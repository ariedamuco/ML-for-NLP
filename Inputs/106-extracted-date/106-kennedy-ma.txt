   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the last few moments, several of our colleagues gave tribute to our friend. He is my friend and is someone so many of us admire here in the Senate. He is someone who has made a difference in this body and this country with his deep commitment to public service. 
   Reference was made this afternoon to Senator ROBB and his service in Vietnam. He fought for our country and served in the Armed Forces. Because of his strong beliefs and commitments to the values of the Nation, he made it his responsibility to respond to the Nation's call. 
   This is a real reflection of the strong commitment and the basic integrity of this extraordinary Senator and friend. He fought in Vietnam for the values he believed in deeply. He came back to this country served as a distinguished Governor of a great State, the State of Virginia. And he continued that service in the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I did want to take a moment, as someone  who has been involved in immigration issues over some 38 years in the Senate, and someone who has worked with colleagues in a bipartisan way. I wanted to let my friend from Michigan know something which I hope he already does know. I wanted to share the great respect I have for him and his leadership on immigration issues, as the chairman of the Subcommittee on Immigration. 
   Immigration issues bring out, really, the best and the worst in our colleagues. These are emotional issues for many of us. We have a Senate and House of Representatives that have strong views on these issues. His hand has been a steady, guiding one of leadership over this period of time, and one I thought showed enormous sensitivity in helping to guide immigration policy in a way that respects the strong tradition of people in this Nation to acknowledge and continually work to remedy the very significant inequities that are still a part of our policy. 
   I also point out what I think all of us in this body remember, his strong leadership in helping us work through the skill shortage in our high-tech industries. He led the Judiciary Committee and the Senate in the development of that program. What certainly impressed me during that period of time was his constant willingness to look at different ideas, different approaches, and differing views, and to always try to reach out to find some common understanding in these areas in order to move the process forward--a real legislator. 
   I know he is proud of many different aspects of his service in the Senate, but I wanted to express from this side of the aisle the affection and friendship of those of us who have worked with him in some very important areas of public policy, and the high regard and respect we have for him. We are hopeful that we'll have a chance to work with him on public policy in the future.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I expect to support the omnibus legislation that will implement the final appropriations agreement for this Congress because it makes the kinds of investments in education, health, and work opportunities that are needed by all American families. In the long run, only through these basic investments can we preserve our capacity to keep our nation strong. I commend my colleagues for their diligence in crafting legislation that respects the highest priorities of the American people. Senator HARKIN and Senator SPECTER have shown the power of bipartisan cooperation throughout their work on this legislation. We have all benefitted from the example and leadership of Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD as well. 
   While this legislation is not perfect and certainly is no substitute for the unfinished work of the 106th Congress, it is good for the American people, and it shows what is possible when we resolve to work together. In this sense, it offers considerable hope for the 107th Congress. 
   EDUCATION 
   In the critical area of education and the nation's schools, this appropriations agreement is a resounding victory for parents and communities across the country. Congress has lived up to its 
   commitment to increase education funding. We are taking a giant step forward to ensure that children across the country receive the support they need to succeed in school and to make college more affordable for every qualified student. I'm proud to highlight a few of the key education accomplishments. 
   For the first time, communities across the country will qualify for over $1.2 billion in federal aid to address their most urgent school building repair needs, such as fixing roofs, plumbing and electrical systems, and meeting fire and safety codes. 
   Schools across the country will receive $1.623 billion, a 25 percent increase over last year, to continue hiring and training new teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades. This year's funding increase will place 8,000 more teachers in classrooms, placing the goal of 100,000 new teachers well within reach. 
   Teacher quality will improve as well this year. Schools will receive $485 million, a 45 percent increase over last year, to help teachers improve their skills through professional development activities, reducing the number of uncertified and out-of-field teachers. 
   Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which helps disadvantaged students master the basics and achieve to high standards, is increased by $506 million, for a total of $8.4 billion. 
   We know that children are most likely to engage in risky behavior in the hours just after school. Congress has responded by increasing support for after-school programs by 87 percent this year, to $851 million. This increase will help more children stay out of trouble after school and get extra help with their schoolwork. 
   The bill also provides an additional $91 million, for a total of $225 million, to support state and local efforts to turn around low-performing schools. 
   Vocational and technical education programs received $1.240 billion, a $48 million increase, to improve programs that give students skills they need in order to meet the demands of the new high tech workforce. 
   College students will also receive much needed support under this bill. The GEAR UP programs will receive $295 million, an increase of $95 million, and TRIO programs will receive $730 million, a $85 million increase, to help more low-income and minority middle and high school students prepare for college and succeed in college. 
   Of all high school students in Boston, 80 percent of them now are tied into colleges. We have 12 different colleges that are tied into the high schools, where they are not just taking the individuals who show promise, which the TRIO Program does and does with extraordinary success, but to try to take the whole class together and move the whole class up. It is a relatively new concept and one which has worked very successfully in the several pilot areas where it has been tried. We are finding extraordinary response, positive response from colleges that engage in this undertaking, and extraordinary response from the schools. I think it will be one of the more important programs to enhance academic achievement for high school students. 
   This legislation will also enable more undergraduate and graduate students to pay for college through part-time work assistance because the Federal Work Study program received a $77 million increase. 
   This bill also strengthens Pell Grants, enabling many more students to take advantage of them. The maximum grant is increasing by $450--from $3,300 to $3,750. Because there are so many young people who, even though they are eligible for the maximum Pell Grant, just couldn't make it with the lower maximum, this is perhaps the most important educational enhancement we have. 
   It recognizes that many children are advantaged in their academic achievement and accomplishment but disadvantaged in the amount of resources they have.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, many of us have worked throughout this Congress to bring greater fairness to our immigration laws. The Legal Immigration Family Equity Act and its amendments are a constructive compromise worked out between members of both parties to address a number of the injustices in current law that have harshly affected many immigrant families. Included in the final legislative package are three provisions that will provide long overdue relief to valued members of our communities and their families. 
   First, the legislation includes the partial restoration of section 245(i) for individuals who are physically present in the U.S. by the date the legislation is enacted into law. Spouses, children, parents and siblings of permanent residents or U.S. citizens will now be able to adjust their status in the U.S. and avoid needless separation from their loved ones. Similarly, persons who benefit from employer-based petitions will also be helped by the restoration of section 245(i). 
   Second, this legislation will benefit many of the ``late amnesty'' class members who have been in legal limbo for close to 15 years. Their spouses and children will be able to remain in the United States until they become eligible for permanent residence. 
   Finally, this legislation provides desperately needed technical corrections that will benefit persons eligible for relief under the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act and the Haitian Refugee Immigrant Fairness Act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Our action today is a significant step in the right direction, but this legislation is far from perfect. Critical pieces are missing. 
   We must continue to work for full parity for Central Americans, Haitians, and Liberians. It is unjust to treat refugees fleeing repression by left-wing dictators better than those fleeing repression by right-wing dictators. Congress must create a fair, uniform set of procedures for all of these refugees. 
   We also must continue to work for relief for permanent residents unfairly affected by the 1996 immigration law. The 1996 law contains some of the harshest provisions that Congress has enacted in many years. Their scope is sweeping. They hurt thousands of immigrants. They have taken immigrants away from their U.S. citizen families, without giving them even an opportunity to have their day in court. Next year, Congress must pass new legislation to correct the harsh provisions of these unfair laws. 
   It is also unfortunate that the legislation does not include far-reaching agreement on agricultural farmworkers. Senator GRAHAM, Congressman BERMAN, and many others worked skillfully to achieve this agreement. They proposed an excellent compromise that would have benefitted both the agricultural workers and the farm owners. 
   These further reforms deserve high priority by the next Congress, and I look forward to working with my colleagues and with the administration of President-elect Bush to enact them into law.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending the Democratic and Republican leaders for reaching this bipartisan agreement to give early, full and fair consideration to the Amtrak bond proposal in the next Congress. 
   The legislation is needed to ensure that Amtrak has the resources to maintain passenger rail service across the country. 
   This funding will undoubtedly strengthen train service in the Northeast Corridor. But this financing package can do much more to provide similar service to communities throughout the country. It will provide the financial stability that Amtrak needs to plan adequately for the future. 
   With the increasing congestion and delays we're seeing at major airports across the country, we need other options for transportation in the 21st century. 
   I look forward to the enactment of this important legislation early in the next Congress, so that passenger rail service will continue to be a key component of our transportation network. 
   Amtrak helps states meet clean air requirements by giving people a viable alternative to driving and flying. It's more energy efficient, which is particularly important for the New England region. 
   For many business commuters and vacationers, it's a more appealing way to travel. And for many workers, it's their chosen profession to which they've devoted years of their lives, and their families depend on it to pay the bills. 
   As a nation, we need a firm commitment to support passenger rail service, just as we do for highways and airports. 
   So again, I commend the leaders for the commitments made today for a financing plan to strengthen passenger rail service in the United States.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, fourteen years ago, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, IRCA. That Act has had undeniably profound effects on the nation--both positive and negative. IRCA set into motion the current legalization program, which has brought millions of individuals out of the shadows of illegal immigrant status and onto a path of temporary status, permanent status and, ultimately, United States citizenship. At the same time, IRCA authorized employer sanctions which, in addition to not deterring illegal immigration, have led to a false document industry and caused discrimination against Latino, Asian, other immigrant workers, and even United States citizens, who by their accent or appearance are wrongly perceived as being here illegally. 
   Many of us supported the provision in IRCA which created an office to address cases of discrimination resulting from employer sanctions. Since then, the Department of Justice Office of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices, OSC, has enforced the anti-discrimination provisions and provided relief to workers who have faced immigration-related job discrimination. 
   One of the innovative accomplishments of OSC has been to develop effective partnerships with state and local government civil rights agencies. A Memoranda of Understanding enables the civil rights agencies who are supposed to work together to do just that. As a result, all agencies are better equipped to prevent and eradicate discrimination. 
   Recently, the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination joined  with the OSC to educate employers, workers and the general public in the state and to work together to address discrimination. The Boston Globe praised the work of the Office of Special Counsel and urged increases in its staff and budget in order for it to keep up with the growing number of newcomers and employers. In the words of the editorial, ``This would help immigrants and the economy--a winning move for the United States.''

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to bring to the attention of the Senate the excellent work that an impressive organization in Costa Rica is doing to address the tragic problem of street children in Central America. The organization, Casa Alianza--a subsidiary of Covenant House in New York--is headquartered in Costa Rica. It was founded in 1981, and provides services for thousands of homeless children, ages six to eighteen, offering shelter, food, medical care, and educational opportunities. 
   The extraordinary work of Casa Alianza was recently honored by the Hilton Foundation, when it received one of the world's most prestigious humanitarian awards, the Conrad N. Hilton Award. 
   At the ceremony in Geneva, Switzerland to present the award, Queen Noor of Jordan praised Casa Alianza. As she stated, ``The phenomenon of street children is global, alarming and escalating. Estimates are that today are 100 million children living on the world's streets. Casa Alianza deserves the Hilton Humanitarian Prize for being the voice and the defender of this helpless and unprotected segment of society and for its important work to stop the human rights abuses inflicted upon them.'' 
   In accepting the award, Bruce Harris, executive director of Casa Alianza, said, ``Street children are often the victims of violence, but what is even more hurtful to them is society's indifference. *.*.* The prize money will feed and shelter many more abandoned children, but the recognition will feed their souls.'' 
   Mr. Harris was recently profiled in the book Speak Truth to Power: Human Rights Defenders Who Are Changing Our World, by my niece, Kerry Kennedy Cuomo. 
   I join in commending Casa Alianza for this well-deserved award and for its pioneering work. These children desperately need help, and Casa Alianza is providing it. At great risk, including facing death threats and armed on its facilities, Casa Alianza and Bruce Harris are acting effectively on behalf of these needy children. They deserve our praise, our thanks, and, most importantly, our support.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most significant bipartisan achievements by Congress and the Clinton Administration is the increase in the Low Income Housing Tax Credit that we should enact this week. However, I am concerned that the Internal Revenue Service is taking a position in audits that may undermine the goal of the credit. 
   Last month, the IRS issued a series of five technical advice memoranda, TAM, on the credit, in response to questions about an audit of a low-income housing developer earlier this year. The memoranda described what may be included in the basis of a property to calculate the amount of the credit that a state can allocate for a development. 
   The memoranda were requested and issued because no regulations currently exist to clearly define the eligible basis for determining the credit. In the absence of regulations, this highly technical advice is all that taxpayers have available, but these specific instructions for a single taxpayer should not necessarily be the final word on the wide variety of developments across the nation. Regulations would be much clearer and would be fully developed by the Treasury Department. 
   A further issue is that the memoranda are inconsistent with current industry practice. The positions taken in the memoranda could lower the eligible basis by over 15 percent, reducing available credits for a project. I am concerned that such a sharp reduction in the credit would mean that many planned developments for affordable housing will no longer be economically feasible, and will force developers to decide against building affordable units. It is also possible that this reduction in available credits for projects could be applied retroactively--nullifying credits that have already been allocated and destroying confidence in this important program that Congress worked so hard to establish. 
   Since States are allocated a fixed number of credits based on population, the memoranda do not save the Treasury any revenues. They simply limit the amount of credits available per project, making individual projects less attractive to developers. The result is fewer affordable housing units at a time when housing prices have soared in many communities across the country. 
   I am also concerned about the lack of opportunity for public comment on this issue. Preparing regulations requires comment, but issuing such memoranda does not. Many constituents--tenants as well as developers--have strong concerns about the credit, and they should have the opportunity to express those concerns adequately. Developers and housing advocates can provide valuable information on the application of these credits, and their views should be taken into consideration. 
   With the growing regional and national economy, housing prices are increasing faster in Massachusetts than any other state. Many studies have shown that we must increase production in new affordable housing units throughout the state to meet the overwhelming demand for affordable housing. We must do all we can to see that the low income housing tax credit is used effectively to meet this pressing need. 
   I urge the Treasury Department to begin the process of developing appropriate regulations on this important issue, including opportunities for detailed public comments.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to urge the Senate to reject the flawed bankruptcy bill. For 3 years, the proponents and opponents of the so-called bankruptcy reform bill have disagreed about the merits of the bill. The credit card industry argues that the bill will eliminate fraud and abuse without denying bankruptcy relief to Americans who truly need it. But scores of bankruptcy scholars, advocates for women and children, labor unions, consumer advocates, and civil rights organizations agree that the current bill is so flawed that it will do far more harm than good. Every Member of the Senate should analyze these arguments closely. We can separate the myths from the facts and determine the winners and the losers. 
   A fair analysis will conclude that this bankruptcy bill is the credit card industry's wish list, a blatant effort to increase their profits at the expense of working families. We know the specific circumstances and market forces that so often push middle-class Americans into bankruptcy. Layoffs are a major part of the problem. In recent years, the rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. Despite low unemployment, a soaring stock market, and large budget surpluses, Wall Street cheers when companies, eager to improve profits by downsizing, lay off workers in large numbers. 
   During the period of January to October in the year 2000, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that there were a total of 11,364 layoffs resulting in more than 1.29 million Americans who were unemployed. In October 2000 alone, there were 874 mass layoffs--a layoff of at least 50 people--and 103,000 workers were affected. 
   Often when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a study of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics recorded that only about a quarter of previously laid-off workers were working at full-time jobs paying as much as or more than they had earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are forced to accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, or jobs with fewer benefits or no benefits at all. 
   I am always reminded that if you were to compare the economic growth in the immediate postwar period, from 1948 up to 1972, and broke the income distribution into fifths in the United States, virtually every group moved up together. All of them moved up at about the same rate. If you looked at the 1970s, and particularly in the 1980s and 1990s, and if you broke the income distribution down into five economic groups, you would see that the group that has enhanced its economic condition immeasurably is the top 20 percent. The lower 20 percent are individuals who have actually fallen further and further behind in terms of their economic income. The next group has fallen still further behind. 
   It is really only when you get to about the top 40 percent of the incomes for American families that you see any kind of increase. It is the group in the lower 60 percent who, by and large, have been affected by these significant layoffs. They have found it difficult to make very important and significant adjustments in their economic condition. They are hard-working men and women who are trying to provide for a family, ready and willing to work, want to work, but they see dramatic changes in terms of their income and they are forced into bankruptcy. 
   We see that many bankrupt debtors are reporting job problems. 
   There are various types of adverse conditions. Many have been fired and some are victims of downsizing. We also find that more women are in the workforce and contributing significantly to the economic stability of the family. If they are victims of a job interruption, it has a significant, important, and dramatic impact on the income of the family. 
   If you look at the principal reasons for bankruptcies, more than 67 percent of debtors talk about employment problems. So these are hard-working Americans who are trying to make ends meet and we find that the economic conditions are of such a nature that they are forced into bankruptcy. Nobody is saying they should not pay or meet their responsibilities. But we also ought to recognize that in many of these circumstances it is not necessarily the individual's personal spending habits that force them into bankruptcy. 
   Another factor in bankruptcy is divorce. Divorce rates have soared over the past 40 years. For better or worse, more couples than ever are separating, and the financial consequences are particularly devastating for women. Divorced women are four times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. In 1999, 540,000 women who headed their own households filed for bankruptcy to try to stabilize their economic lives, and 200,000 of them were also creditors trying to collect child support or alimony. The rest were debtors struggling to make ends meet. This bankruptcy bill is anti-woman, and this Republican Congress should be ashamed of its attempt to put it into law. 
   This chart shows the changes between the men and women in bankruptcy. You see that in 1981 a relatively small percentage of the bankruptcies were by single women. The red reflects the men and women going into bankruptcy. The yellow represents men alone. That was in 1981. In 1991, you see joint bankruptcy is continuing at a relatively slow pace. What you see is the men gradually going up. What happens with women is that it goes up exponentially. Over the period of the last 8 years, it is the women, by and large, who have been going into bankruptcy. 
   Is that to say that these women in 1999 aren't willing to work like the ones in 1991 or 1981, that they are unwilling to pull their fair share? No, Mr. President. There is another explanation. 
   The other explanation is, when we have the tragic circumstances of divorces, more likely than not the women are unable to get the alimony and unable to get the child support, through no fault of their own, and they end up going into bankruptcy. That is a primary reason for the increase in bankruptcies--although the total numbers of bankruptcies now have basically flattened out or have been reduced. 
   We are pointing out that economic conditions are responsible for about half of the bankruptcies. The fact is that downsizing has taken place. In spite of the fact that others who have invested in these companies have made enormous amounts of money, many of those employees have been laid off and have been pushed to the side. 
   These are hard-working men and women. The interesting fact to me is that people filing for bankruptcy are often middle-class people who want to work. These are not Americans trying to get by without playing by the rules. They are working, and they want to work, but there are circumstances that undermine their financial stability. As a result of these circumstances, there is an increase in the number of bankruptcies. It may be because of the inability to get child support or alimony, through no fault of their own.  
   So we have a responsibility to make sure, if we are going to pass legislation, that we are going to be fair to these individuals, rather than to be unduly harsh and penalize them. That is what I believe this current legislation does. It holds 
   them to an unduly harsh standard. That is not only my assessment, it is the assessment of virtually all of the groups --advocates either for children or women or workers or those who fight for basic civil rights. These are organizations and groups that have spent a great deal of time advocating for children or women. They have reached the same conclusion as the 116 bankruptcy professors in law schools all over the country--not located in any particular area--who have examined this bill. 
   In the few moments before we voted yesterday, I asked the other side if they could name one single organization advocating for women and children and working families that supports this legislation and thinks it is fair to them. There isn't a single one. That ought to say something. It is not only those of us who are opposed to it who say it is grossly unfair, it is everyone. When you have a piece of legislation on the floor and there is a division, generally certain organizations support it and certain organizations don't. Not on this one. All the advocacy groups oppose it. Virtually all of them oppose it because they know it is unduly harsh and unfair to children, women, and workers, and unfair to consumers. 
   Mr. President, another major factor in the bankruptcy is the high cost of health care. 43 million Americans have no health insurance, and many millions more are underinsured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 percent of their income on medical care, and older Americans are hit particularly hard. A 1998 CRS report states that even though Medicare provides near-universal health coverage for older Americans, half of this age group spend 14 percent or more of their after-tax income on health costs, including insurance premiums, copayments, and prescription drugs. 
   Does that have a familiar ring to it? We just had a national debate, and the Presidential candidates were asked about prescription drugs. Why? Because of the escalation of the cost of prescription drugs. How does that actually impact and affect families? Well, it is a principal cause of bankruptcy for many families. They just cannot afford to pay for prescription drugs and meet the other kinds of needs they have in terms of paying rent or putting food on the table. They go in a declining spiral and they end up in bankruptcy. 
   These are individuals in families from whom the credit card industry believes it can squeeze another dime. The industry claims they are cheating and abusing the bankruptcy system and are irresponsibly using their charge cards to live in a luxury they can't afford. 
   I think these charts are enormously interesting, and I find them so compelling when you see what is happening and what is driving so many of these families into bankruptcy. 
   The high cost of prescription drugs: the Presidential candidates spoke about it and are talking about the importance of it. Every candidate across this country in this last campaign was saying what they were going to try to do to relieve the cost of prescription drugs. 
   There are millions and millions of senior citizens who can't afford to wait for an answer by Congress. What has happened to them? They go into bankruptcy. Similarly, we see the very tragic growth of the breakups of families and the fact that too many of those involved in those relationships are unwilling to meet their responsibilities to their children or to pay alimony. 
   What has been the result to women? They go into bankruptcy. Or, as we have seen as a result of the developing of our economy and these extraordinary mergers--fortunes are being made, on the one hand, by certain investors, but others who have given their lives to these companies and have received good compensation suddenly are cast aside. They are unable to quickly adjust to their changed economic conditions. What happens to them? They go into bankruptcy. 
   Certainly we need to have bankruptcy legislation. But we also ought to have bankruptcy legislation that is going to be fair and that is going to be just and not punitive. We say that this legislation is punitive. It isn't only myself and many of our colleagues, but it is also those who have spent their lives studying bankruptcy, teaching bankruptcy. Judges on the bankruptcy courts are dealing with it every single day and have virtually uniformly come to the conclusion that this legislation is unfair, unjust, unwise, and doesn't deserve to pass the Senate. 
   This legislation unfairly targets middle-class and poor families. It leaves flagrant abuses in place. 
   Time and time again, President Clinton has told the Republican leadership that the final bill must include two important provisions--a homestead provision without loopholes for the wealthy, and a provision that requires accountability and responsibility for those who unlawfully and often violently bar access to legal health services. The current bill includes neither of those provisions. 
   The conference report includes a half-hearted, loophole filled homestead provision. It will do little to eliminate fraud. 
   That is another failing of this legislation. It creates a loophole for wealthy individuals to effectively hide their income. That kind of loophole will not be available for hard-working Americans who run into the kinds of problems I have outlined. But the homestead provision that is left in this bill still can be abused by hiding millions in assets from creditors. 
   For example, Allen Smith of Delaware, a State with no homestead exemption, and James Villa of Florida, a State with an unlimited homestead exemption, were treated very differently by the bankruptcy system. One man eventually lost his home. The other was able to hide $l.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in Florida. 
   The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity. But that provision was stripped from the conference report. 
   Do we understand? The Senate adopted a provision to deal with the kind of inequity which I have just outlined--listen to this--Allen Smith of Delaware, a State with no homestead exemption, and James Villa of Florida, a State with an unlimited homestead exemption, were treated differently. One man eventually lost his home. The other was able to hide $l.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in Florida. 
   The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity. But that provision was stripped from the conference report. 
   Why? Why was it stripped? Who had the influence? Who authored that amendment? It would be interesting to find out. We don't know because the final conference didn't include members of our party or individuals who are against it. The provision just happened to show up in the conference report. Obviously, it is going to benefit some individuals to the tune of millions of dollars. 
   Surely, a bill designed to end fraud and abuse should include a loophole-free homestead provision. The President thinks so. In an October 12, 2000 letter, White House Chief of Staff, John Podesta says, ``The inclusion of a provision limiting to some degree a wealthy debtor's capacity to shift assets before bankruptcy into a home and in a State with an unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead cap.'' 
   The homestead loophole should be closed permanently. It should not be left open just for the wealthy. Yet this misguided bill's supporters refuse to fight for such a responsible provision with the same intensity they are fighting for the credit card industry's wish list, and fighting against women, against the sick, against laid-off workers, and against other average individuals and families who will have no safety net if this unjust bill passes. 
   This legislation flunks the test of fairness. It is a bill designed to meet the needs of one of the most profitable industries in America--the credit card industry. Credit card companies are vigorously engaged in massive and unseemly nation-wide campaigns to hook unsuspecting citizens on credit card debt. They sent out 2.87 billion--2.87 billion--credit card solicitations in 1999. And, in recent years, the industry has begun to offer new lines of credit  targeted at people with low incomes--even though the industry knows full well that these persons cannot afford to pile up credit card debt. 
   Supporters of the bill argue that the bankruptcy bill isn't a credit card industry bill. They argue that we had votes on credit card legislation, and, that some amendments passed and others did not. But, to deal effectively and comprehensively with the problem of bankruptcy, we have to deal with the problem of debt. We must ensure that the credit card industry doesn't abandon fair lending policies to fatten its bottom line, or ask Congress to become its federal collector for unpaid credit card bills. 
   I have this letter from the American Bankruptcy Service in St. Paul, MN. It references the ``fresh start Visa Card.'' 
   They offer a unique opportunity that could be of great benefit to firms and their clients. By becoming a debtor, they will have the ability to market an unsecured Visa credit card--the fresh start card--to their clients who have filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy, if they have completed the ``341 meeting'' of creditors with no outstanding issues with the trustees, have not yet received a discharge in bankruptcy, or have attached a copy of the bankruptcy notice to their Visa application. 
   They say several law firms, especially those representing consumer debtors in bankruptcy, have requested the ability to distribute the ``fresh start Visa'' application to their clients. For each credit card issued, their firm will receive $10. 
   The credit card industry is marketing to people who are already in bankruptcy. 
   Do we understand that? We heard all of the very pious speeches and statements--what we want is accountability; get those hard-working people and teach them the value of the dollar; teach them a lesson. Well, boy, this is apparently teaching someone a lesson here because they are already going to be eligible, according to the American Bankruptcy Service, to get another Visa card even though they have been in bankruptcy. 
   They are out there trying to tempt them, bring them in one more time, and squeeze out a few extra dollars. Where is the responsibility of the credit card industry in this area? Where is their accountability? Why is this all one way? 
   This bill is tough on women. It is tough on children. It is tough on workers who have had severe medical problems and had to get prescription drugs. It is tough on older workers who haven't gotten their Medicare and do not have health insurance. It is tough on all of them. But it is not very tough at all on the credit card industry that has contributed to the fact that this particular family or individual will be in bankruptcy. 
   Where is the fairness in this? It is not there. 
   Two years ago, the Senate passed good credit card disclosure provisions that added fair balance to the bankruptcy bill. It's disturbing that the provisions in the bill passed by the Senate this year were watered down to pacify the credit card industry. Even worse, some of the provisions passed by the Senate were stripped from the conference report. 
   The hypocrisy of this bill is transparent. We hear a lot of pious Republican talk about the need for responsibility when average families are in financial trouble, but we hear no such talk of responsibility when the wealthy credit card companies and their lobbyists are the focus of attention. 
   The credit card industry and congressional supporters of the bill attempt to argue that the bankruptcy bill will help--not harm--women and children. That argument is laughable. 
   Proponents of the bill say that it ensures that alimony and child support will be the number one priority in bankruptcy. That rhetoric masks the complexity of the bankruptcy system--but it doesn't hide the fact that women and children will be the losers if this bill becomes law. 
   Under the current law, an ex-wife trying to collect support enjoys special protection. But under this pending bill, credit card companies are given a new right to compete with women and children for the husband's limited income after bankruptcy. 
   It is true that this bill moves support payments to the first priority position in the bankruptcy code, but that only matters in the limited number of cases in which the debtor has assets to distribute to a creditor. In most cases, over 95 percent, there are no assets and the list of priorities has no effect. 
   This issue has been debated and debated and debated. It is amazing to me, as we work in the remaining few hours of this session, that we are not considering increasing the minimum wage for workers who have waited a long time to get a $1 increase from $5.15 an hour. No, we are not willing to pass that legislation. We are not willing to come back and pass and give consideration to reauthorizing an elementary and secondary education bill. We are not being asked when we come back to even deal with the Patients' Bill of Rights. No, we are being asked to look out for the credit card industry in a very significant and massive giveaway. It is wrong. This bill does not deserve to pass. I hope it will not. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is fair in a time such as this to ask who the beneficiaries of this legislation are going to be and who is going to lose. 
   As the Senator from Minnesota pointed out, there is not one single organization that advocates for children that supports this legislation. There isn't a single organization that advocates for women that supports this piece of legislation. There is not one organization that represents working men and women that supports this legislation. There is not one group representing consumers that supports this legislation. 
   It fails the basic and fundamental test of fairness. 
   There are over 116 bankruptcy experts from around the country, representing all different views on this, legislation who have basically underscored what I have said. This is written in their letter. They say:  
   We write yet again to bring the same message: 
   The problems with the bankruptcy bill have not been resolved, particularly those provisions that adversely affect women and children.  
   Then it continues on page 2.  
   Granting women and children a first priority for bankruptcy distribution permits them to stand first in line to collect nothing.  
   That is what this is really all about. 
   I hope that at this period in our election process we are not going to be out there trying to shortchange hard-working families, the children and women in our society, and the consumers of this Nation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to reject the motion to invoke cloture on this flawed legislation. For three years, proponents and opponents of this so-called Bankruptcy Reform Act have disagreed about the merits of the bill. The credit card industry argues that the bill will eliminate fraud and abuse without denying bankruptcy relief to Americans who truly need it. 
   But scores of bankruptcy scholars, advocates for women and children, labor unions, consumer advocates, and civil rights organizations believe that the current bill is so flawed that it will do far more harm than good. 
   Every Member of the Senate must analyze these arguments closely and separate the myths from the facts. I believe a fair analysis leads to the conclusion that this bankruptcy bill is the credit industry's wish list to increase its profits at the expense of working families. 
   Proponents of the bankruptcy legislation argue that the current bill is an appropriate response to the bankruptcy crisis. But the facts indicate the opposite. The crisis is overstated, if it exists at all, and is no justification for this sweetheart deal for the credit card industry. 
   For several years, bankruptcy filings were on the rise. But current data reflect a decrease in filings. The so-called bankruptcy crisis has reversed itself--without congressional assistance. According to a report last month, the personal bankruptcy rate dropped by more than 9 percent in 1999, and continued to decline at a greater than 6 percent annual rate in the first nine months of this year. Bankruptcies are now at substantially lower levels than in 1997, 1998, or 1999. There have been 138,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in the current year than during the corresponding period of 1998, a cumulative two-year decline of over 15 percent. 
   This decline in personal bankruptcies is consistent with the view held by leading economists--the bankruptcy crisis is correcting itself. A harsh bankruptcy bill is unnecessary. 
   Supporters of the bill also argue that we need tough new legislation to eliminate fraud and abuse in the bankruptcy system and to instill responsibility in debtors. The argument sounds good, but it masks the truth about this excessively harsh and punitive bill. 
   The current bill is based on biased studies that have been bought and paid for by industry dollars and an industry public relations campaign that unfairly characterizes the plight of honest Americans. Supporters of a bankruptcy overhaul initially relied on a Credit Research Center report in 1997, which estimated that 30 percent of Chapter 7 debtors in the sample could pay at least 21 percent of their debts. But, as the Congressional General Accounting Office responded, ``the methods used in the Center's analysis do not provide a sound basis for generalizing the Center report's findings to the . . . national population of personal bankruptcy filings.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in every area of public policy, we have to make choices and set priorities. 
   How much do we spend on defense? And how much do we spend on domestic priorities? 
   How much do we protect our forests and natural resources? How much do we allocate to health care, education, law enforcement, and other obvious priorities? 
   How heavy should the tax burden be? How much do we need to do to protect Medicare and Social Security for the future generations? 
   Often, we have to make difficult choices. 
   But when it comes to protecting workers from injuries in the modern workplace and increased investments in education, I say there is no choice. It's not one or the other. We must do both. 
   But I'm convinced that our Republican friends want to do neither.  
   They don't want to protect workers from the dangers of the modern workplace. They don't want to protect them from repetitive motion injuries in their offices. Or from eyestrain at their computer screens. 
   But they also don't want to make the targeted investments in education that we need for smaller class sizes, quality teachers, and modern schools. 
   On Sunday night, Republican and Democratic House and Senate appropriators and the White House came to a bipartisan agreement on increasing funding for the nation's schools and communities. 
   On Monday, the Republican leadership rejected that agreement, jeopardizing critical support for the nation's public schools, college students, families, and workers. 
   Once again, the GOP Congress has earned the name the ``Anti-Education Congress.'' 
   Once again, the GOP Congress is putting special interests ahead of education. 
   They failed to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act for the first time in 35 years. Last May, we considered only eight amendments to the bill over six different days, when Senator LOTT suddenly abandoned the debate and moved to other legislation. The bill has never seen the light of day again. 
   By contrast when the bankruptcy bill was debated, our Republican colleagues did everything they could to satisfy the credit card companies. That bill was debated for 16 days, and 55 amendments were considered. 
   Now, while schools and parents wait to see whether Congress will increase its investment in education, Republicans find time to bring up the bankruptcy bill again. 
   Obviously, when the credit card companies want a bill, our Republican friends put everything else aside to get it done. But when it comes to education, the voices of parents and children and schools and communities always go unheard. 
   Every year since they have been in the majority, Republicans have left education funding until the very end. As we've had to do every year since the GOP took over the majority in Congress in 1995, we must be especially vigilant on education funding. Over and over, we've heard the Republican rhetoric of support, but the reality is just the opposite. 
   They say education is a priority. We thought the Republicans might finally put aside their opposition to education. But it's all talk and no action. 
   At the beginning of this Congress, on January 6, 1999, Senator LOTT said, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year ..... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.'' 
   As recently as July 25, Senator LOTT said, ``We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it completed.'' 
   They say they want to invest in education, but their record shows they won't and don't. Year after year, it's the same sad story. 
   In 1995, they tried to abolish the Department of Education and slash $1.7 billion of education funds. 
   In FY96, they proposed to cut discretionary funds for education by $3.9 billion, and to cut for student loans by $14 billion. 
   In FY97, they proposed to cut education by $3.1 billion. In FY98, they tried to cut education by $200 million below the President's request, and in FY99 they tried to cut education by $2.8 billion below the President's request. 
   With the strong leadership of President Clinton, all of these reactionary GOP anti-education schemes were defeated, and federal funding for education steadily increased. 
   Nevertheless, the anti-education Republicans in Congress continue to give education the lowest priority. They say they want to make education a high priority--but their rhetoric never matches the reality. It's four weeks after the fiscal year began, and the Republicans have just 
   rejected a strong bipartisan education funding agreement. And now, for the GOP, the education funding bill is MIA--missing in action. 
   The House Republican majority did break their word when they rejected the bipartisan education funding agreement. They broke their word to the appropriators and the White House who negotiated the agreement. And, they broke their promise to the American people that they would do something for education across the country. 
   I want to be sure that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle understand what was at stake in the agreement. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $1.75 billion to reduce class size. That's an increase of $450 million over last year, to help communities hire an additional qualified teachers to reduce class size in the early grades to 18. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $1 billion for after-school activities--an increase of $547 million over last year. 
   Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. Children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior. 
   Under the successful 21st Century Community Learning program, students are able to have expanded learning opportunities in school facilities, in cooperation with community organizations and other educational and youth development agencies. 
   Massachusetts has greatly benefitted from this successful program. Worcester Public Schools received a $1.2 million federal grant recently to expand after-school opportunities. Boston received $306,000, so that three middle schools in high need areas can create high-quality learning centers that meet the needs of their communities. Chelsea, Holyoke, and Springfield have also received grants under this vital program. We should help more communities increase after-school opportunities for children. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is also rejecting $585 million for teacher quality programs, an increase of $250 million over last year. That means denying millions of teachers access to high quality professional development and mentoring. With training in proven effective teaching practices and the newest technologies, teachers can help all children meet high academic standards and graduate from school prepared for the 21st century workplace. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $6.6 billion for IDEA, an increase of $1.7 billion over last year. That means undermining local efforts to help children with disabilities get a good education. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $250 million for states to help failing schools, an increase of $116 million over last year. That means denying help needed to turn around thousands of low-performing schools. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting a maximum Pell grant of $3,800, an increase of $500 over last year. That means denying many needy college students a much-needed increase in their Pell grants. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting $325 million for GEAR UP, an increase of $125 million over last year. That means denying low-income middle and high school students the extra mentoring and financial assistance they make college a reality for their future. 
   By rejecting the agreement, the Republican leadership is rejecting a new program to provide $1.333 billion for school repair and renovation. That means denying schools the support they need to meet their most urgent repair and renovation needs. 
   Elementary and secondary schools are in urgent need of repair and renovations, so that students can learn and teachers can teach in safe and up-to-date facilities. It's estimated that $112 billion is needed, just to repair existing schools across the nation in poor condition. Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school buildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in almost every community--urban, rural, or suburban. 
   Sending children to learn and teachers to teach in dilapidated, overcrowded facilities sends a message to  these students and their teachers. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can to ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings. 
   Republicans have also rejected the Administration's proposal to provide $25 billion in interest-free bonds to help communities build and modernize 6,000 new schools to alleviate overcrowding and repair crumbling and dilapidated buildings. 
   The President's proposal is the right approach because it maintains Davis-Bacon protections for workers. The Davis-Bacon Act requires contractors to pay construction workers locally prevailing wages, thereby ensuring that federally assisted construction projects are not used to undermine local wages. Paying prevailing wages ensures that taxpayers have quality construction work performed by well trained, highly skilled, efficient workers. It is short-sighted and unacceptable to build new schools for children to improve their learning, and then allow construction workers to be paid sub-standard wages. 
   Republicans opposed to Davis-Bacon continue to repeat the myth that the Davis-Bacon Act increases the cost of school construction. Study after study shows that it does not. Recent studies of prevailing wage laws in Michigan, in Maryland and other Mid-Atlantic states, and in New Mexico and other western states, show that prevailing wage laws do not increase the cost of school construction. 
   Congress has given strong bipartisan support to the Davis-Bacon Act ever since it was first passed in 1931. Paying prevailing wages makes good policy sense. It enhances productivity and quality. It strengthens skills training in the construction industry. It protects the wages and benefits of local construction workers. Even Ronald Reagan promised to support Davis-Bacon. 
   Republican leaders should be ashamed of themselves for denying this urgently needed help for schools, communities, and families across the country. 
   The Republican Congress has put education last too many times, and it should be held accountable in the voting booths on November 7. 
   Voters should also recognize that the Republican candidate for President, Governor Bush, has a track record that is no better on education, and he should be held accountable, too. 
   If Governor Bush's record in Texas is any indication, average Americans--who work day after day to make ends meet--will be an after-thought in a Bush Administration. 
   The Republican Congress says he has the answers on education. He calls his record in Texas an ``education miracle.'' But if you look at the record, it is more of an ``education mirage'' than an ``education miracle.'' 
   Under Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, Texas ranked 45th in the nation in high school completion rates. 71 percent of high school dropouts in Texas are minorities. Hispanic students in Texas drop out at more than twice the rate of white students in the state. 
   So if education is the biggest civil rights issue in America, as Governor Bush claimed in the Presidential debates, he flunked the test in Texas. 
   Last August, the College Board reported that nationally, from 1997 to the year 2000, SAT scores have increased--but in Texas, they have decreased. In 1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national average--and by 2000, the gap had widened to 26 points. 
   Then, last Thursday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The RAND Corporation released an education bombshell that raises serious questions about the validity of even the gains in student achievement in Texas claimed by the Governor. 
   The RAND bombshell was all the more embarrassing, because in August, Governor Bush said, ``Our state ..... has done the best ..... not measured by us but measured by the RAND Corporation, who take an objective look as to how states are doing when it comes to educating children.'' 
   Clearly, at that time, Governor Bush trusted the conclusions made by the RAND Corporation. He was referring to a RAND report that looked at scores in Texas from 1990 to 1996. In fact, Senator HUTCHISON cited those findings on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. 
   But most of the years covered by the earlier RAND report were before Bush became Governor. The new RAND report, released earlier this week, analyzes scores from 1994 to 1998, when George W. Bush was the Governor. 
   The achievement gap in Texas is not closing--it is widening. And what is the Governor's solution? Tests, tests, and more tests. In August, Governor Bush said, ``Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if children are really learning, accountability is a myth, and standards are just slogans.'' 
   We all know that tests are an important indication of student achievement. But the RAND study questions the validity of the Texas state test, because Governor Bush's education program was ``teaching to the test,'' instead of genuinely helping children to learn. 
   If we want a true solution, we should look at the success of states such as North Carolina, which is improving education the right way--investing in schools, improving teacher quality, and expanding after-school programs--all in order to produce better results for students. SAT scores went up in North Carolina by 10 points between 1997 and 2000. 
   The Bush Plan mandates tests and more tests for children--but it does nothing to ensure that schools actually improve and children actually learn. 
   We know that immediate help for low-performing schools is essential. We know that we can turn around failing schools, when the federal government and states and parents and local schools work together as partners to provide the needed investments. 
   In North Carolina, low-performing schools are given technical assistance from special state teams that provide targeted support to turn around low-performing schools. In the 1997-98 school year, 15 North Carolina schools received intensive help from these state assistance teams. In August 1998, the state reported that most of these schools achieved ``exemplary'' growth--and not one of the schools remained in the ``low-performing'' category. Last year, 11 North Carolina schools received similar help. Nine met or exceeded their targets. 
   That's the kind of aid to education that works--not just tests, but realistic action to bring about realistic change for students' education. 
   Instead of taking steps that work, Governor Bush abandons low-performing schools. He proposes a private school voucher plan that drains needed resources from troubled schools and traps low-income children in them. 
   In the Vietnam War, it was said that we had to destroy some villages in order to save them. That's what Governor Bush has in store for failing schools--a Vietnam War strategy that will destroy schools instead of saving them. 
   Parents want smaller class sizes, where teachers can maintain order and give children the one-on-one attention they need to learn. 
   Parents want qualified teachers for their children--a qualified teacher in all of their classes. 
   Parents want schools that are safe and modern learning environments for their children. 
   Parents and students alike want an increase in Pell Grants, to help students afford the college education they need in order to have successful careers in the new economy. 
   The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges. And AL GORE and Democrats in Congress will do just that. They will continue to fight hard and well for the education priorities that parents and local schools are demanding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, OSHA has been attempting to implement an ergonomics standard for the past ten years. But each year, Congress has delayed the standard. And now, even though a bipartisan group of appropriators agreed to a reasonable compromise on this issue late Sunday night, the Republican leadership rejected it--because the business lobbyists demanded it and insisted that millions of workers wait even longer for a safe and healthy workplace. 
   Each year, 1.7 million workers suffer from ergonomic injuries, and nearly 600,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of these injuries suffered on the job. Ergonomic injuries account for over one-third of all serious job-related injuries. 
   These injuries are painful and often crippling. They range from carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe back injuries, to disorders of the muscles and nerves. Carpal tunnel syndrome keeps workers off the job longer than any other workplace injury. This injury alone causes workers to lose an average of more than 25 days, compared to 17 days for fractures and 20 days for amputations. 
   The ergonomics issue is also a women's issue, because women workers are disproportionately affected by these injuries. Women make up 46 percent of the overall workforce--but in 1998 they accounted for 64 percent of repetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of carpal tunnel cases. 
   The good news is that these injuries are preventable. The National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health have both found that obvious adjustments in the workplace can prevent workers from suffering ergonomic injuries and illnesses. 
   Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the nation's worker protection laws keep pace with changes in the workforce. Early in this century, the industrial age created deadly new conditions for large numbers of the nation's workers. When miners were killed or maimed in explosion after explosion, we enacted the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act. As workplace hazards became more subtle, but no less dangerous, we responded by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act to address hazards such as asbestos and cotton dust. 
   Now, as the workplace moves from the industrial to the information age, our laws must evolve again to address the emerging dangers to American workers. Ergonomic injuries are one of the principal hazards of the modern American workplace--and we owe it to the 600,000 workers who suffer serious ergonomic injuries each year to address this problem now. 
   Ergonomic injuries affect the lives of working men and women across the country. They injure nurses who regularly lift and move patients. They injure construction workers who lift heavy objects. They harm assembly-line workers whose tasks consist of constant repetitive motions. They injure data entry workers who type on computer keyboards all day. Even if we are not doing these jobs ourselves, we all know people who do. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, friends and neighbors--and they deserve our help. 
   We need to help workers like Beth Piknick of Hyannis, Massachusetts, who was an intensive care nurse for 21 years, before a preventable back injury required her to have a spinal fusion operation and spend two years in rehabilitation. Although she wants to work, she can no longer do so. In her own words, ``The loss of my ability to take care of patients led to a clinical depression. ..... My ability to take care of patients--the reason I became a nurse--is gone. My injury--and all the losses it has entailed--were preventable.'' 
   We need to help workers like Elly Leary, an auto assembler at the now-closed General Motors Assembly plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. Like many, many of her co-workers, she suffered a series of ergonomic injuries--including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Like others, she tried switching hands to do her job. She tried varying the sequence of her routine. She even bid on other jobs. But nothing helped. Today, years after her injuries, when she wakes up in the morning, her hands are in a claw-like shape. To get them to open, she has to run hot water on them.  
   We need to help workers like Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at General Dynamics in Quincy, Massachusetts in the mid-1980's. He suffered a career-ending back injury when he was told to lift a 75 pound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try to work, he found that on many days, he could not perform the lifting and the use of heavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented him from participating in basic activities. But the loss that hurt the most was having to tell his children that they couldn't sit on his lap for more than a few minutes, because it was too painful. To this day, he cannot sit for long without pain. 
   We need to protect workers like Wendy Scheinfeld of Brighton, Massachusetts, a model employee in the insurance industry. Colleagues say she often put in extra hours at work to ``get the job done.'' She developed carpal tunnel syndrome, using a computer at work. As a result, Wendy lost the use of her hands, and is now permanently unable to do her job, drive a car, play the cello, or shop for groceries. 
   Even though it may be too late to help Beth, Elly, Charley and Wendy, workers just like them deserve an ergonomics standard to protect them from such debilitating injuries. 
   As long ago as 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in the Bush Administration called ergonomic injuries ``one of the nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and health illnesses.'' Since that time, over 2,000 scientific studies have examined the issue, including a comprehensive review by the National Academy of Sciences. All of these studies tell us the same thing--it's long past time to enact an ergonomics standard to protect the health of American workers and prevent these debilitating injuries in the workplace. 
   Last fall, when we considered the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, opponents of an ergonomics standard wanted us to wait for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a further study before OSHA establishes a standard. But it was just another delaying tactic. As we said then, over 2,000 studies on ergonomics have already been carried out. 
   In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed 600 of the most important of those studies. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the studies again. Congress even asked the General Accounting Office to conduct its own study. 
   The National Academy of Sciences found that work clearly causes ergonomic injuries. They concluded that ``the positive relationship between the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of work is clear.'' The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health agreed. They found ``strong evidence of an association between MSDs and certain work-related physical factors.'' 
   The Academy also found that ergonomics programs are effective. As the Academy found, ``Research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rate of musculoskeltal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' The GAO has concluded that good ergonomics practices are good business. Its report declared, ``Officials at all the facilities we visited believed their ergonomics programs yielded benefits, including reductions in workers' compensation costs.'' 
   The truth is that the Labor Department's ergonomics rule is based on sound science. In addition to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, medical and scientific groups have expressed widespread support for moving forward with an ergonomics rule. The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, representing over 7,000 physicians, has stated that ``there is . . . no reason for OSHA to delay the rule-making process while the NAS panel conducts its review.'' The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, representing 16,000 surgeons, the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, representing 13,000 nurses, and the American Public Health Association, representing 50,000 members, all agree that an ergonomics rule is necessary and based on sound science. 
   Many members of the business community support ergonomics protections, because they agree that good ergonomics practices are good business. Currently, businesses spend $15 to 20 billion each year in workers' compensation costs related to these disorders. Ergonomic injuries account for one dollar of every three dollars spent for workers' compensation. If businesses reduce these injuries, they will reap the benefits of lower costs, greater productivity, and less absenteeism. 
   That's certainly true for Tom Albin of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, who said, ``Our experience has shown that incorporating good ergonomics into our manufacturing and administrative processes can be effective in reducing the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, which not only benefits our employees, but also makes good business sense.'' 
   Similarly, Peter Meyer of Sequins International Quality Braid has said, ``We have reduced our compensation claims for carpal tunnel syndrome through an effective ergonomics program. Our productivity has increased dramatically, and our absenteeism has decreased drastically.'' 
   This ergonomics rule is necessary, because only one-third of employers currently have effective ergonomics programs. Further delay is unacceptable, because it leaves too many workers unprotected and open to career-ending injuries. Ten years is long enough. Since OSHA began working on this standard in 1990, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered serious injuries from workplace ergonomic hazards. 
   It is time to end these injuries--and end all the misinformation too. The current attack on OSHA's ergonomics standard is just the latest in a long series of mindless attacks by business against needed worker protections for worker's health and safety. Whose side is this Congress on? American employees deserve greater protection, not further delay. It's time to stop breaking the promise made to workers, and start supporting this long overdue ergonomics standard now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, Sid Yates, who first came to Congress in 1948 and who served with great distinction until his retirement at the end of the last Congress. All of us who knew and loved Sid were saddened by his recent death. He was a soft-spoken leader who demonstrated time and again his unequivocal commitment to his constituents in Chicago and his unwavering respect for the nation's best principles. He was a public servant in the truest and most noble sense, and he was a powerful inspiration to all of us who were fortunate enough to work with him. 
   During his years as Chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, Sid skillfully advanced legislation to sustain and protect our national parks and historic sites. He was a brilliant legislator who has done more to preserve our national historic and cultural legacy than any other member of Congress. 
   Sid was also well known as Congress's leading advocate for the National endowments for the Arts and Humanities. He was a strong and courageous defender of these important agencies. Especially during times of controversy over the agencies, he spoke effectively and persuasively to preserve their vital programs. because of Sid Yates, art and music and dance and theater are now more accessible to families across the nation through their schools and in their cultural institutions. It's an outstanding legacy, and I know I join my colleagues in Congress in a commitment to honor Sid Yates' memory with a renewed effort to support the endowments. 
   Sid Yates will long be remembered as a man who brought graciousness, integrity and civility to public service. He is a patriot who is deeply missed here in Congress as well as in his beloved Chicago. I commend all that he accomplished, and all of us are grateful for his five decades of selfless and principled public service. He will be remembered fondly for many years to come.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Nevada. I commend my friend and colleague, the Senator from Illinois, in raising these issues. I commend him because he has presented the facts to the Senate. 
   We never had an opportunity to vote on the 1996 Immigration Act. To represent that we did is not stating clearly the facts. That was wrapped into a conference report on an entirely different appropriation, which was a take-it-or-leave-it, after the legislation passed, I believe, 97-3, with strong bipartisan support, and it was after days of hearing in the Senate that the Republicans took that and added these provisions, some provisions which the Senator has mentioned. 
   This figure of 4 million is a traditional way of distorting and misrepresenting a position, and then disagreeing with it. That is poppycock. It is red herring. The Senator from Utah ought to know better than that because that is completely inaccurate. 
   I can understand the frustration that many feel about this issue, and I commend the President for attempting to try and deal with it. 
   When we had this Latino Fairness Act, two prominent Republicans, the Senator from Florida and the chairman of the immigration committee, made statements in favor of the position outlined by the Senator from Illinois. They were prepared. They understood that there may have been differences here, but they spoke to it. 
   The President is in a commendable position. I thank him for his leadership in this. I again thank the Senator from Illinois for bringing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I am very hopeful that we will stay the course on this until we get some action on this, another proposal that has a moratorium on the deportation of individuals, which has been passed through the House on the suspension calendar which addresses one of the regrettable aspects of the 1996 act. That has the bipartisan support of Chairman HYDE of the Judiciary Committee, and LAMAR SMITH from the immigration committee, which virtually passed unanimously in the House. I am hopeful we will pass that, as well. 
   Halloween is here. I am watching the clock that is over the Senate right now. It has not been corrected. I don't know whether the goblins are out here, as well, but Halloween is here. While the Nation observes this occasion only once a year, for this Republican Congress, every day is Halloween. This is the Halloween Congress: lavishing treats on the wealthy and cruel tricks on average families. 
   If he is elected, Governor Bush will borrow the idea and have a year-round Halloween White House in which powerful special interests hold sway and working families are left out and left behind. He said no to working families in Texas and he wants to say no to average Americans for 4 more years this time from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. He wants to say no to Social Security, no to Medicare, no to a fair prescription drug benefit for senior citizens, no to the Patients' Bill of Rights, no to improving the public schools, no to health care for uninsured children, no to fair tax cuts for average families, no to fighting hate crimes, no to fairness for lawful immigrants, no to gun safety laws. 
   There is no clearer example of how our Republican friends have kowtowed to powerful special interests than the tax bill before the Senate. Rather than meet the urgent priorities of the American people, Republicans have spent the past 2 weeks huddled behind closed doors to produce a quarter-trillion-dollar tax package tilted overwhelmingly toward the powerful and not toward the average families. 
   In fact, the top 5 percent of taxpayers will receive a greater share of the tax breaks under this Republican tax scheme than the 
   bottom 80 percent of all taxpayers combined. There is little to distinguish this plan from the previous discredited proposals by the Republican leadership in Congress and by George W. Bush. In many ways the items in this package are even more cynical. 
   The Republicans know that millions of Americans are deeply concerned  about the lack of health insurance for low- and middle-income families. So this bill lowers the cost of health insurance for wealthier people who are already insured. Madam President, 95 percent of the people who will benefit under this bill in terms of the health insurance benefits are individuals who are already insured, not any expansion for those who have no health insurance today. 
   Republicans know that millions of Americans are concerned about saving enough for retirement, so this bill fattens the pension opportunities available to the highest level corporate executives. Republicans know that millions of children and working families are having trouble feeding their families even in this time of prosperity. So this bill increases the tax breaks that corporations can claim for three-martini lunches, dinners, and other entertainment. 
   Republicans know that millions of families struggle to care for elderly or disabled family members at home, so their tax bill lowers the cost of luxury nursing facilities for wealthy families. 
   Millions of low-wage workers are depending on Congress to raise the minimum wage this year before we adjourn. But Republicans seem to care so little about the minimum wage that they have repealed it for 6 months of next year in their tax bill. 
   It was, apparently, an inadvertent mistake, or perhaps a Freudian slip. But if they had worked with Democrats and shown us the provision, we could have prevented such an embarrassing mistake. An increase in the minimum wage may be an afterthought for the Republican leadership, but it means food on the table and clothes for the children for the 12 million workers who benefit. To eliminate the minimum wage, even for 6 months, would be a disaster for these families. 
   Here we are in the final hours of this Congress and still we have been denied the opportunity to even vote whether this body thinks we should vote for a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage today--which is now $5.15 an hour--and 50 cents next year, at the time we have the greatest economic expansion in the history of this country. 
   On the other hand, under Republican leadership the Congress raised its salary by $4,800 last year and again by $3,600 this year. Congress made sure nothing got in the way. Congressional pay was not eliminated for 6 months. Congress did not say Congressional salaries would be increased only if accompanied by $100 billion in tax breaks. Isn't that interesting? Our Republican leaders have told us yes, you can have raises, rather than the people who are going to be affected by an increase in the minimum wage if we have $73 billion in tax breaks. We did not have that kind of requirement when we increased our own benefits, but evidently for the hardest working families, many of those who have two or three jobs to try to make ends meet, that is the block that is put in front of them. 
   Madam President, 535 Senators and Representatives received a raise without a hitch. The 12 million Americans who would receive a raise in the minimum wage deserve the same. It is a children's issue, a families issue, a civil rights issue. 
   I hope this Republican Congress will act to pass the minimum wage before adjourning this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. In a number of communities we have living wage regions, in many of the major cities of this country, which have been successful. But there are those, including Governor Bush, whose position is to say the States ought to be able to opt out on the minimum wage. When you realize the minimum wage in the State of Texas is $3.35 an hour, when we have seen the prosperity which is across this country, that raises serious questions about the real interest in any working families. 
   I want to take the time remaining to talk about two public policy areas, first on education and then on health care. If Governor Bush's record in Texas is any indication, average Americans, who work day after day to make ends meet, will be an afterthought in a Bush administration. 
   The Republican Congress says he has the answers to education. He calls his record in Texas an education miracle. But if you look at the record, it is more of an education mirage than an education miracle. Under Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for Education Statistics, Texas ranks 45th in the Nation in high school completion rates; 71 percent of high school dropouts in Texas are minorities; Hispanic students in Texas drop out at more than twice the rate of white students in the State. So if education is the biggest civil rights issue in America, as Governor Bush proclaimed at the Presidential debates, he flunked the test in Texas. 
   Last August, the College Boards reported that nationally, from 
   1997 to the year 2000, SAT scores have increased. But in Texas, they have decreased. In 1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national average. By 2000, the gap had grown by 26 points. 
   Then, last Thursday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The Rand Corporation released an education bombshell that raises serious questions about the validity of gains in student achievements in Texas claimed by the Governor. The Rand bombshell was all the more embarrassing because in August Governor Bush said:  
   Our State has done the best, not measured by us, but measured by the Rand Corporation who take an objective look at how States are doing when it comes to education.  
   Those are the Governor's words. Clearly, at that time Governor Bush trusted the conclusions made by the Rand Corporation because he was referring to a Rand report that looks at scores in Texas from 1990 to 1996. In fact, Senator HUTCHISON cited those findings on the floor of the Senate on Thursday. 
   But most of the years covered by the earlier Rand report were before Bush became Governor. The new Rand report released earlier this week analyzes the scores from 1994 to 1998, when George W. Bush was the Governor. The achievement gap in Texas is not closing, it is widening. What is the Governor's solution? Test, test, tests and more tests. 
   In August, Governor Bush said:  
   Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if children are really learning, accountability is a myth and standards are just slogans.  
   We all know tests are an important indication of student achievement, but the Rand study questions the validity of the Texas State test because Governor Bush's education program was teaching to the test instead of genuinely helping children to learn. 
   These are the results. We find out the objective standards, whether we take it from the Rand Corporation or the National Center for Education Statistics. When it was favorable to Texas, it was quoted ad infinitum by strong supporters of the Governor. But, those successes applied to the education policies that were developed prior to the time the Governor became Governor. 
   If we want a true solution to improving education, we should look at the success of States such as North Carolina, which is improving education the right way: Investing in schools, improving teacher quality, expanding afterschool programs--all in order to produce better results for students. The Bush plan mandates more tests for children, but it does nothing to ensure that schools actually improve and children actually learn. 
   We know immediate help for low-performing schools is essential. We know we can turn around failing schools when the Federal Government, States, parents, and local schools work together as partners to provide the needed investments. 
   In North Carolina, low-performing schools are given technical assistance from special State teams who provide targeted support to turn around low-performing schools. In the 1997-1998 school year, 15 North Carolina schools received intensive help from these State-assisted teams. In August 1998, the State reported most of these schools achieved exemplary growth and not one school remained in the low-performing category. Last year, 11 North Carolina schools received similar help; 9 met or exceeded their targets.  
   That is the kind of aid to education that works--not just tests, but realistic action to bring about realistic change for students' education. And, correspondingly, the test scores for the students in North Carolina have risen 10 points above the national average during this period. 
   The Democratic proposal to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act incorporate the proven approaches that have demonstrated better results for children. But the Republican leadership has blocked any opportunity to debate education. The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, for the first time in 35 years, will not be acted on by Congress. 
   The Vice President, Al Gore, supports programs to improve public schools which have been proven effective. The best example we have is North Carolina. Those programs are tried and tested and demonstrated to be successful. That is what we believe ought to be done in the future for public education in this country. 
   Yet those programs that have been tried and tested in the State of Texas are not improving education for children. Education is a prime issue for families, and we ought to look at the results. When you look at them carefully, you have to realize that what has been outlined as an educational miracle by the Governor just does not measure up--it's just an education mirage. 
   Instead of taking steps that will work, Governor Bush abandons the low-performing schools. He proposes a private school voucher plan that drains needed resources from troubled schools and traps low-income children in them. In the Vietnam war, it was said we had to destroy some villages in order to save them. That is what Governor Bush has in store for failing schools: a Vietnam war strategy that will destroy them instead of save them. 
   Parents want smaller class sizes where teachers can maintain order and give one-to-one attention students need to learn. Parents want a qualified teacher in every classroom in America. Parents want modern schools that are safe learning environments for their children. GAO found that $112 billion was necessary for our schools to meet health and safety standards and environmental standards, to make critical repairs, and to ensure they are wired for modern technologies. That is why we want strong support for our school modernization and construction program that the Republican leadership has consistently opposed. 
   Here we are 4 weeks into the next fiscal year. Republicans have said that education is their top priority, but instead, they have made education their last priority. 
   Parents and students alike want an increase in Pell grants to help young people afford the college education they need to compete in the new economy. 
   The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges, and Al Gore and the Democrats in Congress will do just that. We will continue to fight hard for education priorities that parents and local schools are demanding. 
   There is much good news about education across the nation. More students are taking the SATs so they can gain entrance into college. We see these numbers going up every year. 
   More and more students are taking advanced math and science classes in precalculus, calculus, and physics. We know there are schools in some parts of the country where the children cannot even read and write an essay. We ought to be doing something about it. The Republicans condemn those schools, but they have no plan to improve them. 
   Finally, the SAT math scores are the highest in 30 years. The SATs are taken by young people who want to go on to college. Those who are taking math now--many of the children who are taking the advanced courses are going to do better. That is what we want, isn't it? We want all these indicators to go in the right direction--better results for children. 
   As we come into these final weeks, parents ought to look at the Members of Congress, the Members of the Senate, and the Presidential candidates and where they stand on education. Democrats and Al Gore stand for an investment in children that will produce better results: smaller class sizes, a qualified teacher in every classroom in America in 4 years, a strong downpayment on meeting the nation's school modernization and construction needs, more afterschool programs to keep children safe and out of trouble and give them extra time for learning, too. 
   We should support these policies to improve public schools, and we should oppose policies by the Republican leadership and Governor Bush to abandond public schools. The nation's children deserve no less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, few issues are of greater concern to American families than quality, affordable health care. Americans want an end to HMO abuses. They want good health insurance coverage. They want a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens under Medicare. They want to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so that Medicare will be there for both today's senior citizens and tomorrow's senior citizens. And they want these priorities not only for themselves and their loved ones but for every American, because they know that good health care should be a basic right for all. 
   The choice in this election is clear on health care--and it is not just a choice between different programs. It is also a choice based on who can be trusted to do the right thing for the American people. Al Gore's record and his proposals are clear. He has been deeply involved in health care throughout his career. The current administration has made significant progress in improving health care in a variety of ways--from expanding health insurance for children to protecting Medicare for seniors. He has consistently stood for patients and against powerful special interests. 
   Al Gore has laid out a constructive program that is consistent with his solid record. He is for expanding insurance coverage to all Americans, starting with children and their parents. He is for a strong Patients' Bill of Rights to end abuses by HMOs. He has a sensible plan for adding prescription drug coverage to Medicare. He will fight to preserve Medicare, without unacceptable changes designed to undermine Medicare and force senior citizens into HMOs and private insurance plans. 
   George W. Bush's approach is very different. His proposals are deeply flawed. But even worse than the specifics of his proposals is his failure to come clean with the American people about his record in Texas or about his own proposals. 
   On health care, George Bush doesn't just have a credibility gap. He has a credibility chasm. 
   He has consistently stood with the powerful against the people. He refuses to take on the drug companies--or the insurance companies--or the HMOs. His budget plan puts tax cuts for the wealthy ahead of every other priority, and leaves no room for needed investments in American families. On health care, his values are not the values of the American people. 
   On the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, George Bush said in the third debate that he supports a national Patients' Bill of Rights. He said he wanted all people covered. He said that he was in favor of a patient's right to sue, as provided under Texas law. He said he brought Republicans and Democrats together in the State of Texas to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   That's what he said, but it is not true. Governor Bush knows his record on health care can't stand the light of day. 
   So on national TV, he patently deceived the American people about his record, hoping no one would notice, or else hoping people would give him a pass because he didn't know any better and simply spouted what his spin doctors had given him. 
   But the truth has a way of coming to the surface. Here is what he did on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   He vetoed the first Patients' Bill of Rights passed in Texas. He fought to make the second bill as narrow and limited as possible. He was so opposed to the provision allowing patients to sue their HMOs that he refused to sign the final bill, allowing it to become law without his signature. That is not a record that recommends him for national office to any citizen concerned about a strong, effective Patients' Bill  of Rights. It is the record of a candidate who stands with powerful insurance companies and HMOs, not with American families, and he isn't honest about his record. 
   On Thursday, Senator HUTCHISON stated that the only reason Governor Bush vetoed the first bill and let the right to sue under the second bill become law without his signature was because there was disagreement on how high the caps on pain and suffering would be. I regret that my colleague has been misled. The fact is that there was no provision for lawsuits in the first Patients' Bill of Rights bill vetoed by the Governor. Let me reiterate--there was no provision for lawsuits at all in the first bill. Yet the Governor vetoed it. 
   In the second bill, there was also no issue about the caps on pain and suffering. Texas already had caps on pain and suffering under its general tort law, and everyone assumed that those caps would apply to lawsuits against HMOs. There was never any discussion of this issue. The fact is that Governor Bush, despite what he says today, simply does not believe that health plans should be held accountable. That is why he refused to sign the law allowing suits against HMOs. Once again, he has distorted his record in Texas--and both the record and the distortions call into serious question where he would stand as President. 
   Governor Bush is quick to challenge the integrity of others. But on this issue, his integrity is on the line as well. ``Distort, dissemble, and deny'' on an issue as important as this is not a qualification for the next President of the United States. 
   On health insurance, the record is equally clear--and equally bleak. Governor Bush claims he wants insurance for all Americans. He blames Vice President GORE for the growth in the number of the uninsured. But Governor Bush's record in Texas is one of the worst in the country. Texas has the second highest proportion of uninsured Americans in the country. It has the second highest proportion of uninsured children in the country. Yet, Governor Bush has not only done nothing to address this problem, he has actually fought against solutions. In Texas, he placed a higher priority on large new tax breaks for the oil industry, instead of good health care for children and their families. 
   When Congress passed the Child Health Insurance Program in 1997, we put affordable health insurance for children within reach of every moderate- and low-income working family in America. Yet George Bush's Texas was one of the last States in the country to fully implement the law. Despite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, Governor Bush actually fought to keep eligibility as narrow as possible.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to address the concerns of my friend, the Senator from Texas, in her comments earlier. I want to make very clear I have no complaint against the State of Texas. It has an outstanding history and has produced some great leaders, including Sam Houston, Sam Rayburn, President Johnson. My complaint is not against Texas at all, it is against the clear misstatements of Governor Bush about his Texas record. The facts are there. I am not attacking the State of Texas. I am sure many citizens of Texas share my concerns about the United States. 
   It is proper and necessary to talk about these issues. They are important. They are important in the national Presidential debate because they aren't being addressed by this Congress. The Republican leadership has blocked responsible action on education. For the first time in 35 years, Congress has failed to reauthorize ESEA. We are now 4 weeks late in passing an education funding bill. Since the majority has stifled any debate on education in this Congress, it is appropriate and necessary to speak on the Senate floor about how education will be treated in the next Congress under the next administration. The American people deserve a Congress that will act on education, not ignore it. 
   When we think about what will happen to education next year, we must look at the Presidential candidates and how they will address education. It is essential to look at the record of Governor Bush, the Republican candidate for President. That is what I have done. 
   On the children's health issue, when the Congress passed the CHIP program in 1997, we put affordable health insurance for children within reach of every moderate- and low-income working family in America. Yet George W. Bush's Texas was one of the last States in the country to fully implement the  law. Despite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, Governor Bush fought to keep eligibility as narrow as possible. 
   In fact, the Bush campaign's defense of this unacceptable record is almost as telling as the record itself. According to the New York Times, the Bush campaign acknowledged that Governor Bush fought to keep eligibility narrow, but that he did so because he was concerned about costs and the spillover effect on Medicaid. This so-called spillover effect is the increase in enrollment of children in Medicaid that occurs when the Children's Health Insurance Program is put into effect. Vigorous outreach efforts are made by state governments to identify children who qualify for the new program--but the same outreach identifies many other children who should have already been enrolled in Medicaid. 
   In other words, Governor Bush not only opposed expanding eligibility for the new CHIP program--he was also worried that the very poorest children--those already eligible for Medicaid--might actually receive the coverage to which the were clearly entitled. That is not just what I am saying. That is also the conclusion of the New York Times when it reviewed the facts. It's no wonder that Governor Bush's Texas Administration was cited by a federal judge for its failure to live up to a consent order to let families of poor children know about their eligibility for Medicaid and about the health services to which they were entitled. 
   An article in Time magazine says it all. It is titled, ``Tax Cuts Before Tots. Candidate Bush is pushing his compassion, but poor kids in Texas have not seen much of it.'' And under a box entitled ``Lost Opportunity? Bush and Poor Kids,'' the article makes four key points:  
   [Bush] helped to secure tax cuts by underfunding Medicaid, causing a $400 million shortfall in the program. He delayed the state law to expand Medicaid coverage for 303,000 new kids. They went five years without health insurance. He fought efforts to require automatic coverage for families forced off welfare rolls.  
   Now, my Senate colleagues from Texas offered all sorts of explanations for Governor Bush's miserable record on health care for children. They said that the court case I referred to was begun before Governor Bush took office. That is true. But the consent decree settling the case was agreed to by Governor Bush's administration in February of 1996. And the latest action by the federal judge was based on the Bush's administration failure to live up to the consent decree that it had agreed to. The Bush administration did not keep its word. Children were not its priority. 
   Defenders of the Governor say that Texas could not implement the CHIP program promptly because its legislature only meets every two years. But other states have legislatures that meet only two years, and they were able to get their programs going more promptly. In fact, Texas was the next to last state in the entire country to approve a Chip plan--the next to last state. 
   Governor Bush's misstatements on his Texas record do not end with uninsured children. In the debates, Vice President GORE pressed Governor Bush on the Texas record on the uninsured. Governor Bush said that Texas was spending $4.7 billion a year for uninsured people. But it turns out that actually only one-quarter of that amount was being spent by the State of Texas. The vast majority of the spending was by hospitals and doctors for charity care, and by county governments, not by the state. 
   On the Texas record on the uninsured, Governor Bush claimed that the percentage of the uninsured in Texas had gone down, while the percentage of the uninsured in America had gone up. In 1998, the overall percentage of the uninsured dropped by identical amounts both nationally and in Texas--4.9 percent in Texas and 4.9 percent nationally. But, because of Governor Bush's inaction on children, the percentage of children in Texas who were uninsured dropped only half as much as the drop nationally--10 percent nationally and only 5.2 percent in Texas. When Governor Bush took office, Texas ranked second from the bottom of all 50 States in covering children and citizens of all ages. Today, after six years under his watch as Governor, Texas still ranks second from the bottom. 
   There is still time for the truth to be told. I am hopefully that every American will examine the records of the two candidates carefully. On health care, there should be no question at all as to which candidate stands with the powerful special interests and which candidate stands with the American people. The choice is clear. Governor Bush stands with the powerful, and AL GORE stands with the people. 
   I reserve the remember of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there are two additional important issues that I would like to discuss tonight. There are few clearer examples of this Republican Congress siding with powerful special interests against average people than the pending bankruptcy bill. 
   The bankruptcy conference report targets working men and women who comprise the vast number of Americans in bankruptcy. Two out of every three bankruptcy filers are workers who have lost their jobs because of layoffs or downsizing. One out of every five has huge debts because of health care expenses. Divorced or separated people are three times more likely than married couples to file for bankruptcy. 
   Working men and women in economic free fall often have no choice except bankruptcy. Yet, under pressure from the credit card industry, this Republican Congress is bent on denying all these innocent victims of financial hardship the safety net that the bankruptcy laws have provided for a century. 
   This legislation unfairly targets middle class and poor families, and it leaves flagrant abuses in place. 
   Time and time again, President Clinton has told the Republican leadership that the final bankruptcy bill must include two important additions--a homestead provision without loopholes for the wealthy, and a provision that requires accountability and responsibility from those who unlawfully--and often violently--bar access to legal health services for women. The current bill includes neither of these provisions. 
   The bill does include a half-hearted, loop-hole filled homestead provision. It will do virtually nothing to eliminate fraud. With a little planning--or in some cases, no planning at all--wealthy debtors will still be able to hide millions of dollars in assets from their creditors. For example, Allen Smith of Delaware--a state with no homestead exemption--and James Villa of Florida--a state with an unlimited homestead exemption--are treated differently by the bankruptcy system today. One man eventually lost his home. The other was able to hide $1.4 million from his creditors by purchasing a luxury mansion in Florida. 
   The Senate passed a worthwhile amendment to eliminate this inequity--but that provision was stripped from the conference report. Surely, a bill designed to end bankruptcy fraud and abuse should include a loop-hole-free homestead provision. The President thinks so. As an October 12 letter from White House Chief of Staff John Podesta says:  
   The inclusion of a provision limiting to some degree a wealthy debtor's capacity to shift assets before bankruptcy into a home in a state with an unlimited homestead exemption does not ameliorate the glaring omission of a real homestead cap.  
   Yet there is no outcry from our Republican colleagues about the injustice, fraud, and abuse in these cases. In fact, Governor Bush led the fight in Texas to see that rich cheats trying to escape their creditors can hide their assets under Texas' unlimited homestead law. 
   In 1999, the Texas legislature adopted a measure to opt-out of any homestead restrictions passed by Congress. The legislature also expanded the urban homestead protection to 10 acres. It allowed the homestead to be rented out and still qualify as a homestead. It even said that a homestead could be a place of business. This provision gives the phrase ``home, sweet home'' new meaning. 
   The homestead loop-hole should be closed permanently. It should not be left open just for the wealthy. I wish this misguided bill's supporters would fight for that provision with the same intensity they are fighting for the credit card industry's wish list, and fighting against women, against the sick, against laid-off workers, and against other average individuals and families who will have no safety net if this unjust bill passes. 
   The hypocrisy of this bill is obvious. We hear a lot of pious Republican talk about the need for responsibility when average families are in financial trouble--but we hear no such talk of responsibility when the wealthy and their lobbyists are the focus of attention. 
   The facts are clear. The bankruptcy bill before us is designed to increase the profits of the credit card industry at the expense of working families. If it becomes law, its effective will be devastating. It eminently deserves the veto it will receive if it ever reaches the White House.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, another issue in which this Republican Congress is ignoring working families is immigration. 
   Action on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is long overdue. The issues in this legislation are not new to Congress. The immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has waited far too long for the fundamental fairness this legislation will provide. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act keeps families together. It rewards immigrants who work hard and pay taxes, and it makes our immigration policies simpler and fairer. 
   Our proposal is based on the fundamental principle that immigrants in similar situations should be treated equally. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for all Central Americans, and for Haitians and Liberians. In 1997, Congress enacted legislation granting permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive governments. But Congress did not grant the same protection to other Central Americans and Haitians. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will eliminate these disparities and create fair, uniform procedures for all of these immigrants. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also change the registry cut-off date, so that long-time immigrants who have been residing in this country since before 1986 will qualify to remain in the United States permanently, and it will restore a provision to the immigration laws that was unfairly allowed to expire in 1997. 
   These proposals are pro-family, pro-business, fiscally prudent, and a matter of common sense. But that hasn't stopped the Republican leadership from opposing them and offering a blatantly inadequate substitute that pays lip service to fairness for Latinos and immigrants in our communities but denies them real help. 
   Under even the most generous interpretation, the Republican proposal ignores the vast majority of immigrants and families. It will perpetuate the current patchwork of contradictory and discriminatory provisions enacted by the Republican Congress in recent years. 
   Republicans propose two things. First, a new temporary ``V'' visa would be created that allows certain spouses and minor children of lawful permanent residents to enter or stay in the U.S. and be granted work authorization while waiting for their green card. To qualify for the visa, applicants must have had applications for entry pending for over three years. 
   On the surface, this may sound like a good idea. But it unfairly picks and chooses among family members, granting relief to some, but not to others. The GOP proposal perpetuates the piecemeal and discriminatory immigration policies we are seeking to end. 
   Second, the Republican plan would provide an opportunity for individuals to apply for green cards--but only if they were part of two particular class action lawsuits against the INS for improper handling of the 1986 amnesty program. This selective proposal is grossly inadequate. It provides relief only for individuals who sought counsel from a specific lawyer and joined a specific lawsuit, even though countless  other individuals affected by the INS ruling are left out. Also, of those people who are actually covered by this plan, less than 40 percent are expected to prevail. 
   Republicans acknowledge that the 1986 law was implemented unfairly. It is wrong and inconsistent to deny a remedy to all who were affected. It is wrong to help only those who were able to hire the right attorney, and who filled out the right forms. All eligible individuals should receive relief. 
   Governor Bush praises his trillion dollar tax break for the wealthy, and criticizes Democrats for supporting targeted tax relief that helps some individuals, but not others. It's obvious that Republicans don't care about uniformity when the issue is immigration. It's unfair and unjust to pick and choose among immigrants who will receive this well-deserved and long-overdue relief. 
   We have welcomed these individuals to the United States. They are part of our communities. We have come to know them as neighbors, friends, and colleagues. We should support those who have come here in their search for freedom, equality, and a better life. These are the same dreams our ancestors came here to find in the past. 
   It is essential to pass the real Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and treat immigrants fairly. Hard-working immigrant families deserve this long-overdue relief, and they deserve it now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 will bring far-reaching benefits to the health of millions of Americans. I commend my colleagues, Senator JIM JEFFORDS and Senator BILL FRIST, for their leadership in bringing this important measure to the Senate floor today. The leadership of our colleagues in the House was also essential in developing this groundbreaking bill, and I thank Representatives TOM BLILEY, JOHN DINGELL, MICHAEL BILIRAKIS, and SHERROD BROWN for their dedication and skillful work in bringing this legislation forward. 
   The Act will help the nation meet many of the health challenges we face at the beginning of the 21st century. Few of these are more grave than the ominous threat of attack with a biological weapon. Like the lethal mushroom cloud of a nuclear bomb, a haze of anthrax spores released by a terrorist over one of our major cities could bring death and disease to millions of Americans. Chilling revelations from the former Soviet Union and other nations have revealed extensive and sophisticated programs to use deadly microbes as weapons of mass destruction. Just this week, we heard alarming news from Uganda about the deadly outbreak of Ebola fever. Yet viruses like Ebola were a subject of research in bioweapons programs whose aim was to make these viruses even deadlier and more contagious. 
   Senator FRIST and I have held numerous hearings in the Public Health Subcommittee on these public health threats. Witness after witness testified that the best way to defend the nation against these deadly biological weapons threats is to strengthen the ability of public health agencies to respond at the local, state and national levels. Given the importance of these agencies in safeguarding the health of the nation, we were appalled to hear that many public health agencies are underfunded, ill-equipped and poorly prepared to respond to these modern disease threats. In this electronic era, when we can send an e-mail message from Cape Town to Cape Cod in the blink of an eye, our nation's public health agencies often lack equipment as basic as a fax machine. At a time when scientists have deciphered the entire DNA sequence of the human genetic code, many of the nation's public health laboratories cannot conduct simple genetic tests to identify deadly microbes rapidly and accurately. Yet, in a disease emergency, swift action can keep a local outbreak from becoming a national epidemic. A few lost hours can mean thousands more lost lives. 
   To counter the threat of infectious disease outbreaks--whether naturally occurring or resulting from bioterrorist attacks--we must strengthen our public health defenses. Expert testimony provided to our committee showed how much work needs to be done. We must begin by defining and assessing the capacities that public health agencies need to fight infectious diseases. Our bill authorizes grants to these agencies to enable them to assess their ability to respond effectively to infectious disease threats. 
   Once assessments have been completed, state and local public health agencies will become eligible to receive grants to strengthen their capacity to fight infectious disease threats. While only a few states that have already completed capacity assessments will be eligible for these grants in the first year of this program, more and more states will become eligible in the years to come. 
   Strengthening the nation's public health agencies will also assist in countering the threats posed by microbes that have become resistant to antibiotics. Not long ago, doctors were confident that most microbes could be easily treated with antibiotics. In recent years, however, this confidence has been shaken by the rise of deadly infections that cannot be cured by antibiotics. The World Health Organization estimates that 14,000 Americans die every year from drug-resistant infections, and that fighting these infections costs the United States $10 billion per year. These figures are distressing, and they are sure to become even more alarming in the future, as the number of resistant infections increases. 
   We must clearly do more to halt that upward spiral. If we act now to contain the spread of antibiotic resistance, we can buy enough time for new antibiotics to be developed that provide additional defenses against microbes that are becoming increasingly resistant to the current generation of drugs. This legislation supports efforts to use existing drugs more carefully, monitor drug-resistant infections more diligently, and conduct research to find the next generation of antimicrobial treatments. 
   The existing interagency task force on antimicrobial resistance has made a good start in tackling these problems. This group has carefully brought together federal agencies with special responsibilities in areas related to antimicrobial resistance, and has sought the advice of experts in formulating its Action Plan. Our legislation provides statutory authorization for this task force to continue its essential work. The activities already underway or planned by the task force will do much  to invigorate federal efforts to fight antimicrobial resistance, and our committee will watch carefully to make sure that these promising plans are translated into effective action. 
   The Food and Drug Administration has a special responsibility to protect the public from the growing threat of drug-resistant microbes in our nation's food supply. Numerous scientific studies have provided compelling evidence that there is a link between the overuse of antibiotics in food animals and the alarming increase in drug-resistant microbes found in meat and poultry. The FDA deserves credit for carefully gathering information about the risk of using antibiotics in food animals. The agency now has an opportunity to act decisively on this information, by setting regulatory thresholds for the presence of drug-resistant microbes in food at levels which will protect the public health. Both consumers and producers will benefit if the nation can be assured that its food supply is safe and uncontaminated. I am sure that many members of our committee and our colleagues in Congress will pay close attention to the decisions that the FDA makes on this important issue in the months to come. 
   Countering emerging public health threats is only one part of this important legislation. 
   The Act also includes important provisions to strengthen clinical research. These provisions, which the Senate approved last November as the Clinical Research Enhancement Act, will begin to reverse the alarming decline in the number of health professionals who conduct research directly related to the needs of patients. These provisions will also provide clinical researchers with the facilities they need to conduct their important work. 
   Numerous expert reports and analyses have proven that support for patient-oriented research is inadequate in the United States. Too often, talented health professionals are deterred from careers in clinical research because of inadequate grant funding or the extreme financial pressure of high educational debt. In addition, there are too few clinical research centers which conduct high quality patient-oriented research. The Act addresses these deficiencies by authorizing grants for clinical researchers throughout their careers, by providing relief from the education debt burden that keeps many health professionals from pursuing careers in clinical research, and by authorizing grants to establish general clinical research centers. 
   This legislation is not intended to single out any individual area of medical research for special study or emphasis. Instead, it provides broad support for clinical research so that clinical researchers can pursue whichever avenues of medical research have the greatest medical need or offer the most promising opportunities. In introducing and passing this legislation, it is our strong view that awards under the Act should be granted to investigators who show the greatest promise and who are conducting research of the greatest scientific or health value, regardless of the specific diseases or conditions they may be studying. 
   The Clinical Research Enhancement Act will bear fruit now and in the coming years as new medical advances move more rapidly from the laboratory of the researcher to the bedside of the patient. The skill and dedication of the nation's clinical researchers deserve this support, and it is long overdue. 
   The Act will also revitalize the nation's biomedical research facilities. Continued progress in medicine depends on modern and well-maintained research facilities--yet the nation's basic biomedical research facilities are in an alarming state of disrepair. To restore and rebuild the nation's biomedical research infrastructure, the Act incorporates the provisions originally passed in the Senate last year as the Twenty-First Century Research Laboratories Act. I commend Senator HARKIN for his leadership on these needed provisions. I also commend our colleague, Representative MICHAEL BILIRAKIS, for introducing and championing this legislation in the House. 
   Earlier this year, the National Science Foundation conducted a comprehensive study of the nation's research facilities. The shocking facts uncovered by the analysis demonstrate the need for this important legislation. Over 60 percent of the universities and research institutions studied by the NSF had inadequate laboratory space in the biomedical sciences. The NSF found that 5 percent of the laboratory space at the nation's research institutions is in such poor condition that it needs immediate replacement. An additional 18 percent--or 4.6 million square 
   feet of lab space--needs major repairs and renovations. Funding for such construction has not kept pace with the significant budget increases provided to the NIH in recent years. As a result, 54 percent of all research institutions have had to defer needed construction for research and development due to insufficient funding, resulting in a backlog of more than $2.1 billion in deferred construction. 
   Funding from state, local and institutional sources can meet a significant proportion of this shortfall. But federal resources are needed too, to revitalize the nation's biomedical research laboratories. Under this legislation, NIH will be authorized to provide merit-based grants for construction or revitalization of essential laboratory facilities. 
   The Act also authorizes grants to institutions to purchase the sophisticated scientific instruments that are increasingly required to conduct top quality biomedical research. As scientists learn more and more about the fundamental processes of life, advances in research rely increasingly on complex and expensive scientific instruments. In a matter of moments, an advanced DNA sequencer can find out vital information about the genes that affect health and disease. New microscopes and imaging devices can provide snapshots inside the body or within a single cell. 
   The Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology recently released a detailed survey about the needs of the nation's biomedical research institutions for scientific equipment. Over 80 percent of NIH grant recipients believed that shared scientific equipment and core facilities are essential to their research--but more than half felt that NIH's grant support is inadequate for purchases of this needed equipment. Future progress in medicine will increasingly depend on sophisticated and expensive equipment. Congress has a responsibility to accelerate this progress by providing adequate federal support for equipment. 
   The Act also includes the House-passed Lupus Research and Care Amendments of 2000. These provisions authorize new resources for lupus research and new programs for treating this cruel disease. Lupus disproportionately affects women, and it affects African-American women in particular. Patients with lupus suffer a debilitating variety of symptoms that include inflammation of the joints, kidney failure, painful skin rashes, neurological impairments and many other painful conditions. While lupus is rarely fatal, it can often result in a lifetime of pain or disability for persons with the disease. There is no known cure for lupus, but the Act will advance our understanding of this disease, and provide assistance to persons who suffer from its consequences. 
   The Act will also improve the treatment and detection of prostate cancer, by incorporating the provisions of the Prostate Cancer Research and Prevention Act that was passed by the Senate last November. Too often, men with prostate cancer go untreated because they fail to take advantage of screening procedures that detect the early symptoms of this deadly disease. Early detection is the key to surviving prostate cancer, and these provisions will assist the efforts of the Department of Health and Human Services to promote widespread screening for this 
   disease. 
   The Act also reflects the nation's commitment to improving the treatment and understanding of Alzheimer's disease and sexually transmitted diseases, by authorizing fellowships for clinical scientists conducting research in these areas. Large numbers of Americans today have friends or relatives who suffer from the terrifying loss of mental abilities brought on by Alzheimer's disease. We have made a significant investment in basic research, and we must ensure that the new treatments produced by research are brought rapidly to patients suffering from this disease. I commend my colleague from Massachusetts, Representative ED MARKEY, for introducing the Alzheimer's Clinical Research and  Training Awards Act of 2000, which has been incorporated into this Act. This measure authorizes clinical research awards to health professionals for research, study and practice at centers of excellence for Alzheimer's disease research and treatment. The Act includes a similar provision to increase support for health professionals engaged in clinical research on sexually transmitted diseases, which will improve the understanding and treatment of these disorders. 
   Taken together, the provisions of the Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 will improve the lives of millions of Americans and help safeguard the nation's health in the years ahead. This significant legislation will help revitalize the capacity of the nation's public health agencies to respond effectively to public health emergencies, such as infectious disease outbreaks or bioterrorist attacks. It will help bridge the gap between discoveries made in the laboratory and improvements in patient care by providing new support for talented health professional to pursue careers in patient-oriented clinical research. This legislation will help rebuild the nation's laboratory infrastructure, which is in an alarming state of decay and disrepair. The Act also gives new emphasis to research into the causes and treatment of lupus, prostate cancer, Alzheimer's disease and sexually transmitted diseases. The Public Health Improvement Act of 2000 can help lay a firm foundation for more effective public health in a wide variety of areas, and I urge my colleagues to approve this much needed legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   October 27, 1999: 
   Ioniaferrio Bolton, 26, Dallas, TX; 
   Donal Bryant, 31, Dallas, TX; 
   Merritt J. Copenhefer, 41, Madison, WI; 
   Aurelio Enciso-Murillo, 40, Oakland, CA;

   Jerome Oakley, 18, Baltimore, MD; 
   Joseph Transon, 19, Baltimore, MD; 
   Tyree Turner, 19, Philadelphia, PA; 
   Paul Vo, 30, Houston, TX; and 
   Unidentified Male, 52, Charlotte, NC. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 16-year-old Donald McNeil of Philadelphia, was shot and killed one year ago today by another teenager in what police said was an argument over a girl. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, along with Senators CHAFEE, LEAHY, HARKIN, FEINGOLD, REED and JEFFORDS, I am introducing legislation to help facilitate East Timor's transition to independence. Congressman GEJDENSON has introduced similar legislation in the House of Representatives. 
   In August 1999, after almost three decades of unrest under Indonesian rule, the people of East Timor voted overwhelmingly in favor of independence. 
   They did so at great personal risk. Anti-independence militia groups killed hundreds, hoping to intimidate and retaliate against those supporting independence. The militias also destroyed or severely damaged seventy percent of East Timor's infrastructure. Government services and public security were severely undermined. 
   An international effort, led by Australia and including the United States, brought much-needed stability to East Timor. 
   Now, under the United Nation's Transitional Authority, stability is taking hold again in East Timor, and normal life is slowly returning. 
   In coming months, looking to America and other democratic nations as an example, East Timor's leaders will hold a constitutional convention to decide which form of democratic government to adopt. It is a process that reminds us of our own Constitutional Convention and would make our Founding Fathers proud. 
   Late next year, after choosing a form of democratic government and electing leaders, East Timor is expected to declare its independence as the UN draws  down. A new, democratic nation will take its rightful place in the world. 
   This is a success story. It is a great success story. But it is far from over. 
   East Timor remains one of the poorest places in Asia. Only 20 percent of its population is literate. The annual per capita gross national product is $340. 
   The people of East Timor need and deserve our help. The extraordinary physical and moral courage they demonstrated over the years is impressive. The great faith in the democratic process they showed by voting for independence under the barrel of a gun must not go unrewarded. 
   This bill is our chance to help them, and help now. Its purpose is to put U.S. governmental programs and resources in place now and to enable U.S. government agencies to focus on the imminent reality of an independent East Timor. If we wait until East Timor declares its independence before we do the preliminary work, we will lose crucial time and do a disservice to both the United States and to East Timor. 
   Specifically, this bill lays the groundwork for establishing a firm bilateral and multilateral assistance structure. 
   It authorizes $25 million in bilateral assistance, $2 million for a Peace Corps presence and $1 million for a scholarship fund for East Timorese students to study in the United States. 
   It encourages the President, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the Trade and Development Agency and other agencies to put in place now the tools and programs to create an equitable trade and investment relationship. 
   It requires the State Department to establish an accredited mission to East Timor co-incident with independence. 
   And it authorizes the provision of excess defense articles and international military education and training, after the President certifies that these articles and training are in the interests of the United States and will help promote human rights in East Timor and the professionalization of East Timor's armed services. 
   The people of East Timor have chosen democracy. The United States has a golden opportunity to help them create their new democratic nation. But we must prepare for that day now. We must not miss this rare opportunity to help.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator DEWINE and Senator JEFFORDS for their leadership. As Senator DEWINE has pointed out, this has been a long, continuing struggle for the last 2 years. This has been a bipartisan struggle. We are grateful for the efforts of the House of Representatives. 
   I wish to say on our side, the real champion for this program is on my left, Senator MIKULSKI, from the State of Maryland, who over the period of these last 2 years has been an absolutely tireless advocate on this particular issue, as she has been on so many others. We would not be here this morning in the final hours of this session if not for her strength and determination to see this measure move ahead. 
   I think what she and others have understood is that it has been 5 years since we have seen this important legislation expire. As a result, we have seen even funding on the Older Americans Act. In that respect, there has been a falling behind in the attention to the services for our senior 
   citizens. 
   This is a much better bill than the last authorization; and it will benefit our senior population in a much more sensitive and extensive way. Hopefully, it will gain acceptance and support from our colleagues in the Senate and the House and will be sent to the President so we can strengthen the outreach programs that are lifelines to our senior citizens. 
   So I pay particular tribute to my colleague, Senator MIKULSKI, for her leadership. I thank the administration and President Clinton for the strong priority that he has placed on this and the attention that the Secretary has given to getting this action. 
   I think most of us know we are operating in a very highly charged political atmosphere as we are coming to the last 2 weeks of a political campaign for election to the House and the Senate. But the House of Representatives yesterday passed this bill 405-2. We are very hopeful that we will have a similar outcome. It does indicate that when people of good will want to move a process forward, it can be done. I commend all of those who have worked over a very considerable period of time and have really tried to find common ground on some very difficult and complex issues. 
   Finally, I wish to highlight the very important aspects of this legislation. I think the most powerful and obviously important parts are the nutrition programs, which have been the largest and the longest standing of the programs--this traces back to 1965. Meals on Wheels and congregate meals have been an incredibly important program in permitting so many of our seniors to live at home, and also to benefit from nutritious meals in these congregate sites. It is an important nutritional aspect for many of our seniors who are hard pressed. 
   This bills value in terms of our elderly population cannot really be measured in terms of dollars and cents. It includes important preventive health programs, absolutely essential transportation programs, and important employment opportunities as well. These opportunities enable many of our seniors continue to be useful, constructive, and productive workers, primarily focused on serving communities. 
   There are extraordinary workers under this program. I have met so many of them in travels around my own State of Massachusetts. What they do in terms of adding an additional dimension of services in local communities is really extraordinary. Many people believe, with regard to programs in which they are particularly interested, that they get a great bang for the buck. This Nation, with this program, gets enormous advantages in terms of permitting our seniors to live in the kind of peace and dignity and with a degree of security in these areas which they would be hard pressed to have if this legislation were not on the books. 
   The Older Americans Act was enacted in 1965, three years after I was first elected to the Senate. I am proud to have been one of its original supporters. Over the years since then, we have repeatedly expanded the act to meet more of the needs facing older citizens. 
   Today, the Senate is about to approve a reauthorization of the act which keeps faith with the nation's senior citizens. Current law supports a broad array of home-based and community-based support services to enhance the health and well-being of persons over sixty years of age. This legislation preserves and strengthens these programs, which provide vital links between senior citizens and their communities. 
   For seniors who are healthy and active, the act offers community service employment opportunities, preventive health services, and transportation services. It also supports a range of social activities, including congregate meals. The act supports more than 6,400 multipurpose senior citizen centers across the country. 
   For those frail seniors who lack mobility, it helps to maintain a lifeline to the outside world. It provides daily home-delivered meals, in-home care services, home-maker services, and transportation to doctors and other caregivers, and it supports programs to protect vulnerable seniors from abuse and exploitation. The long-term care ombudsman program investigates and resolves complaints of elderly residents of nursing home facilities and other adult care homes. 
   These programs make a significant difference for those they were designed  to help. This legislation reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that older Americans continue to receive the services which are so essential to their quality of life. This reauthorization means increased federal financial support of these very worthwhile programs. 
   Of all the Older American Act programs, nutrition assistance is the largest and longest running. It was created as a response to disturbing evidence that, due to poverty and isolation, many senior citizens were suffering from serious nutrition deficiencies, and that the lack of good nutrition was contributing to their poor health. 
   Today, under the act, we are providing over 240 million meals a year to over 3 million senior citizens. Approximately half of these meals are provided in congregate social settings and the other half are delivered daily through the Meals on Wheels program to seniors in their homes. This program has broad-based community support. The many volunteers who deliver meals to the home-bound have greatly expanded the reach of the act. Unfortunately, we have not had sufficient resources to fully meet the need. Passage of this legislation will mean a substantial increase in the level of funding for these vital nutrition programs. 
   The Senior Community Service Employment Program, authorized by title V of the act, is the nation's only employment and training program aimed exclusively at low-income older persons--and it will have an increasingly important role as the Baby Boom generation ages. The nation will have 1.4 million more low-income persons over the age of 55 in the year 2005 than there were in 1995, and many of them will want to continue working. 
   Title V serves over 90,000 low-income elderly persons every year. Eighty percent of these participants are age 60 or over, and 16 percent are above 75 years of age. The jobs obtained through this program provide these men and women with needed economic support. But it does much more than that. It keeps them active and involved in their communities, not isolated at home. It provides opportunities to make important contributions to their communities and to learn new skills--and it enhances their sense of dignity and self-esteem. In this legislation, we have significantly strengthened the Community Service Employment Program and provided for its much-needed expansion. 
   As part of this legislation, we have also created a National Family Caregiver Support Program to help families who care for ill or disabled parents or elderly relatives at home. We know how difficult it can become for a family when an elderly person needs a high degree of continuous care. We know the importance of keeping a frail senior at home in a loving environment whenever it is medically possible. This new program will provide essential support services to help these seniors remain with their loved ones. These families deserve our assistance, and this new program will ensure that they receive it. 
   Family caregivers will be able to obtain a broad range of support services, including respite care, in-home assistance, training in caregiver skills, and family counseling, all of which will make a major difference for these vulnerable seniors and their families. The federal government will fund 75 percent of the cost of these services, and the states will fund the remainder. We have authorized $125 million for the first year of this new effort, and we anticipate the program will grow in succeeding years. 
   This reauthorization of the Older Americans Act is the product of a two-year bipartisan effort. Senators JEFFORDS, DEWINE, MILULSKI, and I share a common commitment to preserving and strengthening these programs, which have done so much to improve the lives of millions of senior citizens. We also shared a common determination to break through the barriers which prevented reauthorization in the last two Congresses. I commend my three colleagues for their leadership in fashioning this legislation. Because of the bipartisan spirit in which they approached this task, they made the difficult possible. 
   I also commend the important role of the Clinton administration. The Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services have been extremely helpful throughout the reauthorization effort. President Clinton deserves particular credit for proposing creation of the National Family Caregiver Support Program. 
   The legislation before us is supported by the National Governors' Assn. and by nearly fifty organizations, which represent senior citizens, including: The Leadership Council of Aging Organizations; American Association of Retired Persons; National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare; National Association of Area Agencies on Aging; National Association of State Units on Aging; Meals on Wheels Association of America; Generations United; Green Thumb; National Council of Senior Citizens; National Urban League; National Council on Aging; National Caucus and Center on Black Aged; National Association for Hispanic Elderly; National Asian Pacific Center on Aging; National Indian Council on Aging; Alzheimer's Association; American Society on Aging; Gerontological Society of America; Association of Jewish Aging Services; National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys; Older Women's League; National Association of State Long Term Care Ombudsman Programs; and National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services Programs. 
   I ask unanimous consent that letters of support from a number of these organizations may be placed in the RECORD. Their strong support demonstrates that this bill will truly benefit the older Americans it is designed to serve, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ENZI, and Senator REID for their effective work on this important legislation. And I also commend the American Nurses Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees for their effective efforts in supporting it. 
   Needle stick protection is vitally important to health care professionals and to the many others who come in contact with them. Last year, as many as 800,000 health care professionals suffered needle stick injuries. Over 1,000 health care workers were infected with serious diseases, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. 
   These injuries were preventable, and because of this bill, many future needle stick injuries will be prevented. The Center for Disease Prevention estimates that this bill will reduce needle stick injuries by as much as 88 percent. 
   But numbers alone cannot convey the human tragedy of these injuries. One of my constituents, Karen Daley of Boston, is the President of the Massachusetts Nurses Association and was a registered nurse, a job she loved and found very fulfilling. In January 1999, while on duty in an emergency room in Boston, Karen was accidentally stuck by a contaminated needle. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and Hepatitis C. Fortunately, Karen is in reasonably good health today, although she may never again be able to practice her chosen profession of nursing. 
   The Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act will help prevent tragic accidents like Karen Daley's. This bill requires employers to use, where appropriate, safety-designed needles and other sharp devices to reduce the potential transmission of disease to health care workers and patients. It is not enough to rely solely on one type of control, such as disposable needles and other equipment, when safer, appropriate medical devices are available and can be effective in reducing the risk of contaminated needle injuries. 
   This bill also provides that employers must establish an injury log to record the kind of devices, and the location, of all needle stick accidents.  This information must be considered when determining appropriate devices to be used. 
   This bill strikes a critical balance between the reasoned judgment of health care professionals on patient safety and OSHA's responsibility to protect the health and safety of employees. The bill also provides that non-managerial employees and their representatives--those on the front lines of service delivery--must participate in determining the appropriate devices used in health care settings. Nothing in this bill would justify the establishment of an employer-dominated labor organization or the bypassing of a collective bargaining representative in violation of the National Labor Relations Act. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to support this important legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   Mr. President, the case has been very well stated by the Senators from Ohio, Vermont, and Maryland. I listened carefully to the points the Senator from New Hampshire made earlier today. It is worthy for our committee to give consideration to these points. I thought the Senator from Ohio and others thoroughly explained how steps were already taken to address those issues and went into considerable detail in explaining the provisions of the bill that will address the challenges which the good Senator raised. 
   A great deal of time was taken by the committee to address those challenges. I think the committee has done a good job in addressing them. I do not think, therefore, that amendment is necessary to ensure the interests of the elderly people, as well as the taxpayers. 
   We must remember that it is not unusual for auditors to identify expenditures which do not conform with the terms of a grant, and for the Department to require repayment of the disputed amounts. Disallowed costs are usually nothing more than good-faith errors or honest disagreements over the interpretation of the terms of a grant. 
   For example, during 1998, the Employment and Training Administration of the Department of Labor which administers title V of the Older Americans Act, amongst the many workforce programs it supervises, reviewed 84 audits, examining $30 million in questioned costs, and ultimately disallowed $18 million in grantee expenditures. The disallowed costs included agencies of State and local governments, as well as private organizations, and the disallowance of costs is a routine part of supervision that in no way impugns the integrity of the grantees involved. 
   The Gregg amendment is an extreme and unfair response to a problem which has already been remedied. The Department of Labor has already disallowed the insurance royalty payments which were the major focus of the inspector general's report on NCSC's Title V program grant, ordered the financial practice in question terminated, and demanded repayment of the disallowed costs. The cost items which DOL has disallowed cover the period between 1992 and 1996. The objectionable practices have been stopped. The matter is currently before an administrative law judge. 
   Furthermore, the legislation reported from the HELP Committee already addresses the financial accountability of title V program operators. It establishes strong new performance measures which program operators must meet each year, and provides for removal of operators who consistently fail to meet performance standards. It sets strict limits on the purposes for which the funds can be used. It sets forth in statute a 14-point ``Responsibility Test'' which each program operator must pass in order to be eligible to participate in the title V programs. Section 514(d) requires a detailed examination of the organization's past performance in administering federal funds. The Department will have ample authority to disqualify those program operators whom it deems untrustworthy or unreliable. The procedures we have established are tough and fair. After extensive review of the Senior Community Service Employment Program, the committee believes that these new performance standards and responsibility tests will effectively protect the interest of both the senior citizens who participate in the program and the taxpayers who fund it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, few, if any, issues are of greater concern to American families than quality, affordable health care. Americans want an end to HMO abuses. They want good health insurance coverage. They want a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens under Medicare. They want to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so that it will be there for both today's and tomorrow's senior citizens. And they want these priorities not only for themselves and their loved ones but for every American, because they know that good health care should be a basic right for all. 
   The choice in this election is clear, and it is not just a choice between different programs. it is also a choice based on who can be trusted to do the right thing for the American people. AL GORE's record and his program are clear. He has been deeply involved in health care throughout his career. 
   The current administration has made significant progress in improving health care in a variety of ways--from expanding health insurance to protecting Medicare. He has consistently stood for patients and against powerful special interests.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to just take a few minutes to review the education record. I think I have tried to outline in as an objective way as possible what the record is with regard to health, particularly with regard to children in the State of Texas, the Governor's record on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on the CHIP program, and also on the Medicaid program. 
   I think one can't review that record--not only my statements or the statements in the most recent Time Magazine which have drawn effectively the exact same conclusion--and not reach the conclusion that children have not been a priority on the political agenda of Texas over the period of the last six years. 
   On the issue of education, I spoke briefly yesterday in the Senate. I am troubled, as many of our colleagues, that we are not having cloture on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In spite of all of the assurances that were given by the majority leader and Republican leadership, we still failed to do it. 
   I commend again our colleagues, Senator DEWINE, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator MIKULSKI, and others for effectively concluding the Older Americans Act shows even in these final hours that bipartisanship can work in a very important area. I welcome the chance to work with our colleagues on the committee and the chairman to make sure that we are going to take action. That is an enormously important piece of legislation for our seniors. 
   Education is enormously important for families as well. In spite of the fact that assurances were given by the majority, we still have not done so. For the first time in 35 years, we have not completed our work and reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   What has to be a central distress to all families is it appears now that the appropriations that are going to fund the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will be the last train out of the station. 
   They are more than 3 1/2 weeks late after the end of the fiscal year. It is troublesome to me to hear all of the statements about the importance of prioritizing education when we see that we have basically failed to do our work here in the Senate on this issue. 
   I want to take a moment to find out what we might look to in terms of the future, again looking to what has happened in Texas over the period of these last several years. 
   On the issue of the record on education in Texas, it is more of an ``education mirage'' than an ``education miracle.'' 
   Under Governor Bush, in 1998, according to the National Center for Educational Statistics, Texas ranked 45th in the nation in high school completion  rates. Seventy-one percent of high school dropouts in Texas are minorities. Hispanic students in Texas dropped out at more than twice the rate of white students in the State. 
   In August, the College Board reported nationally that from 1997 to 2000, SAT scores have increased. But in Texas they have decreased. In 1997, Texas was 21 points below the SAT national average, and by 2000 the gap had widened to 26 points. 
   Let me review that very quickly. Since we have had a lot of talk and we have had a lot of sound bites on education, let's look at what has happened. 
   We will come back to what happened under the last several years in these same areas at the national level, which the Vice President was involved in and which he would like to see continued and expanded. 
   On Tuesday, Governor Bush heard more bad news. The Rand Corporation released a study that raises serious questions about the validity of the gains in student achievement claimed by the Governor. On CNN in August, the Governor said: Our state ..... has done the best ..... not measured by us but measured by the Rand Corporation ..... who take an objective look as to how states are doing when it comes to educating children. 
   Clearly, at that time, George W. Bush trusted the conclusions by Rand. 
   On CNN, in September, Governor Bush said: One of my proudest accomplishments is I worked with Republicans and Democrats to close the achievement gap in Texas. 
   The recent Rand study shows his claim is false. The achievement gap in Texas is not closing; it is widening. 
   On Fox News, in August, Governor Bush said: Without comprehensive regular testing, without knowing if children are really learning, accountability is a myth, and standards are just slogans. 
   But, the Rand study shows that the tests cited by Governor Bush to support his claim are biased. They found the gains in student achievement are the product of a discredited practice called ``teaching to the test,'' and that claims of real success in student achievement far exceed the actual results in Texas. 
   The Rand study also says the gains in student achievement in Texas may be inflated, questioning the validity of the scores. According to the study, gains on the Texas State test are far greater than the results for the same students on standard national tests. 
   The Rand study questions the value of the Texas State test because it involves teaching to the test instead of real learning. The Bush education plan has the same serious flaw. It focuses on tests, tests, and more tests. We, as a country, have more tests than any other country in the world. 
   Inevitably, schools will focus more and more on test preparation, as happened in Texas with the State tests, and less on real teaching. In the end, it is education that suffers and so do the students. 
   In addition, in Texas more and more students with disabilities are excluded from taking the test, and more and more students are dropping out or being held back. That is not a satisfactory prescription for improving education. 
   Instead, we should look at the success of States such as North Carolina, which is improving education the right way by investing in schools, teacher quality, and afterschool programs in order to produce better results for students. 
   Governor Bush's plan mandates more tests for children but it does nothing to ensure schools actually improve so that children will obtain a better education. 
   It is clear that Governor Bush is out of touch with parents and students when it comes to education. Governor Bush says everything in education is failing--it is all doom and gloom. His solutions go back to the old scheme to abandon public schools and refuse to make needed investments in education. He mandates more and more tests for children, but does nothing to help create the change needed to ensure that all the children pass the tests. He turns his back on what works and resorts to right wing policies instead, which are inadequate to meet the challenges of genuine school reform. 
   Early education initiatives are especially important. Study after study has shown that children who have quality learning experiences early in life have a greater ability to learn in school, to work successfully with their teachers and their peers, and to master needed skills. We can do more--much more--to put this impressive research into practice. But Governor Bush has no plan to expand access to preschool education. He has no plan to expand Head Start--only empty rhetoric about reforming the program. 
   Assistance for low-performing schools is also essential. We know that with needed investments, failing public schools will improve. In North Carolina, low-performing schools are given technical assistance by special state teams that provide targeted support to help turn around those schools. In the 1997-98 school year, 15 schools were selected and received intensive help from these state assistance teams. In August 1998, the state reported that most of these schools had achieved ``exemplary'' growth--and none continue to be identified as low-performing. In the 1998-99 school year, 11 schools were identified and received help from the assistance teams. Nine schools met or exceeded their growth targets at the end of the year. That's the kind of aid to education that works, and we should support it in all states. Instead, Governor Bush abandons low-performing schools--and proposes instead a private school voucher plan that drains needed resources from troubled schools and traps low-income children in them. 
   Another major problem hindering schools' ability to teach students effectively is the fact that many schools have obsolete, crumbling and inadequate facilities. All teachers and students deserve safe, modern facilities with up-to-date technology. Sending children to dilapidated and overcrowded classrooms sends an unacceptable message. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the boardroom--and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We have an obligation to children and parents to modernize the nation's schools--to build more schools, so that there are more classrooms and less overcrowding, and more computers and other equipment. It is long past time to end the days when the worst building in town is the school house with its crumbling walls and broken pipes and leaky roofs that plague students and teachers and classrooms. But congressional Republicans have repeatedly refused to address these pressing needs. Governor Bush doesn't do nearly enough either. He makes only a token investment in school construction, and he ignores communities' needs to repair crumbling and unsafe schools. 
   Smaller classes are also an indispensable element of school reform. Research documents what parents and teachers have always known--that small classes improve student achievement. Teachers are able to maintain discipline more effectively. Students receive more individual attention and instruction. Students with learning disabilities are identified earlier, and their needs can be met without placing them in costly special education. Instead of applying this basic and widely accepted principle, Governor Bush eliminates the current and increasingly effective effort to help communities reduce class sizes. We must also make a stronger commitment to help communities attract, train and support the highest quality teachers and principals. Two million new teachers will be needed over the next 10 years, because of the large number of teachers nearing retirement and the continuing large increases in student enrollment. The shortage of teachers is compounded by the shameful fact that 50 percent of teachers leave the profession within 5 years. 
   Instead of using our budget resources to strengthen programs that work to improve teacher quality and put well-trained teachers in all classrooms, Governor Bush would simply hand over a block grant to states--a blank check--and hope that state governors will spend the federal aid in ways that improve teacher quality. Clearly, America can do better than that. We have to do better than that. We must also do more to make college accessible and affordable. Parents and students across the country are also struggling to pay for college. The opportunity for a college education should not be determined by the level  of family income. Any student who has the ability, who works hard, and who wants to attend college should have the opportunity to do so. We should do more--much more--to make college affordable for every qualified student. 
   We also need to do more to help train workers who have lost their jobs because of corporate down-sizing or business relocations, so they can find other good jobs in their communities. Workers need opportunities to upgrade their skills to remain competitive, especially in the modern economy. Better services and real training for dislocated workers will give them the skills they need to continue their careers. It will also help to meet employers' growing needs for well-qualified workers. 
   But, Governor Bush has no plan to make college more affordable or help these dislocated workers. He expands Pell grants primarily for the first year of college only. He makes only a limited effort to help the nation's workers upgrade their skills. 
   The vast majority of Americans want us to address these challenges more effectively. We know that many schools across the country are doing an excellent job. The real challenge is to do what it takes to create better schools and better college opportunities for all students. Like Governor Bush, this Republican Congress deserves a failing grade for its lack of support for school reform. Too often, we have abandoned states and local school districts in their efforts to provide students with a good education. Too often, Congress has stood on the sidelines and declined to be an active participant in the nation's education policy. It is only through a strong and cooperative commitment at every level--federal, state, and local--that the nation can adequately meet its education needs. We have a responsibility to do all we can to meet the pressing challenge to guarantee that students will graduate from school and college well-prepared for careers in the new information-age and in our technologically-advanced economy and our competitive global society. 
   That's what AL GORE and Democrats in Congress are proposing--a constructive and more effective balance between accountability for better results and additional resources for programs that work to improve schools. We will ensure that every child receives a good early education, by ensuring that preschool is available to all children. We will help communities improve public schools. Our goal is to put a well-trained teacher in every classroom. We understand that when class size goes up, opportunity for learning goes down. We will help schools reduce class size, so the nation's students can be taught more effectively. We will make major investments in helping communities to build new schools, to alleviate overcrowding and to repair and modernize obsolete and dilapidated classrooms and facilities. We will hold states and schools accountable for results, so that all children have the opportunity to meet high standards. We will expand opportunities for college and later learning by making college tuition tax deductible and by increasing Pell grants. We will reach out to millions of disadvantaged young children and help them to see and believe that college can be a realistic option for their future. We will help the nation's workers obtain the on-going skills training they need, and provide tax credits for employers who offer worker training. 
   In all of these ways, AL GORE's approach to education is the right direction for the nation's future. We have reached the final days of this Congress, and we have yet to give needed priority to education. Negotiations are underway, and there is still a chance to meet our commitment to families and communities across the country, and do what is needed to meet their education needs. 
   At the end of this Congress, families across the country will assess what we have done to meet these priorities, and the verdict has to be, ``too little, too later.'' This Republican Congress deserves a failing grade on education, and no ``election eve conversion'' is enough to avoid that failing grade. The American people share our Democratic commitment to the nation's students, parents, schools and communities. We have already made students and families across the country wait too long for this needed education assistance. 
   We have seen the SAT math scores at their highest in 30 years. This is a very modest improvement nationwide, but all the indicators are going in the right direction as compared to Texas, and scores have increased both for males and females. 
   The number of students taking advanced math and science classes from 1990 to 2000: There is an increase in the number of students taking precalculus, calculus, and physics; students are taking more difficult and challenging courses. They are doing better on the national standardized tests. That is because they want to go to college because there is an increasing opportunity available to them under the proposals made by the administration. That is catching on with students all over the country because we are finding more and more students are taking the SAT. More and more students are taking the difficult, challenging, rigorous tests. Students are doing better in spite of the fact more are taking more difficult and challenging courses, and the national trends are moving in the right direction. That is completely contrary to what has happened in the State of Texas. 
   This is not to suggest we don't have many areas of our country and many school districts that don't need a great deal of help and assistance. However, what we are seeing as a result of the administration, which Vice President Gore has been a part of, and he has been strongly supportive of, these education programs are moving in the right direction. They are moving in the right direction. 
   When he talks about smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, mentoring in terms of teaching, afterschool programs, new technology, and accountability, it is being based upon the schools and school districts which are effectively breaking the mold where we are getting children with enhanced achievement and accomplishment. That is what I think families want in this country, not just cliches. 
   I also wish to mention a final point of contrast between Governor Bush and the Vice President on the early education initiatives and how important they are. Study after study has shown that children who have quality learning experiences early in life have a greater ability to learn in school, to work successfully with their teachers, their peers, and master needed skills. We can do much more to put this impressive research into practice. 
   We have some bold initiatives which are bipartisan. I commend the leadership, Senator STEVENS, Senator JEFFORDS, and others who have been a part of this effort for some period of time. I think we have some real movement here. That debate has been independent of the broader issues on elementary and secondary education. I know in the Vice President's proposal, in terms of investing in the future, this early education program has an important commitment. 
   I remind our colleagues that this whole area was an area that had bipartisan support a number of years ago when the Governors met in Charlottesville. The first recommendation was made to the American people that the Governors were going to be committed. We were challenging the administration. The Congress was ready to learn. Children ought to be ready to learn when they go to school. ``Ready to learn'' means giving those children the kind of confidence building that is so essential in the very early years, when their brains are in formation. 
   Various Carnegie commission reports have demonstrated the early interventions help build confidence. They also demonstrate children begin to appreciate learning in these early formative years. Second, the children develop interpersonal skills which are enormously important when they begin their education experience. Finally, the tests show they develop a sense of humor, which I think is probably of value in carrying one through life. 
   This early intervention has been particularly and repeatedly emphasized and stressed by the Vice President. It ought to be taken into strong consideration.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   Today, the Senate is about to approve a reauthorization of the Older Americans Act which keeps faith with the nation's senior citizens. These programs provide vital links between senior citizens and their communities. 
   For seniors who are healthy and active, the act offers community service employment opportunities, preventive health services, and transportation services. It also supports a range of social activities, including congregate meals. The act supports more than 6,400 multi-purpose senior citizen centers across the country. For those frail seniors who lack mobility, it helps to maintain a lifeline to the outside world. It provides daily home-delivered meals, in-home care services, home-maker services, and transportation to doctors and other caregivers, and it supports programs to protect vulnerable seniors from abuse and exploitation. 
   This legislation reaffirms our commitment to ensuring that older Americans continue to receive the services which are so essential to their quality of life. This reauthorization should mean increased Federal financial support for these very worthwhile programs. 
   As part of this legislation, we have also created a National Family Caregiver Support Program to help families who care for ill or disabled parents or elderly relatives at home. We know how difficult it can become for a family when an elderly person needs a high degree of continuous care. We know the importance of keeping a frail senior at home in a loving environment whenever it is medically possible. This new program will provide essential support services to help these seniors remain with their loved ones. These families deserve our assistance, and this new program will ensure that they receive it. 
   Family caregivers will be able to obtain a broad range of support services, including respite care, in-home assistance, training in caregiver skills, and family counseling, all of which will make a major difference for these vulnerable seniors and their families. We have authorized $125 million for the first year of this new effort, and we anticipate the program will grow in succeeding years. Massachusetts families will receive over $3 million dollars to help them care for their elderly loved ones. 
   The Senior Community Service Employment Program, authorized by title V of the act, is the nation's only employment and training program aimed exclusively at low-income older persons--and it will have an increasingly important role as the Baby Boom generation ages. 
   Title V serves over 90,000 low-income elderly persons every year. The jobs obtained through this program provide these men and women with needed economic support. But it does much more than that. It keeps them active and involved in their communities, not isolated at home. It provides opportunities to make important contributions to their communities and to learn new skills--and it enhances their sense of dignity and self-esteem. In this legislation, we have significantly strengthened the Community Service Employment Program and provided for its much-needed expansion. 
   The legislation already addresses the financial accountability of title V program operators. It establishes strong new performance measures which program operators must meet each year, and provides for removal of operators who consistently fail to meet performance standards. It sets strict limits on the purposes for which program funds can be used, and established a 14-point financial responsibility test which every program operator must pass. The Department will have ample authority to disqualify those program operators whom it deems either untrustworthy or unreliable. The procedures we have established are tough and fair. The Gregg amendment is not needed. 
   Reauthorization of the Older Americans Act has been co-sponsored by over 70 Senators. It is supported by the National Governors' Association and by more than forty citizens organizations. It was overwhelmingly approved by the House of Representatives yesterday on a vote of 405-2. It is the product of a delicate bipartisan and bicameral consensus. Any change in the bill at this late date would have the effect of killing the reauthorization of the OAA for this session. That would be a serious loss for the millions of seniors who depend on this program, and are counting on us to reauthorize it. Please oppose the Gregg amendment so that we can finally enact this important bill this year. 
   I think the real test of a civilization is how it honors its elderly people, its senior citizens. I think that is a very fair criterion and it is one we ought to be reminded about. After all, these are the men and women who fought the wars, brought the country out of the Depression, and continued to make sacrifices for their children. We have enacted legislation historically, with Social Security, to try to keep these individuals out of poverty and also a Medicare program to address their needs. 
   This Older Americans Act is of great importance to millions of our senior citizens, to make sure they can live a quality life. It is not a prescription drug program. No, it is not, but it does provide vital services: Nutrition programs, preventive health care programs, transportation programs, feeding programs, in-home delivered meals programs. It is something that is really a lifeline for millions of our senior citizens. It is an employment program for many of our elderly people who want to provide services in local communities in nonprofit organizations. 
   The amendment before us, the amendment that has been put forward by Senator GREGG, brought a matter to the committee that the committee considered. I just hope our colleagues listen to the excellent presentations of the Senators from Ohio and Vermont, that would indicate that on these issues, this legislation responds to those questions and does it well. 
   This is an opportunity, with the defeat of the Gregg amendment, to pass this legislation and be on the road to provide meaningful services to our senior citizens. I hope the Gregg amendment will be defeated and we will have an overwhelming vote in support of the legislation. 
   I yield.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the reauthorization of the Older Americans Act which just received the Senate's unanimous approval is the product of a two-year bipartisan effort. Earlier today, I said Senators JEFFORDS, DEWINE, MIKULSKI, and I share a common commitment to preserving and strengthening these programs, which have done so much to improve the lives of millions of senior citizens. I commend my three colleagues for their tremendous leadership in fashioning this legislation. 
   Now, I would like to recognize the members of our staffs who did the work that made this bill possible: Rhonda Richards and Abby Brandel from Senator MIKULSKI's office, Karla Carpenter from Senator DEWINE's office, Sean Donohue, Hollis Turnham and Mark Powden from Senator Jefford's office, and Jeffrey Teitz, Michael Myers, and Jerry Wesevich from my office. We assigned them an extremely difficult task. Efforts to reauthorize the Older Americans Act had failed in the last two Congresses. This year, at each point when the differences appeared too wide, these individuals found a creative way to bridge the divide. They managed to build the consensus which has enabled this legislation to pass both the House and Senate so overwhelmingly.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support passage of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act of 2000. I commend Senator FRIST for his leadership on the issue of health disparities in our minority and underserved communities. I also commend the many Senators on both sides of the aisle who worked hard to ensure that the principles of equal justice and opportunity apply to health care. Health care  should be a basic right. With our current economic prosperity and the extraordinary recent advances in medicine, we should be able to guarantee that right to all Americans. 
   The extraordinary advances in health care in recent decades have not been shared by all our citizens. Minority communities suffer disproportionately from higher rates of death from cancer, stroke, and heart disease, as well as from higher rates of HIV/AIDS, diabetes, and other severe health problems. Africa American men who contract prostate cancer are more than twice as likely to die from it as white men. Vietnamese American women are five times more likely than white women to contract cervical cancer. Hispanic women are twice as likely to contract cervical cancer. Native Hawaiian men are 13 percent more likely to contract lung cancer. Alaskan Native women are 72 percent more likely to contract colon cancer and rectal cancer. In addition, African Americans and Hispanic Americans are more likely to be diagnosed with cancer after the disease has reached an advanced stage. For African Americans, the result is a 35 percent higher death rate. 
   The reality of poverty clearly affects the nation's health. Nearly 20 million white Americans live below the poverty line and many live in rural areas such as Appalachia, where 46 percent of counties are designated as health professions shortage areas and high rates of poverty contribute to health disparity outcomes. The lack of a health care facilities or benefits often means poor health care and often a poor prognosis for what might have been a preventable or curable condition. In the Appalachia regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and West Virginia, the rates of the five top causes of death in the U.S. all exceeded the national, average in 1997. Lack of availability and access to health care for poor and underserved regions often goes hand in hand with higher morbidity and mortality rates. Higher rates of heart disease in white males between the ages of 35 and 64 and cervical cancer in white females are also found in Appalachia. We must find better answers to identify and overcome the barriers to care that lead to dire outcomes in underserved communities. 
   While we have continued to make progress in the reduction of child poverty, child mortality, teenage pregnancy, and juvenile violence, we continue to see wide disparities by race and income, with communities of color and those in poverty lagging behind others. Infant mortality rate has declined nationally from 10.9 infant deaths for every 1,000 live births in 1983 to 7.2 in 1998. But among African Americans, the rate is 13.7--more than twice the rate of any other group. In addition, far too many people across this nation lack the health insurance that is necessary for access to basic health care. Over one-third of Hispanic Americans are uninsured, the highest rate among all ethnic groups and two and a half time the rate of 14% for whites. Nearly one-fourth of African Americans, and about one-fifth of Asian Americans are also uninsured. 
   In Massachusetts, significant progress has been made in improving the overall health status and access to health care. We are one of a handful of states in the country to devote the tobacco settlement money entirely to health care. Yet our significant commitment to health care is not translating into equal access or improved health status for all of our citizens. Health status differs by racial/ethnic group and by income group and the differences are reflected in the alarming discrepancy in mortality rates. The infant mortality rate for African-Americans is 11.7--over twice as high as the overall statewide rate of 5.3. 
   The same pattern exists for the HIV/AIDS-related mortality rate, which is more than six times greater for African-Americans and more than four times greater for Hispanics. African American women are more likely to lose their lives to breast cancer, and nearly six times a many Asian-American women and nearly two times as many Hispanic women have never taken a Pap test, which is essential in detection cervical cancer. Clearly, too many citizens are not benefitting from the advances made in science, medicine, and the economy. 
   The Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act addresses the biomedical, behavioral, economic, institutional, and environmental factors that have caused health disparities in communities of color and in undeserved communities around our nation. It provides needed resources for research, data collection, medical education, and public awareness, in order to understand the root causes of diseases and poor health outcomes and to develop strategies to meet the health needs of these vulnerable communities. Each of these aspects has an important role to play in the reduction and eventual elimination of the unacceptable disparities that now exist. 
   Title I of the bill establishes a Center for Research on Minority Health and Health Disparities at the National Institutes of Health. It also provides resources to educational institutions to train minority individuals as biomedical research professionals. 
   Title II focuses on identifying, evaluating, and disseminating information on the factors that contribute to health disparities. 
   Title III addresses the critical need for trained and culturally competent health care professionals by providing resources to develop effective educational support. 
   Title IV enhances the collection of data on race and ethnicity to determine what steps the federal government should take to ensure that all necessary information is collected. 
   Title V provides funding for a public awareness and information campaign to inform minority communities of the health conditions that are affecting them disproportionately and of the programs and services available to them. 
   Passage of the Minority Health and Health Disparities Research and Education Act demonstrates our strong commitment a healthier future for all our citizens. America has the resources to accomplish this goal and I urge the Senate to achieve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the period of the past weeks and months, as the ranking member of our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I have tried to point out the failing of this Congress and the fact that we have not addressed reauthorization of the elementary and secondary education bill, which we are charged to do--we had 22 days of hearings and we had a markup and legislation was reported out of our committee. 
   It has been several months since that legislation was on the floor and then withdrawn by the majority leader. In spite of the efforts of many of us to bring that measure back on the floor of the Senate, we have been unable to do so. We think it is enormously important that we have an opportunity to do so. 
   We are now some 3 weeks after the date that was suggested that we move into the adjournment for this Congress, and we have seen days go by, quorum calls held, and still no action. Now pending before the committee, we have the bankruptcy legislation, which is going to benefit in a substantial way the credit card industry. But we are not having the opportunity to address the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which can benefit families all across this country, with support for State and local communities. 
   This issue, I think, is back before the Senate because, during the period of our national debate between the Vice President and Governor Bush, great attention has been given to the issues of education. Assurances were given to the American people representing the different positions of the candidates. We have pointed out--I did last week--some of the realities and some of the facts about what is happening in our public schools across this country. And also I pointed out the fact that Texas has not been keeping up with the rest of the country on objective tests. That was challenged by some colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Now we have the Rand Corporation--virtually a nonpartisan organization--which has done a very careful review of the Texas experience, and they agree with us and, in effect, agree with Vice President Gore on the issues of education. 
   I am glad we are getting some clarification. We only have 2 weeks left in this campaign, but I am glad we are beginning to get some clarification on this issue. First of all, I remind our colleagues about what assurances were given to the American people about the commitment of our majority leader on the issues of elementary and secondary education. We only provide some 7 cents out of every dollar that goes into the local communities. States have the primary responsibility. Nonetheless, we can give some focus and attention to programs that have demonstrated positive results in terms of academic achievement and accomplishment. That really is the purpose for which these resources are out there, and also to give special emphasis to the most economically disadvantaged children in this country so they are not going to be left out or left behind. 
   We come to this debate and discussion looking over the period of recent years. We wonder whether the positions that have been accepted by the Republican leadership are very much in conflict with the age-old positions of the Republican Party with regard to education, where they believe there should not be a role for any Federal aid to education. We had that debate in the early sixties. We have had it many times since then. 
   Nonetheless, we have seen in the early 1990s when the Republican leadership assumed control of the Senate the first order of business for them was a massive rescission of moneys that had been appropriated and were going to be allocated to school districts that would have provided help and assistance to needy schools across the country. 
   That money had been appropriated by the House and Senate and agreed to by the conference, signed by the President of the United States. One of the first orders of business by the Republican leadership was to rescind that money. We saw a rescission of about $2 billion. The initial request was considerably higher. It was reduced, but we had the rescission. 
   Then in the 1990s we faced the onslaught of our Republican leadership who wanted to abolish the Department of Education. I think most Members and most parents across the country believe that when the President of the United States sits down with the Members at the White House, we want someone sitting at the President's elbow when there is a discussion and debate about domestic priorities in the United States, someone who is always going to say: What about education? What about education, Mr. President? 
   Those voices are there, appropriately so, in terms of the security interests of the United States and defense, for the foreign policy of the United States, the Secretary of State. We have them there with regard to housing. We have them there in terms of the environment. We have them there in terms of commerce and transportation. Many Members believe we should have them there with regard to the issues of education. 
   That was not the position of the Republican leadership. They said: No, we don't want to have that there. They tried unsuccessfully to eliminate the Department of Education. Nonetheless, we find the Department is there. It is considerably downsized. It has had an extraordinary record, with great improvement over the previous Republican Secretaries of Education in collecting the debts that are owed to the Department. They have reduced the student loan default rate from 22.4% in 1992 to 6.9% in 2000. Both the guaranteed and student loan collections have been much more efficient. 
   Now there is a different attitude by the new Republican leadership. It is expressed by the Republican leader himself, going back to January of 1999:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year....... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   January 29, 1999:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to be just words.......  
   June 22, 1999:  
   Education is number one on the agenda for the Republicans in Congress this year.......  
   Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been majority leader.......and Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act........Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   May 1, 2000:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   May 2, 2000:  
   Question: ......have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? 
   Senator LOTT: No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote....... But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across this country and every State, including my own State.   
   July 10:  
   I, too, would very much like to see us complete the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   July 25, 2000:  
   We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it completed.  
   The fact is, for the first time in 35 years we do not have a reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is against the background, Mr. President, of what is happening out there across this country and what young children are doing. 
   We have challenges in our education system. Here is a chart: ``More Students are Taking the SAT.'' That test, by and large, is necessary to gain entrance into the colleges; not virtually unanimous, but by and large it is required. Look at what has happened since 1980, when 33 percent of the children took it: 36 percent in 1985; 40 percent in 1990; 42 percent in 1995; and now in 2000, it is 44 percent. 
   This is a reflection of the attitude of children in our high schools. The percentage of children taking the SATs is going up significantly. The children want to take those tests. They understand the significance of the SAT and the importance of a college education. The SAT test is demanding. It is hard. It is difficult. Children have to work extremely long hours to prepare for these SATs. The increasing numbers of students taking the SAT is a clear indication from the children of this country that they are serious about education and they want to be able to try to improve their academic achievement. 
   Not only do we see their willingness to take the most strenuous of tests, which are the SATs, but they are also willing to take the advanced courses in math and science, probably the most difficult courses in our high school. 
   We see what has been happening in precalculus: In 1990, 31 percent of students enrolled in precalculus; in 2000, 44 percent did. In calculus, the rate increased from 19 percent to 24 percent. In physics, 44 percent to 49 percent. These are the percentage increases of students who are taking the advanced courses in these subject matters--all on the rise. The number of children who are taking the SAT tests is on the rise. 
   Let's take a look at the results. We have now more children taking the SAT tests. They are taking more demanding courses. What have been the results? We see across the board, going back from 1972 and 1975, 1980, the constant downward movement in terms of results. What we have been seeing since 1990 is the gradual, slow--and I admit it has been slow, but it is going in one direction, and that is up. There has been an improvement in SAT math scores and they are now the highest in 30 years. More kids are taking them, more kids are doing better. That is true across the board in terms of males as well as females. 
   We have challenges in our education system. This is a reflection on what is happening generally across the country. These are the matters the Vice President has talked about, how he wants to strengthen those. 
   Now we see what has been happening in the State of Texas. We saw what is happening generally across the country, that all the indicators are going up. Here we have Texas, falling far below the national average on the SAT scores from 1997 to the year 2000. 
   I brought this up to the Senate floor last week, and a lot of my colleagues were dismissive. But let's look at this. This is the national test, the SAT. These are not homegrown tests in Texas and homegrown tests in Massachusetts, homegrown in other States. The SAT is a national standardized test. I will come back to that in a minute. 
   These are the national averages for the SAT test. Notice the national average total scores since 1997 has gone up. That, I think, is a clear indication that the children, working harder, taking more challenging courses, have a greater desire, more of them, to go on to the schools and colleges. It is a very definite upward swing, although not great in terms of the total numbers. All of us want these higher. However, the fact remains that progress has been made and the national average is going up. 
   But not, Mr. President, in the State of Texas. From 1999 to the year 2000, we have seen it flatten out. Going back to 1997, scores have declined; Texas scores have gone down. It is also interesting that Texas scores are well below the national average in the SATs. 
   I think this is a pretty fair indication about the facts in the State of Texas. With all respect, I am not getting into criticizing the Governor or commenting on his desire to try to do better. But I do think that when he talks about it and he claims how well Texas is doing, it is fair enough to look at the facts and examine whether this is so. We have this as a result of these Scholastic Aptitude Tests that show Texas is well below the national average, and under Governor Bush it hasn't improved on the national average in the last several years, at least while he has been Governor. 
   These are the earlier facts. Then we have the blockbuster report, the Rand Commission report, which basically sustains that argument that the schools may not have been making as large of improvements as claimed. It has been an important indictment of what has been happening on education in the State of Texas.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I was just pointing out that we have this extraordinary report. I have it in my hand. It is the October 24, 2000 Rand Commission report: What do test scores in Texas tell us? It is an excellent report. I will have excerpts of it printed in the RECORD. But I hope those who are interested in this issue, trying to make up your minds over the period of these last 10 days, will have a good opportunity to examine that report. 
   Let me just mention a few of the highlights of the report. First of all, the study was released, as I mentioned, on October 24. It raises serious questions about the validity of gains in Texas math and reading stores. The study compares the results of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills, the test taken by Texas students, with the results achieved by those same students on the National Assessment of Education Progress tests. There were large discrepancies between the results of the Texas TAAS test and the national NAEP test. The student gains on the TAAS, the Texas test, are far greater than what has been found with the same group of students on the NAEP or other standardized national tests. 
   Do we understand what we are saying? Significant improvement on the  test just given to Texas students; but for the Texas students who took both the Texas and national test, we found a very dramatic disparity. In Texas, many teachers say they are spending especially--these are the conclusions of the Rand report--large amounts of class time on TAAS test preparation activities. Teachers in low-performing schools reported greater frequency of test preparation than did teachers in higher-performing schools. While this preparation may improve the TAAS scores, it may not help students develop necessary reading and math skills. Also, this could lead to a superficial appearance that the gap between minority and majority students is narrowing when no change has actually occurred. 
   The exclusion of students with disabilities increased in Texas while decreasing in the Nation. Texas also showed an increase over time in the percentage of students dropping out of school and being held back. These factors produce a gain in average test scores that overestimates actual improvement in student performance. 
   We understand now what is happening. Regarding those individuals with disabilities, students we have worked long and hard to make sure they are going to be a part of the student body and have the opportunities for educational advancement, if you can exclude some of them from test taking, as in Texas, plus most likely some of the poorer performing students have dropped out and won't be able to take any of those assessment tests, this is going to have an artificial inflator on test scores. 
   That is the Rand Corporation that is making that conclusion. 
   Also, Rand researchers hypothesize that a small but significant percentage of students may have topped out on the TAAS. In other words, some students may have scored as high as the TAAS would allow them to. If that happened, it would artificially narrow the gap on TAAS between white students and students of color because white students tend to earn higher scores than minority students. Thus, the reduced gap on the TAAS relative to NAEP may be a result of TAAS being too easy for some students. 
   As with other tests, there have been documented cases of cheating on the Texas TAAS test. 
   The NAEP is a national test, which students from around the country can take so States and communities--and parents, most importantly--are able to evaluate the differences between how their children are doing in school compared with how those in other parts of the State and other parts of the country are doing. According to the NAEP, Texas fourth graders were slightly more proficient in reading in 1998 than in 1994. However, the country as a whole also improved to the same degree. Thus, there was nothing remarkable about the reading score gains in Texas. Small improvements in Texas eighth grade math scores were also consistent with those observed nationally. 
   There is nothing remarkable about the NAEP scores in Texas, and students of color did not gain more than whites. Score increases in Texas are identical to those nationwide when using the NAEP data. However, the gains on TAAS were several times larger than they were on NAEP. 
   That is what we are hearing the good Governor talking about. That is what he is talking about. This puts it all in the light that that is not a true reflection of what is happening among the young people. The gains on TAAS were greater for students of color than they were for whites. The large discrepancy between the TAAS and the NAEP results raises concern about the validity of the TAAS scores and validity of claims regarding student achievement. 
   According to the NAEP results, the gap between white students and students of color in Texas is very large and also increasing slightly. 
   In 1998, the average fourth grade reading score for black students was at the 38th percentile compared to the average white student at the 67th percentile. This gap was slightly larger than the gap between these groups in 1994. In other words, the black-white reading gap increased during this 4-year period. The gap between the blacks and whites had actually increased during this period. 
   In fourth grade math, the white-Hispanic NAEP gap grew in Texas but not nationally, and the white-black gap remained constant in Texas but actually shrank nationally. In short, the gap sizes between the whites and minorities on the NAEP were improving nationally but getting worse in Texas. 
   That is not a satisfactory prescription for improving education. It suggests the Texas system is more an education mirage than an education miracle. I think it is important for parents--as they are looking now, trying to get beyond the cliches, beyond the slogans, beyond the set statements, beyond the give and take, even in those debates--to look at the record, and the record is very clear. That is that we have not seen the kind of advancement that has taken place in many other States that are doing a number of things that have been recommended, as we were going to have a chance to hear about in the debate on the ESEA. 
   We find out the States that made the greatest advancement are States that had smaller class sizes, where they had continuing enhancement and proficiency for teacher education, mentoring with teachers, afterschool programs, accountability. They had a number of those programs and even benefited from early education help and assistance as well. 
   What we wanted to try to do is to have a debate on those particular matters that have made a difference in States around the country, where we had seen advancements in education. But we have been denied that opportunity. What basically the leadership, the Republican leadership, has denied us is the opportunity to have that debate, denied us the opportunity to raise these issues. What the American people are being asked is, let's just look back on what has happened in Texas. 
   When we examine Texas, not out of partisanship, but using the objective standards for the SATs--they do not benefit a Democrat or Republican; they are focused on children--and if we take the Rand study which has been available and can be reviewed by anyone--we are finding out that this has been a mirage in terms of education. 
   I want to spend a few moments going into another area which I think the American people ought to give some focus and attention to in these final few days, and that is on the critical issue of the credibility gap in health care. Few, if any, issues are of greater concern to American families than quality, affordable health care. Americans want an end to the HMO abuses. They want good health insurance coverage, they want a prescription drug benefit for senior citizens under Medicare, and they want to preserve and strengthen Medicare so it will be there for today's and tomorrow's senior citizens. And they want these priorities not only for themselves and their loved ones but for every American, because they know that good health care should be a basic right for all. 
   The choice in this election year is clear. It is not just a choice between different programs. It is a choice based on who can be trusted to do the right thing for the American people. AL GORE's record is clear. He has been deeply involved in health care throughout his career. The current administration has made significant progress in improving health care in a variety of ways--from expanding health insurance to protecting Medicare. He has consistently stood for patients and against powerful special interests.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will lay out the facts--and if I can have the attention of the Senator from Texas now--I will lay these facts out, and if the Senator from Texas finds a problem with these facts, then I will be glad to yield for that purpose to listen to what the facts are. 
   These are what the facts are: George Bush said in the third debate that he did support a national Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   He said he wanted all people covered. 
   He said that he was in favor of a patient's right to sue as provided under Texas law. 
   He said he brought Republicans and Democrats together in the State of Texas to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what he said. 
   The reality is different. The Governor vetoed the first Patients' Bill of Rights passed in Texas. He fought to make the second bill as narrow and limited as possible. He was so opposed to the provision allowing patients to sue their HMOs that he refused to sign the final bill and allowed it to become law without his signature. That is not the record of a person who is candid about where he stands and what he has done. Those are the facts. 
   It is not a record that recommends him for national office for any citizen concerned about a strong, effective Patients' Bill of Rights. It is the record of a candidate who stands with powerful insurance companies and HMOs, not with American families. He was forced effectively to take a Patients' Bill of Rights. So when the Senator says, isn't it law today? yes, but it was required because of what happened in the legislature, not the leadership that was provided by the Governor on that issue. 
   On health insurance, the record is equally clear--and equally bleak. Governor Bush claims he wants insurance for all Americans. He blames Vice President GORE for the growth in the number of the uninsured. But Governor Bush's record in Texas is one of the worst in the country. Texas has the second highest proportion of uninsured Americans in the country. It has the second highest proportion of uninsured children in the country. Yet Governor Bush has not only done nothing to address this problem, he has actually fought against the solutions. 
   In Texas, he placed a higher priority on large new tax breaks for the oil industry, instead of good health care for children and 
   their families. When Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, we put affordable health insurance for children within the reach of every moderate and low-income working family. But George Bush's Texas was one of the last in the country to fully implement the law. 
   Do we understand that? Texas was one of the last States in the country to fully implement the law. Despite the serious health problems faced by children in Texas, Governor Bush actually fought to keep eligibility as narrow as possible. 
   This is what happened in 1994: The Governor takes office; Texas ranks 49th. The year 2000: Bush runs for President; Texas ranks 49th. 
   These are the facts. People might not like those facts. People might not want to talk about those facts, but these are the facts. If you have different facts, let's have them. 
   Texas: One of the last States to implement CHIP. October 1997, CHIP funds were available. November 1999, Texas implements the full CHIP program. We had a program where the funds were there. We did not have to appropriate the additional funds. Still it took 2 years. Children cannot wait 2 years when they are sick. They cannot wait when they have a sore throat, or cannot see the blackboard, or cannot see the teacher. They need help and assistance, and the fact it took 2 years, I think, is inexcusable. 
   Bush places a low priority on children. Bush fights to restrict CHIP eligibility to children below 150 percent of poverty. Most of the other States, a great majority of the other States, went to 200 percent of poverty. Maybe the Senator from Texas has an explanation for that. 
   Texas has been one of the only States that has been cited, not by the Senator from Massachusetts and not by Democrats, but by a Federal judge for failure to enroll children in Medicaid. That is the record, Mr. President. 
   You might not want to hear about it, but that is the record. 
   Now, perhaps the most ominous revelation about the Governor's attitude towards this issue came in the third debate when he said:  
   It's one thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.  
   Insurance a Washington term? Governor Bush should try telling that to hard-working families across the country who don't take their children to the doctor when they have a sore throat or a fever because they can't afford the medical bill. He should try telling that to the young family whose hopes for the future are wrecked when a breadwinner dies or is disabled because an illness was not diagnosed and treated in time. He should try telling that to the elderly couple whose hopes for a dignified retirement are swept away in a tidal wave of medical debt. 
   Insurance is far more than a Washington term. It is a Main Street term in every community in America, and its lack of availability is a crisis for millions of families across the country. 
   Prescription drug coverage under Medicare is another major aspect of the health care challenge facing America. Few issues are more important to  senior citizens and their families. They deserve a prescription drug benefit under Medicare. And we should try to provide it in a way that strengthens the promise of Medicare, not in a way that breaks that promise and breaks faith with the elderly. 
   The differences between Vice President GORE and Governor Bush on this issue are fundamental. Governor Bush stands with the big drug companies. The Vice President stands with the senior citizens. Governor Bush has sought at every turn to blur the differences between their two plans in a way that is so misleading as to make a mockery of his own attacks on the Vice President's credibility. 
   Vice President GORE has clearly pointed out the many flaws in Governor Bush's prescription drug plan for senior citizens. But Governor Bush has no response on the merits. Instead, he hides behind phrases like ``fuzzy numbers'' and ``scare tactics.'' 
   But the numbers are not fuzzy, and senior citizens should be concerned. Let's look at the facts. 
   Prescription drug coverage under the Bush plan is not immediate and most senior citizens would be left out. 
   As the Vice President has pointed out, for the first 4 years, the Bush plan would cover low-income seniors only. AL GORE cited the example of a senior citizen named George McKinney. He said:  
   George McKinney is 70 years old, has high blood pressure. His wife has heart trouble. They have an income of $25,000 a year. They cannot pay for their prescription drugs. And so they're some of the ones that go to Canada regularly in order to get their prescription drugs.  
   Governor Bush responded:  
   Under my plan, the man gets immediate help with prescription drugs. It's called immediate helping hand. Instead of squabbling and finger-pointing, he gets immediate help.  
   He kept accusing Vice President GORE of using ``fuzzy math'' and ``scare tactics.'' 
   But Governor Bush's own announcement of his Medicare plan proves AL GORE's point. This is what Governor Bush said:  
   For four years, during the transition to better Medicare coverage, we will provide $12 billion a year in direct aid to low income seniors ..... Every senior with an income less than $11,300-$15,200 for a couple--will have the entire cost of their prescription drugs covered. For seniors with incomes less than $14,600-$19,700 for couples--there will be a partial subsidy.  
   George McKinney has an income of $25,000. He would clearly be ineligible for help under Governor Bush's plan. If Governor Bush thinks that is fuzzy math, then education reform is even more urgent than any of us realized. 
   In the third debate, Governor Bush finally admitted that the 
   first phase of his program is only for ``poor seniors.'' 
   George McKinney is not alone. The vast majority of senior citizens would not qualify for Governor Bush's prescription drug plan, and many of those who did qualify would not participate. 
   Even this limited program for low-income seniors would not be immediate, because every State in the country would have to pass new laws and put the program in place, a process that would take years in many States. 
   George Bush's prescription for middle-income seniors is clear--take an aspirin and call your HMO in 4 years. 
   Governor Bush's prescription drug plan would also require senior citizens to go to an HMO or an insurance company to obtain their coverage. In the first debate, Vice President GORE pointed out that most senior citizens ``would not get one penny for four to five years, and then they would be forced to go into an HMO or an insurance company and ask them for coverage. But there would be no limit on the premiums or deductibles or any of the terms or conditions. 
   Again, Governor Bush did not respond to the Vice President's specific points. Instead, he claimed that the Vice President was trying to ``scare'' voters. 
   The facts are clear. George W. Bush's policy paper states that:  
   Each health insurer, including HCFA-sponsored plans that wish to participate ..... will have to offer an ``expanded'' benefit package, including out-patient prescription drugs. ..... This will give seniors the opportunity to select the plan that best fits their health needs.  
   In other words, to get prescription drug coverage under the Bush plan, you have to get it through a private insurance plan. How high will the copayments be? How high will the premiums be? How high will the deductible be? Governor Bush has no answer. Those important points are all left up to the private insurance companies. 
   Governor Bush says senior citizens will have the opportunity to select the plan that best meets their health needs. But what they will really have is the opportunity to select whatever plan private insurers choose to offer. If it costs too much, senior citizens are out of luck. If it does not cover the drugs their doctors prescribe, they are out of luck. The Bush plan is an insurance industry's dream, and a senior citizen's nightmare. 
   On prescription drugs, and every other aspect of Medicare, the choice between the two Presidential candidates is very clear, and it is clear on every other aspect of health care. The Bush record in Texas is one of indifference and ineptitude--of putting powerful interests ahead of ordinary families. 
   The Bush record in the campaign is one of distortion. The Bush proposals are at best inadequate and at worst harmful. Tax cuts for the wealthy are not as important as health care for children and prescription drugs for seniors. The American people understand that, but evidently Governor Bush does not.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleague, Senator HELMS, in expressing my strong support for this legislation to benefit international broadcasting employees. 
   The bill is important for several reasons. A new special immigrant visa class will be established to cover individuals working in the United States for the International Broadcasting Bureau or one of the grantee organizations affiliated with the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Included among the grantee organizations are the well-respected Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe. 
   In creating a special immigrant visa category, we are making a concerted effort to address the recruitment shortages plaguing these worthwhile broadcasting organizations. This legislation will help to attract qualified foreign employees for available positions with the international broadcasting industry here in the United States. 
   The mission of the United States with respect to international broadcasting makes it important for us to be able to attract and retain a large number of foreign language broadcasters. They must have a unique combination of journalistic skills, including fluency in various languages and an in-depth knowledge of the people, history and cultures of other nations. To carry out its mission, the Broadcasting Board of Governors and its grantees must employ a minimum of 3,400 broadcasters and support staff, such as reporters, writers, translators, editors, producers, announcers, and news analysts. 
   Historically, the Broadcasting Board of Governors has been unable to obtain sufficient numbers of U.S. workers with the rare combination of skills needed for this mission. As a result, we have had to look to other nations to attract the necessary talent. 
   No current visa category exists which properly suits the needs of the international broadcasting industry. Neither the H-1B nor J-1 non-immigrant visas are appropriate for the Broadcasting Board of Governors to use as a means to recruit foreign broadcasters and support personnel. Each of these categories has restrictions which make it difficult to recruit qualified applicants. 
   This legislation overcomes these problems by adding a special immigrant category under the Immigration and Nationality Act. Up to one hundred immigrant visas will be available each fiscal year for foreign nationals employed by the Broadcasting Board of Governors. Spouses and dependent children will also be able to benefit from this legislation. 
   This proposal will provide significant assistance for the international broadcasting industry in meeting its goals and recruitment needs in providing essential news coverage for many of the most dangerous regions of the world. The people employed by organizations  like Radio Free Asia, the Voice of America and Radio Free Europe are exceptionally talented and courageous. They and their families make substantial sacrifices, and they put themselves at great personal risk to carry out their important responsibilities. These dedicated men and women deserve our full support. I strongly urge my colleagues to pass this needed legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Tinker St. Clair, who is retiring at the end of this year after 21 years of outstanding service to the Senate as doorkeeper. 
   Tinker goes back many many years with the Kennedy family. In a sense, I inherited Tinker from my brothers. At the time of the 1960 Presidential campaign, Tinker was active in Democratic Party politics in McDowell County in the heart of coal country in West Virginia. Tinker supported Jack in the key West Virginia Presidential Primary that year, and he campaigned effectively for my brother throughout southern West Virginia. Jack won a dramatic victory in that primary, and it put him solidly on the road to the White House. So it's fair to say that the New Frontier was born right there in West Virginia, and Tinker St. Clair was very much a part of that victory. 
   Tinker was also there for my brother Robert Kennedy in his Presidential campaign in 1968. 
   For the past 21 years in the Senate, Tinker has been a great friend of mine as well, and a great friend of many other Senators on both sides of the aisle. 
   Day in and day out on the Senate floor, Tinker's welcoming smile and wonderful personality have warmed our hearts and minds. He is often here with us, sitting in the back of the Chamber, listening intently to our debates, offering an encouraging word when we arrive and when we finish speaking, reminiscing about past days in the Senate and past campaigns in West Virginia, telling us with pride about his children, his grandchildren, and in recent years, his great-grandchildren. 
   When Tinker leaves us this year, he will leave a place in our hearts that will be impossible to fill. But as he said the other day, he feels it is time, as the West Virginia mountaineer he's always been, to sit on the porch and enjoy his family. 
   As this session of Congress comes to an end, I express my warmest wishes to Tinker for a long and happy and healthy retirement. He has surely earned it. He has served West Virginia well, he has served the Senate well, and he has served the Nation well, and we will miss him very very much.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we are coming into the final hours, the final days of the Senate session, there are still a number of measures which  need focus and attention and priority. I welcome the leadership that is being provided now by the President and a number of our colleagues to try to make sure that before we leave town we try to remedy a situation that has developed since we passed the Balanced Budget Act in 1997. Included in that balanced budget effort were cuts that were directed to the health care providers. It was estimated at that particular time that the cuts would be about $100 billion. What we have found out over the last several years is that the projected cuts have been well over $200 billion. As a result, there have been unintended consequences that have developed. 
   It seems only fair that when we look at the steps that were taken in the past that resulted, and continue to result today, in some very dramatic adverse impacts to a number of different providers in our health care industry, that we remedy that situation. It is particularly important to remedy their situation when we have the fortuitous economic situation in terms of the surplus that we are faced with. 
   I doubt very much--in fact, I am quite sure--that if we had known in 1997 the actual impact the projected cuts were going to have on health care providers, that those particular provisions of the Balanced Budget Act would have been successful. I am sure they would not have been successful. I certainly would not have voted for those provisions. 
   But I welcome the opportunity to join with a number of our colleagues to try to remedy the situation. It is the responsible thing to do. It is absolutely necessary. It is not only affecting many of our excellent health care providers in our urban areas, but it also reaches out to many rural communities. 
   We have had an excellent presentation from our friends as to what these cuts have meant for rural health care and rural health care providers. Let me mention, for a few moments, what is happening to some of the different health care providers now. 
   We are very fortunate in Massachusetts to have some of the best teaching hospitals in the world. These teaching hospitals are the backbone of our quality health care system in America and the world. 
   We are facing many challenges in our health care system. The most obvious one today is a Medicare prescription drug benefit. That is the challenge that comes first to the minds of people when we talk about health care needs and needed changes in our Medicare system. That is a very legitimate challenge. We think of our Patients' Bill of Rights. Many of us deplore the fact that we have not addressed these issues in the Senate. 
   It is irresponsible that we have not taken action on a Patients' Bill of Rights. Although we have a majority of the Members of the House and a majority of the Members of the Senate in favor of a strong Patients' Bill of Rights, still we are denied the opportunity of addressing the issue. We know that every day we fail to do so, there are tens of thousands of Americans who are suffering as a result. 
   We are unable to free ourselves from the power of the HMO industry to successfully pass legislation that would allow doctors to make health care decisions, unfettered by the decisions of bean counters from the HMOs who are more interested in profits than in the health of individuals. That is certainly one very important issue. I think we fail in this Congress by the fact that we have not addressed it. 
   I am constantly amazed as I travel around my State, and the States of Pennsylvania and New York and a few other places where there are candidates running for Congress. One of the first pieces of legislation they say they support is a Patients' Bill of Rights, which obviously has nothing to do with the strong Patients' Bill of Rights that has been supported by more than 300 health providers representing women and children and the disabled, cancer research groups, the doctors, the nurses, the medical professionals. That is one issue. The second, as I mentioned, is a prescription drug benefit. 
   We also are now focusing on teaching hospitals. These are the hospitals that provide the training and teaching for our future medical professionals including doctors, some of the applied health professionals, and advanced practice nurses. We have the best teaching hospitals in the world. We ought to keep them healthy, not endanger them. By not providing a healthy and robust provision in legislation in these final 2 days, we risk endangering our teaching hospitals. 
   What do these teaching hospitals do? No. 1, they provide the best teaching. Secondly, they provide about 30 percent of the indigent care in our country, primarily--obviously--in the communities in which they serve. They play a very important role in providing health care to those who have no health insurance. Third, they are also the places that are developing the new technologies and techniques used in treating some of the most complicated cases. From there the research disseminates; other hospitals and other health care delivery centers benefit from the research done at teaching hospitals. 
   These teaching hospitals are really the jewels of our health care system, and we cannot put them at risk. And they are at risk. The proposal that is being advanced by the Republicans is basically a nice blank check to the HMOs, the industry that is leading the fight against the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yet there is no guarantee that they will continue to provide health care to people in our society or to Medicare recipients. More than 900,000 Medicare recipients will be dropped from HMOs next year. Yet we find the Republicans shoveling billions of dollars into HMO coffers without any assurance that they will use those resources to look after the elderly. The Republicans are shoveling the funds into HMOs rather than investing in a prescription drug program for our seniors. 
   We know we have the teaching hospitals on the one hand. Next we have the community hospitals. The community hospitals are the backbone of health care delivery in our communities. They are the primary health delivery provider in communities all across this country. They have an irreplaceable position. They are exceedingly hard pressed and stressed in being able to perform this function. They need some relief. Any legislation ought to have provisions in it to help provide needed assistance to community hospitals. 
   Then there is the home health care system--the visiting nurses, home health care agencies. We have seen a significant 
   decline in home health care agencies and home health care services generally. At a time when our senior population is going to double over the next 20-25 years, we are seeing a significant decline in home health care services, which makes absolutely no sense. We end up finding out that if patients aren't going to be able to receive home health care services, they will have to go into the more costly hospitals and nursing homes. It makes no sense from a health standpoint, and it certainly makes no sense from a humane standpoint. 
   Our nursing homes are facing bankruptcy in increasing numbers. We have seen scores of bankruptcies of nursing homes in my own State of Massachusetts. The number of nursing homes going bankrupt is increasing every single day. They are in desperate straits. Not only are they in desperate straits, but other health care providers, such as the hospice program that provides such important help and assistance to those who have terminal illnesses, are in desperate straits as well. 
   It isn't just those of us who have these facilities in our States. We have heard eloquent statements from those who come from rural areas. We want to work with them as well. We are not trying to rob Peter to pay Paul. We ought to have something that is going to address the needs of rural areas, and we welcome the opportunity to work with our colleagues. 
   Under the leadership of Senator DASCHLE and Senator REID, Senator MOYNIHAN on the Finance Committee, Senator BAUCUS, and others, an excellent program has been developed from our side. We want to try to make sure that that is going to be considered. We don't want to be shut out of the process, as we are shut out of a lot of issues here. 
   We have heard a good deal of debate about desiring bipartisanship. Well, for a good part of the time I have been in the Senate, when we had these kinds of matters that needed to be discussed or debated, we had Republican and Democratic leaders working these matters  out with the Administration. But we are finding out that this apparently is a solo flight by our Republican friends, to the great disadvantage of our health care system. That makes no sense. 
   The President has indicated he would veto this early proposal that has been put forward by the Republicans as a nonstarter. I certainly would defend that position and welcome the opportunity to discuss it or debate it, whatever will be necessary, because their proposal just does not do the job. It is one of the key remaining issues we have as we come to the end of this session. 
   Finally, I do hope we will be able to have included in the final wrap-up in our balanced budget refinement the Grassley-Kennedy bill that helps parents of children who have disabilities. Last year, in a bipartisan effort, we developed legislation that permitted those individuals who were disabled to go into the labor market and not lose their health insurance. We had a good debate on it. We passed it. Now we find people saying, Why did it take you so long? What is happening is these individuals are moving towards greater independence and self-reliance. They are becoming taxpayers and paying into the public system rather than just drawing from it. It has taken a good deal of time to achieve, but it has been enormously important. 
   What we are saying now, Senator GRASSLEY and I--and I pay tribute to Senator GRASSLEY for the hard work he has done on this in the Finance Committee--is help parents who have children with severe disabilities. So many parents have children who have severe disabilities. The parents are unable to take any increase or any enhancement of their own pay because if they do, they will no longer qualify for Medicaid. And if they no longer qualify for Medicaid, they lose the health care they get for their children under Medicaid, and they can't afford the health care bills. These parents have to refuse pay increases and advancement to remain below the income levels for Medicaid coverage. Of course, this not only does an enormous disservice to that individual but also to the other members of the family. 
   Many of these children with severe disabilities have brothers and sisters, yet the parent still has to work at a wage below the Medicaid level in order to qualify for health coverage of their children. It makes no sense. It is wrong. We have legislation that will address it, and we hope that will be considered. 
   We say once again that the proposal our Republican friends are putting forth is a nonstarter, because we know what they are trying to do; that is, to give a great bundle of cash--so to speak a blank check--to the HMOs that have been resisting our ability to take actions to protect American patients. It makes no sense. It is unfair, and it is fundamentally wrong. 
   We are going to do everything we can to try to fashion a proposal that is balanced, fair, and that really meets the health care needs of our people.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Tuesday night the American people witnessed the third and final Presidential debate between Vice President AL GORE and Governor Bush. 
   We are now less than 3 weeks away from the election. As the debate demonstrated, the choices for the American people could not be clearer. 
   Are we going to continue the economic prosperity of the past 8 years? Or are we going to waste it on excessive tax breaks for the wealthiest one percent of Americans? 
   I remember in 1981 when the economic program of then President Reagan came to the Congress. It had the same kind of rhetoric around it. We are going to cut all of the taxes and increase defense spending and balance the budget, all at the same time. During that period of time, only a handful of us voted against it. It was so clear and obvious at that time that we were going to move into large deficits, which we eventually did--deficits in the hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   I am always amused to hear from others who say it really wasn't the establishment of economic policies; it was just the American energy. If it had been the American energy, why wasn't it the American energy when we were running up deficits? It is quite clear that you had two entirely different economic policies that were being followed. One was a disaster. 
   I am always interested in the fact that it was President Bush who called Ronald Reagan's proposal ``voodoo economics.'' 
   Now we are coming right on back again to that similar kind of proposal of excessive tax breaks for wealthy individuals. That is the heart and soul of the Bush proposal, although it was difficult to quite understand what it was following the debate the other evening. 
   Are we going to continue to have balanced Federal budgets? Or are we going to return to the bad old days of trickle-down economics that created the biggest deficits in our history? 
   And perhaps most importantly--are we going to stand with working families to make the critical investments in education and health care that are needed to help children, help parents, help working men and women, and help senior citizens in their retirement years? 
   These issues are critical not only for the Presidential race but in Congress as well. 
   Governor Bush and the Republicans like to talk education and health care. But look what has happened in this Congress. For the first time in 35 years, they have not reauthorized the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. They are 3 weeks late in providing the needed funds for the Nation's public schools. 
   The time has expired. The new fiscal year is here. Yet we haven't done our business. We always leave the appropriations bill which funds the schools in this country for last. 
   It is always interesting to me to hear and watch these promises that are made by the Republican leadership on education. 
   On January 6, 1999, Senator LOTT said:  
   Education is going to be the central issue this year....... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   On January 29, 1999, he said:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to just be words.  
   On June 22, 1999 the Majority Leader stated:  
   Education is Number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress.  
   On February 1, 2000 he said:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been majority leader....... And Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   On February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act..... Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   On May 1,2000:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   Why don't you bring up the appropriations to fund education? Why is it 3 weeks late? Why is it the last appropriations bill? Why is it that we didn't reauthorize it? Don't come and tell American families that education is number one in your priorities when for the first time in 35 years we don't have a reauthorization. 
   What is the Republican leadership going to do? They are calling the bankruptcy bill back up--the bankruptcy bill. We had 14 days and 55 amendments on that bill. But that isn't enough. They are going to call that up later on for a vote this afternoon. They are going to try to jam that bill, which benefits a small group of credit card companies, rather than deal with the education of American families. That is their priority. Any American family can understand that. 
   We are here. We are prepared to deal with the education program. Oh, no. We can't do that. We are going to go back to bankruptcy which is so important. Important for whom? Important for the credit card companies. Just as in their patients' bill of rights, they have not been able to quote a single health organization in the country that supports them because it is fraudulent. Every health group in the country supports the proposal that was passed by a bipartisan majority in the House of Representatives, and that was supported by the Democrats and a few Republicans in the Senate. Every health organization--over 300 of them. 
   Now we have the industry itself saying no, no--the HMOs saying don't pass the good bill, because we don't want it. Now what happens? The credit card industry says they want this bill. And  what happens? The Republican leadership is trying to jam that right down here. What has happened to education in between? Not only are we not reauthorizing it, but we are not funding it. It is 3 weeks late already. 
   What happened to children in this country? If they hand their homework in 3 weeks late, they would be in the principal's office. They would be getting some kind of discipline in any school in the country. But, nonetheless, we are 3 weeks late. We haven't reauthorized it, and the appropriations have not been finished. 
   I hope our friends on the other side are going to ease off when they talk about how committed their party is on education. I hope they are going to at least have the decency not to try to say: Oh, yes. We are really interested in education--we really do care about it. 
   I was here when one of the first things the Republican leadership did in 1995 was to rescind some $1.7 billion that had been appropriated--the greatest rescission on any single bill that I can remember in my service in 38 years. On what subject? Education. Who offered it? Republicans. How many supported it? Virtually the whole Republican Party. 
   I was here a few years later after we were able to dull some of those rescissions when they came back and tried to abolish the Department of Education. Who offered it? Republicans. Who supported it? The Republican Party. Who opposed it? We did. Not just because it is an agency, but because many of us believe that any President ought to have in the Cabinet office someone talking about education every time that Cabinet meets. 
   That is why we need a Department of Education. We have a department for housing. We have a department for the interior lands of this country. Many believe we ought to have a department for education. Not the Republicans. No, they wanted to abolish it. 
   We have the rescinding of education funding. We have proposals to abolish the Department of Education. We have the refusal to authorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and we have the denying of funding of the existing law--3 weeks late. That happens to be the record. 
   Now, we watched the other night the Republican candidate for office talking about how concerned they were. I wish he had called up our majority leader and said: Look, I am interested in education; why don't you take that up? 
   Let's take up our proposals. We know what they are. We are prepared to vote on them. We are prepared to take those to the American people. Why isn't the other side prepared to do it? What are they so frightened of? What are they so scared of? 
   All we have is silence. We have this empty Chamber where all of these other deals are going on--All these other deals that are not on education. They are on how we can try and get bankruptcy that will basically undermine families who in many instances are hard pressed, mothers who have not been able to get their alimony or child support and are going into bankruptcy. Half the bankruptcies are a result of health care costs for older workers. We cannot wait in order to draw out the last few dollars from those individuals for the credit card companies and shuffle aside education. That is what is happening. The American people ought to begin to understand it. 
   The Republican leadership keeps on saying how important education is. On July 10, 2000 the majority leader said:  
   I, too, would very much like to see us complete the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... I feel strongly about getting it done....... We can work day and night for the next 3 weeks.  
   On July 25, 2000 he said:  
   We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it completed.  
   Mr. President, SAT scores are the highest in 30 years. They have not moved up greatly, but they are going in the right direction for males and females. Of course, it isn't going in the right direction in the State of Texas. Texas falls below the national average on SAT scores between 1997-2000. The national scores are going up a little bit in the right direction. Texas is going along in the wrong direction for SAT scores. 
   We have heard a great deal about what happened to the children in the State of Texas, being 48th of 50 for the number of children that are covered by health insurance. The other night, Governor Bush was talking about what a high priority they put on education and what they have done on education. 
   This tells the story. These are the SAT scores, standard scores. This reflects the national average moving up over the last 3 years, while Texas has been moving down the last 3 years. We don't have any explanation. I know the Vice President didn't want to appear negative, but the fact is, I don't think drawing out what the records are should be considered negative. These are the facts. The American people ought to be able to understand them. The national average has gone up; in Texas the scores have gone down. 
   I was here 30 years before we ever had a vote on education. We had Democratic chairs and Republican chairs. We had Senator Stafford, the education chairman of our committee; Senator Pell was the chairman. During that period of time, education was never a partisan issue. The American people don't want it to be partisan. But it is now. It is when you refuse to let us debate it and abide by the outcome. That is wrong. We ought to fund the education for the children in this country. The Republican leadership has not done it. We ought to be dealing with the education reauthorization prior to bankruptcy and other priorities, and the Republican leadership refuses to do it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to, first of all, thank my friend and colleague, the Senator from Minnesota, for his very eloquent statement, and most of all for all of his good work in protecting working families in this country on this extremely important piece of legislation. 
   I, too, am troubled, as I mentioned earlier today, by the fact that with all the unfinished business we have in the Senate that now with the final hours coming up next week, we are being asked to have an abbreviated debate and discussion on the whole issue of bankruptcy without the opportunity for amendments. Effectively, we are being asked to take it or leave it on legislation which is going to affect millions of our fellow citizens. 
   I had wished that we had scheduled other legislation, as I mentioned earlier today. I wish we were willing to come on back to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act or in terms of a Patients' Bill of Rights or a prescription drug program for our seniors in our country. 
   As someone who has been traveling around my own State, this is what I hear from families all over Massachusetts: Why isn't the Senate doing its business? Why didn't it do its business reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act? This is the first time in 34 years that it has not done so. Why is it 3 weeks late in terms of appropriating funding for education, of which we hear a great deal in the Presidential debates? And in the Congress,  aren't we somehow sensitive to what our leaders are saying in the Republican and Democratic parties about the importance of education? Here we are now 3 weeks late, and the last appropriation, evidently, is going to be the education one. That is not the way that we think we ought to be doing business. 
   So we find ourselves coming back to this issue--or will next week--on the question of whether we are going to accept bankruptcy legislation. 
   I want to make a few points at the outset of my remarks: some proponents of this legislation argue that all the outstanding concerns about the bill have been resolved and that the problems have been fixed. That is simply untrue. It is a myth that women and children are protected under the provisions of this bill. 
   Over 30 organizations that advocate for women and children wrote us and said that by increasing the rights of many creditors--including credit card companies, finance companies, auto lenders, and others--the bill would set up a competition for scarce resources between parents and children owed child support, and commercial creditors, both during and after bankruptcy. Contrary to the claims of some, the domestic support provisions included in the bill would not solve these problems. 
   I have here a list of advocates for women and children who are opposed to this bill. I listened recently, a few hours ago, to a very impassioned statement by one of my colleagues about how the women and children were being protected. Here is a list--and I will include the list in the Record--of groups that, for the life of their years, have been advocates for children and women. These groups say that provisions in the conference committee report are going to put children and women at serious risk and that the proposed bankruptcy law will do a significant disservice to their rights. This is not only what these various groups have said, but this is also the conclusion of the 82 bankruptcy scholars I have listed that I will include in the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I will just read at this time this particular paragraph of the letter:  
   Last year, numerous Senators, Administration officials, and bankruptcy experts expressed concern that certain elements of bankruptcy reform may increase the hurdles for financially troubled women and children to collect support payments and gain financial stability. Since then, a set of domestic support provisions has been added to the bill. Those provisions may be helpful to state support enforcement agencies and, in some instances, to women and children trying to collect support. However, those provisions are not at all responsive to the concerns originally identified. A close look suggests that these concerns persist: 
   Women and children as creditors will have to compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy.  
   There it is: ``Women and children as creditors will have to compete with powerful creditors to collect their claims after bankruptcy''--period. 
   Who do you think is going to win? The powerful creditors or the women and the children? The women who might be out there trying to collect alimony, or the mothers who, as a result of a separation or divorce, are trying to get child support, or the creditors who are represented by powerful financial interests and a whole battery of lawyers? Who do we think is going to win? 
   Those who have studied the bankruptcy laws--without being Republican or Democrat--have all stated their belief that creditors are going to win. As a result, the women and children are going to be put at risk. So we are going to hear a great deal about how this legislation protects women and children. It does not. It does not. And we will welcome the opportunity to engage in that debate as this process moves along. 
   A second point that is mentioned in this letter--I will again just read a portion of it:  
   Giving ``first priority'' to domestic support obligations does not address the problem. 
   Arguing that the bill now favors the claims--  
   This is an additional reference to the point about women and children--  
   Arguing that the bill now favors the claims of women and children, proponents of this reform effort emphasize that the bill gives ``first priority'' to domestic support obligations. In practice, this change in priority is not responsive to the major problems for women and children in the bill. Why is this so? 
   Changing the priority in distribution during bankruptcy will make a difference to women and children in less than 1 percent of the cases, and could actually result in reduced payments in some instances.  
   Second:  
   The priority provision does not affect priority or collection rights after the bankruptcy case is over. Collecting after bankruptcy--not during bankruptcy--is often the significant issue for support recipients.  
   Here it is. They know how to work the language. The credit card companies know how to work the language to give the facade that they are protecting the women and children, but they are not. They are putting them at greater risk. 
   Why, with all the things that need to be done in this country at this time, we are trying to stampede the Senate into legislation that is going to put women and children at greater risk when they are facing hardships in their lives, is beyond my comprehension in one respect, but it is very understandable in another respect; and that is because of the same reasons that we are not getting a Patients' Bill of Rights up before us, because of the power of the HMOs and the HMO industry that are daily putting at risk the well-being and the health of American patients all across this country. 
   Even though there is a bipartisan majority in the House and in the Senate, the Republican leadership is refusing to bring that bill up for a vote. At the same time, they are developing what they are calling balanced budget legislation to try to give allegedly a restoration of some funding to assist some providers because of the cuts that were made at the time of the balanced budget amendment a few years ago, which took a great deal more out of those providers than ever was intended. It is generally agreed that we would restore some of those funds. Who has the priority under the Republicans? The HMOs. They want to give them the money whether they agree to continue to provide the health care or not to our Medicare beneficiaries. They just dropped close to a million of them last year, and they are here with their hands out to get another payoff. 
   Well, we should ask, why have we gotten this legislation? It is quite clearly because of the credit card companies that have been willing to make those contributions as well. Let the contributions fall where they may, whether they include the Democrats or the Republicans. There is no question the Republican leadership has put us in the position of bringing this proposal up in the final hours of the Congress. 
   Proponents also argue that the bill provides relief to small businesses which are filing for bankruptcy, but the legislation in many ways makes it more difficult for small businesses to reorganize. The effect is, more and more small businesses will fail and thousands of American workers will lose their jobs. That is the reason the various organizations that represent workers are strongly opposed to it. We heard from one of our colleagues that this is going to make it a great deal easier for small businesses. Why then are organizations that are representing these workers coming out so strongly in opposition? They understand that the provisions of the small business proposal impose more onerous and costly requirements on small businesses than they do on big businesses. 
   The bill requires that small business debtors comply with a host of new bureaucratic filing requirements and periodic reports. Large businesses are not subject to these requirements. Senior management of small business debtors must attend a variety of meetings at the U.S. trustee's discretion. Senior management of large businesses do not. Under this bill, small business debtors are subject to an extra layer of scrutiny by the U.S. trustee who must assess whether the debtor lacks business viability and should be dismissed out of bankruptcy. Large business debtors are not. Small business debtors are subject to repeated filing restrictions. Large business debtors are not. 
   I am not suggesting that large businesses should be subject to all of these provisions. I am suggesting, however, that these provisions should be reconsidered.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will have more to say about this. I think it is very important to understand that traditionally when we get legislation, we ask who are the beneficiaries and who will pay the price for the legislation. We balance those various factors. 
   Quite frankly, when we look at this legislation, the people who will bear the hardship for the fact that there is some abuse in the bankruptcy laws--that we could all agree need attention and need to be addressed--are the most vulnerable in our society and are paying an extremely unfair price. That is absolutely wrong. We are going to have a good opportunity to address that in the debate to come. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Internet is transforming all aspects of our society, including health care. Web-based businesses, such as Internet pharmacies, can offer convenience and an opportunity for privacy for large numbers of consumers buying online. The Internet also creates opportunities, however, for scam artists and unprincipled suppliers to market contaminated, expired, ineffective, or counterfeit medications to unsuspecting patients. Today, these bad actors can easily prey on patients who turn to the Internet for easy access or low-priced medications. 
   Clearly, effective oversight is needed to protect consumers using the Internet and root out illegal operators without interfering with legitimate Internet commerce. Americans are entitled to the same protections on the Internet that they enjoy in other commercial settings. 
   So far, existing Federal and State laws have had only limited success in protecting consumers from unlawful Internet sellers of prescription medications. 
   Today, some physicians issue prescriptions for patients they have never seen, let alone seriously examined. Patients can purchase prescription drugs on the Internet without adequate safeguards that the drugs are appropriate and of high quality. Because web sites can be easily created and designed, patients may think they have purchased their medications from a U.S.-licensed pharmacy when, in fact, they have not. The prescription drugs they receive may be sold out of someone's garage or from a country with few, if any, standards for manufacturing, storing or shipping these products. 
   Several states and Federal agencies have taken enforcement actions against unlawful Internet sellers, but with limited results. While the number of legitimate Internet pharmacies remains small, the number of illegal sellers continues to grow. We must do more to protect patients when they buy prescription drugs online. Patients should have the same protections when purchasing their medications over the Internet as when buying from a ``bricks-and-mortar'' pharmacy. 
   At a hearing on Internet pharmacies by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in March, state and Federal regulators asked the Committee for additional enforcement tools to combat illegal sales of prescription drugs over the Internet. The National Association of Attorneys General called for Federal legislation to require Internet entities that sell prescription medications to disclose information about their businesses, and to give the states the authority to stop illegal sales nationwide, rather than only within their own borders. At a hearing by the House Commerce Committee in May, the Department of Justice asked for authority to freeze domestic assets of illegal foreign web sites. 
   The Internet Prescription Drug Consumer Protection Act of 2000, which Senators JEFFORDS, DODD, and I are introducing today, gives these needed tools to federal and state law enforcement officials to protect the public from those who sell prescription drugs illegally on the Internet. A companion bill is being introduced by Congressmen BLILEY, KLINK, and UPTON in the House, and I commend Congressman KLINK in particular for his leadership and guidance on this issue. 
   Today's consumer protection laws were enacted before the development of the Internet. This legislation will fill the gaps in current law that permit these illegal sellers to evade prosecution. The bill is supported by the National Association of Attorneys General, the American Pharmaceutical Association, the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists, drugstore.com, and the National Consumers League. 
   Our legislation recognizes that states need additional enforcement tools to  take effective action against unlawful domestic Internet sellers, and Federal agencies need additional enforcement tools to take effective action against illegal foreign sellers. 
   First, the Act requires Internet sellers of prescription drugs to disclose on their web sites and to the appropriate state licensing board their street address, telephone number, and states where they are licensed to sell their products. Consumers have a right to know with whom they are dealing on the Internet, just as they do when they walk into their local pharmacy. 
   Second, the bill authorizes a state to go to federal court to obtain a nationwide injunction against an unlawful Internet seller. Currently, a state can stop an illegal web site operator from selling drugs to citizens in its state, but the illegal operator is free to sell in the other 49 states. For many illegal sellers, the risk of a state injunction is merely a cost of doing business. Under this legislation, illegal sellers will be out of business altogether. 
   The Federal Government has little authority to bring criminals in other countries to justice. However, it can freeze the U.S. assets of foreign sellers if given the proper authority. This legislation gives the Department of Justice the ability to stop illegal foreign operators from collecting payments from U.S. customers. If they can't turn a profit, they'll stop selling. 
   As electronic commerce evolves, cooperative multinational efforts will be needed to assure adequate protections for consumers. Our proposal lays the foundation to achieve this goal. It requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to make recommendations to Congress for coordinating activities of the federal government with those of other countries to curb illegal Internet sales from abroad. 
   Consumers also have an important role to play. Informed purchasers are well prepared to avoid illegal web sites. This legislation requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to educate the public about the potential dangers of buying medications online and about effective public and private sector consumer protections. 
   This legislation is an important step toward making medications online a safe purchase for consumers. I look forward to working with my colleagues to expedite its passage.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first, I would like to say that the attack on the U.S.S. Cole is a tragedy for the nation. My thoughts are with the families and loved ones of the sailors who lost their lives, and I pray for the full recovery of those who were injured. I also urge an immediate investigation of  this brutal terrorist act against our country in order to identify the terrorists and their backers and bring them to justice as soon as possible. 
   I support the conference report to the Fiscal Year 2001 Defense Authorization Bill. It represents major progress in our commitment to defending our country and caring for the dedicated men and women who serve so well in our armed forces. 
   I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their skillful work in producing this consensus and bipartisan conference report. We have made worthwhile progress on many important issues affecting our armed forces. 
   The nation owes a special debt to the men and women of the armed forces for their unwavering commitment to our country and their excellent performance in the challenges they faced in this past year. They stand in harm's way. They have helped end the aggression in Kosovo, enforced the peace in Iraq, and helped provide the foundation for a free and independent nation in East Timor. 
   The contributions of our armed forces in those conflicts captured headlines, but it is important to recognize that our service members are preparing for and responding to a variety of contingencies. From defending the United States and our allies to participating in peacekeeping missions, to conducting counter-drug operations, to providing humanitarian assistance, the members of our armed forces today are prepared to carry out a wide range of duties in an efficient and professional manner. 
   This conference report includes a number of important provisions that demonstrate the commitment by Congress to improving the quality of life of those serving our country today as well as those who have completed their service in the past. For those currently serving, the conference report includes a 3.7 percent pay raise, a full half-percent above the rate of inflation. 
   Our commitment is not only to the soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who defend our country but also to their families. The conference report authorizes the construction of new housing for 2,900 families. For families who live off-base, we have taken steps to meet our goal of reducing out-of-pocket housing expenses to zero within five years. 
   The conference report helps to make the armed forces a more attractive career by implementing a program to allow active and reserve service members to enroll in the Thrift Savings Program, encouraging them to plan and save for their retirement. 
   One of the most important accomplishments in this legislation is a prescription drug benefit for military retirees, their spouses and widows. It is a long overdue step toward making good on the Nation's promise to provide career personnel with lifetime health benefits. And we intend to continue the on-going effort to provide all retirees with affordable, comprehensive prescription drug coverage through Medicare. 
   When we first considered the DOD authorization bill earlier this year, Senator SNOWE and I drafted a proposal to create a comprehensive drug benefit. We worked closely with Chairman WARNER and others to make coverage of prescription drugs a priority in this legislation. I am pleased that our legislation prevailed and was expanded in the conference. It is now clear to all that Congress has heard and heeded the needs of our military retirees, and addressed their number one priority--the cost of prescription drugs. 
   As a result of our efforts, nearly 1.4 million Medicare-eligible military retirees and their spouses and widows--including more than 21,500 in Massachusetts--will have access to affordable prescription drugs, effective upon enactment. 
   Under this legislation, military retirees will receive a retail and mail-order pharmacy benefit. Almost one-third of them--450,000--already have this benefit under the base closing agreement. The bill provides a 90-day supply of prescription drugs by mail for an $8 co-payment, or a 30-day supply of prescription drugs from a retail pharmacy for a 20 percent co-payment. There are no deductibles, and no additional premiums. Military retirees and their spouses and widows will receive the prescription drugs that their doctors prescribe. It is a generous benefit for those who have given so generously to the country during their working years. 
   The legislation also assures comprehensive Medicare supplemental coverage through TRICARE. Together, these new benefits assure health security in retirement for those who have served in the armed forces. 
   These benefits send a strong message to all men and women in uniform that we care about their service. It lets military retirees know that Congress listens, cares, and will act on their behalf. 
   Despite success here today for military retirees, we must not forget the millions of other senior citizens who need help with prescription drugs, too. 
   It's long past time for Congress to mend the broken promise of Medicare. Medicare is a compact between the government and America's senior and disabled citizens. It says work hard and pay in during your working years, and you will receive health coverage in your retirement years. But every day that promise is broken, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. It is time for Congress to make good on that promise, too. 
   When Medicare was enacted in 1965, only three percent of private insurance policies offered prescription drug coverage. Today, virtually all private health insurance policies provide prescription drug coverage. 
   Up to 20 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries--one-half of the total--have no prescription drug coverage throughout the year. Almost 14 million have never had drug coverage. 
   Those who have coverage find that too often it is unreliable, inadequate or unaffordable. In fact, the only senior citizens who have stable, secure, affordable drug coverage today are the very poor, who are on Medicaid. The idea that only the impoverished elderly should qualify for needed hospital and doctor care was rejected when Medicare was enacted. 
   Governor Bush and Congressional Republicans say they want to subsidize prescription drugs for the poor. But senior citizens deserve Medicare, not welfare. 
   Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. 
   Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes--or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to Medicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or cannot afford to take them correctly. 
   Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for a host of dread diseases. In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion in research on new medicines and to bring them to the public. Congress is well on its way to doubling the budget for the National Institutes of Health. The miracle drugs developed by these public and private sectors investments save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. But millions of Medicare beneficiaries are left out and left behind from the benefits of 21st century medicine because they cannot afford the price of admission. 
   Elderly Americans need and deserve prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their children and grandchildren. It is time to make the needs of all seniors a priority as well. 
   As a party, Republicans have always disliked Medicare. It was one of the first votes I cast when I came to the Senate, and it's still one of the best votes I've ever cast. 
   Senator Bob Dole, however, once boasted that he voted against Medicare's enactment, and never liked it. According to historian Robert Dallek, Ronald Reagan saw Medicare as the advance wave of socialism that would ``invade every area of freedom in this country.'' House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY has said that it's a program he would ``have no part of in a free world.'' Newt Gingrich wanted Medicare to ``wither on the vine'' in the GOP effort he led to privatize Medicare and reduce its funding in order to pay for tax breaks for the rich. 
   In contrast, under the leadership of the Clinton-Gore Administration,  Medicare's financial outlook is the healthiest it has ever been. According to the most recent Trustee's Report, the Medicare Trust Fund will remain solvent for the next quarter century. 
   Democrats want a universal, voluntary prescription drug benefit under Medicare. All beneficiaries would be eligible for affordable coverage within one year of enactment. In contrast, George Bush passes the buck to the states and private insurance companies. His flawed two-part program would force seniors to wait too long and do too little for too few. 
   Phase One of the Bush plan would be a state block grant program similar to one of the proposals by Senator ROTH. Eligibility is limited to senior citizens whose incomes are below $14,600--which leaves 70 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries with no coverage. Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. They have spent their working years building our country, and they should not have to beg for prescription drugs in their golden years. 
   It would take years to implement the Bush block grant program. Last February, the National Governors Association unanimously rejected this approach in a resolution that said, ``If Congress decides to expand prescription drug coverage to seniors, it should not shift that responsibility ..... to the states.'' States should not be asked to pick up the slack for Congress' failure to fill Medicare's biggest gap. 
   Phase Two of the Bush plan picks up where Newt Gingrich left off. Under the guise of Medicare ``reform,'' the Bush proposal relies on private insurance companies to 
   provide Medicare benefits. Prescription drug coverage under phase two would not start until 2004. It is contingent on passage by Congress of broad Medicare changes that would create a ``premium support'' program, which would eliminate the government's obligation to contribute 75 percent of the premium for individuals enrolling in Medicare. A similar plan was estimated to raise premiums for the elderly in traditional Medicare by up to 47 percent in the first year. Bush claims that the elderly could keep their current Medicare, but many would be forced to join HMOs, because conventional Medicare would quickly become unaffordable. The Bush plan will turn many senior citizens over to the tender mercy of the private insurance industry, and force them to give up their doctors and join HMOs to have access to an affordable drug benefit. 
   In addition, under Governor Bush's plan, the government would subsidize only 25 percent of an undetermined premium that could vary drastically from state to state. Never in the history of Medicare have senior citizens been asked to pay such a high proportion of the cost of any benefit. According to CBO estimates for a similar plan, the Bush proposal costs so much and provides so little that it is unlikely to help even half of the senior citizens who are currently without drug coverage. 
   The ongoing revolution in health care makes prescription drug coverage more essential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare is as essential today as was coverage of hospital and doctor care in 1965, when Medicare was enacted. Senior citizens need that help--and they need it now. 
   So I say to my colleagues--while we are making good on broken promises, it's long past time to cover prescription drugs under Medicare for all elderly Americans. If we can cover military retirees, we can cover other senior citizens too. 
   Another major achievement in this bill is the inclusion of the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act, a gratifying breakthrough for basic fairness. These workers deserve this compensation, and it is decades overdue. 
   As we now know, the nuclear build-up in the Cold War years exposed many hard-working, patriotic employees in the nation's defense plants to dangerous radioactive and chemical materials at far greater levels than employers were willing to admit. Many of these workers now suffer from debilitating and fatal illnesses directly related to that exposure. For too long, the government shamefully ignored the plight of these workers and failed to accept responsibility for it. 
   I commend Secretary of Energy Richardson for his leadership in bringing this issue to light and dealing so effectively with this tragic chapter in our recent history. I also commend Senators THOMPSON, BINGAMAN, VOINOVICH, MCCONNELL, DEWINE, and BUNNING for their leadership and persistence in achieving this bipartisan compromise. 
   This workers' compensation program is based on sound science and traditional principles of workers' compensation. It is designed to make the claimants whole by paying medical benefits and compensating them for lost income due to death or disability that resulted from work for the federal government or one of its contractors. I supported giving workers the option of choosing to receive their actual lost wages, instead of a lump sum payment, and I am disappointed that the House Republicans refused to include this provision in the final bill. Despite this oversight, this new program is a substantial victory for these energy workers. They made great sacrifices for our country during the Cold War, and they have already waited too long for this relief. 
   Another important provision in the conference agreement is a new GAO study of the effectiveness of existing disability programs in the military health system in meeting the needs of disabled dependents. Too often, active military personnel are forced to turn to Medicaid as the only way they can get good health care for their disabled child--even though there are programs authorized under the military health system to assist disabled dependents. In some cases, choosing Medicaid makes it impossible for active duty parents to accept a military promotion--because they would earn too much money for their child to qualify for Medicaid. It is time to overhaul these programs and make them more effective, so that no military personnel have to impoverish themselves and their family in order to obtain needed health care for their disabled children. 
   I am pleased that this legislation also includes a provision that at long last lifts the unfair stain placed on Admiral Husband E. Kimmel and General Walter C. Short in the wake of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941. Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the Navy and Army commanders at the time of that attack. Despite loyal and distinguished service, they were unfairly scapegoated for the nation's lack of preparation for that attack and the catastrophe that took place. 
   They were the only two officers eligible for advancement under the 1947 Officer Personnel Act who did not receive advancement when they retired. The provision in this bill asks the President to advance them posthumously, so that now, at this late date, these two men will finally be treated fairly like their peers. This provision moves us another step forward on the path of justice and equality, and I am delighted by its inclusion. 
   Although the conference report makes progress on many issues, I am very disappointed that this legislation fails to take strong and needed action on the important issue of hate crimes. 
   Earlier this year, with the support of a broad group of law enforcement organizations, civil rights groups, and community and religious organizations, strong, bipartisan majorities in both the Senate and the House voted to include a needed anti-hate crimes provision in the defense authorization bill. By stripping the hate crimes provision from the bill in the conference, the Republican leadership has callously ignored these 
   votes and the clear will of Congress. On hate crimes, the Republican leadership has failed the leadership test and turned its back on the need to protect all our citizens from bigotry and prejudice. 
   Hate crimes are a national disgrace--an attack on everything this country stands for. They send a poisonous message that some Americans are second class citizens who deserve to be victimized solely because of their race, their ethnic background, their religion, their sexual orientation, their gender or their disability. For too long, the federal government has been forced to stand on the sidelines in the fight against these senseless acts of hate and violence. If America is to live up to its founding ideals of liberty and justice for all, combating hate crimes must be a national priority. 
   If the national outcry is loud enough, we still have a chance to act on this issue in the remaining days of this Congress.  
   We also have a responsibility to address the problem of unexploded ordinance on active and formerly live-fire training facilities. On the Massachusetts Military Reservation, UXO poses a contamination threat to the soil and groundwater in the area. It is time to take action on this problem now, before it causes tragic and irreparable harm to the environment and the people who live in the area. 
   The conference report authorizes $8 million to develop and test new technologies to detect UXO and map the presence of their contaminants. While this is a good step, it cannot be the last step. The Department of Defense should take on the task of removing UXO from current and former training facilities. This step would ensure the continued operation of live-fire ranges and make former ranges safe for their communities and future reuse. 
   In addition, we must deal with the new generation of threats faced by our service members and the American public at large. As we enter the 21st century, our country is faced with new challenges from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the risk of terrorist attacks both at home and abroad, and cyber-warfare. This legislation takes steps to protect us from each of these dangers. 
   The conference report authorizes the creation of five additional Civil Support Teams, comprised of National Guard personnel specially trained to detect and respond to the suspected use of chemical, biological, radiological, or other weapons of mass destruction against cities and people. 
   Strong support is given to threat reduction programs to continue work with the nations of the former Soviet Union to reduce the dangers of proliferation. These steps include an additional $25 million above the President's request to eliminate strategic nuclear weapons in Russia. 
   The number of cyber-attacks against the Department of Defense increased dramatically last year, totaling 22,000 raids on DOD computer systems. With computers being an essential part of the command, control, communications and intelligence functions of our armed services, it is easy to see how disruptive these attacks, if successful, could be. The conference report recognizes the seriousness of this threat and creates an Institute for Defense Computer Security and Information Protection to ensure our military can protect itself from this type of threat. 
   The Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of our distinguished chair, Senator SNOWE, heard testimony over the past year on concerns about the Navy's force structure, shipbuilding rate, and the readiness of our fleet. The conference report supports the Secretary of the Navy's decision to increase research and development on DD-21 to begin the next generation of our destroyer fleet, and asks the Navy to report on the feasibility of receiving delivery of this advanced ship by 2009. But many of us are concerned about the delays that the program has already faced, as well as the effects of the delays on the fire-support requirements of the Marine Corps and on our country's shipbuilding industrial base. 
   The conference report authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 multi-year procurement through fiscal year 2005. The extension of this procurement will ease the strain placed on many of our shipyards, and could raise the Navy's overall shipbuilding rate to an acceptable level of nine ships for each of those years. This provision is good for the taxpayer as well, as it can save the American public almost $600 million compared to building these ships at a slower rate. 
   In closing, this legislation makes progress on many of the serious challenges facing our armed services, and makes important commitments to those in uniform and those who have retired from the services. I urge my colleagues to join me in voting to approve the conference report.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I greatly appreciate the absolutely splendid presentation by my friend and colleague, Senator WELLSTONE. I agree with him on so many issues. His statement today was one of his very best. We can certainly understand the extraordinary work he has done, along with Senator BROWNBACK and others, to make sure this legislation is considered. All of us will forever be grateful to him for his leadership in this extremely important area. I certainly am. I thank him for an absolutely splendid presentation. 
   Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is finally about to pass the re-authorization of the Violence Against Women Act. The current authorization for the Act expired on September 30, and it has taken far too long to bring this important extension to the Senate floor. 
   A woman is beaten every 15 seconds as a result of domestic violence. Every year, one-third of the women who are murdered are killed by their husbands or partners, and approximately one million women are stalked. Conservative estimates indicate that 60 percent of disabled women, up to 25 percent of pregnant women, and 1 out of 25 elderly people have suffered domestic violence. 
   This isn't a problem that only affects adults. Each year, 3.3 million children are exposed to domestic violence. In homes where abuse of women occurs, children are 1,500 times more likely to be abused as well. Whether they witness the violence or are actually assaulted by the abuser, many children learn shocking behavior from adults. 12 percent of high school dating couples  have suffered abuse in their relationships, and often these teenagers are themselves victims of abuse at home. 
   Eighteen year-old Tanyaliz Torres and her mother were stabbed to death by her father in Springfield, Massachusetts. Fifty-eight-year-old Mabel Greineder of Wellesley, Massachusetts was stabbed and bludgeoned to death by her husband. From October 1999 through September 2000, 24 Massachusetts women and children were killed as a result of domestic violence. It is a national epidemic that touches every community in the country. 
   The Violence Against Women Act was enacted in 1994 to address this problem and provide greater safety and peace of mind for millions of women and their families. The act creates a partnership between the public sector and the private sector at every level--Federal, State, and local. Its goal is to establish a safety net of new programs and policies, including community-based services for victims, a National Domestic Violence Hotline, needed technological assistance, and larger numbers of well-trained law enforcement officers and prosecutors. 
   The national Hotline gives women across the country immediate access to the help they need. Since its initiation in 1996, it has received over 500,000 calls. When a Spanish-speaking woman in Arizona needed shelter for herself and her three children, the Hotline called a shelter in Phoenix, found a Spanish-speaking counselor, and gave the caller the counselor's name and directions to the shelter. In the countless cases, the Hotline is an invaluable resource, and we must do all we can to support it. 
   In Massachusetts, $20 million under the Violence Against Women Act has been awarded to advocacy organizations, law enforcement personnel, and State and local governments. The Wampanoag Tribe of Gay Head received funding to develop and strengthen tribal justice strategies to remedy violent crimes against Indian women and to develop and strengthen services for victims. 
   The act also supports HarborCOV--Harbor Communities Overcoming Violence--a Massachusetts program serving Chelsea and Greater Boston. In addition to its core services, HarborCOV has an economic development component which helps survivors move from welfare to work. Employment training and employment referrals are also provided to help domestic violence victims find jobs. 
   The reauthorization will ensure that support for these programs and others will continue. It also includes important new measures, such as transitional housing assistance and a $175 million authorization for shelters, which will be significant additional tools in the battle against domestic violence. 
   One of the most important provisions in the bill is the Battered Immigrant Protection Act. This provision helps battered immigrants by restoring access to a variety of legal protections undermined by the 1996 immigration laws. The Violence Against Women Act passed in 1994 included provisions that allowed battered immigrants to apply for legal status without the cooperation of their abusers, and enabled victims to seek protective orders and cooperate with law enforcement officials to prosecute crimes of domestic violence. 
   Unfortunately, the subsequent changes in immigration laws have reduced access to those protections. Thousands of battered immigrants are again being forced to remain in abusive relationships, out of fear of being deported or losing their children. The pending bill removes obstacles currently hindering the ability of battered immigrants to escape domestic violence safely and prosecute their abusers. 
   It restores and expands vital legal protections like 245(i) relief. This provision will assist battered immigrants, like Donna, who have been in legal limbo since the passage of the 1996 immigration laws. Donna, a national of Ethiopia, fled to the U.S. in 1992 after her father, a member of a prominent political party, was murdered. In 1994, Donna met Saul, a lawful permanent resident and native of Ethiopia. They married and moved to Saul's home in Massachusetts. Two years later, Saul began drinking heavily and gradually became physically and verbally abusive. The abuse escalated and Donna was forced to flee from their home. She moved in with close family friends who helped her seek counseling. She also filed a petition for permanent residence under the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Unfortunately, with the elimination of 245(i), the only way for Donna to obtain her green card is to return to Ethiopia, the country where her father was murdered. The possibility of returning there terrifies her. This legislation will enable her to obtain her green card here, where she has the support and protection of family and access to the domestic violence counseling she needs. 
   Under this act, battered immigrants will also have up to one year from the entry of an order of removal to file motions to reopen prior deportation orders. The Attorney General may waive the one year deadline on the basis of extraordinary circumstances or hardship to the battered immigrant's child. 
   This Act will also expand remedies for battered immigrants living abroad with spouses and parents serving in the United States military or other federal positions. Current law only allows battered immigrants residing in the United States to request this relief. This bill will make it easier for these immigrants and their children to escape abusive relationships and obtain the help they deserve. 
   The legislation also grants the Attorney General the discretion to waive certain bars to immigration relief for qualified applicants. For example, battered immigrant women acting in self-defense are often convicted of domestic violence crimes. Under the 1996 immigration law, they became deportable and are denied relief under the Violence Against Women Act. The Attorney General will be able to use the waiver authority to help battered immigrants who otherwise qualify for relief. 
   Also, recently divorced battered immigrants will be able to file self-petitions. Current law allows only battered immigrant women currently married to their abusive spouses to qualify for relief. As a result, many abusers have successfully rushed to the 
   court house to obtain divorces, in order to deny relief to their immigrant spouse. This provision will prevent this unfair result and ensure that victims are not wrongly deprived of the legal protection they need. 
   These and other important measures will do a great deal to protect battered immigrants and their children from domestic violence and free them from the fear that often prevents them from prosecuting these crimes. Congress enacted the Violence Against Women Act in 1994 to help all victims of domestic violence, regardless of their citizenship. It is long past time to restore and expand these protections. 
   I am also pleased that the legislation includes authorization for increased funds for the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Consistent with last year's funding, the bill authorizes $2 million a year for the hotline and ensures that the Hotline will be an effective source of assistance, providing vital services to women, children, and their families. 
   A second, equally important part of the bill we are considering today is the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, which condemns and combats the trafficking of persons into forced prostitution or forced labor, a practice that is tantamount to modern day slavery. 
   Enactment of this legislation will strengthen laws that punish traffickers and ensure protection for their victims--most of whom are women and children. 
   One of the most important of these provisions expands assistance and protection to victims of severe forms of trafficking, ensuring that they receive appropriate shelter and care, and are able to remain in the United States to assist in the prosecution of traffickers. Relief from deportation is also critical for victims who could face retribution or other hardship if removed from the United States. 
   Sara, a native of Sri Lanka, was promised a lucrative job as a housekeeper. Upon arrival in the U.S., Sara was virtually imprisoned in her employer's Massachusetts home, and subjected to physical and sexual assault. She bore three children as a result of rape. After 5 years of living in captivity and isolation, she was finally  able to escape. This legislation will provide persons like Sara with the protection and rights they need to assist in the prosecution of these despicable crimes. 
   Finally, this legislation also includes an important provision to provide compensatory damages to Frank Reed and other American citizens who were victims of Iranian terrorism. 
   In 1986, Frank Reed, of Malden, MA, was kidnapped in Lebanon. At the time, he was a private citizen and president of the Lebanese International School. During his 44-month captivity, he was blindfolded, chained, tortured, and held in solitary confinement for 2 years. His captors periodically fed him arsenic, from which his health still suffers. 
   In 1990, he was released to Syrian Army intelligence officers in Beirut, who took him to the U.S. Embassy in Damascus. I met him when he returned to the United States after his tragic and traumatic ordeal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. 
   Mr. President, last week, the Census Bureau released new figures on the number of the uninsured. Thanks to a prosperous economy and the Children's Health Insurance Program, the number of the uninsured declined for the first time in more than a decade. But that decline was small, and it is no cause for complacency. The number of uninsured is still far too high--43 million Americans have no insurance coverage--and any weakening in the economy is likely to send the number higher again. 
   It's a national disgrace that so many Americans find the quality of their health determined by the quantity of their wealth. In this age of the life sciences, the importance of good medical care in curing disease and improving and extending life is more significant than ever, and denying any family the health care they need is unacceptable. 
   Earlier this year, along with a number of my colleagues in the House and Senate, I introduced bipartisan legislation to extend the Child Health Insurance Program to include the parents of participating children and to increase the enrollment of eligible children in Medicaid and CHIP. It received a majority vote in the Senate, but it was defeated on a procedural motion. I hope that we will be able to pass it promptly next year, as an initial effective step to reduce the number of the uninsured. 
   Today, I am introducing an additional measure. The Basic Access to Secure Insurance Coverage Health plan--or BASIC Health plan. Congressman John Dingell is introducing a companion measure in the House. Our proposal uses the model of the Child Health Insurance Program to make subsidized coverage available--through private insurance or Medicaid--to all Americans with incomes below 300 percent of poverty--$25,000 a year for an individual and $42,000 a year for a family of three. 
   Almost three-quarters of the uninsured are in this income range. Our plan also includes innovative steps to encourage current and newly eligible individuals and families to enroll. It is a major step toward the day when access to affordable health care will be a reality for all Americans, and I hope it will be enacted as well next year. 
   The need for BASIC is clear. One of our highest national priorities for the new century must be to make good health care a reality for all our people. Every other industrialized society in the world except South Africa achieved that goal in the 20th century--and under Nelson Mandela and Thabo Mbeki, South Africa has taken giant steps toward universal health care today. But in our country, the law of the jungle still too often prevails. Forty-three million of our fellow citizens are left out and left behind when it comes to health insurance. 
   The dishonor roll of suffering created by this national problem is a long one. 
   Children fail to get a healthy start in life because their parents cannot afford the eyeglasses or hearing aids or doctors visits they need. 
   A young family loses its chance to participate in the American dream, when a breadwinner is crippled or killed because of lack of timely access to medical care. 
   A teenager is condemned to go without a college education because the family's income and energy are sucked away by the high financial and emotional cost of uninsured illness. 
   An older couple sees its hope for a dignified retirement dashed when the savings of a lifetime are washed away by a tidal wave of medical debt. 
   Even in this time of unprecedented prosperity, more than 200,000 Americans annually file for bankruptcy because of uninsured medical costs. And the human costs of being uninsured are often just as devastating. 
   In any given year, one-third of the uninsured go without needed medical care. 
   Eight million uninsured Americans fail to take the medication that their doctor prescribes, because they cannot afford to fill the prescription. 
   Four hundred thousand children suffer from asthma but never see a doctor. Five hundred thousand children with recurrent earaches never see a doctor. Another five hundred thousand children with severe sore throats never see a doctor. 
   Thirty-two thousand Americans with heart disease go without life-saving and life-enhancing bypass surgery or angioplasty--because they are uninsured. 
   Twenty-seven thousand uninsured women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year. They are twice as likely as insured women not to receive medical treatment before their cancer has already spread to other parts of their bodies. As a result, they are 50 percent more likely to die of the disease. 
   Overall, eighty-three thousand Americans die each year because they have no insurance. The lack of insurance is the seventh leading cause of death in America today. Our failure to provide health insurance for every citizen kills more people than kidney disease, liver disease, and AIDS combined. 
   Today our opportunity to finally end these millions of American tragedies is greater than ever before. Our prosperous economy gives us large new resources to invest in meeting this critical need. Recently, some Republicans in Congress have finally joined Democrats in urging 
   our country to meet the challenge of providing health coverage to the 43 million Americans who are uninsured. 
   The BASIC plan can be a bridge for both Republicans and Democrats to come together. It is based on the model of the Child Health Insurance Program, which enjoys broad bi-partisan support in every state in the country. It emphasizes a Federal-State partnership to make care accessible and affordable. Insurance is provided primarily through the private sector, but without employer mandates. 
   The BASIC plan is designed to supplement, not replace, the current employment-based system of health care. It will also build on Medicaid, which effectively serves so many of the very poor, the working poor, the disabled, and people with AIDS. 
   Federal subsidies under BASIC will be targeted to those without insurance today. We should not disrupt the health coverage that 161 million Americans now receive through their employers. It makes no sense to encourage those who already have reliable employer-based health insurance to turn instead to a new government-subsidized program. The cost to taxpayers would balloon needlessly, and force us to reduce benefits in order to cut costs. 
   The proposal builds on and expands proven programs that are already in place. States will provide coverage under Medicaid for all very low income people, consistent with the mandate that already exists in federal law to provide Medicaid coverage for all children with family incomes below 100 percent of poverty. Medicaid's broad benefits and minimal cost-sharing are ideal for very low income people, because they cannot afford to contribute significantly to the cost of their own care. 
   For low and moderate income individuals and families, the plan follows the CHIP model. States will have the choice of providing coverage through Medicaid or contracting with private insurance companies to offer subsidized coverage to those eligible to participate. The state would pay the insurance company a premium for each individual enrolled. For higher income enrollees, the individual would make a premium contribution as well. 
   One-third of all the uninsured today are poor, and almost three-quarters of the uninsured have incomes below 300 percent of poverty. A program of subsidies targeted on these low and moderate income Americans will put affordable health insurance within reach of the vast majority of the uninsured. 
   One of the biggest problems we face in expanding health insurance coverage through such a program is assuring that those who are eligible actually participate. We have learned a great deal from the experience under CHIP on how to achieve this objective. We know that simple, mail-in forms are important. We know that public information campaigns and the involvement of community-based organizations can be valuable. We know that programs with presumptive eligibility are effective--so that people can be signed up  right away, without waiting until the eligibility verification process has been completed. We know that enrolling people for a year at a time without subjecting them to reapplications or reverification of income more often than once a year is critical. Through steps like these, we can see that the uninsured are not only eligible for the program but actually participate in it, so that they actually have the financial protection and access to timely medical care they need. 
   The BASIC Health plan will not require employers to contribute to the cost of coverage. But it will require them to make the BASIC plan coverage available through the workplace, and forward the premiums of workers to the insurance company that the workers choose. This step is a minimum obligation that responsible employers should be willing to accept--and it can significantly increase the number of the uninsured who actually have coverage. Eighty-two percent of uninsured Americans today are workers or dependents of workers. Our message to all of them is that help is finally on the way. 
   The cost of the BASIC place is an estimated $200 billion to $300 billion over the next ten years--approximately the cost of the prescription drug plans that many of us have proposed under Medicare. It's a substantial amount of the surplus, but as we know from the success of Medicare, few if any federal dollars are better spent. 
   In sum, every child deserves a healthy start and life. Every family deserves protection against the high cost of illness. All Americans deserve timely access to quality, affordable health care. The American people want action. It is time for all of us to make the cause of health care for all a national priority.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to support the CARE Act Amendments of 2000. I commend the many Senators who worked hard and well on the issue of HIV and AIDS. Senator JEFFORDS and Senator HATCH have championed this issue since 1990 when the CARE Act was first proposed, and Senator FRIST has been an impressive leader in recent years. Their leadership has and the leadership of many others has raised our collective conscience about the HIV/AIDS crisis. Our goal in this legislation is to ensure that citizens with HIV disease continue to receive the benefits of advances in therapies and a system of support that has achieved remarkable success in recent years. 
   For 20 years, America has struggled with the devastation caused by HIV/AIDS. It is a virus that knows no color, religion, political affiliation, or income status. AIDS continues to kill brothers and sisters, children and parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives. This epidemic knows no geographic boundaries and has no mercy on those it strikes. HIV/AIDS has become one of the greatest public health challenges of our times. The CARE Act has directed needed resources to accelerate research, develop effective therapies, and support the 900,000 persons and families living with HIV/AIDS in America, and it clearly deserves to be extended and expanded. 
   AIDS has claimed over 420,000 lives so far in the United States and it continues to claim the most vulnerable among us, especially women, youth, and minorities. We have good reason to be encouraged by medical advances over the past ten years, but we still face an epidemic that kills over 47,000 people each year. Like other epidemics before it, AIDS is now hitting hardest in areas where knowledge about the disease is scarce and poverty is high. The epidemic has dealt a particularly severe blow on communities of color, which account for 73 percent of all new infections. Women account for 30 percent of new infections. Over half of new infections occur in persons under 25. 
   An estimated 34 percent of AIDS cases in the U.S. occur in rural areas, and this percentage is growing. As the crisis continues year after year, it becomes increasingly difficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem. We all share in a very real way in being touched by the epidemic. 
   Fortunately, we have been able to slow the progression of this devastating disease. Many people living with HIV and AIDS are alive today and leading longer and healthier lives. AIDS deaths declined by 20 percent between 1997 and 1998, thanks to advances in care and effective new treatments. The smallest increase in new AIDS cases--11 percent--took place in 1999, compared with an 18 percent increase in new cases just a year before. We are helping people earlier in their disease progression and keeping them healthier longer. 
   Nevertheless, an estimated 30 percent of persons living with AIDS do not have insurance coverage to pay for costly treatments. As a result, heavy demands are placed on community-based organizations and state and local governments. For these Americans, the CARE Act Amendments of 2000 will continue to provide the only means to obtain the care and treatment they need. 
   In Massachusetts, there has been a 77 percent decline in AIDS and HIV-related deaths since 1995. But the number of cases increased in women by 11 percent from 1997 to 1998. Fifty-five percent of persons living with AIDS in the state are persons of color. Massachusetts is fortunate to have a state budget that provides funding for primary care, prevention, and surveillance efforts. But no state is economically sufficient enough to provide the significant financial resources needed to enable all persons living with HIV disease to obtain the medical and supportive services they need without the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   The CARE Act will continue to bring hope to the over 600,000 individuals it serves each year in dealing with this devastating disease. This reauthorization builds on past accomplishments, while recognizing the challenge of ensuring access drug treatment for all who need it, reducing health disparities in vulnerable populations, and improve the distribution and quality of services. 
   Funds totaling $3.4 billion over the next five years will target the hardest hit 51 metropolitan areas in the country under Title I of the Act. Local planning and priority-setting under Title I assures that each of the eligible metropolitan areas responds to local HIV/AIDS needs. Safeguards are put in place to ensure that Title I areas are protected from drastic shifts in funding that can destabilize their HIV care infrastructure by limiting these losses to a maximum of 15 percent over its FY 2000 levels without compounded the effects of the loss from year to year. We also have assured EMAs the opportunity to reset the clock each time they find they do not need hold harmless protection in order to allow them  the needed time and resources to plan prioritize, and redirect resources in response to major shifts that may occur in funding and in the local epidemic. 
   Under Title II, $4.4 billion over the next five years will provide emergency relief to assist states in developing their HIV health care infrastructure. These funds will also provide life-sustaining drugs to over 61,000 persons each month. In addition, these funds will provide assistance for emerging communities that are increasingly affected by HIV/AIDS, but do not currently qualify for additional assistance, while assuring that base Title II funding losses do not occur in any fiscal year for any state or territory. 
   Title III programs will receive $730 million during the five year period to assist over 200 local health centers and other primary health care providers in communities with a significant and disproportionate need for HIV care. Many of these communities are located in the hardest hit areas, serving low income communities. An additional $30 million in funds under Title III will provide planning and capacity development grants for hard-to-reach urban and rural communities. 
   In Title IV, $2700 million over the next five years will be used to meet the specific needs of women, infants, youth, and families. An additional $42 million will assure that oral health care is available to persons with HIV/AIDS who are uninsured. One hundred and forty-one million dollars in funding over the five-year period will assure that we continue our investment in improving the skills of the healthcare workforce. 
   In total, the CARE Act will authorize over $8.5 billion in funding to fight HIVS/AIDS over the next five years. 
   I commend the dedication of the AIDS community and the Administration in working with Congress over the past year to bring forward the best possible legislation. I also commend Sean Donohue and William Fleming of Senator JEFFORDS' staff, Dave Larsen of Senator FRIST's staff, and Stephanie Robinson and Idalia Sanchez of my staff for their effective work on this landmark legislation. 
   The Senate's action today reaffirms our long-standing commitment to provide greater help to those with HIV/AIDS and to families touched by this devastating disease. America has the resources to win the battle against AIDS. We must face this disease with the same courage demonstrated by Ryan White, the young man with hemophilia who contracted AIDS through blood transfusions, and for whom the original act was named. Ryan White touched the world's heart through his valiant effort to speak out against the ignorance and discrimination faced by persons living with AIDS. This legislation carries on his brave work and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a co-sponsor of the Access to Books for Children Act, the ``ABC'' Act. I commend Senator JEFFORDS, Senator DODD, and Senator MURRAY for their leadership on this legislation. 
   Many successful programs are helping children learn to read well. But too often, the best programs are not available to all children. As a result, large numbers of children are denied the opportunity to learn to read well. 40 percent of 4th grade students do not reach the basic reading level, and 70 percent of 4th graders are not proficient in reading. 
   Children who fail to acquire basic reading skills early in life are at a disadvantage throughout their education and later careers. They are more likely to drop out of school, and to be unemployed. This important grant will help many more children learn to read well--and learn to read well early--so that they have a greater chance for successful lives and careers. 
   The programs authorized in the ABC Act complement the work already under way in Massachusetts and other states under the Reading Excellence Act and under the America Reads program. In 1996, President Clinton and the First Lady initiated a new effort to achieve greater national progress on child literacy by proposing their ``America Read Challenge.'' This worthwhile initiative encourages colleges and universities to use a portion of their Work-Study funds to support college students who serve as literacy tutors. Institutions of higher education across Massachusetts are already creating strong relationships with their surrounding communities, and participation in this initiative enhances those relationships. Today, over 1,400 colleges and universities are committed to the President's ``America Reads Work Study Program,'' and 74 of these institutions are in Massachusetts. 
   The Reading Excellence Act was enacted in 1999 to provide competitive reading and literacy grants to states. States that receive funding then award competitive subgrants to school districts to support local reading improvement programs. The lowest-achieving and poorest schools will benefit the most. The program will help children learn to read in their early childhood years and through the 3rd grade using effective classroom instruction, high-quality family literacy programs, and early literacy intervention for children who have reading difficulties. Massachusetts is one of 17 states to receive funding under this competitive program. 
   In addition to good instruction, children need to have reading materials outside of school--and even before they start school. They also need adults to read with them, so that they can develop a love of reading early in life. 
   The ABC Act authorizes three programs to provide children from birth through high school age with low-cost or no-cost books. The programs complement one another by reaching 
   different communities through different means, so that every child can have a book to read. 
   The act reauthorizes $25 million for the successful Reading Is Fundamental Program, which distributes books to school-age children. This program has been especially effective in Massachusetts. It is helping over 45,000 children at 70 sites across the state obtain access to books. As a teacher from Methuen said, ``RIF continues to excite our students by providing them with books they can call their own, exposing them to a variety of literature, and offering these children worlds unknown.'' 
   Founded in 1966, Reading Is Fundamental serves more than 3.5 million children annually at 17,000 sites in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and U.S. territories. Over two-thirds of the children served have economic or learning needs that put them at risk of failing to achieve basic educational goals. By the end of 2000, it will have placed 200 million books in the hands and homes of America's children. 
   The act also authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of Education to award grants to organizations that provide low-cost or no-cost books for local tutoring, mentoring, and family literacy programs. Programs such as First Book have been very successful in encouraging reading. In 1998, First Book was able to distribute more than  2.4 million new books to children living below the poverty line throughout the United States. First book originally committed to distribute two million new books to children over 3 years and add 100 additional First Book communities. Through the extraordinary efforts of its Local Advisory Boards and national partners, First Book has met and far exceeded its book distribution pledge of 2 million books, and has met its expansion goals. We should continue to support programs like First Book that involve businesses and community resources in programs to help ensure that all children have access to books. 
   The ABC Act also authorizes $10 million for the Secretary of Education to award grants to the organizations that provide free books to children under age 5 in pediatric clinics. Programs like Reach Out and Read in Boston are shining examples of how to provide children with access to books and prereading skills through health checkups with their pediatricians. 
   For the past 10 years, through private funding, Reach Out and Read has been helping young children ages 0-5 get the early reading skills they need to become successful readers. Reach Out and Read currently serves 930,000 children in 556 local sites in 48 states. Evaluations of the program show that Reach Out and Read increases parents' understanding of reading and their attitude towards reading--especially to their children. Parents are ten times more likely to read to their children if they have received a book from a pediatrician. Children's brain activity is stimulated by reading, enhancing their intellectual and language development. In addition, the program is cost-effective--on average, the cost is only $5 per child. 
   Holyoke Reach Out and Read is run by Holyoke Pediatric Associates, a large medical practice serving 30,000 clients from Holyoke and surrounding communities in Massachusetts. Sixty percent of the clients are low-income or medicaid eligible families. The program distributed over 3,000 books to children in 1999. 
   It may seem unusual to talk about literacy in a hospital, but it makes perfect sense. To see that children learn to read, everyone needs to lend a hand. Physicians can be a major part of being of the effort. They can help children and parents understand that reading will enhance the well-being of every child, just as milk and vitamins do. A good book may turn out to be the most important thing a doctor prescribes for a child. 
   Reach Out and Read is making it possible for many more young children to have access to books and take the first steps toward learning to read and toward becoming good readers in their early years. It is bringing books and the love of reading to many new children every day. 
   Reading is the foundation of learning and the golden door to opportunity. But for too many children, it becomes a senseless obstacle to the future. Children need and deserve programs like Reading Is Fundamental, First Book, and Reach Out and Read. None of us should rest until every child across the nation has the opportunity to own a book, enjoy a book, and read a book. The nation's future depends on it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the Democratic leader's excellent statement and comment. 
   I was listening particularly to the wrap-up and recalling a number of the majority leaders with whom I had the good opportunity to serve bringing into real relief how at that time we did have the engagement of the issues and the resolution of questions of public policy. 
   That was the time-honored tradition of this body. It hails back to the time of the Constitutional Convention and our Founding Fathers and what they believed we ought to be about. 
   I hope his words will be taken to heart by our colleagues as welcoming into these final days of this session. 
   We are now in the final days of this session. This afternoon, we will mark the end of the current fiscal year by passing a bill--a continuing resolution--that acknowledges that Congress was unable to complete its work. So now we're going to put government funding on auto-pilot while our Republican friends figure out what to do. 
   We started this year--the first of the new millennium--with great hope. We were going to pass new laws to meet the urgent needs of families across America--to improve health care and education, and provide jobs for working families. The question is, did American taxpayers get their money's worth? 
   So far in this first year of the new millennium, we have enacted: 27 laws naming new federal buildings; 7 laws granting awards to individuals; 3 technical corrections to existing laws; 4 laws establishing small foreign assistance projects; 4 commemoratives, and 2 laws establishing new commissions. 
   We found time in our busy schedules to pass a sense of Congress resolution calling for democracy in a Latin American country. We relocated people from one South Pacific atoll to another. We encouraged the development of methane hydrate resources. We allowed the Interior Department to collect new fees for films made in our parks. We eliminated unfair practices in the boxing industry. We renamed the Washington Opera as the National Opera. We passed a new law providing assistance to neotropical migratory birds. 
   I have no doubt that each of these laws was necessary. But nowhere on the list did we pass the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to strengthen the nation's public schools. Nowhere on this list is the Patients' Bill of Rights. Nowhere do we find a Medicare prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. Nowhere is a long-overdue increase in the minimum wage. Nowhere does Congress strengthen our laws against hate crimes. Nowhere on the list are new gun laws to keep our schools and communities safe. 
   If ever a ``Do-Nothing'' label fit a Congress, it fits this ``Do-Nothing'' Republican Congress. 
   Our country as a whole is enjoying an unprecedented period of prosperity--the longest period of economic growth in our nation's history. But for millions of Americans, it is someone else's prosperity. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a person earning the minimum wage earns only $10,700 a year--$3,400 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
   Over the past three decades, the extraordinary benefits of our record prosperity have been flagrantly skewed in favor of the wealthiest members of society. We are pleased with the Census Bureau Report this week showing that the poverty rate dropped to its lowest level since 1979. Yet, poverty has almost doubled among full-time, year-round workers since the late 1970s--from about 1.5 million to almost 3 million by 1998, according to a June 2000 Conference Board report. 
   Today, the top one percent of households have more wealth than the entire bottom 95 percent combined. 
   Yet, despite this historic period of economic growth, minimum wage workers are not able to afford adequate housing. The National Low Income Housing Coalition recently found that the current minimum wage fails to provide the income necessary to afford a two bedroom apartment in any area of this country. 
   Often, workers are putting in longer hours on the job, and more family members are working. A study released by the Economic Policy Institute this month shows that in 1998, lower income families are working 379 more hours a year than they were in 1979. 
   The increase in working hours for African American and Hispanic families is even more dramatic. Middle-class African American families work an average of 9.4 hours more per week than their white counterparts. Hispanic families work five hours a week more than whites at every income level. 
   Parents are spending less and less time with their families--22 hours less a week than they did 30 years ago, according to a study last year by the Council of Economic Advisers. Serious health and safety problems result when employees are forced to work long hours. A recent front page article in the New York Times told the story of Brent Churchill, a power lineman, who died in an on-the-job accident after working two and a half days on a total of 5 hours of sleep.  
   There are signs that at least House Republicans are finally coming around to our way of thinking. They have offered the President a plan to raise the minimum wage. This positive development gives us real hope that we can raise the pay of the lowest paid workers before we adjourn. But we cannot misuse an increase in the minimum wage as an excuse to cut workers' overtime pay, as the GOP proposes. The overtime pay provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act have been in place for over 60 years, and they protect the rights of 73 million Americans. 
   Republicans also want to use any minimum wage legislation as a vehicle to repeal protections from millions of Americans who work hard as inside salespeople, funeral directors, embalmers, and computer technicians. These changes would punish these workers for advances in technology that have made businesses more efficient. They would take away basic protections from precisely those occupations where long hours are most at issue. 
   The Republican proposal also freezes the guaranteed cash wage for waiters and waitresses, and other tip employees. These men and women are usually among the lowest paid workers and often struggle to make ends meet. 
   Finally, the tax breaks in the Republican proposal are not reasonable. They total $76 billion over ten years, compared to the $21 billion tax cut that was included in the last minimum wage law that was enacted in 1996. 
   Congress is quick to find time to vote to increase their own salaries. The increase now pending would mean a raise of over $4,000 a year. Yet, we have not found the time to pass an increase in the minimum wage to benefit hard-working, low-income Americans at the bottom of the economic ladder. Each day we fail to act, families across the country fall farther behind. The dollar increase we propose now should have gone into effect in January 1999. Since then, minimum wage workers have lost over $3,000 due to the inaction of Congress. 
   The American people overwhelmingly support raising the minimum wage. They agree that work should pay, and that the men and women who work hard to earn the minimum wage should be able to afford clothing for their children and food on their tables. 
   Minimum wage workers should not be forced to wait any longer for the fair increase they deserve. We have bipartisan support for this increase and we are not going to go away or back down. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. 
   Mr. President, these charts depict parents working harder. This charts the hours worked by families with children in the bottom 40 percent of income. It is a comparison of the percent of increase in hours worked from 1979 to 1998. This 13.8 percent represents an average increase of 379 hours of work a year, compared to hours worked in 1979. It is just slightly less for white full-time workers. What we are finding out for Hispanics is it is 5 hours more a week than for white workers, and for African Americans it is 9 hours more. For white workers you have a 337 hour increase, and you almost double that for African American workers. 
   Let's see what that has meant in terms of where they rate in America in terms of the distribution of income. The bottom fifth of families have declined by 15 percent, even though they are working close to 400 hours a year longer than they were working 20 years ago. They have fallen behind, about a 15 percent decline in their living. For the middle fifth it is about a 12 percent advantage, and the top fifth, a 73 percent advantage. 
   If you took a chart--I will explain this on the next presentation--and divide the total workforce in fifths, from 1948 to 1975, you would find them virtually all identical. All of America moved together during those years. In the immediate period after World War II, all America moved together. 
   As a result of hard work and ingenuity, individuals who were successful experienced enhanced prosperity, which is fine. But all Americans who were prepared to work moved along together. Now we are seeing this extraordinary skewing at lower incomes of people working harder and harder and falling further and further behind. 
   This is another chart which indicates the purchasing value of the minimum wage is gradually declining. The poverty line is increasing which results in more and more American workers working harder and longer and falling into poverty, with all the implications for themselves and their families. 
   This next chart is extraordinary. It shows the expansion of productivity. We have heard we cannot increase the minimum wage because we have lost our edge in productivity. One can see from this chart the explosion in productivity. The blue line is a decline in real wages. 
   Historically, wages used to keep pace with the increase in productivity because that affects the actual cost to the employer. If the employees are going to be more productive, they ought to participate in the benefits of increasing profits and increasing productivity. But that is not happening, and it is not happening among the low-income workers. 
   This next chart shows the purchasing power again. In 1968, it was $7.66; it is now $5.15. Without an increase, it will fall to $4.90, the lowest in the history of the purchasing power of the minimum wage. At a time of the greatest economic prosperity of any country in the world, the income of those individuals who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year is the lowest it has been in the history of the purchasing power of the minimum wage. That is absolutely crazy. 
   We have been denied an opportunity to vote on this issue. Why don't we vote on it and see how the Members feel about it? Why don't we just go ahead and take the vote? But, no, we are denied that opportunity. It is unacceptable that we are leaving here without doing so. That is one part of the unfinished business our leader, Senator DASCHLE, talked about. 
   The Glenn Commission Report on Math and Science Teaching released yesterday is a clear call to action to do more to put qualified math and science teachers in the Nation's classrooms. 
   As the commission emphasized, we need greater investments in math and science at every level. This commission is made up of distinguished educators, public officials, school administrators, school boards, local personnel, State national directors, and chaired by our good friend and colleague, Senator John Glenn, who spent such a great deal of time in service in the Senate focusing on and giving life to the issues of math and science training. He provided great leadership. We are very much in his debt for that effort. Now for the last 2 years, he has chaired a very outstanding commission, and they made their recommendations yesterday. 
   As the commission emphasized, we need greater investments in math and science at every level--federal, state, and local--to significantly increase the number of math and science teachers and improve the quality of their preparation. 
   We have made some significant progress in recent years, but we cannot afford to be complacent. In our increasingly high-tech economy, high school graduates need strong math and analytical skills in order to be competitive in the workplace. In addition, schools face record-high enrollments that will continue to rise, and they also face serious teacher shortages. 
   Recruiting, training, and retaining high-quality teachers, particularly math and science teachers, deserve higher priority on our education agenda in Congress. We should do all we can to see that schools have the Federal support they deserve. The need is especially urgent in schools that serve disadvantaged students. 
   The commission's timely report gives us new bipartisan momentum to address these fundamental issues more effectively. 
   The report calls for a $3.1 billion investment a year by the federal government for recruiting, mentoring, and training teachers--with most of it for professional development activities. The question is, how fast can Congress respond? Can we act this year, or will we lose another year? 
   I propose that in the fiscal year 2001 appropriations, we make a down payment on the Glenn Commission recommendation investing $1 billion in teacher quality programs, including Title II of the Higher Education Act, and the Eisenhower Professional Development Program, which makes math and science a priority. 
   Math and science appropriations is about $335 million. It is in place. It has  the confidence of educators. It is focused on math and science. We can take the initiative to enhance that program, following the Glenn recommendations. We can do that as our appropriators are meeting with the administration in these last 2 weeks. 
   Title II of HEA is vastly underfunded this year at $98 million and the Eisenhower Program is vastly underfunded at $335 million. 
   By committing $1 billion now, for the coming year, we will be making a needed down payment toward meeting the Nation's teaching needs. 
   No classroom is any better than the teacher in it. The Glenn Commission report is our chance in Congress to tackle this head on and do what is so obviously needed to improve teacher quality across the country. 
   It cries out for action, and this is a priority. We should respond to it, and we can do something now. We have to provide the resources for investing in this area, I believe. 
   Finally, in the debate over prescription drugs, one of the most important reasons for Congress to act and act promptly has often been overlooked. The best source of comprehensive, affordable health insurance coverage for senior citizens is through employer retirement plans. In fact, the combination of Medicare and so-called employer wrap-around coverage is the gold standard for health insurance coverage for the elderly. 
   But private retirement coverage is in free fall, with ominous implications for all retirees. In the three year period from 1994 to 1997, the proportion of firms offering retiree health coverage dropped by 25 percent. In 1998, and 1999, another 18 percent dropped coverage. 
   We know one-third of the elderly have no prescription drug coverage. None. Another third have employer-based coverage. 
   From 1994 to 1997, it dropped 25 percent. From 1997 to 1999, it dropped another 18 percent. All the indicators are going through the bottom. We are seeing dramatic reductions in coverage. We are seeing that prescription drugs are increasingly less relevant in terms of HMOs because the HMOs have been putting in a cap of $1,000 and sometimes $500 in the last 3 years, capping the amount they will actually provide for the senior citizens. And many of them are moving out of parts of the country. 
   The Medigap program is prohibitively expensive. The only people who are guaranteed prescription drugs with any degree of certainty and predictability are the poorest of Americans under the Medicaid program. 
   We can do better. We must do better. We can do better even as we are in the last 2 weeks of this session. 
   A 1999 survey of large employers by the consulting firm of Hewitt Associates found that 30 percent of these firms said they would consider dropping coverage over the next 3 to 5 years. So we have a 25-percent reduction from 1994 to 1997; an 18-percent reduction from 1997 to 1999; and now the prediction of another 30 percent who are going to lose it over the period of the next 3 years. 
   We know what is happening. The time to act is now. 
   According to a new study for the Kaiser Family Foundation, a central reason for this decline is the escalating cost of prescription drugs and Medicare's failure to provide coverage. As the study found:  
   Prescription drug costs are driving retiree health costs to an unprecedented extent. ..... The drug benefit has represented 40-60 percent of retiree's health costs after accounting for Medicare. Based on current cost trends, Hewitt projects drug benefits to represent as much as 80 percent of total 65+ retiree health costs in 2003.  
   The study estimates that President Clinton's plan could save employees as much as $15 billion annually when it is fully phased in. They conclude:  
   The financial savings could ..... slow the erosion of retiree health care by lowering the costs for prescription drug benefits, which have been increasing for employers at double-digit rates and are a major source of concern.  
   A critical reason for this Congress to act to provide Medicare prescription drug coverage for the elderly is the worsening situation facing retirees. But the Republican majority won't act. They won't allow a vote. Just 3 days ago, they declared that Medicare prescription drug coverage is dead for this year. Their own proposals are not what senior citizens want and need. 
   The differences between the two parties are clear on this issue. Vice President GORE and Governor Bush have proposed two very different responses to this problem. The Gore plan provides a solid benefit under the existing Medicare program. Under the leadership of Senator GRAHAM and Senator ROBB, the Senate has already voted on a bipartisan plan that would achieve the objectives of the Gore proposal. With the support of only a few more Republicans, a real prescription benefit can pass this year, so that all our senior citizens can get the prompt help they need. 
   Shown on this chart are the Gore and Bush plans. You have the comparisons. The Gore plan would be implemented in 1 year. The Bush plan is 4 years, with revenue-sharing with the States or block grants to the States. We would have to appropriate the money. Then, if there is, according to Governor Bush, a significant reform of the Medicare system, within that significant reform of the Medicare system--I don't know whether he means just the privatization or not--a prescription drug program could be included. You have that versus starting in a year from now. 
   Secondly, with regard to the guaranteed benefits--this is a crucial difference--what does this ``Yes'' shown on the chart mean on guaranteed benefits? It means this: When a senior goes into a health delivery system needing a prescription drug, the doctor prescribes what prescription drug that senior needs, and the rest is arranged through the Medicare system in terms of the payment. But the doctor decides. 
   As shown over here on the chart, under the Bush proposal it is going to be the HMO. They are going to be the ones making the decision. We can't even get the HMO reform here in the Senate. Now they are suggesting that we have a whole new system of benefits 
   that are going to go through that system, where the HMOs and bean counters, who too often put profits ahead of patients, are going to make that decision. 
   Under the Gore plan, there will be good coverage. It is going to be comprehensive coverage. But under the Bush plan, we don't know what the coverage is going to be because it will be decided by the HMOs. This means it will be built out of the Medicare system. And this will be some other program that may be built upon HMOs or the private sector, which have been remarkably unsuccessful in many parts of this country. 
   More than 930,000 people have lost Medicare HMO coverage this year alone. Rather than be expanded, the drug program has been in decline. Senior citizens need help now. AL GORE's plan provides prescription drugs under Medicare for every senior citizen in 2002. Under the Bush proposal, there will be 25 million seniors who will be excluded because they are not eligible under the parameters of the Bush proposal. This makes absolutely no sense. 
   Experience shows that the Bush proposal would take years to put in operation. Only 14 States have the kind of insurance plans for senior citizens in operation today. This would be all under the Bush proposal. All 50 States must pass new laws or modify legislation. Only 16 States currently have any drug insurance program. The CHIP program--the Children's Health Insurance Program--was passed in August of 1997, was available in October of 1997; and under Texas law, it took them until November 1999 to take advantage of it. It took 2 years to take advantage of it. And the money was already there. The Governors have already indicated they do not want the responsibility to develop, even with the funding, a whole new administration to be able to implement the program. So this is really a nonstarter for seniors. 
   It makes no sense to depend on HMOs to provide this crucial benefit. The Bush plan does not provide the stable, reliable, guaranteed coverage that should be a part of Medicare's promise to the elderly. 
   But there is one guarantee under the Bush plan. The benefits are guaranteed to be inadequate. The Bush program allocates almost $100 billion less to prescription drug coverage than the Gore plan. The reason for this lesser amount is obvious. The Bush approach wastes most of the surplus on new tax breaks for the wealthy, and too little is left to help senior citizens.  
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under the similar Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives, benefits would be so inadequate and costs so high that less than half of the senior citizens who need the help the most--those who have no prescription drug coverage at all--will ever participate. A prescription drug benefit that leaves out half of the senior citizens who need protection the most is not a serious plan to help senior citizens. 
   There is still time for Congress to enact a genuine prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The administration has presented a strong proposal. Let's work together to enact it this year. It is not too late. The American people are waiting for our answer. 
   These are some of the issues I would hope we could still address. We ought to be able to pass the minimum wage. It is not complicated. It is not difficult. We know what is at play here. 
   We ought to be able to finally get prescription drug legislation. We voted on this in the Senate. A majority of the Members of the Senate actually supported a prescription drug program that would be worked through Medicare. We ought to be able to pass that in the Senate. As I mentioned, a majority of the Members already do support it. We ought to be able to get a downpayment on that legislation. 
   We ought to be able to deal with some of the education challenges. That is important. We ought to be able to get the Patients' Bill of Rights passed, as well as the hate crimes issues, and try to do something on the gun show loophole, and some other matters. These are public policy matters that I think the American people want us to address. They do not want us to be out here now, as we have spent the better part of this week, in quorum calls. They want action, and they want action now. We, on this side of the aisle, are prepared to provide it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to gain Senator SESSIONS as a cosponsor of the James Madison Commemoration Commission Act. It is appropriate that we honor James Madison for his exemplary contributions to our country. 
   The Commission will build on the success of the James Madison Fellowship Foundation, which Senator HATCH and I cochair. We are very proud of the work of the Madison Fellows. They are among the most accomplished, talented, and dedicated educators in the Nation. They are committed to educating children across the country about the value of learning, the importance of the Constitution, and the significance of public service. 
   I hope that this new Commission honoring James Madison will breathe new life into the Constitution for people across the country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our Nation's economy is experiencing a time of unprecedented growth and prosperity. This strong economic growth can, in large measure, be traced to the vitality of the fast-growing high technology industry. Information technology, biotechnology and associated manufacturers have created more new jobs than any other part of the economy. 
   The rapid growth of the high-tech industry has made it the nation's third largest employer, with 4.8 million workers in high-tech related fields, working in jobs that pay 70 percent above average income. The Bureau of Labor Statistics projects that the number of core IT workers will grow to a remarkable 2.6 million by 2006--an increase of 1.1 million from 1996. 
   With such rapid change, the economy is stretched thin to support these new businesses and the growth opportunities they present. The constraint cited most often on future growth of the high-technology industry is the shortage of men and women with the skills and technical background needed for jobs in the industry. Several factors are contributing to this shortage, including an inaccurate, negative image of IT occupations as overly demanding, the under-representation of women and minorities in the IT workforce, and outdated academic curricula that often do not keep pace with industry needs. 
   All of us want to be responsive to the nation's need for high-tech workers. We know that unless we take steps now to address this growing workforce gap, America's technological and economic leadership will be jeopardized. The H-1B visa cap should be increased, but in a way that better addresses the fundamental needs of the economy. Raising the cap without seriously addressing our long-term labor needs would be a serious mistake. 
   The legislation before us today includes provisions that respond to what American workers, students and employers have been telling Congress: that any credible legislative proposal must begin with a significant expansion of career training and educational opportunities for our workers and students. Expanding the number of H-1B visas to meet short-term needs is no substitute for long-term solutions to fully develop the potential of our domestic workforce. It makes sense to ask that more of our workers be recruited and trained for these jobs. 
   I commend Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator CONRAD, and other colleagues for their valuable contributions to the proposed training provisions. The training provided will ensure that the H-1B program will provide our workers with the skills needed to benefit from this growing economy and to help our companies continue to grow.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we in the Senate cannot originate a revenue measure to fund the new training and education program. But it would be a serious mistake to enact a final bill that does not call on employers to pay $1,000 per visa for the training and education necessary to improve the skills of U.S. workers and students.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In addition, I believe it is important to exclude from that fee any employer that is a primary or secondary education institution, an institution of higher education, as defined in the Higher Education Act of 1965, a nonprofit entity which engages in established curriculum-related clinical training of students registered at any such institution, a nonprofit research organization, or a governmental research organization.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join Senator ABRAHAM, Senator LEAHY, and others in cosponsoring the Travel, Tourism and Jobs Presentation Act. This measure will reauthorize the Visa Waiver Program and make it permanent. 
   This visa waiver program allows individuals from designated low risk, high volume countries to enter the United States as temporary visitors for business or pleasure without first obtaining a visa. Individuals visiting the United States under the visa waiver program must complete an admission form prior to arrival. Their visit may last only ninety days, with thirty days extensions allowed only in the case of emergency. Countries participating in the visa waiver program must meet certain requirements, such as possessing a low non-immigrant refusal rate for B-1/B-2 visas and utilizing, or currently developing, a machine readable passport program. Finally, the Attorney General must determine that each country's participation in the program will not compromise United States law. 
   By eliminating the visa requirement, the visa waiver program facilities international travel and increases the number of visitors for business and tourism. These effects generate economic growth and stimulate international trade and commerce. According to the INS, over 17 million visitors to the United States arrived under the visa waiver program in FY 1998. The program is strongly supported by the State Department because it reduces consular workloads, allowing the officers to shift staff and scarce resources to other pressing matters, as well as reducing costs. 
   Despite operating efficiently and providing enormous benefit to the United States economy and the State Department for the past eleven years, the visa waiver program remains a pilot program. This bill reauthorizes this important program and makes it permanent. 
   This legislation also strengthens security precautions under this program by requiring participating countries to incorporate machine readable passport programs by October 2003 and nationals from these countries to possess readable passports by 2008. In addition, the Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of State, must continue to evaluate the effect of a new country's inclusion in the visa waiver program on law enforcement and national security. Continuing countries in the program are evaluated every five years. 
   I am especially pleased that Portugal was recently added to the visa waiver program. Travel between our two countries is significantly easier because cumbersome paperwork and delays have been eliminated--obstacles that needlessly prevented Portugese families from visiting their loved ones here in the United States. Portugal's inclusion in the Program will benefit thousands of Portugese families in Massachusetts and around the nation. 
   Although I strongly support this important bill, I have very serious concern about the amendment that Senator HELMS has offered amending the Conyers provision of the visa waiver bill. Representative CONYER'S provision simply states that visas that are wrongfully denied based on race, sex, disability or other unlawful grounds cannot be included in computations determining a country's admission into the visa waiver program. The amendment Senator HELMS offers pertaining only to the Conyers provision. It seeks to preclude judicial review of any visa denying visas, denial of admission to the United States, the computation of visa refusal rates, or the designation or non-designation of any country. 
   I have reluctantly agreed to it because it is surely symbolic and will have no practical legal effect. Under current law, consular visa determinations, the denial of admission under the visa waiver program, or determinations regarding designation of a country into the visa waiver program are not subject to court review. 
   Nonetheless, court stripping provisions, whether symbolic or not, are anathema to our judicial system. I thought that Republicans had learned the importance of judicial review in the Elian Gonzalez case. Such provisions allow life-shattering determinations to be made at the unreviewable discretion of an administrative functionary. The most fundamental decisions are being made on the basis of a cursory review of a few pages in a file, or a perfunctory interview, without the possibility of any appeal or judicial review. This is a recipe for disastrous mistakes and abuse. 
   This excellent program has been a pilot program for too long. Its enormous benefits to the United States economy and the efficiency it creates for the federal government are obvious. It is time we make this light of this fact and make this important program permanent. I urge all of my colleague to support this important bill.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator REED, for his presentation and strong support. I've had the good opportunity, since I first came to the Judiciary Committee, to be on the Subcommittee on Immigration. We have provided temporary protected status for probably 14 different nations over the past years. And we've also provided the green cards for six of those countries, more than half of those countries. What the good Senator has been pressing the Senate on is to take action--that would be consistent with past action--particularly with the guns of war that continue to wreak such havoc in Liberia. I think it is a very compelling case. I am in strong support. 
   Mr. President, for months, Democrats and Republicans have given their strong support for the H-1B high-tech visa legislation. In addition, Democrats have tried--but without Republican support--to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   We have worked hard to reach an agreement to vote on both of these important bills. We could easily have voted on the Latino legislation as part of the high-tech visa bill, but our Republican colleagues have repeatedly blocked every effort we have made to do so. The Republican leadership is determined to prevent this basic issue from coming to a vote in the Senate. 
   Our Republican friends tell us that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is a poison pill, that it will undermine the H-1B high-tech visa legislation before the Senate. But if Republicans are truly supportive of the Latino legislative agenda, that cannot possibly be true. 
   Yesterday, Senator GRAMM accused Democrats of ``putting politics in front of people.'' Is Senator GRAMM prepared to say that to those who would benefit from the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, people such as Francisco? 
   Francisco and his wife completed applications for legalization and attempted to submit them to the INS. The INS refused to accept the applications, because Francisco and his wife briefly left the United States during the application period without INS permission. The courts have ruled against this INS practice, but Francisco and his wife were never granted legalization. They have worked legally with temporary permission while awaiting the court decision on their case. 
   If they are not permitted to work legally in the United States, they will not be able to support their three U.S. citizen children. With permission to work, they have been able to find jobs that accommodate a hearing disability that affects one of their children. If they lose their work permit, they may not be able to find work. They constantly fear detention and deportation. 
   It is shameful that the Senate refuses even to allow a vote on these issues of fundamental fairness for immigrant families. It is Republicans--not Democrats--who are playing politics with the lives of those who have come to our country as refugees from persecution in other countries. The hypocrisy is flagrant. Our Republican colleagues pretend to court the Latino vote across the country in this election year. But when the chips are down, they refuse to act. 
   The Senate Republican leadership can't have it both ways. Either they are part of the solution, or they are part of the problem. They can't call themselves friends of the Latino community, while working to prevent the Latino Fairness Act from becoming law. 
   Republican opposition to this legislation is so intense that they continue to delay passage of the H-1B legislation with their procedural tactics. For reasons that no one understands, the Republican leadership filed a meaningless cloture petition last week, and now they have filed three additional cloture petitions. I ask my Republican colleagues, wouldn't it be easier to allow a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act? If you support the Latino community, if the priorities of the Latino community are your priorities too, we can pass both bills and move forward. 
   The choice is clear. Instead of adopting long overdue family immigration reforms that have broad support from the business, religious, and labor communities, Republicans would prefer to stall action on the high tech visa bill and block a vote on the Latino Fairness Act. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this shameful hypocrisy and allow the vote that simple justice and fundamental fairness demand. 
   But these procedural road blocks won't stop those who support this legislation. After all, the immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has waited far too long for the fundamental justice that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will provide. These issues are not new to Congress. The immigrants who will benefit from this legislation should have received permanent status from the INS long ago. 
   Contrary to remarks made on the Senate floor earlier today, these issues have been around for a long, long time. If my friend, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, wanted to have a hearing, he could have scheduled a hearing at any time over the past 3 years. And if we had had such a hearing, it would have demonstrated that this legislation is not what he described as a ``broad amnesty for illegal immigrants.'' It is a measured bill necessary to reunite families and ensure that American businesses have the workers they need. 
   He would have learned that contrary to Republican concerns that this bill would ``let everybody in,'' the legislation only seeks to create fairness where there is injustice and restore longstanding immigration policy objectives, and is similar to actions Congress has taken often in the past. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central Americans, Haitians, nationals of the former Soviet bloc, and Liberians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive governments. 
   Other similarly situated Central Americans, Soviet bloc nationals, and Haitians were only provided an opportunity to apply for green cards under a much more difficult and narrower standard and much more cumbersome procedures. Hondurans and Liberians received nothing. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will eliminate the disparities for all of these asylum seekers, and give them all the same opportunity that Nicaraguans and Cubans now have to become permanent residents. It will create a fair, uniform set of procedures for all immigrants from this region who have been in this country since 1995. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue relief to all immigrants who, because of  bureaucratic mistakes, were prevented from receiving green cards many years ago. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which included legalization for persons who could demonstrate that they had been present in the United States since before 1982. There was a one-year period to file. 
   However, the INS misinterpreted the provisions in the 1986 Act, and thousands of otherwise qualified immigrants were denied the opportunity to make timely applications. 
   Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of individuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of the law, and the courts required the INS to accept filings for these individuals. As one court decision stated: ``The evidence is clear that the INS' ..... regulations deterred many aliens who would otherwise qualify for legalization from applying.'' 
   To add insult to injury, however, the 1996 immigration law stripped the courts of jurisdiction to review INS decisions, and the Attorney General ruled that the law superceded the court cases. As a result of these actions, this group of immigrants has been in legal limbo, fighting government bureaucracy for over 14 years. 
   Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all individuals who have resided in the U.S. prior to 1986 to obtain permanent residency, including those who were denied legalization because of the INS misinterpretation, or who were turned away by the INS before applying. Our bill would also amend some of the procedural blocks in terms of normalizing one's green card situation. 
   The nation's history has long been tainted with periods of anti-immigrant sentiment. The Naturalization Act of 1790 prevented Asian immigrants from attaining citizenship. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to reduce the number of Chinese laborers. The Asian Exclusion Act and the National Origins Act which made up the Immigration Act of 1924, were passed to block immigration from the ``Asian Pacific Triangle''--Japan, China, the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia--and prevent them from entering the United States for permanent residence. Those discriminatory provisions weren't repealed until 1965. The Mexican Farm Labor Supply Program--the Bracero Program--provided Mexican labor to the United States under harsh and unacceptable conditions and wasn't repealed until 1964. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act provides us with an opportunity to end a series of unjust provisions in our current immigration laws, and build on the most noble aspects of our American immigrant tradition. 
   It restores fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the nation's immigration laws. It is good for families, it is good for American business, and it is good for our economy. 
   Last summer, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan said,  
   Under the conditions that we now confront, we should be very carefully focused on the contribution which skilled people from abroad, [as well as] unskilled people from abroad, can contribute to the country, as they have for generation after generation. The pool of people seeking jobs continues to decline. At some point, it must have an impact. If we can open up our immigration rolls significantly, that clearly will make [the unemployment rate's effect on inflation] less and less of a problem.  
   The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of businesses and trade associations and other organizations shares this view and strongly supports the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This coalition includes the health care and home care associations, hotel, motel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and retail concerns, and the construction and transportation industries. 
   These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition of business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations in support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   The coalition of supporters includes Americans for Tax Reform, Empower America, the AFL-CIO, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, the Anti-Defamation League, the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the Union of Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees International Union. 
   Few days remain in this Congress, but my Democratic colleagues and I are committed to doing all we can to see that both the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and the H-1B high tech visa legislation become law this year. 
   As others have pointed out, we have been discussing this issue now for several days. There is, as the indication of the votes suggest, overwhelming support for H-1B. There is virtual unanimity in the Senate to pass the H-1B program. I was very hopeful that we would be able to offer an amendment with a training component that would be available to Americans, so that the American worker would be able to obtain the level of skills which these new immigrants are bringing here to the jobs in the United States. 
   The average income for the H-1B worker is $47,000; it is not $150,000. Really, all that is necessary for Americans to fill the overwhelming majority of these jobs is training and skills. There is a small percentage of very highly skilled and talented individuals in the H-1B program who add an additional dimension in terms of our economy. But the great majority--the average, as I mentioned--is $47,000. 
   We only require a $500 application fee now. An immigrant family has to pay $1,000 to get a green card to cover the processing. If we were to require a $2,000 fee for the Microsofts, the multibillion-dollar companies, for every H-1B application they have, we would have a fund of about $280 million a year. That fund would be allocated between the National Science Foundation and the existing workforce boards, under the bipartisan workforce legislation that we passed 2 years ago. It would be allocated on the basis of competition to these communities that develop training programs for high skills. That would include the employers, the workers, and the educational institutions. It would give them some continued resources to be able to provide the skills to Americans to meet this particular challenge. 
   We don't have a crisis in terms of workers; we only have a crisis in terms of skills. So we ought to be able to develop the kind of support so that out into the future these jobs will be fulfilled by Americans. But we are not able to offer that amendment under the cloture motion, even though it is directly relevant and even though we offered and debated those in the conference and even though it seems to me to be directly on target with regard to the underlying amendment. We ought to be able to do that. 
   I don't know what the problem is among those on the other side in refusing to permit us to develop a program so these jobs can be fulfilled by Americans. That seems to me to make sense. Good jobs, good benefits--why shouldn't they be for Americans? The only thing that is lacking is the skilled training. Is it asking too much to ask the Microsofts and the great successful IT businesses for a $2,000 application fee for the H-1Bs? I don't think so. 
   We can develop that fund and develop the training program--not create a new bureaucracy--and use the existing training programs with additional funding that would be targeted for that purpose, and also support additional funding for the National Science Foundation, for outreach programs, for women and minorities in these high-tech areas to support those kinds of efforts because there is an enormous absence of women and minorities in the area of these H-1B jobs. 
   There is no reason in the world that we should not have an outreach program. There are excellent programs in terms of developing interest, and programming in terms of women and minorities in the high-tech area. They need additional support. We can use some resources to expedite the processing of the H-1B visas. 
   Massachusetts yields to no one in terms of the high-tech aspects of our industry. We are second to California in the small business innovative research programs. Half of all health patents created in this country are in my own State of Massachusetts. We get high awards in terms of peer review for research. But when I talk to either the private sector or talk to others, they  say: Right on. They don't question the importance of getting additional skilled workers. 
   It is difficult to understand the reluctance and the resistance for this. It is true that 30 years ago if someone worked, for example, in my State in the Four Rivers Shipyard, their grandfather worked there, their father worked there, they generally had a high school education. Every employee who enters the job force now is going to have eight different jobs. What it means in terms of the continued growth of that employee is that there is going to be continuing education and training programs that are going to be available to them. That is just obvious. If we don't understand that, we don't understand what is happening in terms of the needs of American highly competitive, high-tech industries in this Nation, and for the most part other industries as well. 
   We are denied the opportunity to offer that amendment. We would be glad to enter into a time limitation. We are denied that opportunity. We are denied the opportunity in terms of the Latino fairness, even though, as I have mentioned, we have a court decision that found for these particular individuals. But for the actions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, they would have had their position adjusted and would have had a green card. It was certainly the intention of Congress at that time that they should. We are trying to remedy that situation. We are denied that opportunity. 
   We are denied the opportunity to give fairness to the other Central Americans and others who were given the assurance that it was just a matter that we were being rushed at the end of the last Congress and we were unable to get the clearance for these other Central Americans. We were denied that opportunity. We had the judgment for the Cubans and Nicaraguans but not for the Guatemalans, Haitians, Hondurans, and Eastern Europeans. They were given assurance that they would. Republicans and Democrats alike indicated that we are prepared to vote on that with a short time limit. But we are denied that opportunity as well. 
   We find ourselves in this extraordinary situation with all of the machinations on the other side to prohibit us from having a vote. Maybe they have the votes. They probably do, although I somehow feel that if we were to get to this fairness in the light of day, it would be difficult to argue against it. It would be difficult to argue against why on the one hand we are increasing the immigration for high skills and for the high-skilled industries, and on the other hand we are refusing to provide additional manpower and womanpower for many of the other industries with the kind of support that they have in terms of the Chamber of Commerce, labor, and church groups that say they should be able to 
   get it. 
   If we are going to have sauce for the goose, let's have sauce for the gander. Beyond that, they ought to treat these individuals fairly. They have been treated unfairly because of the actions that have been taken in denying them the kinds of protections and rights that they otherwise would have received. 
   They have the compelling argument that they ought to be treated similarly as the H-1Bs; and, second, because they been denied fairness because of other actions that have been taken by the Government. 
   It is difficult as we go through this to understand why we are being denied the opportunity to bring this up. It is very difficult to explain to our colleagues in the Hispanic caucus, let alone to church leaders and other groups, why fair is not fair. That is where we are. The extent to which the Republican leadership is going to deny us this opportunity is absolutely mind-boggling. Why not just let the chips fall where they may? No. We are being denied that opportunity. We are not even permitted a vote on it. 
   That is becoming sort of the custom. It never used to be that way in the Senate. The Senate used to be a place where you could have the clash of ideas, and also the opportunity to express them and get some degree of accountability. But we are being denied, on Latino fairness, to ever get a vote. 
   We are denied the opportunity to have another vote on minimum wage. 
   We are denied the opportunity to get a vote on the prescription drug program. 
   We are denied the opportunity on Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We are denied the opportunity on the education programs. 
   We can't get those. We can understand people voting different ways, and maybe voting for positions I favor and against positions that I support. That was the way it was generally done in the Senate. But we cannot have that opportunity.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week, the Republican leadership in the House and Senate emphasized again their attempt to block needed action this year to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare. 
   Their letter to President Clinton declared any legislation to provide fair prescription drug benefits dead for this year. President Clinton disagreed, and he was right to do it. There is still time for this Congress to pass a long overdue Medicare prescription drug benefit. House Democrats are for it. Senate Democrats are for it. So are many Republicans. President Clinton has been fighting for it for years. 
   All that is needed to make Medicare prescription drug coverage a reality for this year is for the Republican leadership to finally say yes to senior citizens and no to the drug companies. 
   In addition to opposing Medicare prescription drug coverage --in a shameful example of disinformation--the Republican leaders also tried to blame the President for their failure to act. 
   Their letter charges the President with rejecting the recommendations of the commission. But the commission proposed to raise premiums for senior citizens as much as 47 percent. 
   It proposed charging a copayment for home health services that could add more than $3,000 a year to the out-of-pocket costs of the sickest and most vulnerable senior citizens. 
   It proposed restricting the eligibility for Medicare, forcing hundreds of thousands of senior citizens into the ranks of the uninsured. 
   And it proposed a new cap on Medicare spending that could push Medicare into bankruptcy as early as 2005. 
   In fact, the commission proposed the same anti-Medicare agenda that Governor Bush has adopted. The President was right to reject it, and Senator LOTT and Speaker HASTERT are wrong to endorse it. 
   Their letter criticizes the House Democrats for walking off the House floor when the House leadership refused to allow a vote on a fair Medicare drug benefit, and then rammed through a measure that was not Medicare and was not adequate. All the Speaker had to do was to allow a vote. Democrats wouldn't have walked out. He knew that a fair prescription drug benefit would have passed. 
   The GOP leadership letter also attacks the President for failing to endorse the Republican alternative of means-tested block grants to the States to help low-income senior citizens. But it would take years for States to put that alternative in effect and would leave out at least 70 percent of senior citizens. 
   It would provide yet another excuse for inaction. 
   Mr. President, do you understand that? It would limit the benefit. The block grant would be limited to persons under 175 percent of the poverty level, and only those persons under 135 percent of the poverty level would receive total coverage. But that leaves out 29 million seniors who, for the next 4 years, would not participate in the prescription drug program. That makes absolutely no sense. 
   Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. In 1965, the Nation rejected the idea that the only way for seniors to obtain health benefits should be to go to the welfare office. Medicare was passed, and today it has become one of the most successful social programs ever enacted. That decision was right then, and it continues to be right today. We should not turn back the clock. It is not too late for Congress to enact prescription drug coverage under Medicare for senior citizens. We know where the President stands. We know where Democrats in Congress stand. Most of all, we know where senior citizens and their families stand. The Republican leadership should listen to their voices and end its obstruction.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I bring to the attention of the Senate the excellent recommendations announced today of the Glenn Commission, a very prestigious group of academic educators from around the country, Governors, and Members of Congress, who had been interested in education. The presentations and discussions over the past year have reinforced our sense of urgency about the need for better-qualified math and science teachers in the nation's classrooms. 
   The report emphasizes the need for greater investments in math and science at every level--federal, state, and local. We've made significant progress in recent years, but we can't afford to be complacent. In out increasingly high-tech economy, high school graduate need strong math and analytical skills in order to be competitive in the workplace. Schools also face record-high enrollments that will continue to rise, and looming teacher shortages. 
   Recruiting, training, and retaining high-quality math and science teachers deserve a higher priority on our education agenda in Congress. I intend to do all I can to see that schools have the federal support they deserve. The need is especially urgent in schools that serve disadvantaged students. 
   Mr. President, this brings me back to where we are on the issues of education. I can't turn my television on without finding Governor Bush in another school talking about education. I wish he would pick up the telephone and call our majority leader and say, why don't you bring up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and have a debate on that legislation. 
   If we don't get action on it, it will be the first time in 35 years that we have not had debate or discussion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and have not been willing to take a position on this extremely important area of public policy. 
   We had 22 days of hearings in our committee on this measure. We had hours during markup, and we came to the floor of the Senate, and it was like running into a brick wall. We had 6 days of what could be called debate, although 2 days was debate only. And in this time we had 8 votes. But 1 vote was a voice vote, so we only had 7 votes. And 3 of those votes were virtually unanimous. So we only had 4 votes in a couple of days. Compare that to 55 amendments in 16 days on the bankruptcy bill. 
   For those on this side, we think we should have had a much longer opportunity to debate this issue. I think this was the position of the majority leader because he indicated in January of 1999:  
   Education is going to be the central issue this year ..... we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act.  
   In June of 1999:  
   Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in Congress this year.......  
   In May of 2000:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   May 2, 2000:  
   No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote: But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across this country and every State, including my own State. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go.  
   July 25:  
   We will keep trying to find a way to go back to this legislation this year and get it completed.  
   We heard we would have two-track action during the course of the days on appropriations and we would deal with other issues at night. We completed the trade bill, and now we have protracted sessions without any kind of action. 
   We invited the majority leader to call up the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and deal with it in the evenings because it is something the American people want. We are told, no, we will not do that, because there was going to be a possible effort to include an amendment to try to reduce the number of guns that might be going into the schools of this country and we were told that safe schools were not relevant to education. 
   That might be an interesting philosophical position, but yesterday in New Orleans there was another school shooting. We have been following the terrible tragedy and the circumstances of the two children, ages 13 and 15, who are in critical condition. 
   I think parents across the country want to make sure we are doing everything we possibly can to make our schools safe and secure. There are other elements in the debate, but safety is enormously important. It is enormously important because we are reaching record high enrollments in the public school system. 
   Fifty-three million students enrolled in school this Fall. Over the next 100 years, we will double that number of students, and in order to deal with these increases, the Federal, State, and local governments should work together and share the responsibility. This is not an issue we can escape. 
   We have made significant progress in education over the last 30 years. Public schools are experiencing greater success than ever before--with higher graduation rates, increased test scores, higher academic standards, and greater accountability. Students have made gains in achievement, and are more effectively meeting the challenge of high standards. 
   More students are taking the advanced math and science classes. This chart indicates between 1990 and 2000, those who took precalculus rose from 31 percent up to 44 percent; 19 percent in calculus, up to 24 percent; 44 percent in physics, up to 49 percent. 
   The number of students taking the Scholastic Aptitude Tests has also increased. 33 percent of all students were taking this test in 1980, and now it is 44 percent in 2000. 
   Contrary to what many have talked about, we are finding in many of the urban areas that a number of the urban school systems are doing increasingly better. One of those that was extremely challenged in the early 1990s was Detroit, for example. These are the increase-in-performance percentages from 1992 to 1998: 
   Michigan Education Assessment Program: In the district of Detroit, in 1992, 33 percent passed; in the State, 60 percent passed. In 1998, 65 percent in the district of Detroit passed, which is a 97-percent improvement; in the State 74 percent passed. So you are seeing not only is there a dramatic increase in the performance of children in this fourth grade on the subject of mathematics, but also the disparity between the children in a large urban area and those statewide have dramatically been reduced. 
   All of these indicators are rising. The fact is, also, that they are modest, but they are all the positive indicators. But, our work is far from over. In spite of this promising news--the results so far are not enough. Now is not the time to be complacent. We cannot leave any child or any group behind. We have a responsibility in Congress to help all students. The nation's children, the nation's parent, and the nation's schools are counting on us. 
   As we are getting closer to the election, it is getting fashionable to use the education issue as a political issue. But I think it is important to remind our colleagues and friends about who has the special responsibility for education. The fact is, the States and the Governors still have the prime responsibilities. They control effectively 97 cents out of every 100 cents that are spent on education. When some public officials go around and try to blame people for the fact that a particular area, region or community is failing in education, we ought to recognize who has the responsibilities--the local communities and the States. 
   We do have some important responsibilities as well. The American people expect us to fulfill those responsibilities. We are going to continue to speak about this issue and work until the end of this session, to see if we cannot put education back as a priority item for this Congress. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time and suggest the absence of a quorum and ask the time be charged equally.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM, LEAHY, KERRY, WELLSTONE, DURBIN, and FEINGOLD in introducing the Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act. This legislation will restore the balance to our immigration laws that was lost when Congress enacted changes in 1996 that went too far. 
   The 1996 law has had harsh consequences that violate fundamental principles of family integrity, individual liberty, fairness, and due process. Families are being torn apart. Persons who are no danger to the community have languished in INS detention. Individuals who made small mistakes and atoned for their crimes long ago are being summarily deported from the United States to countries they no longer remember, separated from all that they know and love in this country. 
   The Immigrant Fairness Restoration Act will repeal the harshest provisions of the 1996 changes. It will eliminate retroactive application of these laws. The rules should not change in the middle of the game. Permanent residents who committed offenses long before the enactment of the 1996 laws should be able to apply for the relief from removal as it existed when the offense was committed. Unfair new consequences should not attach to old conduct. 
   Our legislation will also restore proportionality to our immigration laws. Current immigration laws punish permanent residents out of proportion to their crimes. Relatively minor offenses are now considered aggravated felonies. Permanent residents who did not receive criminal convictions or serve prison sentences should not be precluded from all relief from deportation. 
   Our proposal also restores the discretion of immigration judges to evaluate cases on an individual basis and grant relief from deportation to deserving families. Currently, these judges are unable to grant such relief to many permanent residents, regardless of their circumstances or equities in the cases. Their hands are tied, even in the most compelling cases, and deserving legal residents are being unfairly treated by these laws. 
   In addition, our proposal will end mandatory detention. The Attorney General will have authority to release person from detention who do not pose a danger to the community and are not a flight risk. The traditional standards governing such determinations should be restored to immigrants. Dangerous criminals should be detained and deported. But indefinite detention must end. Those who have lived in the United States with their families for years, established strong ties in our communities, paid taxes, and contributed to the Nation deserve to be treated fairly. 
   The 1996 changes also stripped the Federal courts of any authority to review the decisions of the INS and the immigration courts. As a result, life-shattering determinations are often now made at the unreviewable discretion of an INS functionary. Immigrants deserve this day in court, and our proposal will provide it. 
   It is long past time for Congress to end these abuses. Real individuals and real families continue to be hurt by the unacceptable changes made four years ago. 
   Armando Baptiste of Boston was recently featured in a column in the New York Times by Anthony Lewis. Armando came to the United States at the age of 9 from Cape Verde. As a teenager, he became involved in a gang and was convicted of assault. Later, he joined a church-sponsored group and turned his life around. He became a key figure in the city, helping other young people in the Cape Verdean community avoid the mistakes that he had made. 
   But the 1996 law made Armando deportable as a result of his earlier conviction. In February, he was jailed by the INS, and he now awaits deportation. The immigration judge will not be able to consider his positive contributions to his community, his family ties, or the hardship that severing those ties will cause. 
   Mary Anne Gehris was born in Germany and adopted by a family in Georgia when she was 2 years old. She is married and has two children, including a 14-year-old with cerebral palsy. Eleven years ago, she pulled another woman's hair during an argument and pled guilty to a misdemeanor. Although she never spent a day in jail, the crime is a deportable offense under the 1996 laws. Mary Anne was pardoned by the Georgia Board of Pardons this year. The Board does not usually grant pardons for misdemeanor convictions, but it decided to do so because, it said, the 1996 laws have ``adversely affected the lives of numerous Georgia residents.'' 
   Ana Flores also deserves a chance. For several years, she complained to police about physical abuse by her husband. In 1998, she bit her husband during a domestic dispute. Without consulting a lawyer, she pleaded guilty at the urging of a judge and was placed on probation for six months. Because the 1996 immigration law calls domestic violence a deportable offense, she is now being deported to Guatemala, even though she has two children who are U.S. citizens. 
   We still have time to act this year to end these abuses. The House of Representatives has already passed legislation that is an important first step in this process, but it fails to deal with many of the most harmful aspects of the 1996 laws. The legislation we are introducing today is needed to end these festering abuses once and for all, and we urge Congress to enact it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes at this time, if the clerk will let me know. 
   Mr. President, I support the pending H-1B high-tech visa legislation. The high technology industry needs skilled workers to ensure its continued growth. As we all know, the Nation is stretched thin to support these firms  that are so important to the Nation's continuing economic growth. Demand for employees with training in computer science, electrical engineering, software and communications is very high, and Congress has a responsibility to meet these needs. 
   In 1998, in an effort to find a stop-gap solution to this labor shortage, we enacted legislation which increased the number of temporary visas available to skilled foreign workers. Despite the availability of additional visas, we have reached the cap before the end of the year in the last 2 fiscal years. 
   The legislation before us today addresses this problem in two ways. The short-term solution is to raise the H-1B visa cap and admit greater numbers of foreign workers to fill these jobs. The long-term solution is to do more to provide skills training for American workers and educational opportunities for American students. 
   Raising the cap for foreign workers without addressing our domestic job training needs would be a serious mistake. We cannot and should not count on foreign sources of labor indefinitely. It is unfair to U.S. workers, and the supply of foreign workers is limited. In their 1999 book, The Supply of Information Technology Workers in the United States, Peter Freeman and William Aspray report that other countries are experiencing their own IT labor shortages and are ``placing pressures on or providing incentives to their indigenous IT work force to stay at home or return home.'' 
   Furthermore, the jobs currently being filled by H-1B workers are solid, middle-class jobs for which well-trained Americans should have the opportunity to compete. The American work force is the best in the world--energetic, determined, and hard working. Given the proper skills and education, American workers can fill the jobs being created by the new high tech businesses. 
   It makes sense to insist that more of our domestic workers must be recruited into and placed in these jobs. Countless reports cite age and race discrimination as a major problem in the IT industry, along with the hiring of foreign workers and layoff of domestic workers. According to an article Computerworld magazine, U.S. Census Bureau data show that the unemployment rate for IT workers over age 40 is more than five times that of other unemployed workers. 
   Similar problems face women and minorities who are under-represented in the IT work force, and the shortage will continue unless they are recruited and trained more effectively by schools, corporations, and government programs. 
   Under the solution that may of us favor, the Department of Labor, in consultation with the Department of Commerce, will provide grants to local work force investment boards in areas with substantial shortages of high-tech workers. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for innovative high-tech training proposals developed by the work force boards in cooperation with area employers, unions, and higher education institutions. This approach will provide state-of-the-art high-tech training for approximately 46,000 workers in primarily high-tech, information technology, and biotechnology skills. 
   Similarly, we must also increase scholarship opportunities for talented minority and low-income students whose families cannot afford today's tuition costs. We must also expand the National Science Foundation's merit-based, competitive grants to programs that emphasize these skills. 
   To provide adequate training and education opportunities for American workers and students, we must increase the H-1B visa user fee. 
   At a time when the IT industry is experiencing major growth and record profits, it is clear that even the smallest of businesses can afford to pay a higher fee in order to support needed investments in technology skills and education. A modest increase in the user fee will generate approximately $280 million each year compared to current law, which raises less than one-third of this amount. 
   This fee is fair. Immigrant families with very modest incomes were able to pay a $1,000 fee to allow family members to obtain green cards. Certainly, high-tech companies can afford to pay at least that amount during this prosperous economy. 
   In fact, according to public financial information, for the top 20 companies that received the most H-1B workers this year, a $2,000 fee would cost between .002 percent and .5 percent of their net worth. A $1,000 fee would cost them even less. 
   This fee proposal will clearly benefit the country in the short- and long-term. Companies get H-1B workers now, and they will benefit from the workers and students served by programs funded with these fees. 
   This proposal presents a win-win, bipartisan approach to meeting the needs and business and the U.S. work force. It is fair, responsible, and necessary, given the rapidly changing needs of society and our prosperous economy. 
   If we build on existing education and training programs and force our labor and civil rights laws to prevent age, race, and gender discrimination, American workers and students can meet the long-term high-tech needs we face in the years ahead. 
   I look forward to debate on this legislation in the days to come. I think it is a good bill, which can be improved with amendments to address several key issues. For example, we must ensure that the H-1B visa program is narrowly focused to address the skill-shortage. The unprecedented exemptions to the cap in the Hatch bill are unwarranted. Instead, we should ensure that workers with an advanced degree have priority for H-1B visas within the cap, and are subject to the same requirements as all other applications. 
   Similarly, we must also ensure that the INS has sufficient funds to process high-tech visa applications and that certain institutions--all educational institutions, university teaching hospitals, nonprofits, and governmental research organizations--are appropriately exempted from the fee requirement. 
   The high-tech industry's pressing need for skilled workers isn't the only immigration issue before Congress. There are also important family immigration issues that must be addressed. 
   On several occasions in recent weeks, Democrats have attempted to bring the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act to the floor of the Senate for debate and a vote. Before the August recess, Democrats attempted to bring this legislation before the Senate, but the Republican leadership objected. Two weeks ago, Democrats were prepared to debate and vote on this legislation as part of the high-tech visa bill, but our Republican colleagues were unwilling to bring this measure to the floor and take a vote. Last Friday, Senator 
   REID asked Senator LOTT for consent to offer the Latino and immigrant fairness bill and the majority leader objected. It is clear that Republican support for the Latino community is all talk and no action. When it's time to pass legislation of importance to the Latino community, the Republican leadership is nowhere to be found. 
   Our Republican friends tell us that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is a poison pill--that it will undermine the H-1B high-tech visa legislation currently before the Senate. But, if Republicans are truly supportive of the Latino legislative agenda, how can that be true? 
   If they support the reunification of immigrant families, as well as the immigration agenda set by the high-tech community, we should be able to pass both bills and send them to the President's desk for signature, for he strongly supports this bill. But Republican support for the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act doesn't match Republican rhetoric on the campaign trail. Rather than admit this hypocrisy, the Senate Republican leadership continues to pay lip service to these goals while blocking any realistic action to achieve them. 
   The immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has waited far too long for the fundamental justice that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will provide. These issues are not new to Congress. The immigrants who will benefit from this legislation should have received permanent status from the INS long ago. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central Americans, Haitians, nationals of the former Soviet bloc, and Liberians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief  Act, which granted permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive governments. 
   Other similarly situated Central Americans, Soviet bloc nationals, and Haitians were only provided an opportunity to apply for green cards under a much more difficult and narrower standard and much more cumbersome procedures. Hondurans and Liberians received nothing. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will eliminate the disparities for all of these asylum seekers, and give them all the same opportunity that Nicaraguans and Cubans now have. 
   Assurances were given at the time that we granted that kind of special consideration for Nicaraguans and Cubans that the others would follow in the next year. Those assurances were given by Republican Senators and the administration alike. Now, if we do not do that, we are failing that commitment. 
   It will create a fair, uniform set of procedures for all immigrants from this region who have been in this country since 1995. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue relief to all immigrants who, because of bureaucratic mistakes, were prevented from receiving green cards many years ago. In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which included legalization for persons who could demonstrate that they had been present in the United States since before 1982. There was a 1-year period to file. 
   However, the INS misinterpreted the provisions in the 1986 act, and thousands of otherwise qualified immigrants were denied the opportunity to make timely applications. 
   Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of individuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of the law, and the courts required the INS to accept filings for these individuals. As one court decision stated: ``The evidence is clear that the INS' ..... regulations deterred many aliens who would otherwise qualify for legalization from applying.'' 
   To add insult to injury, however, the 1996 immigration law stripped the courts of jurisdiction to review INS decisions, and the Attorney General ruled that the law superceded the court cases. As a result of these actions, this group of immigrants has been in legal limbo, fighting government bureaucracy for over 14 years. 
   Looking across the landscape, I cannot think of such a group of individuals who were excluded from participation in a process that would have permitted them to work legitimately in the United States. It was the intention of Congress they be eligible to do so. It was the INS that misled them and effectively denied them that opportunity. The courts have found for those individuals. 
   Then legislation was passed to further exclude them, to take away the jurisdiction of the Justice Department from implementing the court's decision. That is unfair, and we have a responsibility to remedy that. We can do that. We can do that here, on this legislation. We should do it. That process will permit about 300,000 Latinos to be able to get their green cards and become legitimate workers in our economy. 
   Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all individuals who have resided in the United States prior to 1986 to obtain permanent residency, including those who were denied legalization because of the INS misinterpretation, or who were turned away by the INS before applying. 
   Our bill will also restore section 245(i), a vital provision of the immigration law that was repealed in 1997 and that permitted immigrants about to become permanent residents to pay a fee of $1,000 and apply for green cards while in the United States, rather than returning to their home countries to apply. Section 245(i) was pro-family, pro-business, fiscally prudent, and a matter of common sense. Under it, immigrants with close family members in the United States are able to remain here with their families while applying for legal permanent residence. The section also allows businesses to retain valuable employees. In addition, it provided INS with millions of dollars in annual revenue, at no cost to taxpayers. Restoring section 245(i) will keep thousands of immigrants from being separated from their families and jobs for as long as 10 years. 
   The Nation's history has long been tainted with periods of anti-immigrant sentiment. The Naturalization Act of 1790 prevented Asian immigrants from attaining citizenship. The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 was passed to reduce the number of Chinese laborers. The Asian Exclusion Act and the National Origins Act which made up the Immigration Act of 1924, were passed to block immigration from the ``Asian Pacific Triangle''--Japan, China, the Philippines, Laos, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Korea, Vietnam, Indonesia, Burma, India, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia--and prevent them from entering the United States for permanent residence. Those discriminatory provisions weren't repealed until 1965. The Mexican Farm Labor Supply Program--the Bracero Program--provided Mexican labor to the United States under harsh and unacceptable conditions and wasn't repealed until 1964. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act provides us with an opportunity to end a series of unjust provisions in our current immigration laws, and build on the most noble aspects of our American immigrant tradition. 
   It restores fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the Nation's immigration laws. It is good for families and it is good for American business. 
   The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of businesses and trade associations and other organizations strongly supports the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This coalition includes the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, health care and home care associations, hotel, motel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and retail concerns, and the construction and transportation industries. 
   These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition of business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations in support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   This bill is strongly supported by a wide range of different groups, from the Chamber of Commerce to the AFL-CIO, to the various religious groups, as a matter of basic, fundamental equity and fairness. 
   I daresay there are probably more groups that support the Latino fairness--just if you look at numbers--than even the H-1B. This is an issue of fairness. We ought to be about doing it. We are being denied that opportunity by the Republican leadership, make no mistake about it. 
   Our bill will alleviate the problem also by allowing individuals who resided in the United States prior to 1986 to obtain permanent residency by eliminating unfair procedures. 
   As I mentioned, this particular proposal has broad support from the business community, from the workers, and from religious groups. Few days remain in this Congress, but my Democratic colleagues and I are committed to doing all we can to see both the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act and the H-1B high-tech visa become law this year. That is what this whole effort is about. 
   If we are going to look out for the H-1B--and I am all for it--we ought to also remedy the injustice out there applying to hundreds of thousands of individuals whose principal desire is to be with their families and work here in the United States, and do so legally and legitimately. We are being effectively shut out by the majority decision to have a cloture motion filed which would exclude the possibility of inclusion. Our attempts to try to get it included have been denied. That is basically wrong. 
   I welcome the leadership of Senator DASCHLE and others to make sure we are going to address this issue before we leave. Both of these matters need attention. Both of them deserve action. Both of them deserve to be passed. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I don't want to interrupt the line of thought of the Senator. I understand the majority leader put in place two amendments that were actually Democratic amendments--at least one amendment was proposed by Members of our side. I have been in the institution now for 38 years, and I have never heard of another Senator calling up someone else's amendment before the Senate. 
   We want to be involved in the substance of this and get the H-1B measure put on through. But I am just wondering if I understand correctly that the majority leader now has filed a cloture motion and gone ahead and called up the Senator's amendment. Maybe that Senator has been notified; maybe he is on his way here. But I am just wondering, I say to the deputy leader for the Democrats, whether I understand the situation correctly. Is that the understanding of the Senator from Nevada, that this is the situation?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Yes. So that people watching this have some understanding, we have an H-1B proposal that is before the Senate, and there is virtual unanimity in the Senate in favor of it. There are some differences in terms of the training programs, to make sure we get additional funding so these jobs will be available for Americans down the road. Maybe people are trying to block that particular amendment. These are good jobs. Why should we not have training for Americans to be able to have these jobs in the future? I would like to be able to make that case and move ahead. 
   There are other amendments, as the Senator pointed out. On the one hand--I ask my colleague if he doesn't agree--we are 
   looking out after the high-tech community with the H-1Bs. There is a need also in Massachusetts, and I support that. On the other hand, there is a need in terms of equity, fairness, justice, and also economically to make an adjustment of status so that men and women who are qualified ought to be able to get a green card to be able to work. It just so happens they are Latinos. 
   Evidently, that is the difference here, as far as I can figure out. Otherwise, I can't understand why, on the one hand, we are permitting and encouraging people to go to high-tech, but not to go to work in some of the other industries, even though the Chamber of Commerce, the AFL, and the various church groups are in strong support of it. The economics of it are that there is a very critical need for it. 
   Can the Senator possibly explain why we are being denied an opportunity to complete our business in terms of the high-tech and also in the other areas that have been strongly supported by groups across this country? As far as I can figure out, it is that they are basically of Hispanic heritage. 
   I am asking a question to the Senator from Nevada. Has the Senator heard one reason from the other side--because it is the other side that is stopping this--why they won't do it? What is the reason? Why won't they engage in a debate on this particular issue? All we have, Mr. President, is silence on the other side. Here we are trying to give fairness to the Latinos and against the background where we had two Members on the other side, Senator ABRAHAM and Senator MACK, who last year said they favored these kinds of adjustments for the Latinos. They said it in the last Congress. I don't doubt that that is their position now. 
   We can dispose of this in an hour or so this afternoon. But what possibly is the reason the majority leader says, no, we are not going to deal with that? We are going to call up amendments of other Senators who haven't even been notified to come over here and deal with this. What is going on here?

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will withhold, here is another chart showing double the numbers of groups that support this proposal as well. These are all of the groups. Here is the National Restaurant Association listed in support of this 
   proposal. 
   What is the argument on the other side? I thought I heard somebody say, ``We don't want to confuse these issues.'' I don't think there is much confusion about what is being considered around here. There isn't a lot of confusion about it. It is very basic and rather fundamental. The adjustment of status that was applied just over a year ago in terms of the Nicaraguans and Cubans was going to be extended to others, including the El Salvadorans, Hondurans, Haitians, and Guatemalans. They have been effectively discriminated against. We were going to adjust for those. And then for about 300,000 citizens here in this country who are being denied a green card, under the law, according to the courts, they should be entitled to go to work. 
   The courts have said it was a bureaucratic mistake that they were denied that opportunity to be able to get a green card to go to work. Then the Congress went ahead and effectively withdrew the authority of the Justice Department to implement what the courts have found was a gross injustice and gross unfairness to Latinos. Effectively, they wiped out their remedy. 
   What this amendment will do is just give them the opportunity to make that adjustment. This is all about working. It is about working. It is about a green card and working. That is what this is basically about. We hear lectures from the other side all the time about how we want to encourage people to work. These groups want to work. They want to work. They are unable to work because of the refusal of the majority leader to permit consideration of this amendment. 
   I see we are joined by the Senator from Illinois. 
   Then the majority leader calls up Democrats' amendments without even notifying the Senators they are being called up. 
   This is rather embarrassing, I would think, for Members to have amendments called up and they are over in their office trying to do constituency work. Their constituencies are going to wonder: Where in the world is my Senator? His amendment, or her amendment, is before the Senate. Where is that individual? 
   In 38 years I have never seen that. 
   I hope we are not going to have lectures from the other side: Well, we are in charge around here. Evidently they don't care very much about the rules, or at least about the courtesies and the degree of civility we have had about calling up other Senators' amendments. This goes just as far as I can possibly imagine. 
   The one thing that bothers me is, what is it that they fear? What is it possibly that they fear which causes us to have to take all of this time to pass this legislation? 
   Maybe the Senator from Illinois will respond. I want to direct it to the Senator from Nevada. What is it that they fear? Why is it that they take these extraordinary, unique, exceptional steps to deny a fair debate about fairness to Latinos?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, I have been allocated, I believe, 30 minutes. I was supposed to go after the Senator from Utah. Generally, we go from one side to the other, in terms of fairness in recognition. I have waited my turn. The Senator from Utah is not here. I am on that list. I have requested time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are trying to be accommodating here. We have had one Senator from that side. I understand if Senator HATCH was going to be here I would have to wait my turn, but I am here. I have been waiting. Under the fairness of recognition, I object. But I certainly do not object to the Senator speaking after my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for months, Democrats and Republicans have offered their unequivocal support for the H-1B high tech visa legislation. In addition, Democrats have tried--without Republican support--to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   Democrats have worked tirelessly to reach an agreement with the Republicans to bring both of these bills to the floor for a vote. In fact, 2 weeks ago, Democrats were prepared to debate and vote on this legislation as part of their high-tech visa bill, but our Republican colleagues were unwilling to bring this measure to the floor and take a vote. And last Friday, Senator REID asked Senator LOTT for consent to offer the Latino and Immigrant Fairness bill and the Majority Leader objected. No matter what Democrats have done, the Republican leadership has been determined to avoid this issue and prevent a vote. 
   Our Republican friends tell us the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is a poison pill--that it will undermine the H-1B high tech visa legislation currently before the Senate. But, if Republicans are truly supportive of the Latino legislative agenda, that cannot possibly be true. 
   If they support the reunification of immigrant families as well as the immigration agenda set by the high tech community, we should be able to pass both bills and send them to the President's desk for signature. 
   I have three letters from children who wrote to the President about the significance of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act to families. I will read them quickly for the Senate.  
   Dear Bill Clinton. 
   My mom is a member of late amnesty.  
   That is the provision under which they would have received the amnesty. Then the INS put out rules and regulations so they were unable to make the application. Then they went to court and found out later they had legitimate rights and interests; they should have received amnesty. Nonetheless, their rights were effectively eliminated by the 1996 act. So now they are in serious risk of deportation.  
   Dear Bill Clinton. 
   My mom is a member of late amnesty. The Immigration wants to report my mom. They don't want her here. She should have permission to stay here because I was born here. Please don't take her away from me and my brothers. I'll trade you my best toy for my mom. Like my bike and my little collections of cars. Don't take her away from me! Please.  
   Signed Ernesto 
   Here is another:  
   Dear President Clinton, 
   Please don't take my parents away from me. I love them very much and my sisters too. We have been together for a lot of years and I don't want to be separated now so please don't separate us.  
   Signed Larry.  
   Hi. My name is Blanca. I'm 8 years old. I feel bad for my parents. I want my parents to have their work permit back so that they could work hard as they used to work to overcome our lives in Los Angeles. I am willing to give you, Mr. President, Bill Clinton, my favorite doll for my parents' work permit. 
   Thank you! 
   Blanca  
   These are real situations. We are talking about families who ought to be here as a matter of right under the 1986 immigration bill. Their cause has been upheld by the courts. 
   The 1996 act, intentionally or not, effectively wiped out those rights, and those individuals are subject to deportation. The children of these individuals are American citizens, born in this country, but the parents are subject to deportation and live in fear of this. 
   The 1986 act was a result of a series of studies done by the Hesburgh Commission, of which I was a member and so was the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Simpson. There were a number of provisions in that act. Included in that act was an amnesty provision for people who had been here for some period of time, who had worked hard and were part of a community, trying to provide for their families. These letters are examples of individuals who are now at risk, and we are attempting to resolve their family situation. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is a family value issue. 
   I suggest, that if we are talking about families and about keeping families together, that this particular provision is a powerful one. 
   The Chamber of Commerce and a long list of organizations including, the AFL-CIO, the Anti-Defamation League, Americans for Tax Reform, and various religious organizations, support this legislation and have pointed out the importance of it to the economy and the importance of it to keeping families together. They have been strong supporters for these different provisions. 
   There were other amendments we hoped to offer as well. They dealt with the training of Americans for jobs that would otherwise be filled by H-1B visa applicants. The average income for these jobs is $49,000. These jobs require important skills. There are Americans who are ready and willing to work but do not have the skills to work in these particular areas. We wanted an opportunity to offer amendments to deal with this. This would not have required additional expenditures. We were going to have a modest fee of some $2,000 per application that would have created a sum of about $280 million that would have been used for skill training and work training programs, and it also would have provided assistance to the National Science Foundation in developing programs, particularly in outreach to women and minorities, who are under-represented in the IT workforce. 
   There was some allocation of resources to reduce the digital divide, and others to expedite the consideration of these visas and make them more timely, which are both important. That was a rather balanced program. Members can argue about the size and the allocation of resources in those areas, but nonetheless, it appears those provisions are relevant to the H-1B legislation. But we were prohibited under the action taken to even bring up these matters. 
   These issues can be resolved quickly. Under the proposal that was made by Senator DASCHLE, we would have 1 hour of debate on the issue of skill training, which is enormously important. I personally believe we have to understand that education is going to be a continuing life experience. And for those who are in the job market, training and education is going to be a life experience if they are to continue to get good jobs and enhance their skills. 
   These are all related to the subject at hand, but we have been denied the opportunity to offer them. Instead, we have been virtually free of any serious work on the floor of the Senate since 10:15 this morning. Another day has passed. Under the deadline that was established by the two leaders, the Senate will recess at the end of next week. Meanwhile, another day has passed and we continue to be denied the opportunity to remedy a fundamental injustice. We continue to be denied the opportunity to bring up the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, and the opportunity to debate and reach a conclusion on these matters. 
   We are ending another day, but I wonder what the intention is and why we continue to have this circus, so to speak. Americans are wondering. We are in the last 2 weeks of this Congress, and we have passed two appropriations bills. What is happening on the 
   floor of the U.S. Congress? What Americans have seen today is a long period of quorum calls and the denial of Members to offer amendments in a timely way to reach a resolution of matters of importance, such as the H-1B legislation and the Latino and Immigration Fairness Act.  
   I thought when we were elected to the Senate, it was a question of priorities and choices. When I first came to the Senate, I heard this would be a great job if you didn't have to vote. I laughed when I first heard that. Now it is back. It is a great job if you don't have to vote. Now we are prohibited from voting and indicating our priorities on H-1B and the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. It is unfortunate that this is the case. 
   I am going to print in the RECORD a number of the letters that have been sent to me in support of these provisions. Some of the most moving ones have been from some of the religious organizations. 
   I want to be notified by the Chair when I have 10 minutes remaining. 
   I have a letter from the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, one of the very best refugee services. I have followed their work over a long period of time. They are first rate. Here is what they wrote:  
   We understand and appreciate the needs of our country's high-tech industries and universities for highly skilled employees. We also feel, however, that legislation to benefit the most advanced sectors of our society should be balanced with relief for equally deserving immigrants who fled persecution and political strife, seek to remain with close family members or long worked equally hard in perhaps less glamourous jobs. A comprehensive bill would be a stronger bill vindicating both economic and humanitarian concerns.  
   They have it just about right. 
   I have another letter from the Jesuit Conference that says:  
   As you aim to make our immigration policy more consonant with U.S. reality, we ask you to recognize the present situation of thousands of immigrants from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Haiti who fled political and economic turmoil in their countries years ago and are now living and working in the United States without permanent immigration status. Many of those immigrants have built families here and have strengthened the U.S. economy by providing services to the manufacturing industry with the essential low-wage workers they need. Congress has already acknowledged the need to ameliorate the harsh effects of the 1996 immigration law. In 1997, it passed the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act that allowed Cubans and Nicaraguans to become permanent residents, but gave Salvadorans and Guatemalans limited opportunities to do so. 
   Haitians and Hondurans were completely excluded from the 1997 law. In 1997, Haitians were given hope for equal treatment and fairness by passage of the Haitian Relief Act, but the spirit of the legislation was ultimately thwarted by messy and slow lawmaking. It is time to remedy the unequal treatment received by Central Americans and Caribbeans once and for all.  
   The list goes on with group after group representing the great face of this nation pointing out the moral issues involved. Evidently they are not of sufficient and compelling nature that we are permitted to get a vote in the Senate. We are denied that opportunity, even though there is support from a long list of groups that understand the economic importance of this to certain industries. But the moral reasons, the family reasons, the sense of justice which are underlined by members of the religious faith I find compelling. 
   I believe deeply that by failing to act, we are denying ourselves a great opportunity to remedy a great injustice.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Friday night, an armed man walked into a gay bar in Roanoke, VA and opened fire wounding six gay men and killing another. According to news reports, the gunman asked for directions to the closest gay bar and confessed that he was shooting them because they were gay. This vicious shooting was clearly a crime motivated by hate. The victims were targeted solely because of their sexual orientation. The message of hate against the gay community was clear. 
   Hate crimes are a national disgrace. They are an attack on everything this country stands for. They send a poisonous message that some Americans are second class citizens because of their race, their ethnic background, their religion, their sexual orientation, their gender or their disability. We need to take a strong and unequivocal stand against these despicable crimes whenever and wherever they happen. 
   This Congress has a real opportunity to make a difference in the fight against hate-motivated violence. Two months ago, as an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill, a strong bipartisan majority of the Senate voted in favor of hate crimes legislation that will close the loopholes in current law. I pay tribute to the Presiding Officer for his strong support of this endeavor. The House of Representatives has also demonstrated its strong bipartisan support for passing this important legislation on the defense bill. 
   Despite this unique opportunity, the Republican leadership in the Senate and the House continue to oppose including the hate crimes provisions in the conference report on the Defense Authorization Bill. By removing hate crimes legislation from the bill, the Republican leadership will send a disturbing message about its lack of commitment to equal protection of the law and to civil rights for all Americans. 
   I urge Majority Leader LOTT, Speaker HASTERT, and the conferees on the Defense Bill to do the right thing. Both the House and the Senate strongly favor action this year against hate crimes. Now is the time for the Congress to act by sending a clear and unmistakable signal to the American people that the federal government will do all it can to see that these despicable offenses are punished with the full force of the law. 
   Just last Friday night, one of the most horrendous and horrific kinds of crimes was committed by an armed man walking into a gay bar in Roanoke, VA. Interestingly, Virginia has hate crimes legislation, but it is not based upon sexual orientation. So that is a major opening in that law. 
   The legislation, which has passed in the Senate, would be able to address this issue. We should have the opportunity to vote on it. It was included in the defense authorization bill. It was strongly supported on the instructions by the House of Representatives. That conference is still open. I am a member of that conference. It is one of the last remaining items. It ought to be included. If we need a reminder of why it is important to pass this legislation, we have that tragic circumstance. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I raise one other item of priority, and that is the failure to take action on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   If we don't take action, this will be the first time in 35 years where the Senate has failed to take action on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I, again, bring to the attention of our colleagues the commitment that was made by the majority leader going back to 1999. 
   On January 6, 1999, he said:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year....... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   On January 29, 1999:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to just be words.......  
   On June 22, 1999:  
   Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year.......  
   On February 1, 2000:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been Majority Leader....... And Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   On February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act....... Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   Here we are in May of 2000:  
   ..... I haven't scheduled a cloture vote....... But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across this country and every state, including my own state. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
   I ask the Chair to let me know when I have 2 minutes remaining. 
   Final statement, July 25:   
   We will keep trying to find a way to get back to this legislation this year and get it completed.  
   We have not been able to do that. We have been unable to do it. The basic reason that we have been unable to do it is because those on this side wanted to offer a series of amendments--on smaller class size; well-trained teachers in every classroom in America; help and assistance in the construction of schools, in the modernization of schools; afterschool programs; assurance that we are going to have tough accountability; that we are also going to reduce the digital divide; and access for continuing education programs; but we also wanted to make sure that we were going to take the necessary steps to help make the schools safe and secure--and once that became evident, then there was a different mood around here. Then that bill was effectively pulled by the majority. We do not yield on the issue of making sure we do everything we possibly can to make sure that schools are going to be safe and secure. 
   I draw attention to the tragic situation today in the Carter Woodson Middle School in New Orleans, LA. Two teenage boys have been involved in another school shooting. Someone passed a gun in through a fence, and a young child used it. That child shot another child, and then he dropped the gun. Another child picked up the gun and shot the initial shooter. Both children are critically injured and in surgery. School has been canceled for 3 days. 
   We have pressing education issues to address. We have 
   pressing needs to try to make our communities safer and more secure and to remove the opportunities for children to acquire the weapons of destruction that end up taking other children's lives. But we are denied that. As a result, we will not have the chance to reauthorize. 
   I say that because we heard from the majority leader that we are not going to take up education because we are not going to consider gun legislation, in spite of the fact that in 1994, our majority leader co-sponsored gun legislation that was proposed by a Republican Senator. They didn't complain then and say it was inappropriate or irrelevant at that time. It is relevant to make sure that schools are safe and secure. 
   I heard a great deal in the last few days about what is happening in the schools of this country. All of us understand that we have challenges that exist in our inner-city schools and many of our rural schools. We understand that. But I am kind of tired of people just tearing down the public school system. That has become rather fashionable. We have heard that in part of the national debate. I am just going to bring some matters to the attention of the Senate. 
   First are the number of students who are taking advanced math and science classes--this is from 1990 to 2000. On precalculus, the number of students went from 31 to 44 percent; on calculus, from 19 percent to 24 percent; on physics from 44 percent to 49 percent--a very significant increase in the number of children who are taking more challenging courses in our high schools, according to the College Board. 
   On this chart we see the growth in the percent of students who are taking the scholastic aptitude tests. This went from 33 percent in 1980, to 40 percent in 1990, and up to 44 percent. The trend lines are moving up. It is not an enormous amount of progress from 40 percent to 44 percent, but nonetheless it is showing an enhancement of the total number of children who are taking those tests. 
   Here are the SAT math scores. They are the highest in 30 years. This is important because we have many more children taking them. 
   It is one thing that we have a small number of children taking the test, now we have expanded the number of children who are taking the test nationwide. And what do we see? The SAT math scores are the highest in 30 years. They have been moving up now consistently over the last few years. Actually, in the early years, in terms of minorities, the difference has actually diminished. 
   What we are saying is that there are some very important indicators that are going in the right way. I was quite interested in hearing the Governor of Texas talk about how our schools are in all kinds of trouble and how it happens to be the Vice President's fault. But meanwhile the States themselves have 93 cents out of every dollar to spend. They are the ones who have the prime responsibility to spend on education. So the question comes down to, if they are the ones who have the prime responsibility, is it fair enough to ask what these Governors have been doing over this period of time? 
   Federal participation has been targeted on the neediest children. They are the toughest ones to try and bring educational enhancement and academic achievement to; they are the ones who are targeted. Nonetheless, we see what has been enhanced. There have been some very notable kinds of improvements. I think the State of North Carolina, under Governor Hunt, has been one of the outstanding examples of total improvement in how they have been dealing with troubled schools--those schools that have been facing challenges. Instead of the proposal that is offered by Governor Bush in this particular instance, which would draw money from it and effectively close down that school, we find out how they are handling that with Governor Hunt in North Carolina. In North Carolina they send in teams to help restructure both the personnel and the curriculum. What is happening is major achievements and accomplishments. 
   Those are the kinds of ideas we ought to be embracing, the ones that have been tried and tested and have been effective. 
   I want to show, finally, where we are going over a long period of time in terms of enrollment. It will continue to rise over the next century. We are failing in this Congress to have a debate and a conclusion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had 6 days of discussion on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act; 2 days for debate only. Then we had eight votes--one vote was a voice vote; three were virtually unanimous. So we had four votes.

   Mr. KENNEDY. We have not had the full debate and discussion of what American parents want. The fact is, projected over the next years, we are going to see virtually a doubling of the number of children, up to 94 million. The children in this country and the parents deserve a debate and discussion in the Senate on education. They have been denied that. For the first time in the history of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Senate has failed to meet its commitment in this area. 
   I regret that, Mr. President. I wish we were debating that instead of having long quorum calls or lengthy speeches on the floor of the Senate. 
   I retain the remainder of my time under cloture.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in an article published in the July/August issue of Foreign Affairs, Richard Gardner argues persuasively that at this time of record prosperity, America must commit itself to an increased budget for foreign policy in order to protect our vital interests and carry out our commitments around the world. He argues that America's security interests must be protected not only by maintaining a superior military force, but also by focusing on other international issues that are essential to our national security, such as global warming, AIDS, drug-trafficking, and terrorism. He asserts that to achieve these goals, foreign aid must be given higher spending priority, and the current trend of decreased funding for our international commitments must be reversed. 
   Mr. Gardner is well known to many of us in Congress. For many years, and under many Administrations, he has served our nation well as a distinguished diplomat. He skillfully represented U.S. interests abroad, and has made valuable contributions to advancing America's foreign policy objectives. He continues this important work today, serving as a Professor of Law and International Organization at Columbia University and a member of the President's Advisory Committee on Trade Policy and Negotiations.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week nearly 200 high school and college student members of Skills USA-Vocational Industrial Clubs of America, their instructors, and corporate sponsors came to Capitol Hill to report the results of their year-long ``Building Skills for America'' signature campaign. Building Skills for America is a public awareness initiative by Skills USA-VICA to demonstrate the urgent needs of business and industry for a highly-skilled work force and the private sector's effective support for occupational instruction. 
   The campaign has given these students the opportunity to speak to their communities about their pride in their chosen professions and the many opportunities available through good technical education. The students were able to collect 200,000 signatures for the campaign. I congratulate all of these students for their skillful work and dedication in promoting state-of-the-art vocational education and job training programs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation will help millions of children in the years ahead. It takes needed action to improve children's health by expanding pediatric research and taking specific steps to deal with a wide range of childhood illnesses, disorders, and injuries. It also reauthorizes the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Adminstration, which has an important role in reducing substance abuse and maintaining and improving the mental health of the nation's children and adolescents. Coordinated efforts in these areas can lead to significant benefits for all children. 
   Senator FRIST and I have worked closely with many of our Democratic and Republican colleagues on this important legislation. We have talked with experts and advocates in the children's health community and in the mental health and substance abuse treatment communities. This legislation will lead to significant progress in addressing many of today's most pressing pediatric public health problems. 
   The legislation includes a variety of new and reauthorized children's health provisions. It represents a compromise with our colleagues in the House and addresses a wide range of pediatric public health issues raised by experts in the field and championed by numerous members from both sides of the aisle in both chambers. 
   Division A of the bill focuses on general children's health. It includes programs to improve the health of pregnant women and prenatal outcomes, including prevention of birth defects and low birth weight. It establishes a new Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in order to focus the nation's activities more effectively in these important areas. It also directs the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services to expand public education efforts on folic acid consumption in order to decrease neural tube birth defects. 
   The bill also deals with traumatic brain injury which is the leading cause of death and disability in young Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 5.3 million Americans are living with long-term, severe disability as a result of brain injuries, and each year 50,000 people die as a result of such injuries. The Children's Public Health Act revises and extends the authorization for a series of important programs that were enacted in 1996 to deal with these injuries. This reauthorization will assure continued progress toward understanding, treating and preventing them. 
   In addition, the bill includes the long overdue reauthorization of the CDC's Injury Prevention and Control Programs. There are steps we should take to modernize this authority and increase the authorization levels, but it is welcome progress at last to renew its authorization. 
   Improving and protecting the safety of child care facilities is also a high priority for Congress. This legislation creates a new program to improve the safety of children in child care settings, and to encourage child care providers to take steps to prevent illness and injuries and protect the health of the children they serve. 
   It is said that the 21st century will be the century of life sciences. Our national health policy will have the benefit of brilliant new scientific discoveries that have already begun to change how we diagnose, treat and prevent countless conditions. The legislation creates a new grant program that focuses on inherited disorders. Based on legislation introduced last year that has the strong support of a broad-based coalition of both the genetics and public health communities, our bill provides funds for state or local public health departments to expand existing programs or initiate new programs that provide screening, counseling or health services to infants and children who have genetic conditions or are at risk for such conditions. It also establishes an Advisory Committee to assist the Secretary on these issues. 
   The bill also takes a number of steps to address other prevalent childhood conditions. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness, affecting more than seven percent of all American children. The death rate for children with asthma increased by 78 percent between 1980 and 1993, and asthma-related costs total nearly $2 billion annually in direct health care for children. The nation is handicapped by a lack of basic information on where and how asthma strikes, what triggers it, and how effectively the health care system is responding to those who suffer from this chronic disease. Our bill will provide greater asthma services to children, including mobile clinics and patient and family education, and it will help to reduce allergens in housing and public facilities. 
   Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity are also hurting many American children and contributing to lifelong health problems. The nation spends $39 billion a year--equal to six percent of overall U.S. health care expenditures--on direct health care related to obesity. Twenty percent of American children--one in five--are overweight. Unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity in childhood can lead to heart disease, cancer and other serious illnesses decades later. Children and adolescents who suffer from eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, can have wide-ranging physical and mental health impairments. Our legislation establishes new grant programs to reduce childhood obesity and eating disorders, promote better nutritional habits among children, and encourage an appropriate level of physical activity for children and adolescents. 
   The bill also requires the Secretary to study issues related to effective treatment for metabolic disorders, including PKU, and access to such treatments, in order to prevent worsening of these conditions. It is my hope that this study will be useful for employers, insurers, insurance commissioners and others who provide insurance or set coverage standards. 
   Another major area where additional efforts are needed is dental care. Last May, the Surgeon General published a landmark report on oral health in America, emphasizing the need to consider oral health as an essential part of total health. There is no question that oral and dental health care should be included in primary care. Tooth decay is the most common childhood infectious disease, and it can lead to devastating consequences, including problems with eating, learning and speech. Twenty-five percent of children in the United States suffer 80 percent of the tooth decay, with significant racial and  age disparities. The number of dentists in the country has been declining since 1990, and is projected to continue to decline through the year 2020. 
   According to a 1995 report by the Inspector General, only one in five Medicaid-eligible children receive dental services annually, and the shortage of dentists exacerbates the problem of unmet needs. Yet tooth decay is largely preventable. More effective efforts to educate parents and children about the causes of tooth decay--and initiatives to prevent and treat it--can lead to lasting public health improvements. Our legislation includes a variety of approaches to deal with this silent epidemic, including a new grant program to improve the understanding of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of pediatric oral diseases and conditions, and grants to increase community-wide fluoridation and school-based dental sealant programs. It also directs the Secretary to undertake a coordinated oral health initiative to fund innovative activities to improve the oral health of low-income children. 
   Research has long shown that childhood lead poisoning can have devastating effects on children, causing reduced IQ and attention span, stunted growth, behavior problems, and reading and learning disabilities. Yet too many children remain unscreened and untreated, and adequate services often are not available for children with elevated levels of lead in their blood. There is no excuse for not taking greater steps to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. Our bill includes screening for early detection and treatment, professional education and training programs, and outreach and education activities for at-risk children. 
   Pediatric research discoveries promote and maintain health throughout a child's life span, and also contribute significantly to new insights that aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses among adults. A growing body of evidence shows that risk factors for conditions such as coronary artery disease and stroke begin in childhood and persist through adulthood. Congress has a strong record of promoting basic and clinical research, and the steps taken in this legislation continue that priority with a special focus on children. 
   The legislation establishes a pediatric research initiative, authorized at $50 million annually, that will increase support for pediatric biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, including an increase in collaborative efforts among multidisciplinary fields in areas that are promising for children. The legislation also requires coordination with the Food and Drug Administration to increase the number of pediatric clinical trials, and to provide greater information on safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in children. 
   Children have unique health care needs. They are not simply small adults. Nothing is more important to the future health of America's children than maintaining a steady supply of pediatricians, pediatric specialists and pediatric-focused scientists. 
   Our legislation takes several important steps to improve the growth and development of a pediatric-focused medical community. It enhances support through the NIH expressly for training and career development activities of pediatric researchers, including establishing a loan repayment program for health care professionals who focus on pediatric research. 
   It revises and extends the authorization of a program enacted last year to support graduate medical education at independent children's hospitals. These hospitals train half of all pediatric specialists, and 30 percent of all pediatricians. However, because GME activities have historically been supported by Medicare and because these hospitals serve very few Medicare patients, they have traditionally received very little federal financial support for this important and costly activity. As a result, children's hospitals are struggling to maintain the important training, pediatric research, and primary and specialty care services that they provide. Children's hospitals should be treated like all other teaching hospitals when it comes to support for their GME activities. I have sponsored other legislation to guarantee full funding each year, without being subject to the appropriations process. That proposal has been included in the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000. It is awaiting consideration in the Finance Committee, and I hope it will be enacted this year. 
   The bill also authorizes a new long-term study to monitor and evaluate health and development of children through adulthood. The kind of information that will be obtained by this study is long-overdue, and I look forward to its results. 
   The bill also takes two steps to protect children who participate in clinical trials and other research. It requires all HHS-regulated and funded research to comply with current pediatric-specific human subject protection regulations. This provision is supported by the FDA and industry alike, and it is an important step toward assuring full public confidence in life-saving research activities. In addition, it requires the Secretary to review those regulations and report on their adequacy and recommendations, if any, for changes within six months. Our committee intends to look more broadly at the issue of human subject protections next year, and this report will help inform those discussions. 
   Finally, this legislation also includes a variety of directives to increase activities at public health agencies on specific disorders and diseases affecting children. Children living with autism, Fragile X, diabetes, arthritis, muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, cystic fibrosis, and a number of other conditions have much to be grateful for today. We all have the highest hopes that the provisions in this bill will lead to successful efforts to combat these debilitating and often deadly conditions. 
   Division B of the bill will enable the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration to meet the mental health and substance abuse needs of communities through its 
   successful existing programs and through new and innovative initiatives. 
   The recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse indicates that we have made important progress in combating substance abuse, especially among the nation's youth. The goal of this legislation is to build on that progress with expanded prevention and treatment services. Several of the bill's provisions come from the Mental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act, which Senator DOMENICI and I introduced in response to the Surgeon General's groundbreaking Report on Mental Health. These provisions take needed steps to give the mentally ill the services they need. 
   This legislation is the product of bi-partisan cooperation, and I especially commend Senator FRIST for his leadership in bringing everyone together. His efforts have helped ensure that the measure we pass today is an effective response to the mental illness and substance abuse problems we face. 
   Over the past two decades, we have made great progress in determining the causes of mental illnesses and developing strategies to treat them. We have also begun to understand the biological basis of substance abuse. Despite these scientific advances, mental illness and substance abuse continue to be a national crisis. One in five Americans will experience some form of mental illness this year--and two-thirds of them will not seek treatment. Substance abuse costs the country an estimated $270 billion in annual economic costs, and it leads to unacceptable violence, injury, and HIV infection in our communities. 
   Too often, patients with mental illness are denied the state-of-the-art treatment that would be available if their illnesses were physical instead of mental. We have failed to provide them with the services they need to meet the overwhelming obstacles they face. We have not made an adequate effort to help them overcome their addictions. The bill we pass today is intended to correct these injustices. 
   It will provide treatment to those who desperately need it and prevention services to those at risk. Much of the bill focuses on the unique needs of youths, adolescents, and young adults. It provides services for children of substance abusers, training for teachers to recognize the symptoms of mental illness, and a suicide prevention program for children and youth. In addition, it provides a range of community services for children with serious emotional disturbances and for youth offenders. Agencies will receive funding to study  and treat post-traumatic stress disorder in children. The bill also provides funds to coordinate welfare and mental health services for children who would benefit from this approach. 
   For homeless individuals, the bill provides expanded mental health and substance abuse services, along with transition assistance. For residents of treatment facilities, it offers protections from the inappropriate and often harmful use of seclusion and restraints. The bill will help to divert persons with mental illness from the criminal justice system, which for too long has served as a dumping-ground, and give them the services they need. It will provide special treatment for those who suffer simultaneously from mental illness and addiction. It will also provide funds to designate facilities as emergency mental health centers, especially in underserved areas. In all the services included, there will be a special emphasis on meeting the unique needs of specific cultures and ethnic groups, and on giving states the flexibility they need to address the concerns of their individual communities. 
   For too long, we have blamed the mentally ill and those addicted to alcohol and other drugs for their behavior, rather than extending a helping hand. Recent scientific advances have opened new windows onto the biochemical basis of mental illness and addictive behavior. This legislation will ensure that these advances are translated into practical services for those who need them. By creating this more effective framework to deliver appropriate services, we will help many more individuals to re-enter society as productive members, and do much more to dispel the stigma of diseases that affect the mind. 
   This legislation deserves to be a major public health priority for the nation. Congress should send the President this legislation before the end of this session.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this afternoon we are considering legislation on the preservation of our water resources. That is an important issue and it should be debated, but in the short time remaining in this session, we also must answer the call of the American people for real action on key issues of main concern to working families. We still must raise the minimum wage. We must pass a Patients' Bill of Rights--a real Patients' Bill of Rights. We must enact a prescription drug benefit as a part of Medicare. We must invest in education in ways to make a real difference to our children. We must strengthen our laws against hate crimes. We must adopt sensible gun control to keep our communities and our schools safe. 
   But the Congress has done little more than pay lip service to these concerns of working families. In fact, this year, we have done little work at all. By the time this Congress is scheduled to adjourn only 2 weeks from now, the Senate will have met for only 115 days. That is the lowest number since 1956. It is only 2 days shy of the record set by the famous do-nothing Congress in 1948. 
   We know what the Senate leader has said about how he wanted to spend the last few weeks of this Congress, and that we would work day and night to get the business done. We were supposed to work on legislation by day and on appropriations bills by night. Specifically, Senator LOTT said, on September 6:  
   We will focus the greatest time commitment on four other priorities. The four worthy are the permanent trade relations with China, completion of the 11 remaining appropriations bills for the fiscal year that begins October 1, raising the annual limits for protected savings in 401(k), individual retirement accounts, and the elimination of some unfair taxes like the telephone tax.  
   In a letter to GOP Senators, Senator LOTT wrote:  
   The Senate will focus on the completion of the remaining appropriations, the China trade bill, and on the votes to override the President's vetoes of our bipartisan bills to end the marriage penalty and the death tax.  
   There was no mention of key priorities such as prescription drugs, Patients' Bill of Rights, or the minimum wage. 
   Senator LOTT said:  
   When we return to session after Labor Day, there will be long days, but we will do our best to keep Senators advised, after communicating with leadership on both sides of the aisle, on what the schedule will be.  
   The Senate is still waiting for an answer to our unmet priorities, and so are the American people. 
   H-1B HIGH-TECH LEGISLATION
   Mr. President, I'm pleased that the Senate is finally taking steps to debate and vote on the H-1B high tech visa legislation. Our nation's economy is experiencing a time of unprecedented growth and prosperity. The strong economic growth can, in large measure, be traced to the vitality of the highly competitive and rapidly growing high technology industry. 
   I'm proud to say that Massachusetts is leading the nation in the new high tech economy, according to a recent study by the Progressive Policy Institute. Thanks to our world-class universities and research facilities, Massachusetts is a pioneer in the global economy of the information age. We are home to nearly 3,000 information technology companies, employing 170,000 people, and generating $8 billion in annual revenues. 
   With such rapid change, the nation is stretched thin to support these new businesses and their opportunities for growth. Nationally, the demand for employees with training in computer science, electrical engineering, software, and communications is very high. 
   In 1998, in an effort to find a stop-gap solution to this labor shortage, we enacted the American Competitiveness and 
   Workforce Improvement Act, which increased the number of temporary visas available to skilled foreign workers. Despite the availability of additional H-1B visas, we have reached the cap before the end of the year in the last two fiscal years. 
   We need to be responsive to the nation's need for high tech workers. We know that unless we take steps now to address this growing workforce gap, America's technological and economic leadership will be jeopardized. I believe that the H-1B visa cap should be increased, but in a way that better addresses the fundamental needs of the American economy. Raising the cap without addressing our long-term labor needs would be a serious mistake. We cannot count on foreign sources of labor as a long-term solution. 
   These are solid, middle class jobs that Americans deserve under the H-1B program. The median salary for H-1B high tech workers is $45,000. Approximately 57 percent of H-1B workers have earned only a bachelor's degree. More than half of these workers will be  employed as computer programmers and systems analysts. These are not highly specialized jobs. They do not require advanced degrees or years of training. American workers are the most productive workers in the world. It makes sense to demand that more of our workers be recruited and trained for these jobs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is exactly right. That is why, when we do have the measure before us, we will offer amendments to try to develop the support in the Senate, and also in the House, for the funding of a program that will help ensure that this deficit, in terms of the highly skilled who are being addressed by the H-1B visa, will be eased. We will utilize very effective services. For example, the National Science Foundation, which has a good deal of skill and understanding and awareness in giving focus and attention to encouraging highly specialized vocations and support for these types of programs. 
   We will welcome the opportunity to join with my friend from Illinois in bringing this to the attention of the Senate when we actually have the measure before us. We are very hopeful that we will have the opportunity to address it and not have steps taken in the Senate that will foreclose both the debate and discussion on this issue. 
   The fact is that the great majority of these H-1B jobs have good, middle-income salaries, and they are the kinds of jobs that would benefit any family in America. For a number of reasons, which I think many of us are familiar with, we have not developed the kinds of training programs and support programs for the development of the skills in these areas that we need. But the question that will be before us is, Should we throw up our hands and say we won't do that and we will depend upon a foreign supply of these workers in the future? 
   I think not. I think we should take the steps now to make sure this provision actually becomes an anachronism. 
   Perhaps we will also need opportunities for those who have the very highly specialized skills to come here and to benefit and fit into some aspect of either industry or academia. We ought to recognize that. But to rely on the kind of jobs where only 57 percent of H-1Bs earned a bachelor's degree and the average income is only $45,000--this is a long way from those. I think most Members of the Senate and I certainly think most Americans would say H-1B is a superscientist that is going to go to a very specialized company or that will generate thousands of jobs. That may be true for very few that are included. But the fact is, for the most part, these are the kinds of jobs that can be filled with American labor if they have the right kind of skills, and we ought to be able to develop that effort as we go into this program. 
   We also hear countless reports of age and race discrimination as rampant problems in the IT industry. The rate of unemployment for the average IT worker over age 40 is more than 5 times that of other workers. Just when we should be doing more to bring minorities into technology careers, we hear that organizations in Silicon Valley cannot get companies to recruit from minority colleges and universities, or hire skilled, educated minorities from neighboring Oakland. The number of women entering the IT field has also dramatically decreased since the mid-1980s. If the skill shortage is as dire as the IT industry reports, we can clearly do more to increase the number of minorities, women and older workers in the IT workforce. 
   Any credible legislative proposal to increase the number of foreign high tech workers available to American businesses must begin with the expansion of high-skill career training opportunities for American workers. 
   Now more than ever, employer demand for high-tech foreign workers shows that there is an even greater need to train American workers and prepare U.S. students for careers in information technology. As Chairman Alan Greenspan recently stated, 
   The rapidity of innovation and the unpredictability of the directions it may take imply a need for considerable investment in human capital ..... The pressure to enlarge the pool of skilled workers also requires that we strengthen the significant contributions of other types of training and educational programs, especially for those with lesser skills. 
   When we expanded the number of H-1B visas in 1998, we created a training initiative funded by a visa fee in recognition of the need to train and update the skills of members of our workforce. Today, as we seek to nearly double the number of high tech workers, we must ensure that legislation signed into law includes a significant expansion of career training and educational opportunities for American workers and students. 
   I propose that we build on the priorities in current H-1B law. The Department of Labor, in consultation with the Department of Commerce, will provide grants to local workforce investment boards in areas with substantial shortages of high tech workers. Grants will be awarded on a competitive basis for innovative high tech training proposals developed by workforce boards collaboratively with area employers, unions, and higher education institutions. Annually, this program will provide state-of-the-art high tech training for approximately 50,000 workers in primarily high tech, information technology, and biotechnology skills. 
   More than ever, today's jobs require advanced degrees, especially in math, science, engineering, and computer sciences. We must encourage students, including minorities to pursue degrees in these fields. We must also increase scholarship opportunities for talented minority and low-income students whose families cannot afford today's tuition costs. We must also expand the National Science Foundation's merit-based, competitive grants to partnership programs with an educational mission. Equally important, closing the digital divide must be a part of our effort to meet the growing demand for high skilled workers. 
   The only effective way for Congress to responsibly ensure more high skill training and scholarships for students is to increase the H-1B visa user fees. High tech companies are producing record profits. They can afford to pay a higher application fee. According to public financial information, for the top twenty companies that received the most H-1B workers this year, a $2,000 fee would cost between .002% and .5% of their net worth. A $1,000 fee would cost them very little. Immigrant families with very modest incomes were able to pay a $1,000 fee to allow family members to obtain green cards. 
   The H-1B debate should not focus solely on the number of visas available to skilled workers. It should also deal with the professional credentials of the workers being admitted. It makes 
   sense to expand the number of H-1B visas to fill the shortage of masters and doctoral level professionals with specialized skills that cannot be easily and quickly produced domestically. We should insist that a significant percentage of the H-1B visa cap be carved out and reserved for individuals with masters or higher degrees. 
   In the days to come, we will have the opportunity to debate these issues and pass legislation that meets the needs of the high technology industry by raising the visa cap and also by ensuring state-of-the-art skills training for American workers. Clearly, however, the immigration agenda is not just an H-1B high-tech visa agenda. Congress also has a responsibility to deal with the critical issues facing Latino and other immigrant families in our country. To meet the needs of these immigrants, my colleagues and I have introduced the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act.  
   The immigrants who will benefit from this legislation should have received permanent status from the INS long ago. These issues are not new to Congress. The Latino community has been seeking legislation to resolve these issues for many years. The immigrant community--particularly the Latino community--has waited far too long for the fundamental fairness that this legislation will provide. 
   This measure is also critical for businesses. All sectors of the economy are experiencing unprecedented economic growth, but this growth cannot be sustained without additional workers. With unemployment levels at 4 percent or even lower, many businesses find themselves unable to fill job openings. The shortages of highly skilled, semi-skilled and low-skilled workers are becoming a serious impediment to continuing growth. 
   Information technology companies are not the only firms urging Congress to provide additional workers. An equally important voice is that of the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, a consortium of businesses and trade associations, and other organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, health care and home care associations, hotel, motel, restaurant and tourism associations, manufacturing and retail concerns, and the construction and transportation industries. 
   These key industries have added their voices to the broad coalition of business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations in support of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. Conservative supporters of the Act include Americans for Tax Reform and Empower America. Labor supporters include the AFL-CIO, the Union of Neeletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees International Union. 
   All of the major Latino organizations support the bill, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Religious organizations include a broad array of American Jewish groups, the U.S. Catholic Conference, and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services. 
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act includes parity for Central Americans and Haitians. In 1997, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which granted permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled their repressive governments. The act provided other similarly situated Central Americans and Haitians with the opportunity to apply for green cards under more difficult and narrower standards and more cumbersome procedures. 
   It is unfair not to provide the same relief for all immigrants seeking safe haven in the United States. Fairness requires that we address this grave injustice. As Congresswoman CARRIE MEEK said on the floor of the House of Representatives ``Nicaraguans, Cubans, Guatemalans, and Salvadorans ..... live next door to each other in some of our communities [but] one will get a green card and the others cannot. One could seek citizenship after 4 to 5 years; the others cannot. Is that fair? My answer is no, it is not fair.'' 
   Senator MACK, Senator ABRAHAM, and others said, ``Last year, we adopted legislation to protect Nicaraguans and Cubans. But Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. The time has come for Congress to end the bigotry. We must remedy this flagrant omission and add Haitians to the list of deserving refugees.'' 
   There it is, Mr. President, those who have reasonable access: Cubans and Nicaraguans; those who have unreasonable access, Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Haitians, Hondurans, and immigrants from Eastern European countries. We have the support from the Chamber of Commerce and from the AFL-CIO to bring this in. With H-1B legislation we are looking out for the high tech industry; why not look out for other industries, as well? We had a strong indication of support by two Republican Senators last year when this was passed. Yet we are being denied the opportunity by the Republican leadership to bring this matter before the Senate. We are being denied the opportunity by the Republican leadership to have a vote on it. We will agree to a time limit. They are denying even the chance to bring it up. That is wrong. That is unfair. It is unjust. 
   We are going to do everything we possibly can to remedy that through other parliamentary means. The idea that we are bringing up one particular proposal to look at high tech--and I am all for those provisions, and stated my support for them--and saying we should be able to deal with this issue and expand the job opportunities for other Americans, while on the other hand, saying absolutely no, we are going to set up a parliamentary situation where we are absolutely denied the opportunity to bring that up. It is supported by the religious and business communities, and has had the support of Republican Senators, but we are being denied the opportunity to bring it to the floor for a vote. It is wrong. It is unfair. The American people ought to understand it. 
   Not only are we failing to deal with some of the key issues which are at the heart of the American families' concerns, but we are refusing to be fair on this issue with regard to the Latino and Immigrant Fairness provisions. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will create a fair and uniform set of procedures for all the immigrants from the region who have been in this country since 1995. 
   It is important to remember the recent history of why people in Central America and Haiti fled from their homes. In Guatemala, hundreds of so-called ``extra-judicial'' killings occurred every year between 1990 and 1995. Entire villages ``disappeared.'' Most of the villages were probably massacred. In El Salvador, an end to 12 years of civil war has not meant an end to violent internal strife. Ironically, the death toll in 1994 was higher than during the war. In Honduras, the Department of State's Human Rights Report cites ``serious problems,'' including extra-judicial killings, beatings and a civilian and military elite that has long operated with impunity. Haiti has been ruled by dictators for decades. In September 1991, 
   Haiti's first democratically-elected government was overthrown in a violent military coup that was responsible for thousands of extra-judicial killings over a three-year period. 
   The idea that we have discriminatory provisions in our immigration laws is nothing new. I remember in 1965 when we passed the Immigration Act, which eliminated the Asian Pacific triangle, a provision that went back to the old Yellow Peril days. In 1965, we permitted only 125 Asians to come into the United States. We effectively excluded Asians from their ability to immigrate here. We gave preferences to others. Who did we give preference to? To those who qualified under the national origin quota system that was based upon the ethnic requirements. 
   The immigration laws in our country historically have been filled with these inequities, and we have been battling to try and make them fair and just. Now we are refusing to eliminate one of the most glaring discriminatory aspects that has ever existed in our immigration laws, and we are being denied that opportunity on the floor of the Senate by the Republican leadership. That is fundamentally wrong. 
   Providing parity for immigrants from countries in Central America and Haiti will help individuals such as Ericka and her family. In 1986, when Guatemala was in the midst of a civil war, Ericka's father was abducted and disappeared. He is presumed dead. The rest of the family fled to the United States for safety. When Ericka joined her mother in 1993, she was a minor and could be included in the family's asylum application. Her family now qualifies for permanent residence under NACARA. However, because Ericka is 21, she no longer qualifies under this law and will therefore remain in legal limbo--or worse, be deported back to Guatemala. 
   This is happening every single day. She lives in fear of being sent back to the country where her father was killed. Her life here is in limbo. She graduated from high school and has dreams of going on to college. But without permanent residence, she cannot qualify for scholarships. Passage of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will enable her to remain in the United States with her family and continue her education.  
   The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act will also provide long overdue relief to immigrants, who because of bureaucratic mistakes, were prevented from receiving green cards long ago. That is one aspect of the bill. Listen to this and wonder why we can't address this aspect of the law. 
   In 1986, Congress passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act, called IRCA, which included legalization for persons who could demonstrate that they had been present illegally in the United States since before 1982. There is a one-year period to file. However, INS misinterpreted the provisions in IRCA, and thousands of otherwise qualified immigrants were denied the opportunity to make timely applications. 
   Several successful class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of individuals who were harmed by these INS misinterpretations of law. The courts required the INS to accept filings for these individuals. One court decision stated:  
   The evidence is clear that the INS' ..... regulations deterred many aliens who would otherwise qualify for legalization from applying.  
   They went to court. The court found for them. We are talking about 300,000 individuals. The court found for them and said: You are qualified, you got misinformation from the agency that was supposed to administer this. We apologize. Go ahead and apply. 
   Then what happened? The ink was not even dry and in 1996, the immigration law stripped the courts of the jurisdiction. The Attorney General ruled that the law superseded the court cases. As a result of these actions, this group of immigrants have been in legal limbo and fighting government bureaucracy over 14 years. 
   We are denying them the opportunity to make the adjustment of their status. Our bill will alleviate this problem by allowing all individuals who have resided in the United States prior to 1986 to obtain permanent residency, including those who were denied legalization because of INS' misinterpretation, or who were turned away by the INS before applying. 
   Consider Maria. Maria, who came to the United States 18 years ago, has been living in legal limbo with temporary permission to work, while courts determine whether she should have received permanent residence under the 1986 legalization law. Maria now has a U.S. citizen son who suffers from a rare bone disease that confines him to a wheel chair. As a result of the changes in the 1996 immigration law, Maria has now lost her work permit. Her father recently passed away in El Salvador, but her tenuous legal status did not permit her to return there to pay her last respects. All Maria wants to do is legalize her status and continue to work legally to support her family and pay her son's medical bills. Without the passage of this legislation, Maria faces an uncertain future. 
   This bill will also restore section 245(i), a vital provision of the immigration law that permitted immigrants about to become permanent residents to apply for green cards while still in the U.S. for a $1,000 fee, rather than returning to their home countries to apply. 
   Section 245(i) was pro-family, pro-business, fiscally prudent, and a matter of common sense. Under it, immigrants with close family members in the U.S. are able to remain here with their families while applying for legal permanent residence. The section also allows businesses to retain valuable employees, while providing INS with millions of dollars in annual revenue, at no cost to taxpayers. Restoring Section 245(i) will keep thousands of immigrants from being separated from their families and jobs for as long as ten years. 
   America has historically been open and welcoming to immigrant populations seeking to build new lives, free from the fear of persecution and tyranny. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act builds on that tradition, by restoring fairness to the immigrant community and fairness in the American legislative process. This legislation will regularize the status of thousands of workers already in the U.S., authorize them to work --that is what this is all about, obtaining a Green Card so they can work, pay taxes--and create a policy that is good for families and good for this country. It will correct past government mistakes and misdeeds that have kept hard-working immigrant families in bureaucratic limbo for far too long. 
   This is legislation that cannot wait. Families are being torn apart because we have failed to take the necessary steps to pass the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. Before the August recess, Democrats attempted to bring this legislation before the Senate, but the Republican leadership objected. Just last week, Democrats were prepared to debate and vote on this legislation as part of the high-tech visa bill, but our Republican colleagues were unwilling to bring this measure to the floor and take a vote. They prefer to talk about their support for the Latino community, rather than take tangible steps to benefit immigrant workers and their families. 
   Few days remain in this Congress, but we are committed to doing all we can to see that this legislation becomes law this year. Passage of this bill will be a victory for all who believe in justice, fairness, and the American dream. 
   There may be individuals who want to take issue with those observations I have made. We would be glad to debate them. We had, under the Democratic leader's proposal, indicated a willingness to limit amendments to, I believe, five amendments and to have short time agreements on all of those. We could have disposed of this whole legislation and done it in a way that would have expressed the will of the Senate. Instead, we are spending all week on it. We are spending virtually the whole week. With 3 weeks left, we are spending a whole week on this legislation and are still failing to deal with the fundamental issues of fairness which are within the legislation, although we will have an opportunity to deal with it, and that is the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I hope we will have that chance. I am confident Senator DASCHLE will give us that opportunity. We look forward to debating these issues. But we ought to be able to do that in the sunshine on the open floor of the Senate. Maybe there are those who differ, who believe this is not an issue of fairness. Maybe there are those who say we ought to have a dual standard, one standard for the high-tech industry and a different standard for those who basically track their heritage to Spanish tradition. 
   I cannot speak about what the reservation is, but I fail to be persuaded by any of the arguments I have seen so far about why we should not have fairness, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, as we are having fairness in the H-1B. Maybe there are those who will want to engage in that discussion and debate. I will look forward to participating in that as well. 
   Mr. President, I wanted to take a few moments now of the remaining time--I will only take 15 more minutes. 
   In addition, I want to mention briefly my sense of what, we ought to be addressing in the Senate. We are constantly reminded that we do not set the agenda, that it is the other side that sets the agenda. We have certainly learned that over the period of this year. But we want to let the millions of Americans who are out there, who care about these issues, know that there are Members in the Senate who are deeply committed to these areas of public policy and who want to take action and think action can be taken in the areas of education, education reform; in the area of prescription drug and prescription drug reform; in the area of patients' rights and patients' rights reform. I spoke yesterday about the importance of the minimum wage. 
   On the issues of education, what is of enormous concern to me is--I read earlier, into the RECORD, what was going to be the calendar established by the Republican leader. But I also want to read this, so we have a good idea of what the Republican leader has said on other occasions about education. This is the majority leader's promises on education. 
   On January 6, 1999:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year....... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   It is important for this reason: This will be the first time in 35 years--the first time in 35 years, if we do not reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that we have failed to do so. 
   Maybe there is a good reason for that. Maybe there are other higher priorities. But when the Senate spends 16  days debating the issue of bankruptcy, with 55 amendments, and then has a 6-day debate on education, and of the seven rollcall votes, three of them were virtually unanimous--we have not had the real debate and discussion the American people want. 
   Nonetheless, we have these promises, promises on education. This is what was said: 
   Remarks to U.S. Conference of Mayors Luncheon, January 29, 1999--But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to just be words. ..... 
   Press conference, June 22, 1999--Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year. 
   Remarks to U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000--We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been majority leader. ..... And Republicans are committed to doing that. 
   Speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, February 3, 2000--We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... Education will be a high priority in this Congress. 
   Congress Daily, April 20, 2000--..... Lott said last week his top priorities in May include an agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills. 
   Senate, May 1, 2000--This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education. 
   Press Stakeout, May 2, 2000-- 
   Question: Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? 
   Senator Lott. No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. ..... But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across this country and every state, including my own state. For us to have a good healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go. 
   Senate, May 9, 2000-- 
   Senator Kennedy: As I understand, ..... we will have an opportunity to come back to [ESEA] next week. Is that the leader's plan? 
   Senator Lott: That is my hope and intent.  
   Then on July 10:  
   I, too, would very much like to see us complete the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. I feel very strongly about getting it done. We can work day and night for the next 3 weeks.  
   Then finally, July 25:  
   We will keep trying to find a way to get back to the legislation and get it completed.  
   The reason we are not having a debate is because the majority thought there might be an amendment dealing with limiting the opportunity for children to obtain guns in school areas. That kind of outrageous question, about whether we were going to try to make our schools safer and more secure, once that was even mentioned, the word went out and we effectively found there was not going to be any more debate and discussion. 
   However, in 1994, under Republican leadership, the Republican leader actually cosponsored a weapons amendment. At that time, no one on that side of the aisle said: Oh, no, we are not going to consider it. That is not relevant to education. We want to make sure we are not only going to have smaller class sizes, better trained teachers, afterschool programs, modernization of schools, more technology available, greater accountability, preschool help and assistance for our children, but we want our children to be safe and we want them to be secure. 
   I think parents understand that and support it. 
   We are denied the opportunity to even vote on that. It used to be around here, years ago in the Senate--and also not that long ago--when people had differences, you settled them through debates and by votes. Now you settle them by not even bringing them up. 
   That is where we are: Nowhere, on the issues of education. 
   This is in spite of the fact we know that student enrollment will continue to rise in the foreseeable future. According to the U.S. Department of Education's 2000 Baby Boom Echo Report, between 1990 and the year 2000, growth in the K-12 student population has gone up by 6.6 million students, from 46.4 million to 53 million. And, even beyond the next ten years, the number of school-age children will continue to increase steadily. Between the year 2000 and the year 2100, the total will rise from 53 million to 94 million children, 41 million more children are going to be going to schools in this country. 
   Does anyone believe the education issue is going to go away? Does anyone think by not calling it up or giving it attention it is going to disappear? We used to debate these issues and then have resolution. 
   This is against the background that in more recent times, since 1980 to 1999, the Federal share of education funding has declined from 11 percent to 7.7 percent for elementary and secondary education, and 15 percent to 10 percent for higher education. I know there are Members who do not want any funding in elementary and secondary education. 
   I was here in 1994 when the new Republican leadership took over. The first thing they did was decrease funding for programs under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That was the first major debate. I know they have been in favor of abolishing the Department of Education. I am aware of that. Most parents think we ought to have a partnership and that we ought to move ahead. 
   I would like to mention just one other fact. More students today are taking advanced math and science courses. This is very encouraging since these rigorous classes provide the foundation that students need to acquire solid math knowledge. In precalculus, the percent who are taking advanced placement courses has increased from 31 percent to 44 percent; calculus, 19 percent to 24 percent; physics, 44 percent to 49 percent. 
   SAT math scores are the highest in 30 years. Modest, gains have been made, but the upward trend lines are very important, and they have consistently flowed upwards. This is important. We ought to be debating this. We ought to know what schools are doing to achieve that success. We ought to benefit from those schools' successes. We ought to give our support to those successful efforts. We ought to give flexibility to the local community to make sure their schools are successful. 
   Why can't we debate this? We have more children taking the SATs than have ever taken them before. All of these SAT math scores--for males and females--are following an upward trend. 
   But, our work is far from over. In spite of this promising news, the results so far are not enough. Now is not the time to be complacent. We still have enormous problems. We have them in my State and in many of our largest cities. In so many of these areas, we have teachers, parents, communities, business leaders, and workers who are prepared to do something. In my city of Boston, we had a net day. We were 48th out of 50 States in terms of access to the Internet. We had net days around our State. Now we are tenth, and it was all done voluntarily. 
   The IDEW in Boston laid 450 miles of cable and did it voluntarily. We had contributions from the software industries of tens of millions of dollars. Many helped the teachers in training programs. They were delighted to do it. They wanted to work on it. Things are happening. We are not saying we are the only solution, but what we are saying is let's find ways we can be supportive. We are not given that opportunity. 
   Finally, I want to mention two other areas. One is on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights. It has been just over a year since the House passed good Patients' Bill of Rights legislation--the bipartisan Norwood-Dingell bill. The Senate passed another bill that failed to meet these requirements. 
   I remind the American people, there is not a single medical organization that supports the Republican proposal. Not one. I have said that a dozen times. I have challenged the other side to come up with a single medical organization in this country that supports their proposal. There isn't any. Three hundred support ours. Every children's group, every women's group, every group representing the disabled, every medical group of every stripe has supported ours--North, South, East, and West. We still cannot get it. If the Republicans would let us vote on this again, we would have a majority of the Members of this body support the bipartisan proposal that passed the House of Representatives. The American people ought to know that the Senate leadership is keeping this bottled up. 
   This chart shows the particular protections and where they came from. I am not going to take the Senate's time now to read all of them. If one is looking at where these protections came from, access to emergency care was recommended by the Committee on the  Patient's Quality Commission, based of Democrats and Republicans. It was a unanimous recommendation. It is also from the insurance commissioners, the Association of Health Providers, plus it is already in Medicare. Every one of these protections has been out there one way or the other. We should be about the business of ensuring that the American people are going to get all the protections. 
   I see my good friend from the State of Florida who is doing such an important service to the Senate in bringing a historic perspective to the importance of a prescription drug bill, and the emotional and day-to-day reality that exists without these protections. 
   We still have a chance to vote on these issues. We have two different proposals that are basically before us. The one that Senator GRAHAM will introduce and support and that has broad support will ensure that individuals benefit from a prescription drug benefit program that lets doctors decide what is in their best interest. It can go into effect a year from now. That is enormously important. 
   The proposal that has been recommended on the other side consists of block grants that go to the States, in which 28 million American seniors will not participate because they will not be eligible. We will also have to wait until the money is actually appropriated by the Congress to those States. 
   States will need enabling legislation to provide those prescription drugs, and then sometime after 4 years, if there is a modernization program under Medicare, there can be a prescription drug benefit. If my colleagues want to take their chances and roll the dice, that is the way to go. If they want to have a dependable, reliable, stable, predictable benefit program, it should be under Medicare. The seniors understand that. They have confidence in it. They want it strengthened. We have a responsibility to do that. We can build on that program for a sound and effective future. 
   I will be glad to yield the remaining time to the Senator from Florida.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had hoped to be able to address some of the issues here this afternoon, but we will have to work out additional time later in the afternoon. 
   The appropriations bill that is before us effectively will increase the pay for Members of Congress by over $5,000 a year. I support that particular proposal, but we ought to know that that is what is effectively included in this legislation. That is there basically because of the Republican leadership. As I mentioned, I support that, as I have supported other pay increases in the past. 
   But what Americans should understand is the fact that on the one hand the Republican leadership is prepared to have a $5,000 increase in the pay of Members of Congress and still deny us the opportunity to vote for a 50-cent-an-hour increase this year and a 50-cent-an-hour increase next year for the hard-working Americans who are at the bottom end of the economic ladder. It is basically and fundamentally wrong. And the American people ought to understand it. 
   We have 2 1/2 weeks left. We ought to be able to make a judgment decision whether those Americans--some 10.1 million who will be affected by the increase in the minimum wage--ought to be able to have an increase in the minimum wage. We believe they should. We have fought to try to get that to happen. We have been limited in our opportunities to address that issue because of parliamentary tactics which have been used by the Republican majority in the Senate to deny us that. 
   No one needs a briefing about the issues on the increase in the minimum wage. They are basic. They are fundamental. Ninety-five percent of the Members of this body have voted on this issue. It would not take a great deal of time. We would be willing to enter into an hour equally divided if we were able to get an opportunity to vote on an increase in the minimum wage. 
   The American people ought to understand what the priorities are as we are coming to the last days of this Congress with 2 1/2 weeks left. This is an issue of priorities. The Republican leadership has said we will put this appropriations bill forward. They have basically sidetracked the whole debate on the education bill, even though that was a priority for them before and even though their standard bearer is out there talking about the importance of higher education. I wish that the candidate would just call up the majority leader and say: Put the education bill on the floor of the Senate. Why aren't you doing it? 
   We are going to be dealing with the H-1B legislation which is going to affect 100,000 visas and denying the opportunity to make other kinds of changes in that particular program. We are saying that that is more important than having a short debate on an increase in the minimum wage? 
   As my friend and colleague has pointed out--who are these people? They are basically people who are assistants to teachers, who work in the schools in this country. 
   Who are they? They are helping assistants to child care workers, who are looking after the children of working families. 
   Who are these people? They are assistants in nursing homes, who are looking after the parents who have retired and are now in nursing homes being taken care of either by their children in nursing homes or perhaps even under the Medicaid system. 
   These are the people who are minimum wage workers. They are the men and women who clean the buildings around this country. 
   What has happened to them over the period? I wish the Members of this body had seen the excellent piece on ABC this morning that talked about what is happening in the workforce. It pointed out that now the American worker is working longer than any other worker and that the rates of productivity have increased. Generally speaking, when you have an increase in productivity and you have workers willing to work more, they get an increase in their pay. Not here, not minimum wage workers. 
   What we have seen is that those at the top part of the economic ladder have been experiencing a very substantial increase and those on the bottom fifth of the economic ladder, which include the minimum wage workers, have actually fallen behind in their purchasing power. If we do not take action on an increase in the minimum wage in the final 2 1/2 weeks, then the increase we had 3 years ago will effectively be wiped out for these workers. That is quite a message; that is quite a priority. 
   Mr. President, I ask the Chair to advise me when I have 2 minutes remaining. 
   What has happened? We have offered this. And what has come back now from the other side, from the Republican leadership? They say: All right, we will let you have a 2-year increase in the minimum wage if you will agree to a $76 billion tax reduction for the wealthiest individuals in this country. Some deal, some deal for workers--$76 billion in tax reductions. You would think at least they would have the common sense just to do it for the small mom-and-pop stores. No. This is for the big boys, tax cuts, $76 billion. The last time we had an increase in the minimum wage, it was $21 billion. A lot of people thought that was too much. Seventy six billion dollars they want. And that isn't enough. 
   What they also want to do is wipe out time and a half for overtime for 73 million Americans, cut back on overtime pay. So you don't have to even pay, not only the minimum wage workers, but those above them, overtime pay. That is part of the deal: We will give 50 cents an hour to hard-working Americans this year and 50 cents next year. Give us the $76 billion. Let us be able to make other workers work. It will save us billions and billions and billions of dollars in terms of payroll. That is the deal they are offering. 
   Beyond that, I know this isn't a typical Republican position. They say: We are going to preempt the States that are out there in terms of the tax credit for workers in restaurants where they are able, instead of paying the full minimum wage, to say: We will only pay part. And if they get the rest in terms of tips, we don't have to make up the wages. That is a fine situation anyway. Someone is able to provide additional kinds of services; because of that, able to get a tip; and you are going to penalize them. We are going to put that into giving the credit to the employers. It is a lousy deal for workers in the  first place. The Restaurant Association and their employees have gone through the roof anyway since the last time we passed it. Nonetheless, what they are saying is, OK, here is one deal for the minimum wage, but because some of the States have been a little more understanding and a little more helpful to these workers, we will preempt those States. I don't hear any statements on the other side of the aisle: Well, we don't want one size fits all. If you eliminate ``one size fits all'' and ``Washington knows best'' from the Republican vocabulary, they haven't got much to say. On this bill, there is no consistency. Give us $76 billion. Let us eliminate overtime. Then we will have a deal. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are going to take every opportunity--and there will be some that will come down--to try to do something in terms of the minimum wage. 
   As I have said before, this is a women's issue because the majority of the recipients of the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue because a majority of the women who get the minimum wage have children. This is a family issue. We hear ``family values'' around here. This is a family values issue because whether those parents have time to spend with those children depends on income. It is a children's issue. 
   It is a civil rights issue because the great percentage of those who are out there working are men and women of color. And beyond that, it is fairness issue. In the United States of America, with the economy going right through the roof, with the greatest economic prosperity in the history of the Nation, we are going to say: If you work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, we don't think you ought to live in poverty. The Republican leadership refused to let us get a vote on this. That is absolutely unconscionable. The American people ought to understand it on election day. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of our top priorities in Congress is to improve public schools for all students--by reducing class size, improving training and support for teachers, expanding after-school programs, modernizing and building safe school facilities, and increasing accountability for results. But some in Congress advocate diverting scarce resources to subsidize private schools through vouchers, when it is public schools that need the help and support. 
   An article in today's Wall Street Journal by North Carolina Governor Jim Hunt eloquently explains why we should do more to support public schools, and why we should oppose private school vouchers. 
   Governor Hunt is a respected leader and renowned champion on education issues. He has been a strong advocate for many years for improving public schools, particularly by upgrading curricula, supporting better teacher training, and increasing early childhood education opportunities. As Governor Hunt states, it would be a step in the wrong direction to undermine these important priorities by relying on voucher schemes, just as we are starting to see solid results in improved student achievement.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator Daschle, Senator Moynihan, and other colleagues in introducing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000. This bill takes the next step in our continued effort to restore the excessive Medicare cuts in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. This legislation also includes several proposals to ease the financial burden and improve care for all beneficiaries. It also includes important proposals to increase the effectiveness of Medicaid and the children's Health Insurance Program, and to improve access to care for vulnerable populations, including legal immigrant children and pregnant women. Our goal is to pass this legislation before the end of the year. 
   The cost-saving measures enacted by Congress as part of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 have turned out to be far deeper than the estimates at that time, and these excessive cuts have put countless outstanding health care institutions across the country at risk. 
   In Massachusetts, 25 percent of home health agencies no longer serve Medicare patients. Forty-three nursing homes have closed in the state since 1998, and another 20 percent are in bankruptcy. Two out of every three hospitals in Massachusetts are losing money on patient care. 
   The record surpluses we currently enjoy and anticipate in the years ahead are partly due to the savings achieved by cutting Medicare in the BBA. Most of these savings came from policy and payment reforms, including actual cuts in payments for various services. While some changes were clearly justified, the overall cuts were much deeper than intended and are too severe to sustain. 
   Last year, in passing the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 1999, we made a good start. It gave needed relief to Medicare providers. But when we enacted that bill last year, we also knew that it was only a down-payment, and that additional relief would be needed. 
   The bill we are introducing today follows through on that commitment. It would invest $80 billion over 10 years to restore payments to Medicare and Medicaid providers, improve benefits, and increase access to health care under Medicaid and CHIP. It provides the funding needed to allow these essential health professionals and institutions to do what they do best--provide the best health care possible for elderly and disabled Americans on Medicare. It will ensure that the nation's health care system is able to care responsibly for today's senior citizens, and is adequately prepared to take care of those who will be retiring in the future. 
   No senior citizen should be forced to enter a hospital or a nursing home because Medicare can't afford to pay for the services that will keep her in her own home and in her own community. 
   No person with a disability should be told that occupational therapy services are no longer available. Because legislation to balance the budget reduced the rehabilitation services they need. 
   No community should be told that their number one employer and provider of health care will be closing its doors or engaging in massive layoffs, because Medicare can no longer pay its fair share of health costs. 
   No freestanding children's hospital should wonder whether it can continue to train providers to care for children, because of uncertain federal support for its teaching activities. 
   Yet these scenes and many others are playing out in towns and cities across the country today, in large part due to the excessive cuts required by the Balanced Budget Act three years ago. 
   With the retirement of the baby boom generation, the last thing we  should do is jeopardize the viability and commitment of the essential institutions that care for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet that is now happening in cities and towns across the nation. In the vast majority of cases, the providers who care for Medicare patients are the same providers who care for working families and everyone else in their community. When hospitals who serve Medicare beneficiaries are threatened, health care for the entire community is threatened too. 
   This legislation is an important step to maintain excellence throughout our health care system. I commend Senator Daschle and Senator Moynihan for their leadership on this vital issue. It deserves prompt consideration by the Finance Committee and the entire Senate, and it should be enacted into law before we adjourn.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership on this important legislation and it is a privilege to join him as a cosponsor on this legislation. I also commend the thirty-four youth organizations that comprise the National Collaboration for Youth and the more than 200 young people who have worked on this bill. They have been skillful and tireless in their efforts to focus on the need for a positive national strategy for youth. 
   Our goal in introducing the Younger Americans Act is to establish a national policy for youth which focuses on young people, not as problems, but as problem solvers. The Younger Americans Act is intended to create a local and nation-wide collaborative movement to provide programs that offer greater support for youth in the years of adolescence. This bill, modeled on the very successful Older Americans Act of 1965, will help youths between the ages of 10 and 19. It will provide assistance to communities for youths development programs that assure that all youth have access to the skills and character development needed to become good citizens. 
   In other successful bipartisan measures over the years, such as Head Start, child care, and the 21st century learning communities, we have created a support system for parents of preschool and younger school-age children. These programs reduce the risk that children will grow up to become juvenile delinquents by giving them a healthy and safe start. It's time to do the same thing for adolescents. 
   Americans overwhelmingly believe that government should invest in initiatives like this. Many studies detail the effectiveness of youth development programs. Beginning with the Carnegie Corporation Report in 1992, ``A Matter of Time--Risk and Opportunity in the Nonschool Hours,'' a series of studies have shown repeatedly that youth development programs at the community level produce powerful and positive results. 
   In this report this last March, ``Community Counts: How Youth Organizations Matter for Youth Development,'' Milbrey McLaughlin, professor of education at Stanford University, calls for communities to rethink how they design and deliver services for youths, particularly during non-school hours. The report confirms that community involvement is essential in creating and supporting effective programs that meet the needs of today's youth. 
   Effective community-based youth development programs build on five core resources that all youths need to be successful. These same core resources are the basis for the Younger Americans Act. Youths need ongoing relationships with caring adults, safe places with structured activities, access to services that promote healthy lifestyles, opportunities to acquire marketable skills, and opportunities for community service and community participation. 
   The Younger Americans Act will establish a way for communities to give thought and planning on the issues at the local level, and to involve both youths and parents in the process. The Act will provide $5.76 billion over the next five years for communities to conduct youth development programs that recognize the primary role of the family, promote the involvement of youth, coordinate services in the community, and eliminate barriers which prevent youth from obtaining the guidance and support they need to become successful adults. The Act also creates a national youth policy office and a national youth council to advise the President and Congress and help focus the country more effectively on the needs of young people. 
   Too often, the focus on youth has emphasized their problems, not their successes and their potential. This emphasis has sent a negative message to youth that needs to be reversed. We need to deal with negative behaviors, but we also need a broader strategy that provides a positive approach to youth. The Younger Americans Act will accomplish this goal in three ways, by focusing national attention on the strengths and contributions of youths, by providing funds to develop positive and cooperative youth development programs at the state and community levels, and by promoting the involvement of parents and youths in developing positive programs that strengthen families. 
   The time of adolescence is a complex transitional period of growth and change. We know what works. The challenge we face is to provide the resources to implement positive and practical programs effectively. Investing in youth in ways like that will pay enormous dividends for communities and our country. I urge all members of Congress to join in supporting this important legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this has been a very difficult debate for all of us in the Senate who care about labor rights, about human rights, and about the environment in China. 
   These issues are important, and we can't ignore them. I especially commend the many leaders throughout the country on labor issues, human rights issues, and environmental issues for  stating their case and their concerns on these challenges so eloquently and effectively. It's clear that we must do more than this agreement does to make sure that free trade is also fair--that it improves the quality of life of people everywhere, and creates good jobs here at home. 
   The demonstrations at last year's WTO negotiations in Seattle and in other cities since then show that we must pay much greater attention to these concerns. Too often the current system of trade enriches multi-national corporations at the expense of working families, leaving workers without jobs and without voices in the new global economy. Too many companies export high-wage, full-benefit jobs from our country and replace them with lower-paying jobs in the third world countries with few, if any, benefits. 
   For too many families across America, globalization has become a ``race to the bottom'' in wages, benefits, and living standards. In recent years, corporate stock prices have often increased in almost direct proportion to employee layoffs, benefit reductions, and job exports. This growing inequality threatens our own economic growth and prosperity, and we must do all we can to end it. 
   I am also very concerned about a trade deficit that continues to grow at an alarming pace. In this historic time of economic prosperity, the trade deficit remains one of the most stubborn challenges we face. While the current trade deficit is clearly a sign that the U.S. economy is the strongest economy in the world, we cannot sustain this enormous negative balance of trade for the long term. We risk losing even more of our industrial and manufacturing base to foreign countries with lower labor standards. 
   Similarly, all of us who care about human rights and environmental rights must find more effective ways to address these concerns. The flagrant violations of human rights that continue to take place in China are unacceptable. And so is the callous disregard of the environment by that nation as its economy advances. 
   The answer to these festering problems is to give these fundamental issues a fair place at international bargaining tables. Clearly, we do not do enough for labor rights, human rights, and the environment when we negotiate trade agreements. 
   I intend to vote for this agreement, however--as flawed as it is--because I am concerned that the alternative would be even less satisfactory. But I welcome the Administration's commitment to give these other issues higher priority in future trade negotiations, and I look forward to working to achieve these essential goals. 
   The global marketplace is a reality, and the United States stands to gain much more by participating in it than by rejecting it. I'm hopeful that we will be able to work together in the future on these basic issues in ways that bring us together, not divide us. 
   It is especially significant that all of the economic concessions made in this agreement are made by China. It will not change our own market access policies at all. The concessions that China has made are substantial, and President Clinton and his Administration deserve credit for this success. In particular, US Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky did a excellent job negotiating this agreement for the United States. 
   By approving PNTR, Congress is not deciding to accept China into the World Trade Organization. China will join the WTO regardless of our vote in Congress. What Congress is deciding is whether to accept or reject the extraordinary economic concessions that China has offered to the United States. If we reject PNTR, we reject the bulk of the concessions that China reluctantly made. We would be allowing China to keep its barriers up--and we might well be inviting the WTO to impose sanctions against us for not playing by the rules we agreed to. 
   Within five years, under this agreement, China will completely end its tariffs on information technology. It will eliminate its geographical limitations on the sale of financial services and insurance. It will do away with quotas on products such as fiber-optic cable. And it will end the requirement to hire a Chinese government ``middle-man'' to sell and distribute products and services in China. These are major concessions that no one could have predicted even two years ago. 
   China has also agreed to eliminate export subsidies. The inefficient, state-owned industries in China will no longer be able to rely on government support to stay afloat. They will be required to compete on a level playing field. China has agreed that its state-owned industries will make decisions on purely commercial terms, and will allow US companies to operate on the same terms. 
   The agreement also contains strong provisions against unfair trade and import surges. We will have at our disposal effective measures to prevent the dumping of subsidized products into American markets for years to come. The agreement contains strong and immediate protections for intellectual property rights, which will benefit important US industries such as software, medical technology, and publishing. Strong protections are also included against forced technology transfer from private companies to the Chinese government--a provision that has benefits for both commercial enterprises and national security. 
   All of these protections and concessions will be lost if Congress fails to pass PNTR. Rejection of this agreement would put American businesses and workers at a major disadvantage with our competitors in Europe and in many other nations in securing access to the largest market in the world. 
   One out of every ten jobs in Massachusetts is dependent upon exports, and that number is increasing. If we accept the concessions that China has given us, companies in cities and towns across the state will be more competitive. More exports will be stimulated, and more jobs will be created here at home. 
   It is clear that many of our businesses will reap significant benefits from this trade agreement. But it is also clear that some businesses and workers will be hurt by it as well. It is our responsibility to do everything we can to reduce the harm that free trade creates. We must strengthen trade adjustment assistance and worker training programs. As we open our doors wider to the global economy, we must do much more to ensure that American workers are ready to compete. We must make the education and training of our workforce a higher priority as we ask our citizens to compete with workers across the globe. Importing skilled foreign labor is no substitute for fully developing the potential of our domestic workforce. The growth in the global marketplace makes education and training more important than ever. 
   We need to create high-tech training opportunities on a much larger scale for American workers who currently hold relatively low-paying jobs and wish to obtain new skills to enhance their employability and improve their earning potential. As the economy becomes more global and more competitive, it would be irresponsible to open the doors to new foreign competition, without giving our own workers the skills they need to compete and excel. I'm very hopeful that passage of this agreement will provide a strong new incentive for more effective action by Congress on all these important issues. 
   The issue of PNTR also involves major foreign policy and national security considerations. When China joins the World Trade Organization, it will be required to abide by the rules and regulations of the international community. The Chinese government will be obligated to publish laws and regulations and to submit important decisions to international review. By integrating China into this global, rules-based system, the international community will have procedures never available in the past to hold the government of China accountable for its actions, and to promote the development of the rule of law in China. 
   The WTO agreement will encourage China to continue its market reforms and support new economic freedoms. Already, 30 percent of the Chinese economy is privatized. Hard-line Chinese leaders fear that as China becomes more exposed to Western ideas, their grip on power will be weakened, along with their control over individual citizens. 
   As the economic situation improves, China will be able to carry out broader  and deeper reforms. While economic reforms are unlikely to result immediately and directly in political reforms, they are likely to produce conditions that will be more conducive to democracy in China in the years ahead. 
   All of us deplore China's abysmal record on human rights and labor rights and the environment, and we have watched with dismay as these abuses have continued. It is unlikely that approving PNTR will lead to an immediate and dramatic improvement in China's record on these fundamental issues. But after many years of debate, the pressure created by the annual vote on China's trade status has not solved those problems either. 
   Approving PNTR leaves much to be desired on all of these essential issues. But on balance, I believe that it can be a realistic step toward achieving the long-sought freedoms that will benefit all the people of China. The last thing we need is a new Cold War with China.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I note that we are going to hear from former Vice President Quayle at 6 p.m., and Senator STEVENS wanted to address the Senate. Just as a point of information, I welcome the chance to be able to address the Senate tomorrow. If the Senator is going to continue for a while, if he could let us know, because I wanted to have the opportunity to hear from Mr. Quayle and also to accommodate Senator STEVENS. The Senator is addressing a very important matter that is relevant to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona. Could he give us any indication?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join my colleagues in introducing the Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act. I commend Senators JEFFORDS, ENZI and REID for their effective work on this bill that is vitally important to health care professionals and all Americans who come in contact with them. 
   The need for needle stick protection is compelling. Last year alone, there were almost 800,000 needle stick injuries to health care professionals. Over 1,000 health care workers were infected with serious diseases, including HIV, Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C. Sadly, all of these injuries were preventable. The good news is that through the provisions of this bill, many future needle stick injuries will be prevented. In fact, the Center for Disease Prevention estimates that needle stick injuries will be reduced by as much as 88 percent. 
   But as is so often the case, numbers alone cannot convey the full story of human tragedy resulting from these injuries. One of my constituents, Karen Daley of Boston, is the President of the Massachusetts Nurses Association and was a registered nurse, a job she loved and found very fulfilling. In January 1999, while working in an emergency room in Boston, Karen was accidentally stuck by a contaminated needle. Six months later, she tested positive for HIV and Hepatitis C. Fortunately, Karen is in relative good health, although she will never again be able to practice her chosen profession of nursing. 
   The Needle Stick Safety and Prevention Act is intended to prevent tragic accidents like this. This bill requires employers to implement the use of safety-designed needles and sharps to reduce the potential transmission of disease to health care workers and patients. This bill also provides that employers establish an injury log to record the kind of devices, and the location, of all needle stick accidents. 
   Equally important, this bill allows non-managerial employees--those on the front lines of service delivery--to be involved in determining the appropriate devices used in health care settings. 
   This bill has bipartisan support in the Senate and the House. It also is supported by the American Hospital Association, the American Nurses Association, the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of Federal, State County and Municipal Employees. 
   I urge all of my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to join us in supporting this important bill, and I am hopeful that it can be enacted into law before this session of Congress ends.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to commend a fellow Massachusetts resident, William F. Hofmann of Belmont, who will be installed as President of the nation's largest insurance association--the Independent Insurance Agents of America--next month in Orlando, Florida. Bill is a partner in Provider Insurance Group, which has offices in Belmont, Brookline and Needham. 
   Bill's impressive career as an independent insurance agent has been marked by outstanding dedication to his clients and his community. He began his service in the insurance industry with the Independent Insurance Agents of Massachusetts, where he served as president. He also represented Massachusetts on the IIAA's National Board of State Directors. In 1980, he was honored with the Mr. Chairman's Award'' by the American Association of Managing General Agents' for his distinguished service as chairman of its Education Committee. 
   Bill was elected to IIAA's Executive Committee in September 1995 and was honored by his peers when they named him President-Elect of the Association last fall. He will be inaugurated as President next month during the annual meeting in Orlando. 
   As a member of the Executive Committee leadership panel, Bill has worked to strengthen the competitive standing of independent insurance agents by helping to provide the tools they need to operate more successful businesses. 
   Before joining the IIAA's national leadership team, Bill was active on several of its committees. He served as chairman of the Education Committee for four years, and in 1994 he received a Presidential Citation for his work in this area. 
   Bill also has distinguished himself as an active and concerned member of his community. He served as president and on the Board of Directors of the Boston Children's Service. He also has been active in the Belmont Youth Basketball program, the Chamber of Commerce, and the Boosters Club. He has served as chairman of the Belmont Red Cross and as treasurer of the Belmont Religious Council. Bill is also an elected town meeting member, finance committee member, and registrar of voters in Belmont. 
   I am proud of Bill's accomplishments, and I know that he will have a successful year as president of the  Independent Insurance Agents of America. As his past accomplishments demonstrate, Bill will serve his fellow insurance agents with distinction, and provide them with strong leadership. I extend my warmest congratulations to Bill and his wife Marilyn as the incoming President and First Lady of this distinguished organization.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   First of all, I commend my friend and colleague from Florida on an excellent presentation and one that commends itself to the common sense of all of us in the Senate. 
   The fact is the Medicare program was built upon the existing programs in 1965. Since that time, we have discovered the importance of preventive health care--how important it is in keeping people healthy and how important it is for actually saving Medicare funds over a long period of time. The Senator from Florida has indicated a pathway we might follow to deal seriously with these issues. We should not have to explain to this body that for every $1 we spend for immunizations, we save $8 to $9 by preventing disease. 
   I admire and am a strong supporter of the administration's series of recommendations for preventive care. The Senator from Florida has outlined a process and system where we can finally take action on these recommendations. 
   The bottom line is the Budget Committee doesn't take into consideration the savings from preventive care so this body has been extremely slow in enacting these programs. But these preventive measures make a great deal of sense. They make sense for ensuring good quality health care for the families of this country, and they make sound economic sense. I certainly agree with the Senator that along with preventive care, we ought to understand the importance of prescription drugs. I think what he has outlined today is enormously important for us to consider. 
   I will take a few moments to move beyond this very excellent presentation into what the challenge is for all of us in the Congress over these next 5 weeks. There is time, I believe, to take action on a good prescription drug program. We have, now, two different systems which have been offered to the American people. The first is the proposal that was advanced initially by President Clinton and is now enhanced by Vice President GORE. The proposal has been changed--not really dramatically--but I think it has been more carefully attuned to the needs of Medicare enrollees than the alternative which has been presented by Governor Bush. 
   I hope even in the short time that remains--when we conclude the action on trade issues we still have more than 3 weeks of Senate time--I hope we can still take action on a minimum wage. Every Member of this body knows that issue well. We know what is before us. We ought to take action on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a bipartisan effort to try to do that. There have been some suggestions and recommendations in order to accommodate some of those who voted against this previously. We now, hopefully, will gain support for those proposals. 
   Finally, and very importantly, the other remaining issue which is of vital importance to seniors is a prescription drug program. Let me mention quickly some of the concerns I have about this program and some of the advantages that I believe are in the Vice President's program. 
   The Vice President's program is built upon Medicare. We have heard on the floor of the Senate the Medicare system is a one-size-fits-all program. The fact is that seniors understand Medicare. They support Medicare. They understand there have to be some changes in the Medicare program but, nonetheless, it is a tried, tested process and it is one which offers the necessary flexibility. 
   What has been proposed by the Vice President is a prescription drug program that goes into effect a year from now, and is gradually phased in over a period of time. The seniors of this country would have a benefit for prescription drugs a year from now. I think that is very important and one of the most compelling parts of the Vice President's program. 
   The alternative is the proposal offered by Governor Bush. I read here from the Governor's own proposal. It says in his 
   proposal that effectively it will be a block grant program that will in effect ensure low-income seniors do not have to wait for overall reform. 
   Our seniors ought to have some pause, because he is talking about  overall reform of the Medicare system. That ought to bring some pause. We do not really know what overall reform is. I think most seniors would say: We have confidence in the Medicare system. We want a program that will get the benefits to us quickly. 
   He says that low-income people will not have to wait for the overall reform. We are not sure what that really means. To have your prescription drugs covered, Governor Bush will establish the immediate helping hand which will provide $48 billion to States for 4 years to deal with low income seniors. So it will be 4 years before 27 million seniors will be able to participate because there are 27 million seniors who do not fall within Governor Bush's definition of those who need an immediate helping hand. Those 27 million seniors will wait 4 years--and then wait for the overall Medicare reform. The Vice President's plan goes into effect 1 year from now. 
   Second--and I think enormously important--is what we call the guaranteed benefit. This is very simple. A guaranteed benefit means the doctor will make the decision on your prescription drug needs. When seniors go in--whatever their condition, whatever their disease, whatever their problem--the doctor makes the recommendation as to what prescription drug is needed. That is fundamental. That is the guaranteed benefit. 
   That is not true with regard to the Governor's proposal. It will be the HMO that the individual is enrolled in that will decide. We will find that the HMO will make the decision about what prescription drugs are covered--whether it will be the only drug on the HMO's formulary, or whether other kinds of prescription drugs will be permitted to be used. 
   That is interesting, is it not, Mr. President? Most seniors want the doctor to make the recommendation. This underlies the basic difference between our two parties on the prescription drug issue. 
   We are for the Patients' Bill of Rights so doctors are allowed to make health care decisions. We want to make sure that doctors are going to make decisions about prescription drugs rather than turning this right over to the HMO. 
   Finally, what is being established under the Gore proposal is very clear. The government and the Medicare beneficiary will have a shared responsibility in paying for prescription drugs. There will not be any deductibles. There will be a premium, and half of the premium will be paid for by the Federal Government. 
   Under the Bush proposal, we do not know what the HMO is going to charge. There is no prohibition against a deductible and we do not know what the copayments will be. We have no idea what the premium will be. The Governor says the government will pay 25 percent of whatever the premium is, but there is no assurance to seniors that there is not going to be a sizable deductible in that program. The size of the deductible is a mystery. 
   Under the Vice President's program, we can give assurance today that when the program goes into effect, as part of the Medicare program, whatever that senior citizen needs, if the doctor prescribes it, that senior citizen will get it. 
   Those who are opposed to Vice President GORE's program, who support the Governor's proposal, cannot make that claim. They cannot tell us what the premiums are going to be over a period of time because they are not spelled out, at least in the papers that have been made available. 
   The only thing that we know--which causes many of us a great deal of concern--is that after 4 years, after overall reform of the Medicare system, then there will be a program for prescription drugs. That is a long time to wait. That is a very long time to wait. What I have found in my State is that people want a prescription drug program and they need it now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the final points I want to make are that 70 percent of Medicare beneficiaries, more than 27 million seniors, will not even be eligible for Governor Bush's immediate helping hand program. 
   Finally, the nation's Governors have already rejected the block grant approach. Republican and Democratic Governors have said: This will be a massive administrative nightmare for our States; we do not want the responsibility even if it is going to be funded. We can understand that. 
   We have an important opportunity to make a difference for our seniors with a good prescription drug program. Let's reach across the aisle. Let's join forces. Let's try to get the job done before we recess. The opportunity is there. We are willing to do that, but we need to have a response from the other side and a willingness of the Republican leadership to try to get the job done. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know we are very much involved in this extremely important decision on the question of trade with China, but I do want to take a few moments this morning to address another issue which I think is of central concern to families across this country. 
   I think it is particularly appropriate that we give additional focus and attention to the priority of education policy as we are coming into the final days of this session of Congress. I think there is a heightened interest in this issue as some 53 million children are going back to school. They have started going back to school in the last 10 days and are going back to school this week. And, fifteen million children are going to colleges, going back to school now, this week and next. 
   Parents are wondering what the circumstances will be for their children this school year and in the future, and who is going to ensure their children are going to get an adequate education and will move ahead. Parents understand full well that education is key to the future for their children and, obviously, education is key to our country's future as we are moving more and more into a new information-age and technologically-advanced global economy. This is a matter of enormous urgency. 
   We understand that there is a fundamental responsibility for the education of children in the elementary and secondary high schools of this country at the local and State level and that the role of the Federal Government is much more limited. Approximately 7 cents out of every dollar that is spent locally actually comes from the Federal Government. 
   In my travels around my State of Massachusetts, in talking to parents, they are interested in a partnership. They are interested in their children doing well. They want support for programs that work, and they are less interested in the division of authority between local and State governments and the participation of Congress in assisting academic achievement. 
   The backbone of congressional participation in the education of children is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is an act of enormous importance. It is not only myself who is saying this, but we have the statements of the majority leader, Senator LOTT, who in January 1999 indicated:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. ..... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   Remarks to the Conference of Mayors on January 29, 1999:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not just going to be words.......  
   Press conference, June 22, 1999:  
   Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year.  
   Remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been majority leader. ..... And Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   A speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   Congress Daily, April 20, 2000:  
   ..... Lott said last week his top priorities in May include agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills.  
   Senate, May 1:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   Press Stakeout, May 2.  
   Question: Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? 
   Senator LOTT: No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. ..... But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across the country and every State, including my own State. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go.  
   Those are the assurances we have been given by the majority leader, and we have had 6 days of discussion about elementary education. Two of those days were discussion only. We had a total of eight amendments, seven rollcalls, one voice vote, and three of those seven were virtually unanimous. So we have not had this debate which not only the majority leader has said is important, 
   but which families believe is important. The reason they believe it is important is because of the substance of education policy that will be included in that debate. I remind the Senate where we are on the expansion of the number of children enrolled in school. In K-12 enrollment, it is at an all-time high. In 1990, 46 million K-12 children were enrolled, and by the year 2000, 53 million children. There are increasing pressures on local communities across the country. 
   This chart shows that student enrollment will continue to rise over the next century. There are 53 million students enrolled in the year 2000, but if you look at the projections, 94 million are estimated to be enrolled by the year 2100--41 million more students over the next century, virtually doubling the Nation's population in education which will require building schools and hiring more qualified teachers all across this country. 
   This is a matter of enormous importance to national policy and family policy. We believe we should not give short shrift to debating what our policies may be. We may have some differences on different sides of the aisle, but we should be debating these policy issues. 
   On the issue of priorities this year, such as bankruptcy--which we debated for 16 days, we had 55 amendments; 16 days on bankruptcy, 55 amendments. As I mentioned, we had eight amendments on elementary and secondary education. Three were unanimous and one vote was by a voice vote. So we really have not met our responsibilities, I do not believe, on debating education policy.  
   I strongly favor Federal commitment and investment in programs that have been tried, tested, and proven to be effective and that can be implemented at the local level and have a positive impact on the children.  
   I want to take a moment to bring the Senate up to speed about what is happening in schools across the country. More students are taking the SAT test: In 1980, 33 percent; 1985, 36 percent; 40 percent in 1990; 42 percent in 1995; 44 percent in 2000. More and more of the children in this country are recognizing the importance of taking the scholastic aptitude test. Children are aware they have to apply themselves, as reflected in the number of students taking the test, and that college education is the key to success in America. Also, the results have been positive. Even though more students are taking the SAT, and the students are more diverse, math scores are the highest in 30 years. But, in order to sustain the gains made, children need to continue to have well-qualified teachers, they need an investment in preschool programs, they need afterschool programs, they have to have available to them the latest technologies so they can move ahead in their academic work.  
   This is another chart showing more students are taking advanced math and science classes. This reflects 1990 to 2000: Precalculus, in 1990, was 31 percent. It is now 44 percent. Calculus, 19 percent in 1990; 24 percent in 2000. In physics, 44 percent in 1990 to 49 percent in 2000. 
   We are finding more students are taking college level courses, advanced placement courses, the more challenging courses, and they are doing better and better in these undertakings. 
   However, our work is far from over. We cannot get away from the fact that there are many others in our country, in urban areas and rural areas, who are facing extraordinary challenges. 
   Those disadvantaged children are really the ones on which we are focused in terms of the Federal elementary and secondary education programs. 
   Basically, there are important ways in which we can give some help and assistance to these children. We believe in smaller class sizes, with well-trained teachers, and afterschool programs. We believe in making sure the children are going to be ready to learn, either through the Head Start Program or through helping and assisting local groups to try to give help and assistance to those children as they are preparing, even for Head Start, the ready-to-learn program, which basically was a goal we agreed to--Democrats and Republicans alike--in their conference in Charlottesville about 10 years ago. That is an area in which we have not been able to gain support, although we have a bipartisan proposal that is actually currently pending--would be pending were we to get back to the elementary and secondary education bill. 
   We believe the success of the STAR Program in Tennessee and also in the State of Wisconsin demonstrates the importance of smaller classrooms. Also, all of the various studies have shown quite clearly the importance of having well-trained teachers. 
   We can learn from States that have moved ahead in providing adequate compensation of teachers, such as Connecticut, North Carolina, and other States, and that have shown that when you have teachers who are well trained and well paid, you get an enhanced academic achievement for these students. 
   We support afterschool programs--they have a tremendous impact on helping children to enhance their academic achievement. 
   We should also make college more accessible to every qualified student through GEAR UP and college tuition help, the excellent proposal that has been advanced by Vice President Gore to provide a tax deduction for tuition for children, for parents whose children are going on to college. 
   Also, in the area of skills training, we tried to address that in an amendment. We actually were able to get a majority in the Senate to support the restoring of a training program, but we have been unable to get that implemented because there was a point of order made against it. We had to amend a bill which did not make it possible for us to carry that forward into a conference. 
   All of these are matters of enormous importance. We have been impressed--I have--by the debate and discussion at the national level about the Vice President's proposal to understand that learning has to be a continuum and that skills training has to be a continuum. 
   I often am reminded of the fact that when I first was elected to the Senate, we had a very efficient shipyard down in Fall River, MA. The workers who worked there, their fathers worked there, their grandfathers worked there. More often than not, the sons wanted to work there. But there has been a change. That yard has been closed. Now what we find out is--not only there but across my own State of Massachusetts and across the country--everyone who enters the job market is going to have, on average, seven different jobs over the course of their lifetime. 
   We have to be able to have continuing education and training programs accessible and available to young and old alike, so that people are going to be able to upgrade their skills. That is enormously important. It is enormously important not only to the young, but it is enormously important to communities such as mine, Massachusetts, where we have an older workforce--we have a transition from a lot of the older industries into newer kinds of industries--and where the real difference is in the development of skills. 
   We would have the opportunity to address many of those issues I have very briefly mentioned in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We certainly would be able to address universal preschool, the issues of qualified teachers, and the importance of 
   skills training that is going to be school based. We could address modern and safe schools. We would be able to address afterschool opportunities, smaller class sizes, and the higher education issues. 
   Lifelong training would perhaps not be exactly targeted in those programs, but we will have an opportunity to address that, I believe, in the final budget negotiations that are going to be taking place between the two Houses, and with the appropriations. Being able to have a clear indication about where we in the Congress stand on these issues could be enormously instructive in terms of allocating scarce resources. 
   I just want to say, we are continually frustrated that we have not been able to get this matter back up in the Senate for debate. We note that we were on a two-track agenda just last week, where we did the trade issues during the day and the appropriations in the evening. We would like to suggest that we could do the trade issues, as they are going along, but we are prepared to move ahead to consider the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the evenings. We could consider it this week, next week, until we have reached a conclusion to it. We recognize the importance of it. 
   If we are looking around for priorities--we heard last week about the importance of a lockbox; and we ought to certainly address that issue before we adjourn--but I daresay for most families, this week is education week as their children go back to school. They want to know what they might be able to expect from the Congress, what kind of partnership should they be able to expect, and we should not just give them silence, which we effectively are giving them. 
   I welcome the fact that this week we are having Vice President Gore speak on the various aspects of education for a series of days in different parts of the country. I would like to see a national debate on education. I would like to see him out there speaking about it. I would like to have seen Governor Bush speaking about it. I would like to see the engagement of their ideas in the forums of their debates. But we ought to be discussing these issues here on the floor of the Senate. That is something I think is of importance. 
   Every day we let this go by, every day that we refuse to bring this up, I think we are denying the American people the kind of debate on an issue they care about, which they deserve. We hear both of the candidates talk about education. Let the record just demonstrate that we, on our side, want to get back and debate this issue. We want to take action on it. We are prepared to go forward on it. We do not need phone calls from the Vice President on this. We are prepared to go ahead--and go ahead today, tonight, any other time, on it. 
   We wish the Governor would call the Republican leadership and say: Look, I am interested in the education issues as well. Why don't you go ahead and have a good debate on that issue and in the Senate. Let me tell you what my positions are. Let's have a debate. Let's let the American people understand. Let's give them a window into this discussion, which is so important for families in this country. Let's not exclude them. 
   I can imagine, as the Vice President is going around talking about education, there are going to be people saying: What is happening in the Congress? I hope he understands that we, on this side, are prepared to have these matters debated, discussed, and resolved. We wish we could join with our colleagues on the other side to do so. 
   Historically, the issues on education have never been really partisan. We have some differences in terms of accountability, which the Vice President strongly supports. But we believe we ought to be able to have a debate and discussion in the Senate on this issue. We think we are denying the American people the opportunity. 
   So I would invite the Governor to contact the Republican leadership here  and say: If you are really interested in education, let's bring the elementary and secondary education bill back to the floor. Let's debate it. 
   We are glad to consider it in the evening time. We have now just about a month left in this session of the Senate. We ought to be resolving the issues on education, on the Patients' Bill of Rights, on prescription drugs, and on the increase in the minimum wage. If we did those four, if we took care of those four issues, I think we could say that this was a Congress of considerable achievement and considerable accomplishment. 
   Those are central, focused issues about which both of the candidates are talking. But they are speaking all over the country; they are not speaking to us here in the Senate. We have no debate on minimum wage. We are not getting back to the minimum wage or prescription drugs. We aren't getting back to education. 
   Since we are not going to be able to do that and have it rescheduled, we are going to have to take whatever steps we possibly can on whatever bills that are going to come up in the remaining days. We want to do this well. We want to do it with the understanding of the leadership on both sides. But if we are not going to be able to get focus and attention on these issues, then we are going to have to take whatever opportunity we have, on any of the measures that are coming down the line, in trying to press the people's business in the form of education. And that I commit we will do. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, senior citizens need a drug benefit under Medicare. They've earned it by a lifetime of hard work, and they deserve it. It is time for Congress to enact it. The clock is running out on this Congress, but it is not too late for the House and Senate to act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. September 7, 1999: Ignacio Barba, 25, Oakland, CA; Ernest Bolton, 48, Dallas, TX; Steven Celestine, 5, Miami, FL; Fareed J. Chapman, 19, Chicago, IL; Selester Edward, 21, Louisville, KY; Samuel Girouard, 18, Bellingham, WA; Allen Howe, 32, New Orleans, LA; Robert Jenkins, 29, Charlotte, NC; Leo Kidd, 28, Detroit, MI; Alvin Marshall, 45, Pittsburgh, PA; Stacy Stewart, 28, St. Louis, MO; William Thornes, 23, Washington, DC; Darrly Towns, 15, Detroit, MI; Dao Vo, 19, Seattle, WA; Bathsheba Woodall, 23, Philadelphia, PA. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned was only five years old. Steven Celestine, a little boy from Miami, was shot and killed one year ago today by his own father, as his mother tried to protect him in her arms during an argument between the parents. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of this small child and the others I named are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see my colleagues on the floor. I note that my colleague from New Mexico was here waiting before I came to the floor and before my friend from Iowa arrived. I know he has an important short subject matter. He has not been recognized in the consent agreement, and I want to accommodate all. 
   I believe I am entitled to 30 minutes; I expect to be able to complete my remarks in a shorter period. I want to accommodate the Senator from New Mexico. I will speak 20 minutes, and then yield to the Senator from Iowa. I ask unanimous consent to follow that outline, if it is agreeable to the Members.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this afternoon, we are considering whether to proceed to legislation to establish permanent normal trading relations with China. That's an important issue, and it should be debated. 
   But in the short time remaining this year, we also must answer the call of the American people for real action on key issues of concern to working families. I want to mention briefly and then talk for the few more moments that I have about three specifically. 
   We must raise the minimum wage--with no gimmicks, no poison pills, and no bloated tax breaks for the wealthy. We are willing to consider some tax relief for small businesses to offset any burden of raising the minimum wage. But the minimum wage should be the engine for relief for low-wage workers, not the caboose on a massive train of tax breaks and antiworker legislation. 
   The latest Republican scheme may raise the minimum wage. But it also reduces overtime payments for all workers. Workers all over America are saying that employers are requiring them to work too much overtime. Under the Republican scheme, not only can employers require workers to work more overtime, but employers can pay them less for that overtime. 
   We must pass a real Patients' Bill of Rights--true HMO reform in which all Americans in managed care plans are protected--not just some, as our Republican friends propose. 
   We must strengthen our hate crimes laws. The Senate has passed such legislation on the DOD authorization. It's now up to the Republican leadership to decide whether we stand up against hate and bigotry in America, or will this Congress just take a pass. 
   We must invest in education in ways that will make a real difference for our children. That means helping local schools hire more teachers so we can have smaller class sizes, and a quality  teacher in every classroom in America. It means partnering with local schools to modernize school buildings and build more schools. It means increasing Pell Grants so more young Americans have a chance to go to college. It means more pre-school and after-school help for parents and schools. 
   We must adopt sensible gun controls that keep our communities and our schools safe. We should require child safety locks on all guns, and we must close the gun show loophole. 
   We must adopt urgently needed immigration reforms. We must expand the visa quota for skilled workers--the so-called ``H-1B visa.'' And we must adopt new laws to ensure equal treatment under our immigration laws for Latino and other immigrants. 
   Last but not least, we must enact a prescription drug benefit as part of the Medicare program. Whenever a senior citizen signs up for Medicare, a comprehensive prescription drug benefit should automatically come with it. Senior citizens shouldn't have to battle HMOs and insurance companies to get the prescription drugs they need. Yet, that is what our Republican friends propose. 
   Let's do it right--and do it now. Let's pass a prescription drug benefit as an integral and normal part of the Medicare program, just like hospitalization and doctors' visits. 
   This summer, Congress voted tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans and a pay raise for itself, but the Republican leadership has continued to block efforts to raise the salaries of America's most underpaid workers--those earning the minimum wage. 
   While Members of this Republican Congress are quick to find time to increase their own salaries and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, they have not yet found the time to pass an increase in the minimum wage to benefit those hard-working, low-wage Americans. The Republican leadership has insisted on doing nothing for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. It is an outrage that Congress would raise its own pay but not the minimum wage. 
   I was pleased to hear during the recess that House Republicans are finally coming around to our way of thinking. Last week, after three years of foot-dragging, Speaker HASTERT offered the President a plan to raise the minimum wage. This is a positive development, and it gives us real hope that we can raise the pay of the lowest paid workers this year. 
   These low income working families deserve a raise. Their pay has been frozen for three years. Since January 1999 alone, minimum wage workers have now lost $3,000 due to the inaction of Congress. If we fail to increase the minimum wage this year, it will lose all of the value gained by the last two increases. Minimum wage earners should not be forced to wait any longer for an increase. 
   But we can't use this as an excuse to cut workers' overtime pay, as Speaker HASTERT proposes. We can't raise the minimum wage on one hand--and cut overtime pay for millions of Americans on the other hand. 
   The typical American family is working more and more hours, according to a study released for Labor Day by the Economic Policy Institute called ``The State of Working America 2000-2001.'' Employees have increasingly been forced to work mandatory overtime--time they would rather be spending with their families--and they should be fairly compensated for that work. 
   Several new studies further prove how important a minimum wage increase is. A recent report released by the Economic Policy Institute entitled ``The Impact of the Minimum Wage: Policy Lifts Wages, Maintains Floor for Low-Wage Labor Market'' reveals that 63 percent of gains from a $1 increase in the minimum wage would go to families in the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution. The study also finds that the higher wage raises the incomes of low-wage workers, with no evidence of job loss. In addition, the study reports that, among people who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage, 1.75 million workers are parents with earnings below $25,000 a year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we enter the final weeks of the 106th Congress and the home stretch of the Presidential campaign, two health issues demand immediate action--protecting patients against the abuses of HMOs and other health insurance plans and providing coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare for senior citizens. The American people deserve action on each of these issues from this Congress. The position of the two Presidential candidates on these issues has become a key factor in determining whether they are truly committed to serving the needs of the American people, and the position of every member of Congress on these issues is important for the same reason. 
   With regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights, last week, ABC began to air a documentary series--``Hopkins 24/7''--that vividly illustrates once again the need for prompt action to end HMO abuses. Hopkins 24/7 is a documentary on life at one of the nation's finest hospitals--Johns Hopkins. The documentary is the result of three months of intensive filming. The first segment, shown on August 30, showed American medicine at its best, and the abuses by managed care at their worst. 
   A 14-year-old girl, Tiffanie Salvadia, sought care from Johns Hopkins for her cancer of the uterus. The diagnosis had been delayed for six critical weeks because crucial tests were not ordered by her HMO physicians. When Tiffanie finally reached Johns Hopkins, the cancer had spread from her uterus, raising the risk of this serious illness even further. When Tiffany finally reached an institution capable of giving her the quality care she needed, the problems with her HMO were not over: Authorization for a vital test was needed, but the hospital was unable to contact the HMO for the authorization. Fortunately, Hopkins simply went ahead and performed the test, and hoped that the hospital might be able to obtain payment later. 
   Tiffanie ultimately received fine care from Hopkins, and her chances of recovery from the cancer now seem good. But her favorable prognosis is no thanks to her HMO. Here is what Dr. Paul Colombani, the oncologist at Hopkins, had to say about Tiffanie's case and about his experience with managed care generally. 
   On the difficulty in getting the test authorized, he said, ``I have to do the diagnosis codes and the procedure codes. And we have to submit them to the insurance company ahead of time. And they have to say yea or nay. We're not going to do this. You have to do that. I think it is ridiculous that a high school clerk should be telling me that I can or cannot do an operation on a patient.'' 
   On the delay in getting Tiffanie an accurate diagnosis and treatment, the doctor said, ``We see delays in diagnosis because of the inadequacies of the managed care system all the time. And for...... the .1 percent of patients where it turns out to be a life and death situation, they just look at that as the price of doing business. It's pathetic. In October or September, or whatever, that was the time to do that surgery. Now we're playing catch up.'' 
   Perhaps the most heart-rending comment came from Tiffanie's mother. It is a comment that any parent who has ever had a child with a serious illness can understand. She said, ``My daughter has cancer. I want to concentrate on her, and getting her better and not have to worry about if I have a referral for this or a referral for that.'' 
   ``I want to concentrate on her.'' That should be the right of any parent whose child is seriously ill. But today, because of the abuses of the insurance industry, it is not a right--it is a privilege of the fortunate few. 
   Whether the issue is diagnostic tests, specialty care, emergency room care, access to clinical trials, availability of needed drugs, protection of doctors who give patients their best possible advice, or women's ability to obtain gynecological services--too often, in all these cases, HMOs and managed care plans make the company's bottom line more important than the patient's vital signs. These abuses should have no place in American medicine. Every doctor knows it. Every patient knows it. And in their hearts, every Member of Congress knows it. 
   Almost 11 months ago, the House of Representatives passed the bipartisan Norwood-Dingell bill to end these abuses. It is endorsed by 300 groups of doctors, nurses, patients, and advocates for women, children, and families. It is supported by virtually every medical group in this country. It passed by an overwhelming bipartisan majority. It should have sailed through the Senate of the United States. But it continues to languish because the Republican leadership continues to put a higher priority on protecting industry profits than on protecting patients. 
   We have come close to successful passage. On June 8th, the Norwood-Dingell bill fell just one vote short of passage in the full Senate. It was supported by every Democratic Senator--and only four Republican Senators. 
   The American people deserve action before this Congress ends. Every day we delay, more patients suffer. The Patients' Bill of Rights is one of the most important issues facing this Congress--facing every family, too. There is no question where Vice-President AL GORE stands. If Governor Bush supported patients' rights and were willing to show the leadership that the American people have the right to expect in a Presidential candidate, this legislation would clearly pass the Senate. But on this issue, Governor Bush has failed to show the leadership we need. 
   I still believe that enactment of strong, effective legislation is possible this year. I am here to serve notice to the Senate today, that there will be new votes on this issue before we adjourn. I am hopeful that we will be successful. The American people are waiting for relief--and we owe it to them to act. 
   On Medicare prescription drugs, the second major issue of health reform facing us is insurance coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare. 
   After a year of full-time campaigning, Governor Bush today has finally offered a specific prescription drug plan for the consideration of the American people. Unfortunately, that plan is an empty promise for senior citizens. It is not Medicare--and it is not adequate. It is part of a broad plan to make regressive changes in Medicare that will raise premiums, force senior citizens to join HMOs, and further a radical right-wing program of privatization. And drug benefits would not even be available to most senior citizens for four years. 
   Senior citizens need a drug benefit under Medicare. They earned it by a lifetime of hard work. They deserve it, and it is time for Congress to enact it. The clock is running out on this Congress, but it is not too late for the House and Senate to act. The Administration and Vice President GORE have proposed one. So have Democrats in Congress. And we intend to assure that the Congress will vote on a real prescription drug program this month. The American people deserve action, and we intend to see that they get it. 
   Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. 
   Too many senior citizens take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they can't afford the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while almost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from negotiated discounts.  
   In the face of declining coverage and soaring costs, more and more senior citizens are being left out and left behind. The vast majority of the elderly are of moderate means. They cannot possibly afford to purchase the prescription drugs they need if serious illness strikes. 
   The older they are, the more likely they are to be in poor health, and the more likely they are to have very limited income to meet their health needs. 
   Few if any issues facing this Congress are more important than giving the nation's senior citizens the health security they have been promised. The promise of Medicare will not be fulfilled until Medicare protects senior citizens against the high cost of prescription drugs, in the same way that it protects them against the high cost of hospital care and doctor care. 
   Vice President GORE has been fighting for prescription drug coverage under Medicare since 1993. President Bill Clinton has called for immediate action in his last two State of the Union Addresses. 
   The Administration has put a solid program on the table for the consideration of Congress--and their program is affordable for senior citizens and also for the federal budget--because they do not use the surplus for hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   The Bush plan is not adequate and it is not Medicare. In fact, he has also endorsed a regressive plan to change Medicare in a way that will raise premiums and force senior citizens to join HMOs. 
   That is not the kind of Medicare the American people want, and it's not the kind of prescription drug benefit they want either. 
   Under Bush's version of Medicare reform, the premiums paid by senior citizens for conventional Medicare could increase by as much as 47% in the first year and continue to grow over time, according to the nonpartisan Medicare actuaries. The elderly would face an unacceptable choice between premiums they can afford and giving up their family doctor by joining an HMO. 
   Senior citizens already have the right to choose between conventional Medicare and private insurance options that may offer additional benefits. The difference between what senior citizens have today and what George Bush is proposing is not the difference between choice and bureaucracy--it's the difference between choice and coercion--driven by a right-wing agenda of privatization. On this ground alone, it deserves rejection, regardless of its provisions for covering prescription drugs. 
   But the program to cover prescription drugs is equally flawed--so flawed that it is an empty promise for millions of senior citizens. To begin with, the value of the Bush program to senior citizens is only one-half of what Vice President GORE has proposed. The reason is obvious--after massive tax breaks for the wealthy, there is not room in the Bush budget for adequate prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. 
   The Bush plan provides little help to the vast majority of senior citizens who are not poor, but are of modest means and cannot afford large drug expenses or large increases in Medicare premiums. Under the Bush plan, these seniors have to pay three-quarters of the cost of their prescription drug coverage--and the coverage is not even adequate. 
   In the entire history of Medicare, senior citizens have never been asked to pay such a high share of the cost of the premiums for any benefit. 
   The defects in the Bush plan go far beyond the inadequacy of the benefits. It is a program that only a drug company executive could love. For the first four years, there is no Medicare benefit at all, just a program of block grants to the states for providing coverage for low income senior citizens. Senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare, and they deserve Medicare, not welfare. 
   When the Bush plan finally becomes available to all seniors, it does not provide a real Medicare benefit--or any other adequate benefit. 
   Instead, it gives senior citizens what is, in effect, a voucher--and it tells them to go out and buy their own coverage from a private insurance company. If the price is too high in the area in which they live, they are out of luck. If the drug company's list of approved drugs does not include the medicine they need, their only recourse is a time-consuming appeal. There is no defined benefit--senior citizens are not even guaranteed the same coverage in Missouri that they would get in Mississippi. It is all up to the insurance company. 
   The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that under the similar Republican plan passed by the House of Representatives, benefits would be so inadequate and costs so high that less than half of the senior citizens who need help the most--those who have no prescription drug coverage today--will even participate. 
   A prescription drug benefit that leaves out half of the senior citizens who need protection the most is not a serious plan to help senior citizens. 
   It is ironic that in offering this inadequate plan, Mr. Bush has criticized Vice President GORE for a ``big-government, one-size-fits-all'' solution. The Gore plan covers prescription drugs under Medicare in exactly the same way that Medicare covers doctor and hospital costs. Mr. Bush obviously feels this is a one-size-fits all solution. That is why he has endorsed an extreme restructuring of the Medicare program. He may favor forcing the elderly into HMOs, but that is not what Democrats in Congress support. That's not what Vice President GORE supports. Most important, that's not what the American people support. 
   There is still time for Congress to enact a genuine prescription drug benefit under Medicare. The Administration has presented a strong proposal. Let's work together to enact it this year. It is not too late. The American people are waiting for an answer. 
   I am hopeful we will pass that legislation. Again, I am strongly committed, as I believe my colleagues, Senator DASCHLE and others are, to ensure we will have an opportunity to vote on that measure before we adjourn. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. I come here to pay tribute to the remarkable career of one of our nation's most influential labor and civil rights leaders, Dolores Huerta, who has retired as Secretary-Treasurer of the United Farm Workers of America. 
   Dolores Huerta is a true national treasure. For half a century, the great victories for farm workers, the advances for these hardworking and proud families, would not have been possible without the able leadership and vision of Dolores Huerta. When farm workers marched, Dolores led the way. When farm workers struck for better wages and working conditions, Dolores was at the front of the line. In all of the great boycotts for better jobs for farm workers and their families, it was Dolores who pulled it all together. 
   Farm workers are her family. And all of us in public life soon learned that if something was wrong with her brother and sisters in the field, Dolores would be knocking on doors to set things right. Her activism was ignited when as a teacher, many of her students came to school suffering from hunger and without adequate clothing. Frustrated by the plight of these children, Dolores decided that she could best serve her community by working as a grass roots advocate and refocused her life to the economic empowerment of the parents of her students--the farm workers. 
   In 1955, she founded the Stockton, California chapter of the Community Service Organization. There, she began to develop her leadership skills through the organization's advocacy work to end segregation and police brutality, promoting voter registration, and improving public services for the disenfranchised. 
   The plight of migrant farm workers always remained a central part of her public service. She soon met her kindred spirit in the cause for farm worker rights, Cesar Chavez. Dolores and Cesar embarked on a new path to bring the plight of farm workers in our national consciousness. In 1962, they founded the National Farm Workers Association, the predecessor to the United Farm Workers. Never before did farm workers have a voice in the political process. Under her leadership as Political Director, farm workers began to understand that they could achieve social justice by organizing strikes, boycotts, and voter registration drives. Through Dolores' leadership, once invisible farm workers were now given a human face and became an integral part of the struggle to gain civil rights and equal justice for people of all colors and economic backgrounds. 
   Dolores will always hold a special place in the hearts of the Kennedy family. Dolores and Cesar Chavez developed a special relationship with my brother Bobby for John F. Kennedy's 1960 presidential campaign. Together, they established the ``Viva Kennedy'' voter registration drive for Hispanic voters in California. That effort was revived in 1968 for Bobby's presidential campaign. l will always remember how her dedication and hard work were instrumental to my brother's California primary victory. Dolores made it possible for Bobby to reach out to Mexican-Americans and convey the message of a common vision for equal justice. She encouraged those who believed that they were disenfranchised to come to the polls for the first time to join in the fight for civil rights and human dignity. My family will always remember and respect Dolores for her strong and skillful efforts as well as her commitment to the great goals that we share. 
   1973 was yet another turning point for the farm worker movement. When grape growers decided to discontinue the collective bargaining agreements with the United Farm Workers, Dolores organized a national boycott and public education campaign to inform consumers of the poor working conditions and unfair wages that farm workers endured from the agricultural industry. The striking farm workers were subjected to severe harassment and violence. Many of them lost their lives in the struggle. But they would not give up until justice was won. In the end, the California legislature enacted the Agricultural Labor Relations Act. For the first time, farm workers were granted the right to collectively organize and bargain for better wages and working conditions. 
   Cesar Chavez passed on seven years ago, but the struggle of the farm workers continues. At a time in which most people settle into the slower pace of their golden years, Dolores keeps on fighting the battles that have not yet been won. I am delighted to hear that she will still be on the ramparts and in the trenches for workers in need of her help. Dolores continues to do all she can to empower future generations of Americans to carry the torch that she let so brightly shine over these challenging years. She will also continue her efforts to increase Latino voter participation and develop strong leadership opportunities for Hispanic women around the country, and advocate for the rights of immigrants and working people, speak on behalf of working people across America. 
   Millions of Americans enjoy a higher quality of life because of her skillful efforts. No one has fought harder for civil rights of people of color, for worker's rights, for environmental rights, for women's and children's rights, for quality education and health care, and for economic empowerment for the poor. The Kennedy family is proud to consider Dolores a friend. 
   Dolores Huerta is a living legend and a true American hero. Her vision, compassion, and tireless commitment to all Americans is never ending. Nothing we can say or do can truly repay her for all she has done to make our country the strong and more just nation that it is today. From all of us who love and respect her, we say, ``Job well done!''

   Mr. KENNEDY. It is a privilege to join my colleagues in introducing the ``Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000.'' This important legislation will help re-establish fairness and balance in our immigration laws by making it fairer to apply for green cards, advancing the date for registry from 1972 to 1986, and providing equal treatment for Central American and Haitian immigrants. 
   Our legislation will also provide fairness for immigrants from Central American countries and Haiti. In 1997, Congress granted permanent residence to Nicaraguans and Cubans who had fled from dictatorships in those two countries. But it excluded many other Central Americans and Haitians facing similar conditions. The legislation will eliminate this unfair disparity by extending the provisions of the 1997 Act to all immigrants from Central America and Haiti. 
   By providing parity, we will help individuals such as Gheycell, who came to the United States at the age of 12 with her father and sister from worn-torn Guatemala. She went to school here, and became active in her community. In high school, she formed a club that helped the homeless in Los Angeles. She is now attending college. Her  family applied for asylum and all were given work permits. They now qualify for permanent residence. But because Gheycell is 21, she no longer qualifies, and risks being deported to Guatemala. Under our proposal, she will be able to remain in the United States with her family and continue her education. 
   The legislation will also change the registry cut-off date so that undocumented immigrants who have been residing in this country since before 1986 can remain in the United States permanently. The registry date has periodically been updated since the 1920's to reflect the importance of allowing long-time, deeply-rooted immigrants who are contributing to this country to obtain permanent residence status and eventually become citizens. 
   These issues are matters of simple justice. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act is strongly supported by a broad coalition of business, labor, religious, Latino and other immigrant organizations. Conservative supporters include Americans for Tax Reform and Empower America. Labor supporters include the AFL-CIO, the Union of Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, and the Service Employees International Union. Business supporters include the National Restaurant Association and the American Health Care Association. 
   All of the major Latino organizations support the bill, including the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the National Council of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials. Religious organizations supporting the bill include the U.S. Catholic Conference, the Anti-Defamation 
   League, and the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services. Members of these groups agree that immigrants are an important asset for the economy, and that by enabling them to become permanent residents, they will be freed from exploitation. 
   This legislation will adjust the status of thousands of workers already in the U.S. and authorize them to work. This policy is good for families and good for this country. It will correct past government mistakes that have kept countless hard-working immigrant families in a bureaucratic limbo far too long. In taking these steps, Congress will restore fairness to our immigration laws and help sustain our economic prosperity. 
   I understand, we are coming into the last day of this particular session of this Congress. We will have approximately 4 weeks when we return. But we are running into the last days. 
   The Senator from Nevada was asking for consideration--since we have been in a quorum call, we probably do have the time to deal with these issues, which are not new issues--that we take the steps to try to provide some simple justice for many of our fellow citizens and workers here in the United States who have, because of the failure of action by Congress, or because of the particular decisions of the courts, been denied fairness in their treatment before the law. 
   I would like to ask the Senator from Nevada if he remembers the time, about 3 years ago, when we saw action taken in order to permit permanent resident status for Nicaraguans and Cubans. And yet, at least at that time, there were solemn guarantees that we were going to be able to have similar consideration for Guatemalans, El Salvadorans, Haitians, the other Central Americans who have been involved in similar kinds of conflict. 
   There was a unified position within the community that--because of the turmoil, because of the dangers to many of those people in returning to their country, dangers of retribution--that we ought to give them at least the opportunity for permanent resident status. A decision was made at that time to only do it for the Nicaraguans and the Cubans. But there was the promise that we were going to do it for the rest of the Central Americans. 
   This effort by the Senator from Nevada basically says: we made the promise. We gave the guarantee to these individuals. This is an effort by the Senator from Nevada to make sure that Nicaraguans, Cubans, Haitians, Guatemalans, and El Salvadorans are treated fairly and treated the same. 
   Is that one of the efforts that the good Senator is attempting to achieve?

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. At this time, our fellow citizens ought to understand that if you are Guatemalan, El Salvadoran--someone who has been involved in the conflict in that region over the years and is now in the United States--you go off to work in the morning, and you may be married to an American wife, and you may have children who are Americans, and you can be picked up and deported, while the person who is working right next to you in the same shop may have been born 5 miles away but will have the protections of law. 
   Does that seem fair to the Senator from Nevada?

   Mr. KENNEDY. The part of this proposal that the Senator was trying to have before the Senate is really to equalize the treatment of those in Central America and Haiti with those from Nicaragua and Cuba because of the assurances that were given. 
   The Senator has talked about the registry which has been periodically updated since the 1920s, to reflect the importance of allowing long-time,  deeply rooted immigrants who are contributing to the country to obtain permanent resident status and eventually become citizens. 
   Consider the case of Adriana, who came to the United States with her parents in 1981. In 1986, her family became eligible for legalization, since they had arrived here before 1982. They completed their applications and attempted to submit them to the INS. However, the INS erroneously declared them ineligible because they had briefly left the country in 1985. That year, Adriana and her parents had returned to their native land to visit her dying grandmother. They returned to the United States on tourist visas. In 1989, Adriana learned that the INS had been wrong in denying their right to apply for legalization. They successfully challenged the INS action, but because of changes in 1996, the family is still in legal limbo. Adriana's dream of becoming a special education teacher is on hold, and every day she lives in fear of deportation. 
   Here is a person who, under the law, under the holdings, should be permitted to remain in the United States permanently but is being denied that because of some legal impediments. I understand that the Senator's proposal effectively says to those who have been adjudicated in courts of law, which is the basis of this legislation, that those courts of law holdings should be upheld legislatively here in the Senate. Isn't that effectively what the second provision of the Senator's proposal would do?

   Mr. KENNEDY. There are three major provisions in the legislation. The other important part of the bill is what is called 245(i), which was a section of the immigration bill that should not have been allowed to expire in 1997. It had been in effect for years. Then it was allowed to expire. All we are trying to do is give it some life again because it had been so successful prior to that time. This provision would permit immigrants eligible to become permanent residents to apply for green cards here in the United States for a $1,000 fee, instead of being forced to return to their native land to apply. The fee was a significant source of funds for INS enforcement and for the processing of applications. Section 245(i) is pro-family and pro-business. It allows immigrants with close family members in this country to remain here and apply for permanent residence. It enables businesses to keep valuable employees, and it provides INS with millions of dollars in additional revenues each year, at no 
   cost to taxpayers. 
   Restoring the ability to apply for green cards in this country also alleviates other unnecessarily harsh provisions in the law which bar these immigrants from returning to the United States for up to 10 years. 
   Consider the case of Norma, who entered the United States from Mexico, settled in North Carolina, and married a U.S. citizen. They have been married for 2 years, have a child, and are expecting another this fall. They recently purchased a new home for their growing family. Norma and her husband are troubled over what to do about her immigration status. She can stay here and risk being deported. Or she can return to Mexico to apply for an immigrant visa, but she would be barred from re-entering the United States for 10 years. That is the current law, 10 years. The restoration of section 245(I) will allow this new family to stay together. Until then, she remains here in legal limbo, unable to become a permanent resident. 
   Section 245(I) had been in effect for 8 years without any kind of abuses. I remember the hearings we had on the 1996 act. I was amazed when this was added. I fought it, voted against it, but it was put into law. The restoration of section 245(I) will allow this new family to stay together. Until then, she remains here in legal limbo, unable to become a permanent resident, and risks being deported. 
   We describe it as 245(I), but this is a real family. These are real cases, real cases of family unity. It is something that is closely related to how parents are going to be able to deal with their children. 
   In talking about the registry, these are individuals who should be entitled to remain here under court order because they comply legally, but because there was a mix-up in the INS, they have been denied that opportunity. We are trying to bring justice to them, justice and fairness to Central Americans, and treat them equally. These don't seem to me to be very complex issues. These issues do not demand a great deal of time in order to be able to understand them or to debate them. These issues, it seems to me, should be very comprehensible to Members of the Senate. 
   I understand the Senator from Nevada is attempting to say: as we come to the end of this session we have been unable to get these matters to the floor because of a range of different activities. Now, in the final days, as a matter of simple fairness, as a matter of family policy, as a matter of common sense, as a matter of continuing our commitment to these individuals, and as a matter of basic and fundamental justice, we ought to take this action. Is that the position of the Senator from Nevada?

   Mr. KENNEDY. That is a very moving story. 
   I see others who want to address the Senate. Let me ask the Senator a final question. Does the Senator hope the Republican leadership will come and either explain their objection to considering and taking action on these issues, or at least that the Republican leadership will give the Senator the assurance that we will bring this up after the completion of the debate on the China trade issue by, say, mid-September? The Senator would certainly welcome that, would he not? And if we are not able to get those kinds of assurances, the silence by the Republican leadership in addressing this issue, I think, would be very significant indeed. 
   We all know what is happening around here. I think if the leadership gave assurances to the Senator from  Nevada and most importantly, to the many families in this country affected by our unfair immigration laws, that we will consider this legislation--would the Senator not agree with me--that that would be an enormous step forward and magnificent progress? But if we are not able to get those assurances, how does the Senator interpret the silence of the leadership on this issue?

The Judiciary Committee members understand these issues. They can help provide information to our colleagues if they are in doubt. But the compelling need for action in these areas is just extraordinary. 
   I hope my friend and colleague from Nevada is not going to just end with this challenge. I hope he will continue to work, and I certainly will join him, as many colleagues will, and try to get action. We are unable to get the action today, but we have time remaining. I want to say I look forward to working with him to make sure we get action one way or another, hopefully with the support of the Republican leadership. But if we are not able to have that support, I hope at least they will get out of the way so we can give justice to these very fine individuals. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, religious freedom is a bedrock principle in our Nation. The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 reflects our commitment to protect religious freedom and our belief that Congress still has the power to enact legislation to enhance that freedom, even after the Supreme Court's decision in 1997 that struck down the broader Religious Freedom Restoration Act that 97 Senators joined in passing in 1993. 
   Our bill has the support of the Free Exercise Coalition, which represents over 50 diverse and respected groups, including the Family Research Council, the Christian Legal Society, the American Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way. The bill also has the endorsement of the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights. 
   The broad support for this bill by religious groups and the civil rights community is the result of many months of difficult, but important negotiations. We carefully considered ways to strengthen religious liberties in other ways in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. We were mindful of not undermining existing laws intended to protect other important civil rights and civil liberties. It would have  been counterproductive if this effort to protect religious liberties led to confrontation and conflict between the civil rights community and the religious community, or to a further court decision striking down the new law. We believe that our bill succeeds in avoiding these difficulties by addressing two of the most obvious current threats to religious liberty and by leaving open the question of what future Congressional actions can be taken to protect religious freedom in America. 
   Our goal in passing this legislation is to reach a reasonable and constitutionally sound balance between respecting the compelling interests of government and protecting the ability of people freely to exercise their religion. We believe that the legislation accomplishes this goal in two areas where infringement of this right has frequently occurred--the application of land use laws, and treatment of persons who are institutionalized. In both of these areas, our bill will protect rights in the Constitution--the right to worship, free from unnecessary government interference. 
   I commend Senator HATCH for his commitment and diligence in developing this legislation. The consensus bill before us is in large part the product of his skillful leadership. Many others in the Senate also deserve credit for this legislation, including Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator DASCHLE, Senator SCHUMER, Senator REID, Senator BENNETT, Senator HUTCHINSON, and Senator GORDON SMITH. 
   A broad array of groups also played a central role in crafting this legislation. Among those deserving special recognition are the American Civil Liberties Union, the Baptist Joint Committee, People for the American Way, the Union of Orthodox Congregations, the American Jewish Committee, and the Christian Legal Society. Professor Douglas Laycock of the University of Texas School of Law had an indispensable role in this process. Finally, I commend the White House and the Department of Justice for their guidance and expertise in developing an effective and constitutionally sound bill. 
   Senator HATCH and I are including in the RECORD a section-by-section summary of the bill along with a joint statement providing a detailed explanation of the need for this important legislation. Numerous committee reports have also described numerous examples of thoughtless and insensitive actions by governments that interfere with religious freedom, even though no valid public purpose is served by the governmental action. 
   The Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 is an important step forward in protecting religious liberty in America. It reflects the Senate's long tradition of bipartisan support for the Constitution and the nation's fundamental freedoms and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, contingent workers in our society face significant problems, and they deserve our help in meeting them. These men and women--temporary and part-time workers, contract workers, and independent contractors--continue to suffer unfairly, even in our prosperous economy. A new report from the General Accounting Office emphasizes that contingent workers often lack income security and retirement security. 
   We know that for most workers today, a single lifetime job is a relic of the past. The world is long gone in which workers stay with their employer for many years, and then retire on a company pension. Since 1982 the number of temporary help jobs has grown 577 percent. 
   The GAO report shows that 30 percent of the workforce--39 million working Americans--now get their paychecks from contingent jobs. 
   Contingent workers have lower incomes than traditional, full-time workers and many are living in poverty. For example, 30 percent of agency temporary workers have family incomes below $15,000. By comparison, only 8 percent of standard full-time workers have family incomes below $15,000. 
   Contingent workers are less likely to be covered by employer health and retirement benefits than are standard, full-time workers. Even when employers do sponsor a plan, contingent workers are less likely to participate in the plan, either because they are excluded or because the plan is too expensive. Only 21 percent of part-time workers are included in an employer-sponsored pension plan. By comparison, 64 percent of standard full-time workers are included in their employer's pension plan. 
   Non-standard or alternative work arrangements can meet the needs of working families and employers alike, but these arrangements should not be used to divide the workforce into ``haves'' and ``have-nots.'' Flexible work arrangements, for example, can give working parents more time to care for their children, but many workers are not in their contingent jobs by choice. More than half of temporary workers would prefer a permanent job instead of their contingent job, but temporary work is all they can find. 
   As the GAO report makes clear, employers have economic incentives to cut costs by miscategorizing their workers as temporary or contract workers. Too often, contingent arrangements are set-up by employers for the purpose of excluding workers from their employee benefit programs and evading their responsibilities to their workers. Millions of employees have been miscategorized by their employers, and as a result they have been denied the benefits and protections that they rightly deserve and worked hard to earn. 
   All workers deserve a secure retirement at the end of their working years. Social Security has been and will continue to be the best foundation for that security. But the foundation is just that--the beginning of our responsibility, not the end of it. We cannot expect Americans to work hard all their lives, only to face poverty and hard times when they retire. 
   That is why I am introducing, with Senators TORRICELLI and HARKIN, the Employee Benefits Eligibility Fairness Act of 2000 to help contingent workers obtain the retirement benefits they deserve. This legislation clarifies employers' responsibilities under the law so that they cannot exclude contingent workers from employee benefit plans based on artificial labels or payroll practices. 
   This is an issue of basic fairness for working men and women. It is unfair for individuals who work full-time, on an indefinite long-term basis for an employer to be excluded from the employer's pension plan, merely because the employer classifies the workers as ``temporary'' when in fact they are not. The employer-employee relationship should be determined on the facts of  the working arrangement, not on artificial labels, not on artificial accounting practices, not artificial payroll practices. 
   It is long past time for Congress to recognize the plight of contingent workers and see that they get the employee benefits they deserve. These important changes are critical to improving the security of working families, and I look forward to their enactment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 10 years ago today Congress passed landmark civil rights legislation, based on the fundamental principle that people should be measured by what they can do, not what they can't do. With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, America began a new era of opportunity for the 47 million disabled citizens who had been denied full and fair participation in society. 
   We continue to build in Congress on the bipartisan achievements of the ADA. I'm gratified by President Clinton's strong endorsement today of the Grassley-Kennedy Family Opportunity Act now pending in Congress. The goal of our legislation is to remove as many of the remaining barriers as possible that prevent families raising children with disabilities and special health needs from leading full and productive lives. No family in this country should ever be put in a position of having to choose between a job and the healthcare their disabled child needs. The Family Opportunity Act ensures that no family raising a child with special needs would be left out and left behind. 
   For generations, people with disabilities were viewed as citizens in need of charity. Through ignorance, the nation accepted discrimination and succumbed to fear and prejudice. The passage of the ADA finally moved the nation to shed these condescending and suffocating attitudes--and widen the doors of opportunity for people with disabilities. 
   Today we see many signs of the progress that mean so much in our ongoing efforts to see that persons with disabilities are included--the ramps beside the stairs, the sidewalks with curbs to accommodate wheelchairs, the lifts for helping disabled people board buses. 
   Whether they are family members, friend, neighbors, or co-workers, persons with disabilities are no longer second class citizens. They are demonstrating their abilities and making real contributions in schools, in the workplace, and in the community. People with disabilities are no longer left out and left behind--and because of that, America is a stronger, better and fairer country today. 
   As the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the many disabled persons who worked so long and hard and well for its passage continue to remind us, equal opportunity under the law is not a privilege, but a fundamental birthright of every American.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to announce the introduction of the Family Care Act of 2000, which takes the next logical step in assuring access by as many citizens as possible to affordable health insurance. I commend Congressman JOHN DINGELL and the rest of our colleagues for their fine work in crafting this legislation. 
   The number of uninsured Americans is now more than 44 million, and the figure is rising by an average of one million a year. America is the only industrial country in the world, except South Africa, that fails to guarantee health care for all it citizens. 
   It is a national scandal that lack of insurance coverage is the seventh leading--and most preventable--cause of death in America today. 
   Three years ago, we worked together to create CHIP, the federal-state Children's Health Insurance Program, which provides coverage to children in families with incomes too high for Medicaid and too low to afford private health insurance. 
   More than two million children have been enrolled in that program, and millions more have signed up for Medicaid as a result of outreach activities. Soon, more than three-quarters of all uninsured children in the nation will be eligible for assistance through either CHIP or Medicaid. 
   But, despite this progress, the parents of these children, and too many others, have been left behind. The time has come to take the next step. 
   The overwhelming majority of uninsured low-wage parents are struggling to support their families. I will ask unanimous consent to insert a statement in the RECORD from Patricia Quezada, a parent of three lovely girls, who would benefit from this legislation. 
   Parents who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should be eligible for assistance to buy the health insurance they need in order to protect their families. Our message to them today is that help is on the way. 
   Often, they work for companies which don't offer insurance, or they aren't eligible for insurance that is offered. Fewer than a quarter of the jobs taken by those who have been forced off the welfare rolls by welfare reform offer insurance as a benefit--and even when it is offered too few companies make it available for dependents. The time has come to take the next step. 
   The Family Care Act of 2000 will provide with the resources, incentives and authority to extend Medicaid and CHIP to the parents of children covered under those programs. 
   Coverage for parents also means better coverage for children. Parents are much more likely to enroll their children in health insurance, if the parents themselves can have coverage, too. 
   This step alone will give to six and a half million Americans the coverage they need and deserve. 
   The Family Care Act will also improve the outreach and enrollment for CHIP and Medicaid, and encourage states to extend coverage to other vulnerable population, such as pregnant women, legal immigrants, and children ages 19 and 20. 
   This program is affordable under current and projected budget surpluses. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the cost will be $11 billion over the next five years. 
   Last Monday, a majority of the Senate voted in favor of this proposal as an amendment to the marriage penalty bill. We needed 60 votes, so it was not successful then, but we clearly have a bipartisan majority of the Senate. 
   The bottom line is that we have the resources to take this needed step, and  end the suffering and uncertainty that accompanies being uninsured.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate's guest Chaplain today, Minister Angela Williams, for her eloquent prayer opening today's session of the Senate. Angela became a licensed minister in January of this year, and she is currently an associate minister at Shiloh Baptist Church in the District of Columbia. I had the privilege of attending her first sermon there last November. She is also currently a graduate student at Virginia Union University in Richmond, where she is pursuing the degree of master of divinity. 
   Angela's father, J.C. Williams, is also a minister. He served for 28 years with great distinction as a Navy chaplain. He retired in 1998, and is now an associate minister in Martinez, GA. Rev. J.C. Williams served as guest Chaplain for the Senate last September. 
   Our guest Chaplain today wears many hats. Angela Williams is also a talented lawyer, and is a graduate of the University of Texas Law School. As an Assistant United States Attorney in the Middle District of Florida, she was selected to serve on the National Church Arson Task Force, which was created by the Department of Justice to investigate, prosecute, and prevent the epidemic of church arsons that were afflicting many parts of the country. From 1996 to 1998, Angela Williams investigated and prosecuted approximately 25 percent of those Federal cases nationwide. 
   Angela is also well known to many of us in the Senate and the House of Representatives. For the past 2 years, in  addition to her ministry, she has served as a member of my Senate staff on the Judiciary Committee. 
   All of us on both sides of the aisle and with the Clinton administration who have worked with Angela have great respect for her ability and dedication. Her principal responsibilities have been in the area of law enforcement issues, especially hate crimes, and she deserves great credit for her leadership on this important issue in our country today. 
   Angela will be leaving my staff at the end of this week. All of us who know Angela wish her well. We have been very impressed with her calling to the ministry and her dedication to it. It has been a privilege to work with her as a member of our Senate family, and we are grateful for her inspiring prayer as guest Chaplain today. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I point out to our colleagues and friends the Calendar of Business for the Senate. This is the calendar of the business pending, the unfinished business, and a list of various pieces of legislation reported out of the committees. 
   The American people probably don't have this at their fingertips, but if you take the time to look at this when you visit the library, or you can write to Members of the Congress, you will find out that in the pending business the first order is a bill to extend programs and activities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. Right next to it, it says May 1, 2000. That means that this has been the underlying and pending piece of legislation. Yet we are denied any opportunity to address what is going to be the Federal participation in working with States and local communities in the areas of education. We didn't address it in the rest of May. We received assurances by the Republican leadership that we were going to come back and address those issues and questions. We didn't do it in June, and we didn't do it in July, although we were told we would be able to address these issues in evening sessions and have a disposition of that legislation. 
   In the meantime, what have we done? As my friend from Illinois has pointed out, we have seen a tax cut of over $1 trillion. We had something else done, too. The House of Representatives have given themselves a pay increase of $3,800 a year. We didn't see the increase in the minimum wage. They didn't vote for that. In fact, when TOM DELAY was asked about the increase in the minimum wage, he said: That doesn't affect us. What he continued to say is we are not in the business; we are overseers of a $2 trillion economy. And he was quite dismissive of the problems and challenges that are affecting working families at the lower wrung of the economic ladder. 
   We have not done the American people's business. We are not addressing the questions of smaller class sizes. We are not addressing the issue of trying to train teachers to be better teachers. We are not addressing the issue of afterschool programs. We are not addressing the efforts to try to deal with the problems of the digital divide. We are not dealing with the greater kinds of accountability of the expenditures of funds in terms of education. That is off the agenda. As has been pointed out many times since the founding of the Republic, debates on the floor of the Senate are about priorities. 
   The majority leaders have effectively dismissed debate, discussion, and action on education in order to have a trillion dollar tax cut for the wealthiest individuals and a pay increase for themselves. No attention to prescription drugs. Thumbs down on that. Thumbs down on a Patients' Bill of Rights. We haven't got time to debate a Patients' Bill of Rights or a Medicare prescription drug program. We haven't got the time to debate a gun issue to try to make our schools safer. But we have the time to debate a trillion dollar tax cut and a pay increase of $3,800. 
   If you take the increase in the minimum wage for 2 years, we are talking about half of what the increase would be for a 
   Member of Congress. We can't even debate it. We can't discuss it. We can't vote on it because that is not part of the agenda of our Republican leadership. That is what this is about. It is about priorities. That is what this election is going to be about, ultimately. No action in terms of the Patients' Bill of Rights, even though we are one vote short of being able to get action, to try to ensure that decisions affecting families are made by doctors and trained medical officials and not accountants for the HMOs. We are not going to have, evidently, action on the gun issues to try to make our schools safer and more secure, to try to limit the availability of guns to children in our society that results in more than 10 children every single day being killed. We are not able to do it. We want to indicate to the majority that we are going to take every step possible to  make sure we are going to address those issues. We have been cut out and closed out to date. But we are not going to do it. 
   Here it is Tuesday morning. Quorum calls all day Monday. Quorum calls this morning. Failing to take action on these issues, it is basically an abdication of our responsibility. We are not going to go silently into the night. I understand the hour of 10 o'clock has arrived.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier in the day, I was pointing out that the pending business is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965. We are in the process of reauthorization and had more than 22 hearing days on that legislation. We had an extensive markup on that legislation. We began debate in early May. Over the period of 6 days, we had 2 days when we were not permitted to offer any amendments, and we ended up with rollcalls on 7 amendments; 2 of those were virtually unanimous votes. On May 1, we had floor debate only. May 2, we had floor debate only. On May 3, we had a Gorton amendment, changes in Straight A's, 98-0. A Democratic alternative, which was a completely different approach, was the first major amendment. On May 8, a Collins amendment was a voice vote, and on May 9, a Gregg amendment on teachers, 97-0. There were 8 amendments. We had 6 days of debate. Two were debate only. We had only 7 rollcalls; 2 of those rollcalls were unanimously accepted. 
   I believe this is a matter of significant priority for the American people. On the bankruptcy legislation, we had 16 days of debate and considered 55 amendments. With all respect to the importance of that particular issue, it seems to me the issue of good quality education in K through 12, and the role we have on that issue, is of central importance. 
   I am mindful that the majority leader himself said he believed this was an important matter. He gave the assurances to the Senate going back to January 6, 1999:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. ..... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   January 29th, 1999:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to be just words.  
   Then on June 22, 1999:  
   Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year.  
   In Remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, February 1, 2000:  
   We are going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I have been majority leader. ..... And Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   April 20, 2000: The majority leader said his top priorities in May included agriculture sanctions, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills. 
   May 1, 2000:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   May 2, 2000: Senator LOTT was asked on ESEA: Have you scheduled a cloture vote on that?  
   No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. ..... But education is number one in the minds of American people all across this country and every State, including my own State. For us to have a good, healthy and even a protracted debate and amendments on education, I think, is the way to go.  
   That has been the end of it since May 2. Always something else has come up. Always something else came up in May. Always something else came up in June. Always something else came up in July. 
   It does seem, even with this week, we are now at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of a Tuesday. We could have had some debate on this on Monday or today.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader. I made the point earlier that we did have before the Senate the pending business, which is the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It did seem, since it was the pending business, that under the rules generally, after the time expires under morning business, we would go back to that legislation. 
   I know the majority leader has attempted to work out a process with the minority leader to move forward the business of the Senate. The education bill has been the pending business since May of this year. That has taken us through May, through June, and through July. 
   I still think we can complete the ESEA prior to recessing this week. If we are unable to get agreement on these appropriations bills--I know they are important and generally, as the year goes on, they receive a higher priority, but it does seem to me that education has a high priority as well. I had thought we were going to have an opportunity to deal with the education legislation during the evenings of last week. We were unable to do so. We got caught up in the Agriculture appropriations bill. 
   I am wondering whether the majority leader can give us any indication whether he has an intention of getting back to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and, if so, when that might be because with the successful motion the Senator has made and with the invoking of cloture, as I understand, the elementary and secondary education bill is returned to the calendar and will not be before the Senate as the pending business. With those actions, we are returning the elementary and secondary education bill uncompleted to the calendar. It does seem to me to be a priority. I am wondering what assurances the leader might be able to give us on the issue.

   Mr. KENNEDY. We do know children start back to school in late August and early September. Time is moving along. There were allocations of resources in appropriations bills where there has been absolutely no authorization or statement of policy. It does seem to me that parents, school boards, and schoolteachers are entitled to a full debate and discussion on these issues and for the Senate to work its will. 
   I appreciate what the Senator has said. I hope he understands we are going to continue to raise this issue as we move along because I do think it is a top priority. The American families who have 58 million children in schools across this country are entitled to a response. I thank the majority leader.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, too many Americans nearing age 65 face a crisis in health care. They are too young for Medicare, and unable to obtain private coverage they can afford. Often, they are victims of corporate down-sizing, or of a company's decision to cancel its health insurance. These Americans have been left out and left behind through no fault of their own--often after decades of loyal work--and it is time for Congress to provide a helping hand. 
   Almost three and a half million Americans ages 55 to 64 have no health insurance today, including more than 60,000 in Massachusetts. Many of these Americans have serious health problems that threaten to destroy the savings of a lifetime and that prevent them from finding or keeping a job. Even those without significant health problems know that a serious illness could wipe out their savings. 
   Even those with good coverage today can't be certain it will be there tomorrow. No one nearing retirement can be confident that the health insurance they have now will protect them until they qualify for Medicare at 65. 
   The health and financial well-being of these near-elderly are often at risk because of the serious gaps in our health care system. Those without coverage are twice as likely to be in fair or poor health than persons with coverage. They are four times as likely not to receive a recommended medical test or treatment, and five times as likely to forego needed medical care when they are sick. 
   The bill that Senators ROCKEFELLER, DASCHLE, and I are introducing today is a lifeline for these Americans. It is a constructive step toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. It will enable uninsured Americans ages 62 to 65 to buy into Medicare by paying monthly premiums. It will also enable those ages 55 to 61 who lose their jobs to buy in. In addition, it will help retirees ages 55 and older whose health insurance is terminated by their employers by extending COBRA. 
   Finally, tax credits equal to 25% of the premium will be available for enrollees in all three programs to help them afford to buy into the programs. The estimated cost of the tax credits is $8.4 billion over the next ten years. 
   In the past, opponents have used scare tactics to claim that these proposals pose a threat to Medicare. They are nothing of the kind. There is no additional burden of Medicare as a result of this legislation. The tax credits are paid for by general treasury funds. The Medicare costs are paid for through enrollee premiums. The existing Medicare Trust Fund is protected by placing the programs in their own trust fund. The Medicare Trustees will monitor the program to ensure that it is self-financing. 
   The number of near-elderly who are uninsured is growing every year. Relief of this kind was originally proposed by President Clinton, and it deserves broad bipartisan support. The health and financial consequences of the lack of insurance are significant--especially for the near-elderly. These Americans need and deserve the help that this bill provides. We intend to do all we can to see that this proposal is enacted as soon as possible.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have recently witnessed another example of the indifference of Members of Congress to the needs of hard-working, low-wage American workers. While our minimum wage bill still languishes, Members of Congress are raising their own pay yet again. Congress has cut the taxes of the wealthiest Americans, but the Republican leadership still insists on doing nothing for those at the bottom of the economic ladder. It is an outrage that Congress would raise its own pay but not the minimum wage. 
   Over the past decade, in spite of the recent prosperity, the average inflation-adjusted income of the poorest fifth of Americans rose by only 1 percent, while the average inflation adjusted-income of the richest 5 percent rose by 27 percent. 
   The Republican Congress just passed an estate tax repeal that provides 100 percent of its benefits to the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans and 91 percent  of its benefits to the wealthiest 1 percent. The Republican marriage tax penalty bill passed last week is also heavily tilted to benefit only the wealthy. Members of this Republican Congress are quick to find time to increase their own salaries and cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, but they cannot find the time to pass an increase in the minimum wage to benefit those hard-working, low-wage Americans. 
   These low-income working families deserve a raise. Their pay has been frozen for 3 years, and our Democratic proposal will increase the minimum wage by 50 cents this year and another 50 cents next year. The Republican leadership is doing all it can to prevent this fair increase, but this issue will not go away, and we will continue to offer our minimum wage amendment to bills on the floor again and again at every opportunity until we pass it and send it to the President for his signature. 
   In recent months, a bipartisan House voted by a solid majority to increase the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years, and many of our Senate colleagues have also supported an increase: 50 cents now and 50 cents a year from now. 
   The American people agree that the minimum wage should be increased. The time is now to give America's hard-working families the raise they so desperately need and deserve. It is unconscionable for the Republican leadership to vote themselves a pay raise yet again, cut taxes for the wealthiest Americans, and then deny workers at the bottom of the economic ladder a fair pay increase. Our Democratic proposal offers workers the minimum wage raise they need and deserve: No tricks, no poison pills, no tax breaks for the wealthy, and we have bipartisan support for this increase. 
   The issue is a priority. The Senate should act on a fair minimum wage bill, and we should act as soon as possible. It is wrong for the Senate to continue to block this long overdue act of simple justice for working families. 
   This chart shows the real value of the minimum wage. It is from 1968 up to the year 2001. If we were to take the real value and use constant dollars, the minimum wage would be $7.66, if we were to have the same purchasing power as we had in 1968. 
   We have seen the minimum wage decline over these years, particularly in recent years. Without an increase, it will be valued at $4.90. If we were to have the increase of 50 cents and 50 cents, the purchasing power would only be $5.85, which is still below what it was for over 12 years. That is all we are asking: Let's bring it up by 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year. Even though that would be $6.15, it represents $5.85 of purchasing power in constant dollars. 
   What we are seeing is that it is almost $2 lower than what the minimum wage was in 1968. This is against the situation, if one looks over this particular chart, that working families are living in poverty. If one looks at what has happened, again in constant 
   dollars, of where the minimum wage has been going in recent years in adjusted inflation dollars, then one sees where the poverty line has been going in recent years. 
   We are finding out now that since 1988, minimum wage workers are working, in many instances, longer, harder, more jobs, and are sinking deeper and deeper into poverty. 
   This is against the background of the last 10 days where we gave over $1.5 trillion--a huge amount in estate taxes, the majority of which goes to the highest income individuals, and $300 billion to the wealthiest individuals in marriage tax penalty relief. Then last week, the House of Representatives voted themselves a $3,800 pay increase. That represents what a minimum wage worker would make in 2 years. They voted themselves that in 1 year. 
   This is where we have seen America's poorest families are getting poorer. The bottom fifth of the families are right at the edge where they have been from 1979 to 1999, 20 years, working harder, working longer, and their benefit from the economic expansion is virtually nonexistent. The middle fifth has gone up 5 percent, and the top fifth of families has gone up 30 percent. 
   These are the men and women who are the backbone of the whole economic expansion. Yet they are the ones who are experiencing almost crumbs in advancing their quality of life and their lifestyle. 
   Last week, we saw all this happening in the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives increased their pay by $3,800 a year. As I mentioned, if our minimum wage amendment is passed, it works out to be less than $2000. 
   Even if we give the increase in the minimum wage, minimum wage workers in 2 years will make half of what the pay increase will be for Members of Congress. 
   That is not bad enough, but Congressman DELAY was asked by a columnist, Mark Shields:  
   Can you and Dick Armey and others who voted for that pay raise or cost-of-living increase defend voting against an increase in the minimum wage?  
   Mr. DELAY said:  
   Well, Mark, we don't work for minimum wage.......  
   How dismissive can one be? Evidently, Members of Congress, their children, and their lives are more important than workers who are working hard as children's aides in the Head Start Program, or working in nursing homes taking care of seniors. 
   These are men and women who have a great sense of dignity and pride in their work, working, in many instances, two or three jobs. 
   Mr. DELAY says:  
   [W]e don't work for minimum wage. Members of Congress represent 250 million people.......''  
   How dismissive: We are more important. 
   I defy that. These are men and women who are working, and working hard, and who have a sense of dignity and a sense of pride in the work they do. They are teachers' aides. They are children's aides, working in child care programs. They work in nursing homes. They work in the buildings across this country in order to make the buildings clean for American industry. 
   This is basically a women's issue because the great majority of minimum wage workers are women. It is a children's issue because millions of the women who are working at the minimum wage have children, and their lives are all being affected by this. It is a civil rights issue because great numbers of the minimum wage workers are men and women of color. And most profoundly, it is a fairness issue, where we hear so many speeches here in the Senate saying: We honor work. We want Americans who want to work. 
   Here are men and women, who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, trying to make ends meet, trying to bring up children, trying to pay for rent because they don't have the income in order to purchase a house, trying to put food on the table, and trying to spend some time with their families. 
   It is an interesting fact, American workers now spend 22 hours less per week with their children. Why? Because they have to work at more jobs, and to work longer at their jobs. So it is a family issue. 
   Of all the times we listen to statements about family values and fairness in our society, we are crying crocodile tears, evidently, because we heard last week that people who have estates over $100 million should not be taxed twice. Even if you scored $100 million, we are still going to provide more tax breaks. We refuse to even permit a vote on an increase in the minimum wage here in the Senate, while we are going out and increasing our own salary, and doing it in a contemptuous way to these men and women. Shame on this body. 
   We are going to bring this up. We have heard a lot about: This is not relevant. Is it going to be fair to bring this up? We are going to be told that we do not set the agenda in the Senate. 
   I can just tell you, there are men and women who have struggled, and struggled mightily, and are struggling today. They deserve the increase. These arguments about inflation are out the window. Every economic indicator has demonstrated that the last two increases have had no impact in any way in terms of inflation. The idea that we are going to have lost jobs is absolutely preposterous. Every economic study has indicated the same. We have responded to those arguments. 
   This is a fairness issue. It is a decency issue. It is about our fellow citizens. It is about work. It is about families. It is about children. It is about  women. It is about fairness in civil rights. We are going to continue to pursue this item. We are going to pursue it this week and the 4 weeks when we return in September. We are going to continue to pursue it until we have justice for these workers. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote is about our priorities as a nation. The price tag on this tax giveaway is almost exactly what we need to provide a Medicare prescription drug benefit to millions of senior citizens who desperately need this help: $292 billion over the next decade. 
   In the past week or so, our Republican friends have passed tax breaks that total about a trillion dollars over the next ten years, benefiting the wealthiest Americans. We don't just look at it over 5 years, we ought to be looking at the consequences of this bill over a 10-year period, and even longer. And the record shows that the tax proposals are not what they are claimed to be. 
   This so-called marriage penalty tax break is a sham. Democrats strongly support eliminating the marriage penalty in the tax laws, and our Democratic alternative will do that. But less than half the tax breaks in the phony Republican bill are actually directed, as the Senator from New York pointed out, at the marriage penalty. 
   Once again, our Republican friends are using an attractive label like ``marriage penalty'' as a cover for unjustified tax breaks for the wealthy at the expense of urgently needed priorities, such as prescription drug coverage for our senior citizens. 
   The Republican trillion dollar tax breaks for the wealthy mean: No Medicare prescription drug benefit for the Nation's senior citizens; no new teachers for the Nation's schools; no increase in the minimum wage for the Nation's hard-working, low-wage workers; no protections for patients across the Nation facing abuses by HMOs; nothing to make the Nation's schools or our neighborhoods safer. 
   This tax break for the wealthy is a giant step in the wrong direction for America. President Clinton is right to veto it. 
   Never in the history of the Senate has so much been given to so few, with so little consideration for working families in America. 
   Mr. President, Republicans say that President Clinton himself called for marriage penalty relief in the State of the Union address that he delivered five months ago, so he should hurry and sign this bill. I wonder whether they heard the same speech that I heard last February. President Clinton certainly called for elimination of the marriage penalty, but he also urged action on other national priorities that are every bit as important--a Medicare prescription drug benefit, support for the nation's schools, and many other urgent national needs. 
   This is a do-nothing Republican Congress on all of these other priorities. The shamefully excessive single-minded focus has been on tax breaks for the wealthy, to the exclusion of all other major priorities. The GOP tax cuts already approved by this Congress will consume about a trillion dollars of the projected surplus over the next ten years. The bill that Republicans brought to the Senate today is a marriage penalty in name only. 
   It fails to eliminate 62 of the 65 marriage penalties in the tax code--while the Democrats' marriage penalty alternative eliminates every single one. 
   In the interest of all Americans, President Clinton offered to compromise and sign the Republican marriage penalty bill despite its shortcomings, but only if the Republican Congress made progress on at least one of the other urgent needs facing the nation--prescription drug coverage to end the unconscionable crisis that millions of senior citizens face every day--the high cost of the drugs they need to safeguard their health. The extraordinary promise of fuller and healthier lives offered by new discoveries in medicine is often beyond their reach. They need help to afford the life-saving, life-changing miracle drugs that are increasingly available. 
   Republicans in Congress have rejected this reasonable offer by the President and are still pursuing their irresponsible tax-cut agenda. Republicans have eyes only for tax breaks. They've attached tax breaks to the minimum wage bill in the House, more tax breaks to the bankruptcy bill in the Senate, and still more tax breaks to the Patients' Bill of Rights in the House. They have tried to pass tax breaks to subsidize private school. They even want to eliminate the estate tax, the ultimate tax break for the wealthy. 
   Earlier this week, the Republican leadership forced through the Senate a complete repeal of the estate tax which will cost over $50 billion a year when fully implemented. Over 90 percent of the benefits in that bill will go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. In total, Republicans in the House and Senate have already passed tax cuts that would consume almost a trillion dollars of the budget surplus over the next ten years, and far more than that in the next decade, because these GOP tax schemes are so backloaded to conceal their true cost to the nation's future. 
   Fortunately, the nation has a President who will not hesitate to stamp ``veto'' on all of 
   these irresponsible GOP giveaways. But what if we had a President who would sign these monstrosities? 
   The American people have a basic choice to make in November. Do they want the record budget surplus to be used for strengthening Social Security and Medicare--for providing a prescription drug benefit under Medicare--and for improving our schools? Or do they want to give trillions of dollars to the wealthiest individuals and corporations in the nation? 
   These are the basic policy choices for what kind of America we want in the years ahead. Democrats do not oppose  tax cuts, but we do insist that tax cuts must be reasonable in amount and must be fairly allocated to all Americans. 
   We also want action on other key priorities for the nation's future. Taking a trillion dollars out of the federal treasury for tax breaks clearly jeopardizes our ability to provide a prescription drug benefit for Medicare. It jeopardizes our ability to fix crumbling schools, reduce class sizes, and ensure that teachers are properly trained. It jeopardizes our ability to help the 4 million Americans who have no health insurance today because their employers won't provide it and they can't afford it on their own. 
   Just one of the Republican bills--the repeal of the estate tax--will give $250 billion to America's 400 wealthiest families over ten years. $250 billion will buy ten years of prescription drug coverage for eleven million senior citizens who have no coverage now. Yet, these astronomical tax giveaways are being rammed through Congress by a right wing Republican majority in Congress bent on rewarding the wealthy and ignoring the country's true priorities that have a far greater claim on these resources. 
   The prosperous economy is helping many Americans. But those who work day after day at the minimum wage are falling farther and farther behind. The number of families without health insurance is rising alarmingly. 
   A recent study by the pro-business Conference Board finds that the number of working poor is actually rising, in spite of the record prosperity. More and more working families are being forced to seek emergency help in soup kitchens and food pantries, and those charities are often unable to meet the increasing need. Yet Congress stands on the sidelines. 
   The result of the GOP tax break frenzy is to crowd out necessary spending on priorities that the American people care most about. These other priorities for all Americans are being ignored by the GOP Congress in this unseemly stampede to enact tax breaks so heavily skewed to the wealthiest Americans. Never in the entire history of the country has so much been given away so quickly to so few, with so little semblance of fairness or even thoughtful consideration. 
   If we are serious about ending the marriage penalty, instead of using it as a fig leaf for enormous tax breaks for the wealthy, we can easily do so at a reasonable cost that leaves ample room for other high priorities. I strongly support tax relief to end the marriage penalty. The marriage penalty is unfair, and it should be eliminated. 
   But I do not support the GOP proposal. That proposal is a trojan horse. Marriage 
   penalty relief is not its real purpose. Only 42 percent of the tax benefits--less than half of the total--goes to persons subject to the marriage penalty. The rest of the tax breaks--58 percent--go to those who pay no marriage penalty at all, and many of them are actually receive what is called a marriage bonus under the law. Republicans who claim their bill is intended only to eliminate the marriage penalty either haven't read the bill, or they are violating the ``Truth in Advertising'' laws. 
   Most married couples today do not pay a marriage penalty. A larger percentage of couples actually receive a marriage bonus than pay a marriage penalty. The marriage penalty is paid by couples in which both spouses work and also have relatively equal incomes. They deserve relief from this penalty. They deserve it immediately, and we can provide it modest cost. 
   But the Republican bill does not target its tax cuts to those who actually pay a marriage penalty. The cost of their bill is highly inflated and heavily backloaded to make the cost in the early years seem low. The current bill will cost nearly fifty billion dollars more over the next ten years than the bill which the Senate passed earlier this week. In just three days, the price tag has risen from $248 billion to $293 billion. That's an inflation rate which should alarm every American. 
   As with all Republican tax breaks, the bill earmarks the overwhelming majority of its tax benefits for the wealthiest taxpayers. The final bill sandpapers one of the roughest edges by deleting a provision that would have solely benefitted taxpayers with six figure incomes. But the overall bill is still grossly unfair to middle and low income working families. More than two thirds of the total tax savings go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. 
   An honest plan to eliminate the marriage penalty could easily be designed at much lower cost. House Democrats offered such a plan, and so did Senate Democrats. Our Democratic proposal would cost $11 billion a year less, when fully implemented, than the Republican plan, yet provide more marriage penalty tax relief to middle income families. 
   The problem is obvious. Republican colleagues insist on using marriage penalty relief as a cover for large tax breaks that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty and that are heavily weighted to the wealthiest individuals in the nation. The message to all Americans is clear and unmistakable--Beware of Republicans bearing tax cuts. They're not what they seem, and they're not fair to the vast vast majority of the American people. 
   This GOP Congress is a dream Congress for the very wealthy and their special interest friends, but it is a nightmare Congress for hard-working families all across America. Whether the Republican tax breaks arrive at the White House in smaller prices or in one big mess, their trillion-dollar tax breaks will eminently deserve the veto that President Clinton is about to give them.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of use are saddened by the death in our Senate family. I join Senators on both sides of the aisle in mourning the loss of our colleague and friend, Paul Coverdell, and I extend my deepest condolences to the members of his family. 
   Senator Coverdell and I differed on many of the major issues of the day. But it was obvious to all of us who served with him that he was a leader of genuine conviction, deep principle, great ability, and high purpose. 
   His commitment to public service was extraordinary. It was always a privilege to work with him. 
   I especially admired his dedication to seeking common ground--to exploring every aspect of every issue, and to learn as much as possible about it--to going the extra mile to achieve worthwhile compromise instead of confrontation--and above all to finding practical answers to the many serious challenges we face together in the Senate. 
   He was deeply committed to enhancing the qualify of life for all Americans. We both shared a strong commitment to improving education in all of the Nation's schools. I'm saddened that he will no longer be with us as the Senate turns again in coming days to the important debate on support for elementary and secondary education in schools and communities across the country. 
   I also particularly admired Paul Coverdell's leadership role as Director of the Peace Corps in the Bush administration from 1989 to 1991, before he came to the Senate. 
   Over the years, the Peace Corps has had special meaning for all of us in the Kennedy family, because it is one of the finest legacies of President Kennedy. I know that my brother would have been proud of Paul Coverdell's commitment to the Peace Corps and its ideals and its service to peoples in need in many different lands. 
   In a very real sense, the campaign slogan that Paul Coverdell used so effectively in his successful Senate re-election campaign in Georgia 2 years ago sums up his extraordinary career, and tells why he had so much respect and friendship from all of us. That slogan consisted of two simple words--``Coverdall Works.'' And it was true, in every sense of the word. Paul Coverdell served the Senate well, the Nation well, and the people of Georgia well, and we will miss him very much.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator WELLSTONE's amendment. We need to do all we can to understand why food stamp participation has declined so sharply. We know that poverty among working families is growing, not declining, even in this time of prosperity, and we need to find better answers to this problem. 
   The Conference Board is a global business membership organization that has enabled senior executives to exchange ideas on business policy and practices for nearly a century. The most recent Conference Board study is entitled ``Does a Rising Tide Lift All Boats? America's Full-Time Working Poor Reap Limited Gains in the New Economy.'' The conclusions of this pro-business group are surprising. The Conference Board found that the number of full-time workers classified as poor increased between 1997 and 1998, the last year for which data is available. And despite the strongest economic growth in three decades, the poverty rate among full-time workers is higher now than it was during the last recession. 
   The Congressional General Accounting Office also studied this issue of declining food stamp participation, and it found that food stamp participation is declining much more rapidly than poverty. 
   The obvious result is that millions more Americans, including children and working families, are going without adequate nutrition today than before the welfare reform law was enacted. 
   In Massachusetts, Project Bread operates a statewide hunger hotline, where operators respond to 2,300 requests for referrals each month. Last month, a mother from Worcester called. She had just been released from the hospital after the birth of her fifth baby. Doctors had ordered her to stop working 3 months ago, due to complications with her pregnancy. Her husband drives a bus, and their single salary was barely enough for the family to get by. When she called the hotline, there was no money and no food in the house, and hotline workers characterized her situation as desperate. 
   In many other communities, the nation's mayors have been distressed by the sudden sharp increases in requests for emergency food from working families. Too many of those in need are being turned away, because the resources are so inadequate. We clearly need a better understanding of why this alarming level of hunger persists in our record-breaking economy. 
   We need this additional information as soon as possible. We must accurately determine why food stamp participation has declined. I look forward to working with my colleagues to deal more effectively with this tragic problem of hunger.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The American food supply is one of the safest in the world--but it is not safe enough. Over 75 million Americans a year are stricken by disease caused by contaminated food they eat. Each year, 9,000 people--mostly the very young and the very old--die as a result. The costs of medical treatment and losses in productivity for these illnesses are as high as $37 billion annually. 
   The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and the increase in the number of organisms resistant to antibiotics, are compounding these problems and making foodborne illnesses an increasingly serious public health challenge. 
   Americans deserve to know that the foods they eat are safe, regardless of their source. Yet too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of foodborne disease. This Congress can make a difference. The FDA requested a budget increase of $30 million in 2001 for its Food Safety Initiative activities. With these additional funds, the FDA can improve its inspection of high-risk food establishments and strengthen its laboratory capabilities. Without this funding, the agency will conduct 700 fewer inspections next year. The Senate Appropriations Committee recognized the importance of protecting our food supply by granting the FDA the majority of its requested increase for food safety. The amendment I propose will give the FDA the additional $6 million it needs for these efforts. 
   In response to improved surveillance and increased sampling and testing, illnesses from the most common bacterial foodborne pathogens decreased by 21% from 1997 to 1999. As a result, 855,000 fewer Americans each year suffer from foodborne diseases. But contaminated food still remains a significant public health problem. 
   Recently, a new strain of an organism contaminated oysters in Texas, and caused an epidemic of diarrhea. This year, the FDA recalled several smoked fish products manufactured in New York because of outbreaks of disease. In March, 500 college students in Massachusetts became ill with Norwalk-like virus. Each year there are also at least 4700 cases of Salmonella in Massachusetts. We must do more to protect our citizens from foodborne diseases. 
   Imported foods are a significant part of the problem and often pose especially serious health risks. Americans are consuming foods from other countries at increasing rates. Since 1992, the number of food imports has tripled. At that time, the FDA was able to inspect only 8% of these imports. Since then the rate of FDA inspections of imported food has dropped to less than 1%, because resources did not increase for monitoring these imports. 
   Other countries have often not implemented food safety protections comparable to those in the United States, and general sanitary conditions are often poor. As a consequence, foods from such countries are more likely to be contaminated with disease-producing organisms. In 1995, 242 people contracted Salmonella from alfalfa sprouts imported from the Netherlands. In 1996, over 1,400 people became ill from contaminated raspberries from Guatemala. Just this year, infected shrimp from Vietnam caused Salmonella and E. coli outbreaks.  
   In earlier decades, diseases such as tuberculosis and cholera were the focus of food safety concerns. Today diseases caused by dangerous new strains of E. coli have become primary causes of foodborne illness. These new organisms necessitate increased investment in research, technology, and surveillance to protect the safety of our food supply. 
   Food safety are also especially important to protect the growing number of individuals in vulnerable populations, such as young children, the elderly, those with lowered immunity from HIV, and those with inadequate access to health care. 
   By providing the FDA with the necessary resources to combat foodborne diseases, we can protect tens of millions of our fellow citizens across the country each year. Investment in food safety is an investment in the health of every American. Congress should give the FDA the resources it needs in order to ensure the safety of the food we eat. The amendment I am proposing is a major step to meet this challenge, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment and I commend the sponsors for their efforts to address the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   I support this amendment, and I commend its sponsors for their efforts to address the high cost of prescription drugs. The American public wants affordable medicines, and I believe we should do all we can to reduce the financial burden imposed on our citizens by high drug costs. 
   It is worth emphasizing that imports of prescription drugs from other countries must be accompanied by strict precautions to protect the public. Federal standards require that all prescriptions sold in the United States must be safe and effective. The public health protections guaranteed by the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act do not end at the gates of the manufacturer's plant but extend all the way to the doorstep of the consumer. Congress has promised the American people that the medications they use will be effective and be free of contaminants. 
   In 1988, President Reagan signed into law the Prescription Drug Marketing Act to protect Americans from counterfeit, contaminated, and other unsafe medications. Today counterfeit drugs continue to plague the citizens of many countries, including our own. In 2000, at least 30 people in Cambodia died from fake malaria medications. 60,000 people in Niger were vaccinated against a deadly epidemic of meningitis with counterfeit vaccines, and received water injections instead of real medicines. This past year the United Kingdom broke up a smuggling ring to import counterfeit drugs into the U.K. from India. According to a DEA official, 25% of the prescription drugs brought by consumers into the U.S. from Mexico are fake. From 1989 to 1994 a counterfeit antibiotic from China was sold in the U.S. through legal distribution channels resulting in almost 2,000 adverse events, including 49 deaths. In spite of an Import Alert issued by the FDA in September 1999, the fake medication may still be entering the U.S. 
   I raise these problems to emphasize that without adequate protections, legalizing importation by pharmacists and wholesalers will increase the risks already posed by fake and contaminated drugs. This amendment deals with these safety concerns primarily by placing the responsibility for assuring the quality of imported products on the importer, subject to FDA oversight--and it gives FDA broad authority to impose additional requirements necessary to protect public health. 
   The FDA needs adequate tools to combat counterfeit or adulterated drugs. Adequate funding for the FDA is essential to ensure the safety of imported prescription drugs. FDA currently inspects less than 1% of all drug shipments from other countries. Clearly, additional resources will be necessary to implement this amendment.  
   As we all know, the real issue is providing an effective and affordable prescription drug benefit to senior citizens and the disabled under Medicare. 
   That is the basic and fundamental issue. We wouldn't be having this debate if we were providing an effective prescription drug program to the seniors under the Medicare program. It wouldn't be necessary. We wouldn't have to be taking these additional risks. This is not a substitute for the Senate taking action on that important measure. 
   The President has reiterated the fact that he would be glad in working with our Republican friends to sign their marriage penalty legislation if it included a prescription drug program. It is absolutely essential. This legislation is no substitute for it. 
   The cost of the drugs these patients needed far exceeded their ability to pay, even if the cost was deeply discounted. A patient with high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, and an enlarged prostate would pay $3,100 annually for drugs. 
   This particular chart indicates the general patient profile for some of the most common kinds of concerns, particularly for the elderly. They are the ones who have the highest utilization of the prescription drugs. They are the ones who need the protections under Medicare. They are the ones who, hopefully, we are going to take action on in this Congress to protect. 
   We are talking about osteoporosis, or heart trouble with a typical cost of $2,412--that is 20 percent of the pretax income; high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, enlarged prostate, $3,100, 26 percent of pretax income; severe arthritis, ulcers, gastric reflux, depression, $3,696, 31 percent; ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease, asthma, $4,800, 40 percent. 
   This basically shows not only the access but the enormous costs of the prescription drugs to address these particular items. 
   A patient with heart disease and severe anemia, $26,500, and 22 percent. 
   If we look at this chart, most senior citizens have very moderate incomes. Look at this. Fifty-seven percent are under $15,000; 21 percent are under $24,000. We have virtually 80 percent below $24,000. 
   We are talking about a handful of senior citizens in the upper areas. Eighty percent of our seniors are people of extremely modest means. The cost of these drugs are going absolutely out of sight. 
   That is why we have to have a program that is going to provide coverage, and that is going to be universally affordable for our seniors and for the Federal Government as well. 
   This is a drug crisis for our seniors. The coverage is 
    going down, and the costs are going up. 
   I will take just a moment of the Senate's time to point out what is happening to our senior citizens. 
   Twelve million--effectively a third--of our seniors have no coverage whatsoever. Eleven million of them have employer-sponsored coverage. We are going to show a chart in just a moment that shows employer-sponsored drug coverage is collapsing. 
   Some three million have Medicare-HMO, and we will find what is happening in the HMOs where they are putting limitations of what they are going to be prepared to reimburse under prescription drugs. 
   The next is Medigap costs which are going right up through the ceiling and becoming less and less affordable. 
   The only group of Americans who have dependable, reliable, affordable prescription drugs are the 4 million Americans under Medicaid. 
   It is a national disgrace when we know the commitment that was made here in the Congress in 1964 and in 1956 that said to our senior citizens, work hard, we will pass Medicare, and you will not have to worry about your health care needs in your golden years. We didn't include a prescription drug program because the private sector didn't have it then. Only 3 cents out of every dollar was expended on prescription drugs. Now it is up 20 cents, and in some places even 30 cents, in terms of the costs of the health care dollars. Health benefits have dropped by 25 percent. That is between 1994 and 1997. This arrow is continuing to go right down. 
   The other chart showed where you have 11 million seniors getting covered by employer-based programs. This chart indicates that they are rapidly losing coverage at the present time. 
   We have 11 million who do not have any coverage, and 12 million who have employer-sponsored coverage. But that is going down. 
   This shows what is happening if they get Medicare HMO drug coverage. We see 75 percent will limit coverage to less than $1,000. They are putting limitations on what they will pay for. The chart shows the five major illnesses affecting and impacting our senior citizens cost vastly higher than $1,000. Therefore, our seniors, even if they have coverage under an HMO, are still paying an unaffordable amount of money if $1,000 is the limitation. Mr. President, 32 percent have imposed caps of less than $500. We are seeing the collapse of coverage that is out there for our senior citizens. 
   This chart shows what is happening in the medigap coverage--which is effectively becoming unaffordable--in the sample premium for a 75-year-old person in various States. This is virtually unaffordable. 
   This chart shows the costs of drugs compared to the Consumer Price Index over recent years, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, and 1999. In 1995, 2.5 percent; in 1996, 3.3 percent; in 1997, 1.7 percent; in 1999, 2.7. 
   The top of the chart shows the actual drug costs in terms of the expenditures being made by seniors to get the drugs they need. We see a very modest increase in the Consumer Price Index. Yet for senior citizens who use three times the amount of drugs as the rest of the population, we find out this is continuing to increase, placing extraordinary pressure on seniors. In many instances, they are completely unaffordable. 
   As mentioned earlier in the debate, the Pharmaceutical Research Manufacturers say:  
   Private drug insurance lowers the prices 30 percent to 39 percent.  
   That says it all. It is saying you could go ahead and have a reduction in the costs of these prescription drugs anywhere from 30 percent to 39 percent, and they can still make an adequate and generous profit. This is from the industry itself. The seniors are hearing this and living it, as pointed out by the Senator from North Dakota and my friend, the Senator from Vermont. They are seeing this. They know this has happened. They have to go abroad in order to try to get these vital prescription drugs. 
   The unanswered question is, If we can go across and buy them, why can't we do this in a way that is going to be more accessible and available not only to those able to go over but also to our friends and neighbors and fellow senior citizens? 
   It is out of that enormous frustration and these facts that this amendment comes to the floor. That is why I believe it should be supported. I think it is essential, but it is not going to address the fundamental issue, which is the Medicare program that will cover all of our senior citizens and effectively do it in a way that will see a significant reduction of costs. 
   I thank the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Just before the Senator leaves that thought about the need for support for special education, this is something the Senator from Iowa has been particularly interested in and in which he is strongly supported by the Senator from Illinois and myself. 
   We have heard a lot of lectures out here about the importance of helping local communities who have these extraordinary challenges of families who have children with these special needs, and it places a very special burden on local communities. I think the Senators from Iowa and Illinois and others understand the importance of giving help and relief to these communities all across this country. We hear about the need out there. 
   I am wondering whether the Senator shares my belief that after giving $1.3 trillion away, whether we should not have used some of those resources to try to help local communities and help families who have these kinds of special needs for their children? 
   We are going to be hard pressed to find the resources to do that. Perhaps the Senator would also tell me why it is now that we have gone all of this last year, all of this year, and we still can't get a minimum wage up to look out for the interests of 13 million Americans who are working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, who take pride and have a sense of dignity, that we can't have an opportunity to address it, when in the last 5 days we have given $1.3 trillion away to the wealthiest individuals.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Will the Senator respond to another question? 
   Is it the Senator's position--and we have been joined by the Senators from California and New York--that there is a greater priority to provide a prescription drug program for the 40 million Americans who need prescription drugs than there is to grant the $1.3 trillion to the wealthiest individuals, that the Senator from Illinois shares the belief that we ought to be addressing that particular issue prior to the time that we give away all of these funds to some of the wealthiest individuals?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, between last Friday and today, in the span of just 4 days, Republican Senators will pass tax breaks, overwhelmingly targeted for the wealthy, that will cost the Treasury one and a half trillion dollars over the next 20 years. You would think that careful attention would be paid to the merits of these astronomical tax giveaways before they are passed. Instead, they are being rammed through by a right-wing Republican majority in Congress bent on rewarding the wealthy and ignoring the country's true priorities that have a far greater claim on these enormous resources. 
   What about prescription drug coverage for millions of senior citizens under Medicare? I have just returned from Massachusetts where I met with the elderly people. They are asking, Will the Senate of the United States, will Congress, take action to provide some relief to the elderly people in my State and across the country? Really, the unfinished business of Medicare is the prescription drug program. We did not debate that last Thursday and last Friday. We are not debating that issue today. We have basically said, let's find out how we can give the one and a half trillion dollars away over the next 20 years, instead of dealing with the Medicare issue on prescription drugs. 
   What about greater Federal aid to education to help schools and colleges across the country and the students who attend them? We put into the RECORD last Friday the most recent studies of the Congressional Research Service that showed that by moving to smaller class sizes, there was an enhancement of academic achievement and accomplishment by students in California. That supports the STARS Program of Tennessee. Senator MURRAY of the State of Washington has been our leader championing for smaller class sizes, because we believe that that can be enormously important in enhancing academic achievement. If we do that, plus ensure that teachers get training and professional advancement in their classrooms, working to enhance their professionalism, we will see a very important, significant gain in academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   We also know the value of afterschool programs, tutorials, and accountability, as Senator BINGAMAN has talked about; the newer digital divide that Senator MIKULSKI has talked about; construction, the need to make sure our schools will be safe and secure and not crumbling, as so many of them are. But, no, we have set that aside. We are not going to have the resources to do that. Make no mistake about it, I say to American families, we have made enhancing academic achievement for our teachers, smaller class sizes, afterschool programs, a lesser priority than providing $1.5 trillion from the Federal Treasury to the wealthiest individuals. 
   What about health insurance for the millions of hard-working Americans who have no coverage today? We made a downpayment in terms of the children in the CHIP program in a bipartisan way. We reach out to try to get coverage for their hard-working parents, an increasing number of Americans, who do not have health insurance. But we have not put that on the agenda. We are not debating that here on the floor of the Senate. There will not be the resources to try to do that. We are saying we want $1.5 trillion for the wealthiest individuals. Health insurance for hard-working Americans is put aside. 
   What about raising the minimum wage for millions of low-income Americans, the 13 million Americans, the majority of whom are women who have children? It is a women's issue, it is a children's issue, and it is a civil rights issue because so many of these men and women are men and women of color. It is a fairness issue. People who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should not have to live in poverty. No, we cannot debate that up here in the 
   Senate. We can get tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in this country, but we will not debate an increase in the minimum wage. We will not do it. 
   I hope we are not going to hear long lectures from the other side about how we ought to be funding, now, the special needs programs. We had great statements from the other side: We have failed in meeting our responsibility to special needs children, to help local communities in the area of education. We have heard that time in and time out, while we have been trying to do some of these other actions for children in this country. We had an opportunity to pay for all those special needs children, but I did not hear from the other side that this is a priority. We did not hear it when they had the $780 billion tax cut 2 years ago, and we could have taken a fifth of that tax cut and funded special needs education for every child in this country for 10 years. No, no, that is not enough of a priority. We are not going to do it. Our tax cut is too important. We are going to give $1.5 trillion away without spending a single nickel on special needs children. 
   The list goes on about protecting Social Security and Medicare. Right now, I am sure there are scores of Members of the Congress and the Senate going on about how we ought to protect Medicare and Social Security. It is very clear what the priority has been in the Senate: $1.5 trillion, not to protect Medicare, not to protect Social Security, but to provide it to the wealthiest individuals in this country. 
   That is what has happened over the period of these last 4 days, including a Sunday when we were not even here. All of these priorities and many more are being blatantly ignored by this Republican Congress in their unseemly stampede to enact these tax breaks for the wealthy. Never, in the entire history of our country, has so much been given away so quickly to so few with so little semblance of fairness or even thoughtful consideration. 
   I make that statement. I wait to be challenged on that. Never, never in the history of this body has so much been given away to so few, in such a short period of time, with such little semblance of fairness and even thoughtful consideration. 
   I hope we are not going to hear from the other side: We need to study these  issues more carefully in our committee; this hasn't been carefully considered by the committee--when they come out with that $1.5 trillion tax cut, that never even saw the light of day in committee, on the estate tax. Think of having a committee report, think of having a committee discussion, think of having some debate about what the implications of this might be in terms of a wide range of different issues? Absolutely not. We just took it, faced it, and passed it. 
   So it goes on. Plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else will be the epitaph of this Republican Congress. It's a dream Congress for the superwealthy and their special interest friends, and a nightmare Congress for hard-working families across America. 
   The Republican's trillion-dollar tax breaks will eminently deserve the veto that President Clinton is about to give them. The Republicans fail to honestly weigh the nation's priorities, and I believe that this is an irresponsible and reckless way to legislate. Some may view it as good political theater, red meat for the Republican right wing on the eve of the Republican convention. But it is a disservice to all Americans because it prevents action on the many true priorities facing this Nation. 
   I suspect that Americans who see and understand what is happening here this week in Washington will ask a single question: What if George W. Bush were in the White House? He would sign these irresponsible tax break monstrosities, and the nation would suffer for years to come. 
   I suspect that millions of Americans who see what is happening here would say: No thanks, we don't need a Congress that would pass such irresponsible legislation--and we certainly don't need a President who would sign it. 
   Last Friday's estate tax bill gave $250 billion to America's 400 wealthiest families, yet this same $250 billion would buy 10 years of prescription drug coverage for 11 million senior citizens who don't have access to coverage now. Our senior citizens face a crisis today. The extraordinary promise of fuller and healthier lives offered by new discoveries in medicine is often beyond their reach. They need help to afford the life-saving, life-changing miracle drugs that are increasingly available. Cutting a trillion dollars from the federal budget clearly jeopardizes our ability to add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare. 
   Today, in schools across the country, students face over-crowded classrooms, teachers go without adequate training, school buildings are crumbling, and violence is a constant threat. One would think that at some opportunity over these past few days we would have debated what most families are concerned about, as well as insuring academic achievement for their children in a safe and secure area. 
   No, we are denied that opportunity. We cannot debate that. We are told somehow that it is not relevant. It is relevant to what parents care about, which is their children in school. I daresay it is a lot more relevant than the fact that we will be giving $1.5 trillion, $250 billion of which will go to the 400 wealthiest families. It is a lot more relevant to their lives than that other factor, the giveaway. 
   Yet, Republicans are rushing through a trillion dollars in tax cuts without serious consideration of what it means for the nation's unmet education needs. Today, the booming economy is helping many Americans, but those who work day after day at the minimum wage are falling farther and farther behind. A recent study by the pro-business Conference Board finds that the number of working poor is actually rising, in spite of the record prosperity. The number of working poor families who seek emergency help in soup kitchens and food pantries across the nation is far ahead of the ability of agencies to meet their needs. 
   Read the reports from last week about what is happening to children in our society. The total number of poor children has gone down by about a percentage point, a point and a half, maybe, in the last 2 years. But the ones who are living in poverty are living in deeper poverty than they have ever experienced. 
   We are finding an increased number of children who are not being immunized against basic diseases, and here we are cutting $1.5 trillion, when we are not immunizing our children and cannot find ways to make those programs workable and effective. We are not debating that and trying to find ways to improve it. 
   The cost of rental housing is skyrocketing in most cities 
   because of the economic boom, but the wages of millions of families who need that housing has failed to keep pace. 
   My colleague and friend from Massachusetts, JOHN KERRY, made this case so well last week to, effectively, a deaf audience in the Senate. Cutting tax revenues by a trillion and half dollars jeopardizes our ability to respond to these needs. 
   The American people cry out for action on many other basic priorities, but the tax breaks being passed by the Republican Congress would make fair action on all those priorities virtually impossible. Republicans are well aware that their tax-cutting extravaganza would not survive if it were honestly weighed against the nation's real priorities. That is why Republicans resort to gross distortion of the facts. 
   They apply the phony label ``death tax'' of trying to deal with family farms and small businesses. Republicans told story after story about how the estate tax hurts owners of small businesses and family farms. Our Democratic alternative would grant them protection, but it wasn't enough for Republicans. Their position was to basically hold small business owners and small farmers hostage until they could get the larger breaks for the largest estates and the wealthiest individuals in the country. 
   They know this President is going to veto this measure, and instead of truly doing something that would benefit those small family farms and small businesses, they say: Oh, we would rather have it vetoed. We will serve those small family farms up rather than deal with them. They know this is true in the marriage tax penalty as well. 
   Listen to this: They apply the phony label ``marriage tax penalty'' to the current bill even though 58 percent of the tax cuts go to couples who pay no marriage penalty at all. Do my colleagues hear that? Fifty-eight percent of the benefits of this measure, according to the Joint Tax Committee, a measure which we will start voting at 6:30 this evening, will go to couples who pay no marriage tax penalty at all. 
   The Democrats have a simple alternative to address the marriage penalty: Let them file as a single person if it will mean it lowers their taxes. What in the world could be simpler than that? If one is paying more because of their marriage situation as a result of commingling of the funds, Democrats say: OK, file as single individuals. That will solve it. There is no red tape and no administrative bureaucracy. It is simple. It meets a particular challenge. 
   The Republicans: Oh, no. We want our program which will provide this extraordinary windfall to the wealthiest individuals. 
   Our Democratic alternative would cost $11 billion a year less than the Republican bill--but it would provide greater marriage tax penalty relief to families with incomes below $150,000 a year. But, our sensible Democratic approach does not overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy so the Republicans reject it. Republicans intentionally designed their bill to give 78 percent of the total tax savings to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. 
   Ending the marriage tax penalty is a thinly veiled pretext to their latest installment of massive tax breaks for the wealthy. We saw the same tactics during the debate on the estate tax. We heard story after story of how the estate tax will hurt owners of small businesses and family farms. 
   I found Senator CONRAD's presentation of our Democratic alternative compelling and effective, virtually unchallenged on the floor of the Senate. Oh, yes, there was a challenge saying: Look, why are we supporting that because all of the various groups evidently support the Republican position? 
   I thought that was very interesting coming after our debate on HMO reform where we had 330 organizations support our HMO reform, and this particular Senate voted against it when they did not have a single one supporting their proposal and the responses by Senator CONRAD were responsive to this challenge.  
   They are holding small businesses and farmers hostage to their flagrant scheme to help the super-rich even while they talk piously of helping the middle class. 
   This Republican Congress is the trillion-dollar-travesty Congress. Fortunately, President Clinton and AL GORE are here--in this case, President Clinton--with a veto pen to burst their bubble. But thank goodness that working families, middle-income families, have a President who really cares about the economic and financial situation in this country. 
   I take pride that I was one of 11 Members of the Senate who voted against the Reagan tax cut that took us from $400 billion to $4 trillion in debt. 
   That is why I am always interested in listening to those on the other side talk about what wonderful economic programs we have had over the recent times. 
   Let me finally use these charts to demonstrate, once again, what this repeal of the estate tax will cost. It is $55 billion per year that we are effectively giving the wealthiest individuals by the year 2010. This could fund every program in the Department of Education. 
   We are not saying that just throwing money at it answers all the problems. But it is a pretty clear indication about what a nation's priorities are, about how we are going to allocate resources. We could have fully done that, funded all of education, on this. We could have funded the total cost of prescription drug medicines for every beneficiary and had $15 billion left over. We could have had funding for all the beneficiaries, for all of our senor citizens. We could have provided the funding for the $20 billion which takes care of all the medical research in the National Institutes of Health, and you would still have $35 billion left. 
   This is an indication of priorities. This is another indication. 
   This chart depicts that from the Republican estate tax, those who are going to benefit from it, benefit from it to the average of $268,000. All we are trying to get is a Medicare prescription drug benefit that will be valued for our senior citizens at $900. 
   Here it is: $268,000, by 2010, for those who will benefit under the Republican tax cut. All we are trying to do is get $900 for our senior citizens, our 40 million senior citizens we will have at that time. Or to put it another way, the beneficiaries will have the estates worth $2.3 million. The people we are trying to help average $13,000 a year. They are the people we are trying to look out for. 
   This is the contrast. I believe, as I have said, never has so much been given to so few in such a short period of time--without, I think, the fair, adequate national debate or discussion in terms of what is really necessary, in terms of meeting the human needs of families in this country, the educational needs, the health needs, of what is needed in terms of housing for working families and what is necessary in terms of prescription drugs. 
   How are we going to have clean air? How are we going to have clean water? How are we going to clean up the brownfields? How are we going to make sure people are going to continue to have an opportunity to work in employment and have the training and the skills in order to be able to compete in the new economy? 
   All of those priorities have been washed away. With $1.3 trillion, we would be able to provide the investments for the American people. We have given that away. We have given that away without adequate and fair consideration of these priorities. I welcome the fact that we have a President who is going to veto those measures. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are talking about relief from the so-called marriage penalty in the Tax Code. But low-income married parents face a more serious marriage penalty under Medicaid. Under the current law, parents who are married lose their health coverage under Medicaid in some 14 States. In other States, they lose their health coverage under Medicaid if they work more than 100 hours a month. That is wrong. 
   Our answer to this problem is to provide States with the resources and authority to expand S-CHIP and Medicaid to the parents of the children who are covered under these programs. It is a sensible system. The President has paid for it in his budget. It provides needed relief from the health marriage and work penalty under Medicaid. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am disappointed that the Senate has taken four days now to debate the estate tax before making any real progress on education, health, or debt reduction. Democrats agree that owners of small businesses and farms need relief from this tax, and if the Republicans had worked with us, this problem could have been solved long ago. Instead, our Republican colleagues are holding small business owners and farmers hostage as their excuse to provide an enormous windfall to the wealthiest 1 percent of taxpayers--people who have an average income of over $800,000 a year. The repeal of the estate tax that they seek, costing over $50 billion a year, is the ultimate tax break for the wealthy, and any repeal bill will eminently deserve the veto that President Clinton has promised if it reaches his desk. 
   The Senate has much higher priorities that we should have addressed this week. Tens of millions of senior citizens face a crisis because they can't afford the prescription drugs they need. The extraordinary promise of fuller and healthier lives brought by new prescription drugs is beyond their reach. They need help to afford these life-saving, life-changing miracle drugs. But instead of doing the work that is needed to enable all seniors to access the prescription drugs they need, the Senate spends day after day doing the bidding of a few thousand of America's wealthiest citizens. 
   We send tens of millions of young children to dilapidated, crumbling, over-crowded schools with underpaid teachers each day--yet we stand here debating a bill to repeal the tax on multi-million dollar estates. 
   Millions of working men and women and their families struggle to survive on the minimum wage at its current unfair level of $5.15 an hour. The Republican Senate has no time to meet their needs--yet the time of the Senate is instantly available to those who make thousands of dollars each hour. 
   Congress has not found time to resolve any of the daily problems facing the vast majority of the nation's working families, its senior citizens, and its school children. In this ``do-nothing Congress,'' the list of priority matters on which nothing is done goes on and on--gun safety, the patients' bill of rights, protecting children from tobacco, protecting the environment. There is no time for any of these issues--but there is always time to help millionaires and even billionaires reduce their taxes. It is obvious where the priorities of our Republican friends lie. 
   All Americans should take a clear look at what the Republicans really want when they propose a full repeal of the estate tax. Current law now taxes only the largest 2 percent of all estates. No one else pays any estate tax. Today anyone can bequeath unlimited resources to a spouse completely free of the estate tax, and $675,000 to anyone else--again completely without tax. Present law already exempts up to $1.3 million for family-owned businesses and farms. 
   We Democrats seek to substantially raise these exemptions so that next year, no one pays the tax on the first two million dollars in value of any estate, and by 2010, no one pays the tax on the first four million dollars in value of any estate. The Democratic plan affords owners of small businesses and family farms double these exemptions, so that couples who own a small business or family farm worth up to $8 million would pay no estate tax at all. If a business or farm is 
   worth over $8 million, only the portion over $8 million in an estate is taxed under the Democratic plan. The Democratic plan will eliminate all estate taxes for more than half of those who currently pay them. I stand with my Democratic colleagues in fully supporting this common sense approach to estate tax reform. 
   Estate tax repeal, however, is simply a boon for the three thousand largest estates each year, valued not in millions, but in the tens of millions of dollars. These huge estates are the only ones significantly affected by the estate tax. 
   Currently, over half of all estate taxes are paid by the top one tenth of the wealthiest one percent--estates worth more than $5 million. There are fewer than three thousand of these estates out of the 2.3 million Americans who die each year. According to an analysis by the Citizens for Tax Justice, 91 percent of the tax benefits from repeal of the estate tax would go to the top 1 percent of taxpayers--who have an average annual income of $837,000. As Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has said, repealing the estate tax would qualify as the most regressive and back-loaded tax legislation ever. 
   Republicans don't want to talk about who will really benefit from this enormous tax cut. Instead, they talk about the plight of small family owned farms and businesses. What they don't tell you is that these family owned small businesses and farms account for less than ten percent of estate taxes today. 
   We could act now--and we should--to help families keep their farms and businesses when the owner dies. This concern is legitimate--but it does not justify eliminating the entire estate tax. The estate tax problem for small businesses and family farms could be solved at a fraction of the cost of the Republican bill. Our Democratic proposal provides full relief to these families. 
   If helping owners of small farms and businesses were the Republicans' real goal, they would join us to pass the Democratic estate tax reform overwhelmingly. After all, the Democratic plan exempts almost all owners of small businesses and farms immediately, while the Republican plan takes ten years before exempting anyone. Republicans obviously know that giving immediate relief to family farms and small firms will take away any pretext at all for the enormous windfall that they want to give the richest taxpayers. They know they can never explain the real purpose of their estate tax repeal to the voters--so they are holding relief for small business owners and small farmers hostage to their unacceptable larger scheme for helping the super-rich. 
   The people whom the Republican leadership is really working for--but whom they don't want to mention--are those few people who inherit the 3,000 estates each year that are worth more than $5 million. These estates are one in every thousand estates--yet they pay over half of the current estate tax. When pressed to explain why these estates need to have taxes eliminated entirely, Republicans respond vaguely in terms of ``fairness.'' They never explain why it is fairer to tax the earned income of working families than the unearned inheritance of the wealthiest families in America. That is a fairness issue they never want to talk about. There is nothing compassionately conservative about repealing the estate tax. 
   Republican President Theodore Roosevelt thought the estate tax was fair when he proposed it a century ago. He believed then and we believe today that those who have the largest financial resources have an obligation to help provide for the basic needs of the less fortunate members of this community. Obviously, today's Republicans don't share Teddy Roosevelt's values. 
   The supporters of the Republican estate tax repeal have also carefully designed it to conceal its real long-run cost. Under their scheme, full repeal  would not occur until the year 2010. When fully phased in, the repeal will cost over $50 billion a year. The cost of repealing the estate tax will be nearly three quarters of a trillion dollars in the second ten years. This nation cannot afford to devote three quarters of a trillion dollars to repealing the estate tax. The 98 percent of Americans who would receive no tax relief from repeal of the estate tax know it is unfair to spend this vast amount on the wealthiest taxpayers. 
   Let's consider what $50 billion a year can accomplish for the American people--if we don't repeal the estate tax. It is more than the entire budget for the Department of Education. We could double the federal investment in schools--provide smaller classes with better teachers, state of the art computer technology for every classroom, and modern school facilities across the nation. We could double the financial assistance for college students. 
   Consider what $50 billion a year could do for senior citizens. It is $10 billion more than is needed to fully fund prescription drug coverage for all elderly Americans under Medicare. 
   We have a bipartisan congressional goal to double the funding for medical research through the National Institutes of Health and improve the health of our entire nation. Fifty billion dollars a year would allow us to virtually triple the NIH budget. 
   These are the most pressing needs of the American people--not repeal of the estate tax. 
   Astonishing as it may seem, I have heard my Republican colleagues stand on this floor and claim that the projected budget surplus enables us to easily afford their estate tax repeal. But by the time their law is fully effective in 2010, it will cost the Treasury over $50 billion each year, rising to $750 billion over ten years. 
   Repeal of the estate tax would also cost the country billions in charitable contributions. A Treasury Department analysis estimates that it would cause charitable contributions to be reduced by $6 billion per year. Colleges that rely on donations to build buildings and provide scholarships would be hurt. Medical schools that rely on donations to conduct medical research would be halted. Public Hospitals that rely on donations to buy equipment and buildings would have to cut back on their ability to provide health care. Shelters that rely on donations to keep people warm and fed would have to turn more people away. Six billion dollars is precious to the non-profit sector of this Nation. 
   The entire Department of Education will have budgeted $48 billion in fiscal year 2005. You don't hear Republicans saying we can easily afford to double education spending. Instead, during the recent debate on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, we repeatedly heard our Republican colleagues say that they had to compromise among competing meritorious priorities to fit within their limited budget. They have ample money for the super-rich--but nothing for students in crumbling schools. 
   The same is true for prescription drugs. President Clinton's proposal would cost about $40 billion in 2010, the year before Republicans want to begin giving over $50 billion each year in tax breaks to the wealthiest of all Americans. 
   I vote for prescription drugs over estate tax repeal. I vote for education over estate tax repeal. I vote for medical research over estate tax repeal. This issue should not even be a close question for 98 percent of Americans. 
   The Republican Party is living up to its reputation as the ``Let Them Eat Cake'' Party. 
   What do they propose for senior citizens who desperately need prescription drugs? Republicans say, ``Let them eat cake.'' 
   What do they propose for schools and students? Republicans say ``Let them eat cake.'' 
   What do they propose for workers struggling to survive on the minimum wage? Republicans say, ``Let them eat cake.'' 
   What do they propose for the richest 1 percent of taxpayers? A $50 billion annual windfall at the expense of America's hard-working families. 
   I say, ``Let them eat cake'' will work no better for the Republican Party than it did for Marie Antoinette.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, pay discrimination against women continues to be a serious problem in our society. The wage gap now costs America's families $200 billion a year. Nearly two-thirds of working women report that they provide half or more of their family's income, and nearly one in five U.S. families is headed by a single woman. Yet single mothers continue to earn the lowest average rate of pay. 
   Although the Equal Pay Act was signed into law 37 years ago, the wage gap today continues to plague American families, and wage discrimination continues to be a serious and pervasive problem in workplaces across the country. In spite of the Equal Pay Act, women still earn only 73 cents for every dollar earned by men. And the pay disparities between white men and women of color are even more disturbing. African American women earn just 63 cents, and Latinas earn only 53 cents for every dollar earned by white men. And men of color suffer from pay inequality as well. 
   These disparities translate into large costs in lost wages and lost opportunity. The average working woman loses $4,200 in income annually, and suffers a loss of $420,000 over her career. In Massachusetts, women earn an average of $512 weekly, compared to $640 earned by men for the same period of time. This gender gap has a long-term impact, since lower wages and lower lifetime earnings lead to lower pension benefits in retirement. The median pension benefit received by new female retirees is less than half that of benefits received by men. 
   Women are entitled to the same paychecks as male colleagues who perform  the same or comparable work. Without this guarantee, women are less able to provide an economic safety net for themselves and their families. If married women were paid the same wages as men in comparable positions, their family incomes would rise by nearly 6 percent, and their families' poverty rates would fall. If single women earned as much as men in comparable positions, their incomes would rise by 13 percent, and their poverty rates would be reduced as well. These figures demonstrate the severe effect of pay disparities on the lives of women and their families. 
   Equal pay helps men as well as women. One of the major causes of pay inequity is sex segregation in the workplace. Jobs traditionally held by men, such as jobs which involve heavy lifting or truck driving, are compensated more highly than jobs traditionally held by women, which often involve caretaking or nurturing activities. Both men and women in jobs predominantly held by women--such as sales, service, nursing, child care, teaching and clerical positions--suffer the effects of pay bias. As the percentage of women within an occupation increases, the wages for that job decrease. 
   Women and men alike will receive significant gains in earnings if they are paid the same wages as comparable workers in jobs that are not predominantly female. Men and women who work in predominantly female occupations earn less than comparable workers in other occupations. Women would gain $89 billion a year, and men would gain $25 billion from pay equity increases in female-dominated jobs. The 4 million men who work in predominately female occupations lose, on average, over $6200 each year. The increase in payroll costs that would result from these wage adjustments would be only 3.7 percent of total hourly payroll costs throughout the economy. 
   Some argue that these differences in pay are based on different levels of education, years in the workforce and similar factors. But, these factors alone do not explain away the wage gap. Studies have found substantial pay differences between men and women working in the same narrowly defined occupations and establishments. Studies of discrimination in hiring offer additional evidence on the gender pay gap. 
   Educational advancement hasn't solved this problem. Although women have now surpassed men in the percentage of those earning a college or advanced degree, college-educated women earn almost $14,000 less than college educated men. A black woman with a master's degree earns almost $10,000 less annually than a college-educated white male. A college-educated Hispanic female makes only $727 more than a white male with a high school degree. These disparities in compensation for men and women can be explained by one factor--blatant discrimination. 
   Consider the story of Sarah Foulger, who served as pastor of a church in Maine for more than 10 years. For the last 5 of those years, she asked for a pay raise, and every year she was told the increase had to be delayed or reduced. Within weeks of her departure, the church was 
   able to significantly increase the salary of the male pastor hired to replace her. After 17 years of her ministry, she earned less than $7,000 in pension credits. The third of her salary that was missing--multiplied by just 4 years of being underpaid --would have added up to enough money to pay for a State college education for one of her children. 
   Gender and race-based wage discrimination is also present on Capitol Hill, and it is glaring and embarrassing for all of us. Women custodial workers in the House and Senate Office Buildings have been underpaid for years, and have finally brought suit against the Architect of the Capitol. Even though the women custodians perform essentially the same work under the same job conditions as male workers, they are paid almost a dollar less an hour. 
   But there are some successes. Nancy Hopkins is a molecular biologist and professor at M.I.T. When she learned that she was making less than her male colleagues, she took the issue to the administration. M.I.T's top officials responded by issuing a report acknowledging that its female professors suffered from pervasive, if unintentional, discrimination. The report documented discrimination in hiring, awards, promotions, membership on important committees, and allocation of important resources such as laboratory space and research funding. 
   Eastman Kodak Company provides another significant example. After an internal study of its compensation practices, Kodak voluntarily agreed to pay $13 million in back pay to 2,000 female and minority employees who had been underpaid because of their race or gender. Kodak continues to work to improve the number of women and minorities in mid-level and senior-level management positions. 
   The plight of these women who work hard and are denied fair compensation is unacceptable. The disparities are particularly alarming because they persist almost 40 years after the Equal Pay Act was enacted, and at a time when our nation is experiencing unprecedented prosperity, when women are entering the workforce in record numbers, and when women are spending less time at home with their children, and more time at work. 
   Businesses and other private institutions across the country also have a responsibility to do more to correct this injustice. I commend M.I.T. for the impressive example it has set by acknowledging that women professors suffer from pervasive pay discrimination and by making a clear commitment to correct it. And I commend Eastman Kodak for its efforts to address the wage gap in response to NAACP concerns, by launching an investigation and providing raises for 12 percent of its female and 33 percent of its black employees. More businesses and organizations need to follow these leads. 
   Congress must do more to solve this unconscionable problem. Our goal is not just to reduce the pay gap, but to eliminate it entirely. Senator DASCHLE's Paycheck Fairness Act is a needed step to correct this injustice in pay. It will provide more effective remedies for women denied equal pay for equal work. And Senator HARKIN's Fair Pay Act will prohibit wage discrimination based on sex, race, or national origin for employees in equivalent jobs in the same workplace. Congress should pass both the Paycheck Fairness Act and The Fair Pay Act. These bills are necessary steps to eliminate the disparity between the earning power of men and women. It's the right thing to do--and the fair thing to do--for working families. 
   At a time when our economy is more prosperous than ever, when unemployment is at a 30 year low, and when women are entering the labor force at an all time high, there is no excuse for discrimination that cheats women out of their fair pay.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican marriage tax plan provides a quarter of a trillion dollars in tax breaks over the next ten years. Only 15 cents of every dollar in tax breaks goes to families with incomes of less than $50,000 a year. Sixty-eight cents of every dollar goes to families with incomes of more than $75,000 a year and 40 cents goes to individuals with more than $100,000 in income. Someone with $200,000 in income gets a $1,300 tax break, while a family struggling to make ends meet on $30,000 a year gets a meager $172--about fifty cents a day. Many of the tax breaks in the bill have nothing to do with the so-called marriage penalty. 
   I'd like to point out that right now we have a marriage and work penalty in Medicaid. Up to 14 states--which account for more than 22 percent of the  population--penalize two-parent low-income families by having stricter eligibility standards for Medicaid or even prohibiting enrollment. For example, in Maine, married parents earning a total of $14,000 annually can't qualify for Medicaid, but a single parent earning the same amount can. 
   The work penalty is equally appalling. In 37 states, a single parent with two children can qualify for Medicaid only if she earns 80 percent of the poverty level or less. Only 13 states offer Medicaid coverage to a single parent who works full-time in a minimum wage job and has two children. That's wrong, and this amendment would fix it. 
   It would also provide financial incentives and new options for states to expand CHIP and Medicaid to parents and older youths, and it would improve enrollment in CHIP and Medicaid. These are two important steps that we should be able to take this year. 
   An overwhelming majority of the uninsured are working men or women, or family members of workers. In fact, the vast majority are members of families with at least one person working full-time. 
   Most uninsured workers are not uninsured by choice. They are uninsured because their employer either does not offer coverage, or because they are not eligible for the coverage if it is offered. Seventy percent of uninsured workers are in firms where no coverage is offered. Eighteen percent are in firms that offer coverage, but they are not eligible for it, usually because they are part-time workers or have not worked in the firm long enough to qualify for coverage. Only 12 percent of uninsured workers are offered coverage and actually decline, and some of them do so because they have other coverage available. 
   Most of the uninsured have low or moderate incomes. 
   Thirty-seven percent are at or below the federal poverty level. Twenty-eight percent have incomes between 100 and 200 percent of poverty. Fifteen percent have incomes between 200 and 300 percent of poverty. 
   While good coverage for all Americans may not be feasible at this time, we can and must do more to close the current health insurance gap. 
   It is a national scandal that lack of insurance coverage is the seventh leading--and most preventable--cause of death in America today. 
   Numerous studies indicate that lack of insurance leads to second-class health care or no health care at all. A recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that angina patients with insurance are more than twice as likely as uninsured patients to receive needed bypass surgery. Across the nation, more than 32,000 patients are going without needed heart surgery because of their lack of insurance. 
   The numbers are equally dramatic when it comes to cancer. Early detection and treatment of cancer often makes the difference between life and death. Uninsured patients are two and a half times more likely not to receive an early diagnosis of melanoma and one and a half times more likely not to benefit from early detection of breast cancer, prostate cancer, or colon cancer. Tragically, the new and promising treatments resulting from our national investment in the NIH are out of reach for millions of uninsured Americans. 
   In 1997, we took a major step toward guaranteeing health insurance to millions of children in low-income working families whose earnings are above the cut-off for Medicaid. Every state is now participating in the children's health insurance plan, and most states have plans to increase coverage under these programs again this year. 
   As of January, two million children had been enrolled in the program, and many other children had signed up for Medicaid as a result of the outreach efforts. Soon, more than three-quarters of all uninsured children in the nation will be eligible for assistance through either CHIP or Medicaid. 
   An article in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that 57 percent of uninsured children had an unmet major medical need before enactment of CHIP. But just one year after receiving coverage, only 16 percent of these same children had an unmet medical need. 
   The lesson is clear. Access to insurance improves access to 
   health care, which improves health. We have the resources. We have good programs. We must do all we can to increase their effectiveness. Clearly, the states and the federal government have more to do. 
   The overwhelming majority of uninsured low-wage parents are struggling to support their families. Too often, there is too little left to pay for health care. Parents who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, should be eligible for assistance to buy the health insurance they need to protect their families. Our message to them today is that help with health care is on the way. 
   As I mentioned earlier, under current law, Medicaid is generally available only to single-parent families. Our proposal also repeals this ``health marriage tax.'' It is a serious penalty for low-wage two-parent families, and one which is comparable to the ``marriage penalty'' in the tax code. 
   This proposal also rewards work. Currently, most parents in families with an employed person are not eligible for Medicaid, while families headed by non-workers are eligible if their income is low enough. That's not right. Eligibility should be tied to need, not to employment status. It's a historical artifact of the system and it ought to be changed. 
   Coverage for parents also means that coverage for their children is more likely too. Parents are much more likely to enroll their children in health insurance programs, if the parents themselves can obtain coverage. 
   These steps will provide up to six and a half million more Americans with the health insurance coverage they need and deserve. If we are sincere in this debate about helping working families, our goal should be to enact this coverage before the end of this year. I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I will take a few minutes more of the Senate's time to review where we are as an institution and where we are effectively as a country on the people's business. 
   We have just passed an estate tax bill that is going to cost the Treasury $750 billion over the next 20 years. Half of the benefit of that, some $300 billion, will benefit some 1,400 families. Four hundred families will benefit by $250 billion. So this is a proposal that is basically benefiting the wealthiest individuals in the country. 
   With the marriage penalty tax that is before us, it is $250 billion over a 10-year period, and 40 percent of the people who benefit from it have incomes over $100,000--$100 billion of that $250 billion is going to go to people with incomes in excess of $100,000. 
   As the result, at the end of this week and at the end of consideration of the legislation before us, we will have expended $1 trillion. Going into Monday night, when we are going to complete the issue on the marriage penalty, we will have spent $1 trillion. We have to ask, who has benefited and who has not. 
   Quite clearly, as this chart points out, the people who have benefited are the wealthiest individuals in our country. We see the average value of estate exempted under the Republican plan is $2.3 million. The median income of a Medicare beneficiary is $13,800. 
   We find out, if we look at another indicator about who is going to benefit, that the Federal expenditure per person under the Republican estate tax repeal is $268,000 versus $900 for the Medicare prescription drug coverage we are trying to pass here. 
   We think it is about time that we started looking out after the senior citizens, 40 million of them, who need a prescription drug program. We know they have enormous needs. That is why we are in such strong support of the proposal being advanced by Senator ROBB, Senator GRAHAM, the leader, and other measures. 
   At the end of this week and the beginning of next week, with the expenditure of about $1 trillion from the Treasury, we are not buying one new book for a child in America. We are not buying one new Band-Aid or one prescription drug for a senior citizen who is in need. 
   We are not making our schools any safer by an effective program that might limit guns in our schools in this country. We have not done a single thing to stop an accountant in an HMO from denying care that may put a patient at further risk in our society. We have not done anything about prescription drugs. We have not done anything  to provide a real Patients' Bill of Rights. That is at the end of this week, where we have spent $1 trillion. 
   When I go back to Massachusetts in a short while, people are going to be asking: What have you done? You spent $1 trillion. Have you done anything for our schoolchildren? Have you done anything for our parents? Have you done anything about prescription drugs? Have you done anything to make our health care system safer? Have you done anything to make our schools safer? Have you done anything to increase access to health care? The answer to all of those is no, we have not. 
   That is very clearly not a matter of accident. That is a matter of choice. It is a matter of priority. 
   It is a result of the Republican leadership having set out an agenda, and it is an agenda to which I take strong exception. I cannot believe that it is the agenda of working families in this country. It cannot reflect their priorities. 
   Working families are concerned most about their children. They are concerned about their parents. They are concerned about their jobs and safety and security. They are concerned about living in safe and secure neighborhoods with clean air and clean water. 
   We have not touched a single item that will impact and affect average families in America. As an institution, we have failed to meet their priorities. 
   We are going to continue to fight these battles, next week and beyond, all the way through, as long as we are in session. We will fight it continuously right up to the time of the election. 
   I want to be clear. I support legislation that would provide tax relief to the working families who are currently paying a marriage penalty. Such a penalty is unfair and should be eliminated. However, I do not support the proposal which the Republicans have brought to the floor. 
   While its sponsors claim the purpose of the bill is to provide marriage penalty relief, that is not its real purpose. In fact, only 42 percent of the tax benefits contained in the legislation go to couples currently subject to a marriage penalty. The majority of the tax benefits would actually go to couples who are already receiving a marriage bonus, and to single taxpayers. As a result, the cost of the legislation is highly inflated. It would cost $248 billion over the next ten years. 
   And, as with most Republican tax breaks, the overwhelming majority of the tax benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers. This bill is designed to give more than 78 percent of the total tax savings to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. 
   It is, in reality, the latest ploy in the Republican scheme to spend the entire surplus on tax cuts which would disproportionately benefit the richest taxpayers. That is not what the American people mean when they ask for relief from the marriage penalty. With this bill, the Republicans have deliberately distorted the legitimate concern of married couples for tax fairness. 
   All married couples do not pay a marriage penalty. In fact, a larger percentage of couples receive a marriage bonus than pay a marriage penalty. The only couples who pay a penalty are those families in which both spouses work and have relatively equivalent incomes. They deserve relief from this inequity and they deserve it now. We can provide relief to the overwhelming majority of the couples simply and at a modest cost. That is what the Senate should do. Instead, the Republicans have insisted on greatly inflating the cost of the bill by adding extraneous tax breaks primarily benefitting the wealthiest taxpayers. 
   A plan that would eliminate the marriage penalty for married couples could easily be designed at a much lower cost. The House Democrats offered such a plan when they debated this issue in February. The Senate Democrats are offering such an alternative plan today. If the real purpose of the legislation is to eliminate the marriage penalty for those working families who actually pay a penalty under current law, it can be accomplished at a reasonable cost. 
   The key to drafting an affordable plan to eliminate the marriage penalty is to focus the tax relief on those couples who actually pay the penalty under current law. The Republican proposal fails to do this, and, as a result, it actually perpetuates the marriage penalty despite the expenditure of $248 billion on new tax cuts. Under the Democratic plan, the tax relief actually goes to those currently paying a marriage penalty. It is also essential to target the tax benefits to the middle income working families who need tax relief the most. The Democratic plan focuses the tax benefits on those two earner families with incomes less than $150,000. By contrast, major portions of the tax benefits in the Republican plan would go to much wealthier taxpayers at the expense of those families with more modest incomes. As a result, the Democratic proposal would cost $11 billion a year less, when fully implemented, than the Republican plan, yet provide more marriage penalty tax relief to middle income families. 
   The problem we have consistently faced is that our Republican 
   colleagues insist on using marriage penalty relief as a subterfuge to enact large tax breaks unrelated to relieving the marriage penalty and heavily weighted to the wealthiest taxpayers. The House Republicans put forward a bill which would cost $182 billion over 10 years and give less than half the tax benefits to people who pay a marriage penalty. Even that was not enough for the Senate Republicans. They raised the cost to $248 billion over 10 years with nearly all the additional amount going to the wealthiest taxpayers. A substantial majority, 58 percent of the tax breaks in the Senate bill would go to taxpayers who do not pay a marriage penalty. 
   Nor is this the only excessive and unfair tax cut bill the Republicans have brought to the floor this year. They attached tax cuts to the minimum wage bill in the House, tax cuts to the bankruptcy bill in the Senate. They have sought to pass tax cuts to subsidize private school tuition and to eliminate the inheritance tax paid by multimillionaires. 
   Just this morning, the Republican leadership forced through the Senate a complete repeal of the inheritance tax, which will cost over $50 billion per year when fully implemented. More than 90 percent of the tax benefits of that bill will go to the richest one percent of taxpayers. 
   In total, the Republicans in the House and Senate have already passed tax cuts that would consume over $700 billion during the next ten years. 
   The result of this tax cut frenzy is to crowd out necessary spending on the priorities that the American people care most about--education, prescription drugs for seniors, health care for uninsured families, strengthening Medicare and Social Security for future generations. It's misguided and short-sighted, and I strongly object to it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the need for action by Congress on prescription drug coverage for senior citizens is as clear as it is urgent. Medicare is a specific contract between the people and their government. It says, ``Work hard, pay into the trust fund during your working years, and you will have health security in your retirement years.'' But that promise is being broken today and every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. 
   This amendment is about priorities. The Republican marriage penalty relief proposal is little more than a fig leaf for a package of other tax breaks for the wealthy. I am all for marriage penalty relief. I am all for providing targeted tax relief to working families. But that's not what's at stake here. 
   This amendment simply says that marriage penalty relief shall not take effect until legislation has been enacted that provides a voluntary, affordable outpatient Medicare prescription drug benefit to all Medicare beneficiaries which that guarantees meaningful, stable coverage, including stop-loss and low-income protections. 
   Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. Too many senior citizens take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions at all--because they can't afford the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while almost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from negotiated discounts. Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to Medicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need to treat their illness. Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for a host of dread diseases, but senior citizens are being left out and left behind because Congress fails to act. 
   The crisis that senior citizens face today will only worsen if we refuse to act, because insurance coverage continues to go down, and drug costs continue to go up. 
   Twelve million senior citizens--one third of the total--have no prescription drug coverage at all. Surveys indicate that only half of all senior citizens--20 million--have any prescription drug coverage throughout the year. Insurance through employer retirement plans is plummeting. Medicare HMOs are drastically cutting back. Medigap plans are priced out of reach of most elderly Americans. The only senior citizens who have stable, reliable, affordable drug coverage are the very poor on Medicaid. 
   Prescription drug costs are out of control. Since 1996, costs have grown at double-digit rates every year. Last year, the increase was an unacceptable 16 percent, at a time when the increase 
   in the CPI was only 2.7 percent. Access to affordable prescription drugs has become a crisis for many elderly Americans 
   In the face of this declining coverage and soaring cost, more and more senior citizens are being hurt. The vast majority of the elderly are of moderate means. They cannot possibly afford to purchase the prescription drugs they need if serious illness strikes. Fifty-seven percent of senior citizens have incomes below $15,000 a year, and 78 percent have incomes below $25,000. Only 7 percent have annual incomes in excess of $50,000. The older they are, the more likely they are to be in poor health and the more likely they are to have very limited income to meet their health needs. 
   Their current situation on prescription drugs is intolerable. Senior citizens and their families are asking for help and they deserve it. The Senate has an obligation to respond. 
   Few if any issues facing this Congress are more important than giving the nation's senior citizens the health security they have been promised. The promise of Medicare will not be fulfilled until Medicare protects senior  citizens against the high cost of prescription drugs, in the same way that it protects them against the high cost of hospital and doctor care. 
   President Clinton called for prescription drug coverage under Medicare in his 1999 State of the Union Message more than 18 months ago but the Senate still has failed to act. The legislation passed by the Republican majority in the House can't pass the truth in advertising test. 
   It is not a true Medicare benefit--and it won't give senior citizens the stable, affordable, adequate prescription drug benefit they deserve. 
   The Senate Finance Committee is discussing a new prescription drug proposal but it requires senior citizens to give up their current benefits and accept greater out-of-pocket costs that they cannot afford as the price for gaining prescription drug coverage. 
   The amendment we are proposing is a clear statement of priorities. It says that prescription drug coverage for the Nation's senior citizens is as important as new tax breaks. 
   Let's get our priorities straight. Let's meet this pressing need. Let's give senior citizens a real prescription drug benefit under Medicare. Let's put the Senate on record in support of mending Medicare's broken promise, and telling America's senior citizens that they are as important as working families and others who would benefit from this tax bill.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. President, with all due respect to the Senator from Oklahoma, I think the two Senators from North Dakota spelled out very clearly and convincingly the differences between the position taken by the Republican majority, and the alternative proposed by Democrats. The Democratic proposal basically and fairly addresses legitimate concerns in the estate tax by essentially removing the estate tax from small farms and businesses. That presentation has been made effectively by the Democrats. I don't think anything that has been said in the recent moments undermines the credibility of the Democratic position. I think the Democratic alternative proposal reflects the views of the overwhelming majority of the Democrats on this issue. 
   I am somewhat amazed as we come into the final days of this period of the Congress that we are talking about how we are going to reduce the taxes for the wealthiest 2,400 Americans. These people pay half of all current estate taxes. In the outer years, the second decade after a repeal, the 400 wealthiest families in this country would save $250 billion in taxes under the Republican plan. That explains why some of our colleagues on the other side insist that we spend the Senate's limited time addressing only the concerns of the wealthy. 
   The fact is, we have 10 million Americans today who would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. We know the minimum wage has fallen substantially behind in its purchasing power. Why isn't the Senate of the United States debating what we will do for the 10 million hard-working Americans, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, in some of the most challenging jobs in our society? What is it about the priorities of the Republicans trying to protect the interests of the very wealthiest individuals in our society, rather than trying to deal with the hard-working Americans who are at lower levels of the economic ladder--in this case, hard-working Americans making minimum wage? Many of these workers are women, including women who have children; and a significant number are men and women of color. This is a family issue. It is a children's issue. It is basically a fairness issue. 
   No, the Republicans with this issue want to reduce taxes on the wealthiest individuals, $250 billion additional for the 400 wealthiest families in this country. Should that surprise Members? No. I look back to the debate from the mid-1990s. Perhaps some Members remember the famous tax  loophole called the Benedict Arnold tax loophole that permits Americans to accumulate billions and billions of dollars in this great land. And then what does a citizen do? He basically renounces his citizenship and takes those billions of dollars out of the country, tax free. It is the Benedict Arnold tax loophole. 
   I went over the various votes we had to end this deplorable practice. We voted at least seven times on that. Every time we had a sense-of-the-Senate resolution that was non-binding, our Republican friends voted with us to eliminate this Billionaire tax loophole, but when had substantive votes to actually do something about it, they voted against us. 
   Just about a month ago, in May the Wall Street Journal reported that the loopholes enabling the super-rich to renounce their citizenship and avoid tax remain. The loopholes in the expatriate tax law are so big that you could fly a jumbo jet through them. The basic Benedict Arnold loophole remains alive and well--costing the Treasury billions and billions of dollars. 
   President Clinton has joined Democrats in repeatedly proposing to end all of the loopholes. His February 2000 budget includes repeal. But we see no action from the Republicans. We only see them wanting to add more escape hatches for the super-rich. 
   Why is it that the Republicans are so prepared to protect the financial interests of the wealthiest individuals? We ought to be taking these resources and investing them in our schools. We need significant investments in education so that our children can attend modern schools, schools that are worthwhile for their attendance, schools with small class sizes, and schools with trained teachers. Many Republicans talk about these needs, but when it comes to action, they want to focus on adding to the riches of the rich. The nation deserves much better than this estate tax repeal plan. 
   We ought to be debating here this afternoon the interest in a prescription drug program that will look after 40 million Americans, instead of 2,400. 
   It is very clear what the priorities are. The other side, the Republicans, are looking after the financial interests of the wealthiest individuals in this country, and many of us believe that we, at this time, ought to be debating what we are going to do to protect the hard-working Americans who are making the minimum wage, those senior citizens who need a prescription drug coverage, or the children of this country who need new, modern schools. That is what the issue ought to be.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending my friend from Utah on this proposal. We are moving into the life science century with absolutely extraordinary breakthroughs in so many areas. 
   We want to see a continuation of the R&D from the private sector, with an element of the public sector, as well. I think this Congress has wisely doubled the NIH budget, for example, and also seen an expanded research in other areas of the agencies that we have witnessed in recent times. That has not always been the case in recent times where we have a combination of the opportunity for creativity and expansion in terms of our economy in many fields, particularly the areas of health, are virtually unlimited. 
   This will make an enormous difference. I congratulate the Senator from Utah. Seeing my friend and colleague, the ranking minority member, I am mindful of the fact during the height of the Japanese recession, when they were hard pressed in terms of their economic future, what did the Japanese Government do? They tripled the R&D budget. We have seen similar examples in Europe. As a result of these incentives in trying to bring more research and development, we have seen the restoration of important economies of the world. 
   We have a strong economy and we want to keep it this way. Having this permanent will be a very important contribution in ensuring that. I congratulate the Senator. I ask unanimous consent to be a cosponsor of the amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment to permanently extend the R&D tax credit. I presented a similar amendment last year, and I commend Senator HATCH's leadership on this important issue. 
   Many have called this the century of life sciences. We are witnessing extraordinary breakthroughs which are both transforming our quality of life and fueling our economy. The R&D tax credit is a proven effective means to generate increased research and development in the life sciences, and it is a key ingredient in the continued success and growth of the nation's economy. 
   Much of America's technological leadership today and in the past has been stimulated by federal support for private investment in R&D. The Congress has wisely decided to double the NIH budget. We need to continue to strengthen these investments as a top national priority. 
   A main virtue of the credit is that it encourages investments in the kind of research that ensures long-term competitiveness. Often, private sector research focuses on closer horizons, and the credit is important in encouraging a longer-term focus as well. 
   Research and development now generate about 5,000 new jobs a year, and significant amounts in taxes for the federal treasury. Federal Reserve Chairman Greenspan has cited increased productivity as the source of our current record breaking economy. It accounts for 70% of our economic growth. 
   This record-breaking economy provides an unprecedented opportunity for increased creativity and expansion. Particularly in the health field, our ability to increase our R&D investment will make an enormous difference in our fight against disease and in our efforts to improve the quality of life for so many. 
   Making the R&D tax credit permanent is essential for encouraging continued investment by private industry. Without a permanent credit, industry lacks the certainty needed to make decisions about continuing investments. 
   A permanent R&D credit will do more to encourage investment in the long-term research projects needed to keep our companies--and our nation--at the cutting edge of competition in the world economy. In the last session of Congress we were able to extend the credit temporarily again. I am hopeful that this year, with bipartisan support, we can make the credit permanent. 
   The credit has been extended 10 times since 1981. But this on-again off-again pattern makes the credit less reliable, and diminishes the important incentives that the credit can provide. 
   I am mindful that at the height of the Japanese recession, Japan has managed to triple its R&D budget. European countries are increasing their budgets as well. 
   Congress should do all it can to give R&D the top priority it deserves. Stable and substantial federal funding is essential for fundamental scientific research. We must also support private investment in fundamental research across a wide spectrum of disciplines.  In failing to do so, we run the risk of slowing the nation's economic engines. 
   I am proud of the leadership of Massachusetts on these issues. According to a study by the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, the state received $3.45 billion in federal research and development funds in 1997, amounting to 37% of total research and development spending in the state and received the sixth-largest share of federal R&D funding in the nation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Earlier today, we had an excellent presentation made by the two Senators from North Dakota about the Democratic alternative. In those presentations, they pointed out that the arguments made on the other side about  the importance of changing the estate tax so it addressed the needs of family farms and small businesses would be addressed in the Democratic alternative. 
   The basic Republican position is to hold those small family farmers hostage until they get what is the ``big apple,'' which will provide some $700 billion to the wealthiest individuals in this country; 2,400 taxpayers will get $300 billion in tax relief. The Forbes 400 families will get, effectively, $250 billion. 
   As the Senator from New Mexico has pointed out, this is an issue of our priorities. What his amendment says is that we can address the particular needs of the family farms and small businesses, and rather than use all the other kinds of revenues, out of the difference between the $64 billion and the $104 billion of the Republicans, we can take $11 billion of that this year and use those scarce funds in order to try to meet the educational needs of the children of this country. That is what this is about. 
   As was pointed out by the Senator from New Mexico, this is really a choice about priorities. Are we interested in providing tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals in our society, or are we interested in investing in the children of our country? We will have an opportunity to address that in just a few moments. 
   What we have seen in the past decade is an explosion in the number of children who are attending grades K through 12--going from 46.4 million in 1990 all the way up to 53.4 million in the year 2000. At the same time, we have seen a rather dramatic reduction in Federal support for elementary and secondary education from the 1980s; in 1980, 11.9 percent out of every dollar spent came from the Federal Government, and this was down to 7.7 percent in fiscal year 1999. We have also seen this lowering in higher education. We addressed this issue in the Schumer amendment earlier--unsuccessfully. But we had a debate on it. This 
   measure addresses this differential in elementary and secondary education. 
   It is fair enough to ask whether the substance of this amendment will make very much of a difference to the children in this country. Once again, we have the most recent reports and the most recent studies that have been done by the Congressional Research Service that point out, as of the very end of June of this year, their evaluation of what has happened with smaller class sizes in California. 
   California's class size reduction shows that reducing class size improves student achievement. A study of the first 3 years of class size reduction in California shows that smaller classes have boosted student achievement in communities across the State for the second year in a row. It says the evaluation shows that though students in the most disadvantaged schools were more likely to be in larger classes and have less qualified teachers, students in smaller classes still outperform their peers in larger classes, even with less-qualified teachers. These students could be performing even better if all the children in those schools have fully qualified teachers and smaller class sizes. 
   That is exactly what this amendment does. I don't know how often we have to bring in the latest evidence. Here is the latest evidence, which shows students will perform better with smaller class sizes and better trained teachers. This amendment also provides afterschool programs with tutorial, tough accountability standards, dropout prevention programs, a billion dollars for special needs in IDEA, and a modest program to try to address the $112 billion necessary for school construction--you make a difference when you invest in the children of this country. We are here to say that we believe one of the priorities of American families ought to be in using this money to invest in the children and not to provide a windfall tax break for 2,400 of the wealthiest individuals in this country. That is what this vote is about. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 2 1/2 minutes. 
   As the Joint Tax Committee pointed out, as printed in the New York Times today, according to the data, 95 percent of the roughly 6,000 farmers who paid estate taxes that year would have been exempted under the terms of the Democratic plan, as would 88 percent of the roughly 10,000 small business owners who paid the tax. That responds to my good friends from Texas and Arkansas. 
   I understand they want to protect any tax loophole that is in there. We have a billionaire tax loophole that has permitted billionaires to leave the country, renounce their citizenship, and pay no tax at all. They have defended that in the past. The fact is, the wealthiest individuals are still going to get $150 billion in tax breaks. 
   All we are saying is that it is more valuable to invest in the education of the children of this country than to give the 400 richest families in this country $250 billion. That is what this amendment does. The 400 richest families, according to Forbes magazine, get $250 billion; 2,400 families get $300 billion. We are saying, $150 billion for them. 
   We need to get to what is essential to our national interest, and that is children. It is a matter of priorities. They want to protect the billionaires' tax loophole; they want to protect the 400 wealthiest families in this country. We want to be debating the minimum wage this afternoon. We want to debate education and education funding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator KERRY's proposal to create a housing trust fund. In this period of strong economic growth and record expansion, the lack of affordable housing is an increasingly serious problem for millions of families  across the country, especially low income families struggling to lift themselves out of poverty. Our national prosperity means less if firefighers, teachers, police officers, nurses, and many other hard-working Americans cannot afford to live in the communities where they work. 
   As long ago as 1949, the nation pledged safe, clean, decent housing for all Americans. As we begin a new century, this promise is still unfulfilled. Even worse we are not making even modest progress to achieve this goal. 
   The rising cost of housing is one of the most difficult challenges for many families. It is particularly serious for the elderly, many of whom also face the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs as well. 
   In a period of economic prosperity such as the one we now enjoy, it is wrong that we have one of the lowest housing production levels in history. Affordable housing must be a higher priority for the Congress. 
   Over the past five years, more than $20 billion has either been rescinded or diverted by Congress from federal housing programs for other uses, while the number of Americans who cannot afford a decent place to live continues to rise. 
   The problem is particularly acute in Massachusetts. The average time on waiting lists for public housing and housing vouchers is over 3 years, and more than 13,000 families are on those waiting lists. 
   In the Greater Boston area, affordable housing is not only a problem for many families, it is becoming a problem for businesses. Many of the most successful companies report difficulties in their efforts to attract and retain employees because of the high cost of housing. Without an ability to retain a strong workforce, unaffordable housing threatens to undermine prosperity at every level, federal, state, and local. 
   The costs of new construction and rehabilitation of existing housing are very high. The price of owning a home is increasing faster in Massachusetts than in any other state in the country. 
   I support the Clinton's Administration's budget request of $32.5 billion for the Department of Housing and Urban Development for FY 2001, a 25 percent increase over FY 2000. By contrast, the budget adopted by the Republican Congress in April proposed a $400 million reduction in the HUD budget. 
   The Trust Fund proposed by this amendment is an important start to ending this period of disinvestment. 
   Senator KERRY's amendment will provide funds for new units and for the renovation of existing units, along with increases in ownership. It channels money through local and state governments, primarily to already established programs with a track record of success. The majority of Trust Fund assistance will be used for the neediest families, including the working poor. 
   As we debate the misguided priority of massive tax relief for the wealthiest 2 percent of estates, I urge my colleagues instead to consider the needs of millions of families who are working hard, but who find it increasingly difficult to afford housing for their families. 
   I urge the Senate to support this amendment. Housing must be a higher priority for Congress. The time to act is now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. 
   July 13, 1999: Debbie Ahl, 39, Nashville, TN; Desiree Battle, Detroit, MI; Antonio Darias, 49, Miami-Dade County, FL; Leonardo Duran, 18, Houston, TX; Doug Harris, 31, Cincinnati, OH; Stefanie Harris, 29, Cincinnati, OH; Romero Jones, 19, St. Louis, MO; Sigmund Linberger, 34, Akron, OH; Michael McKinnon, 18, Nashville, TN; Rodolfo Recendez, 32, Fort Worth, TX; Dylan Sertich, 22, Toledo, OH; Unidentified male, 16, Long Beach, CA; Unidentified male, 35, Nashville, TN. 
   One of the victims of gun violence I mentioned, 19-year-old Romero Jones from Missouri, grew up in tough circumstances and turned his life around after a troublesome childhood. Romero worked with his city's ``Cease Fire Program'' to reach out to young people to encourage them to give up their involvement with gangs and pursue job training and careers. Romero sat on the stage with President Clinton during the President's 1995 visit to St. Louis to discuss the city's successes in addressing crime. 
   Romero was shot and killed in what police say was a case of mistaken identity--no drugs or money were found in Romero's home following his tragic death. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The time has come to enact sensible gun legislation. Our country cannot afford to lose more of its promising young leaders like Romero Jones. His death is a reminder to all of us that we need to act now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our bipartisan goal in introducing The Early Learning Opportunities Act is to provide greater support for parents across the country in preparing their children for a lifetime of learning, beginning at the earliest age. 
   I commend Senators STEVENS, JEFFORDS, DODD, DOMENICI, and KERRY for their support and leadership in developing this legislation and in seeing to it that children's voices are heard and their needs are a priority in this Congress. Senator KERRY and I have worked together to improve early learning opportunities in Massachusetts, and this national initiative is based in part on successful models in our state. Senator DODD has been an outstanding leader on children's issues for many years. Senator JEFFORDS, the chairman of our Senate committee, has shown great skill and determination in shaping this legislation, and in keeping our committee focused on the important issue of early learning. Senator DOMENICI has been an essential ally throughout the development of this bill, as has the senior Senator from Alaska. Senator STEVENS and I introduced the Early Learning Trust Fund Act as a predecessor to this legislation, and he was a leader in obtaining approval of $8.5 billion for early learning in this year's Senate budget resolution. 
   Clearly, the need for this legislation is urgent. Today's families are legitimately worried about the quality of care provided to their infants and toddlers while the parents are at work. Of mothers with children aged zero to five, a record 64 percent worked outside the home in 1999. The average cost of care for each of these children is four  to ten thousand dollars a year. This is their highest expense besides food and shelter, consuming a quarter to half of their wages. Too often, even this level of sacrifice isn't enough. Many families simply cannot find quality care for their children. Facilities are dangerous, crowded, or closed at the non-traditional times that many mothers work. Low wages attract the least skilled care givers, over a third of whom quit each year. Enforcement of quality standards is rare. Elementary and Secondary education fully deserve to be a priority for the nation, but so does early learning--and it is needed at a time when many young families are least able to bear the full cost. 
   In Massachusetts, the Community Partnerships for Children Program currently provides quality full-day early learning for 15,300 young children from low-income families. Yet today, over 14,000 additional eligible children in the state are waiting for the early learning services they need--and some have been on the waiting list for 18 months. A 1999 report by the Congressional General Accounting Office on early learning services for low-income families was unequivocal--``infant toddler care [is] still difficult to obtain.'' 
   Even as the need to provide early learning opportunities increases, it is clear that many current facilities are unsafe. The average early learning provider is paid under seven dollars an hour--less than the average parking lot attendant or pet sitter. These low wages result in high turnover, poor quality of care, and little trust and bonding with the children. 
   The Nation's military faced these same problems in the 1980's, and because of the threat 
   that the poor quality of care posed to children, to morale, and to retention of personnel, the armed forces worked long and well to create a model program. The Defense Department now provides quality care to 200,000 children. Many European nations have followed the same path as the U.S. military, building a broad array of quality early learning models that prepare children to reach their full potential. 
   Head Start is one example of the kind of quality program that has already proved effective throughout the United States. A recent survey found that more parents are satisfied with Head Start than any other federal program. But only two in five eligible 3- and 4-year-olds are enrolled in Head Start--and only one in 100 eligible infants and toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start. As a result, literally millions of young children never have the chance to reach their full potential. We must do better, and we can do better. 
   It is time to act to make early learning a top education priority for the nation, just as governors urged us to do a full decade ago. All preschool children should have access to the kind of care and brain stimulation necessary to enable them to enter school ready to learn. We cannot rest until all children have the opportunity to develop to their full potential. 
   Academic studies have confirmed what parents have long understood--education occurs over a continuum that begins at birth and extends throughout life. Study after study proves that positive brain stimulation very early in life significantly improves a child's later ability to learn, to interact successfully with teachers and peers, and to develop crucial skills like curiosity, trust, and perseverance. Two years ago, the Rand Corporation reported that ``after critically reviewing the literature and discounting claims that are not rigorously demonstrated, we conclude that these [early learning] programs can provide significant benefits.'' Governors, state legislatures, local governments, and educators have all supported these studies and called for increased investments in early learning as the most effective way to promote healthy and constructive behavior. 
   The goal of this legislation is to enable all children to enter school ready to learn, and to maximize the impact of federal, state, and local investments in education. We must do more to ensure that children have access to the experiences they need during the five or six years before they walk through their first schoolhouse door. Education begins at birth. It is not a process that occurs only in a school building during a school day. When our policies respond to this reality, we will reduce delinquency, improve productivity, and become a stronger and better nation. Early learning programs are good for children, good for parents and good for society as a whole. 
   The Committee for Economic Development reports that the nation can save over five dollars in the future for every dollar invested in early learning today. The investment significantly reduces the number of families on welfare, the number of children in special education, and the number of children in the juvenile justice system. Investment in early learning is not only morally right--it is economically right. 
   Two months ago, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a bipartisan coalition including hundreds of police chiefs, sheriffs, and crime victims, released another convincing report. It finds that children who receive quality early learning are half as likely to commit crimes and be arrested later in life. Our greatest opportunity to reach at-risk children is in their youngest years. 
   It is especially important for low-income parents who accept the responsibility of work under welfare reform to have access to quality early learning opportunities for their children. The central idea of welfare reform is that families caught in a cycle of dependence can be shown that work pays. But children's development must not be sacrificed as families move from welfare to work. 
   We must expand access to Head Start and Early Head Start. We must make parenting assistance available to all who want it. We must support model state efforts that have already proved successful, such as Community Partnerships for Children in Massachusetts and Smart Start in North Carolina, which rely on local councils to identify early learning needs in each community and allocate new resources to meet them. We must give higher priority to early childhood literacy. In ways such as these, we can take bolder action to strengthen early learning opportunities in communities across the nation. 
   The legislation that we introduce today will move us closer to all of these goals. It includes $3.25 billion over the next three years to enable local communities to fill the gaps that limit current early learning efforts. Local councils will direct the funds to the most urgent needs in each community. These needs include parenting support and education--improving child care quality through professional development and retention initiatives--expanding the times and the days that parents can obtain these services--enhancing childhood literacy--and greater early learning opportunities for children with special needs. These priorities are designed to strengthen early learning programs in all communities across the country, and give each community the opportunity to invest the funds in ways that will meet its most urgent needs. 
   Much more needs to be done to improve early learning throughout America. But we know from our experience in improving the military's early learning program that with small steps, over time we can go a long way. I urge the Senate to approve this important bill, and I look forward to its enactment and to the significant differences it will make.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator FRIST and our other colleagues in introducing the Children's Public Health Act of 2000. This bipartisan legislation will help millions of children in the years ahead. It takes needed action to improve children's health by expanding pediatric research and calling for specific steps to deal with a wide range of childhood illness, disorders, and injuries. Coordinated action in these areas can lead to significant benefits for all children. 
   Senator FRIST and I have worked closely with many of our Democratic and Republican colleagues on this legislation. We have talked with experts and advocates in the children's health community. We believe this legislation will lead to significant progress in addressing some of today's most pressing pediatric public health problems. 
   The legislation includes a variety of new and reauthorized children's health provisions that are organized under four broad categories--injury prevention, maternal and infant health promotion, public health promotion, and research. 
   Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and disability in young Americans. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has estimated that 5.3 million Americans are living with long-term, severe disability as a result of brain injuries, and each year 50,000 people die as a result of such injuries. The Children's Public Health Act revises and extends the authorization for the important programs enacted in 1996 to deal with these injuries. This reauthorization will assure  continued progress toward our understanding, treating and preventing them. 
   Improving and protecting the safety of child care environments should also be a high priority for Congress. This legislation creates a new program to improve the safety of children in child care settings, and to encourage child care providers to take steps to prevent illness and injuries and protect the health of the children they serve. 
   In addition, this legislation includes programs to improve the health of pregnant women and prenatal outcomes, including prevention of birth defects and low birth weight. It establishes a new Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in order to focus the nation's activities more effectively in these important areas. The new center will be especially helpful for children and families affected by these conditions. 
   The bill also takes a number of steps to address other prevalent childhood conditions. Asthma is the most common chronic childhood illness, affecting more than seven percent of all American children. The death rate for children with asthma increased by 78 percent between 1980 and 1993, and asthma-related costs total nearly $2 billion annually in direct health care for children. The nation is handicapped by a lack of basic information on where and how asthma strikes, what triggers it, and how effectively our current health care system is responding to those who suffer from this chronic disease. Our bill will provide greater asthma services to children, including mobile clinics, and patent and family education, and it will help to reduce allergens in housing and public facilities. 
   Poor nutrition and lack of physical activity are also hurting many American children and contributing to lifelong health problems. The nation spends $39 billion a year--equal to six percent of overall U.S. health care expenditures--on direct health care related to obesity. Twenty percent of American children--one in five--are overweight. Unhealthy eating habits and physical inactivity in childhood can lead to heart disease, cancer and other serious illnesses decades later. Children and adolescents who suffer from eating disorders, such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia, can have wide-ranging physical and mental health impairments. Our legislation establishes new grant programs to reduce childhood obesity and earing disorders, promote better nutritional habits among children, and encourage an appropriate level of physical activity for children and adolescents. 
   Last May, the Surgeon General published a landmark report on oral health in America, emphasizing the need to consider oral health as an essential part of total health. There is no question that oral and dental health care should be included in our primary care. Tooth decay is the most common childhood infectious disease, and it can lead to devastating consequences, including problems with eating, learning and speech. Twenty-five percent of children in the United States suffer 80 percent of the tooth decay, with significant racial and age disparities. The number of dentists in the country has been declining since 1990, and is projected to continue to decline through the year 2020. 
   According to a 1995 report by the Inspector General, only one in five Medicaid-eligible children receive dental services annually, and the shortage of dentists exacerbates the problem of unmet needs. Yet tooth decay is largely preventable. More effective efforts to educate parents and children about the causes of tooth decay, and initiatives to prevent and treat it can lead to lasting public health improvements. Our legislation includes a variety of approaches to deal with this silent epidemic. 
   Research has long shown that childhood lead poisoning can have devastating effects on children, causing reduced IQ and attention span, stunted growth, behavior problems, and reading and learning disabilities. Yet too children remain unscreened and untreated, and adequate services often are not available for children with elevated levels of lead in their blood. There is no excuse for not taking greater steps to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. Our bill includes screening for early detection and treatment, professional education and training programs, and 
   outreach and education activities for at-risk children. 
   Pediatic research discoveries promote and maintain health throughout a child's life span, and also contribute significantly to new insights that aid in the prevention and treatment of illnesses and conditions among adults. A growing body of evidence shows that risk factors for conditions such as coronary artery disease and stroke begin in childhood and persist through adulthood. Congress has a strong history of promoting basis and clinical research, and the steps taken in this legislation continue that priority. 
   The legislation establishes a pediatric research initiative, authorized at $50 million annually, that will increase support for pediatric biomedical research at the National Institutes of Health, including an increase in collaborative efforts among multidisciplinary fields in areas that are promising for children. The legislation also requires coordination with the Food and Drug Administration to increase the number of pediatric clinical trails, and to provide greater information on safer and more effective use of prescription drugs in children. 
   Children have unique health care needs. They are not simply small adults. Nothing is more important to the future health of America's children than maintaining a steady supply of pediatricians, pediatric specialists and pediatric-focused scientists. 
   Our legislation takes two important steps to improve the growth and development of a pediatric-focused medical community. First, it enhances support by the National Institute for Child Health and Human Development expressly for training and career development activities of pediatric researchers, and it establishes a loan repayment program for pediatricians who conduct research. 
   Second, it extends the authorization of a new program that supports graduate medical education activities at independent children's hospitals. These hospitals train half of all pediatric specialists, and 30 percent of all pediatricians. However, because GME activities have historically been supported by Medicare and because these hospitals serve very few Medicare patients, they receive very little financial support for this important and costly activity. As a result, children's hospitals are struggling to maintain the important training, pediatric research, and primary and specialty care services that they provide. Children's hospitals should be treated like all other teaching hospitals when it comes to support for their GME activities. I have sponsored another legislative proposal to guarantee full funding each year, without being subject to the appropriations process. That proposal is awaiting consideration in the Finance Committee. Until it is enacted, we owe it to America's children to invest in their future health care by improving our support for pediatric GME activities. 
   The bill also authorizes a new study to monitor and evaluate development of children through adulthood. The kind of information that will be obtained by this study is long-overdue. Children are more vulnerable to physical, chemical, biological, and other risks than adults, and we must make a major commitment to learning more about the influences and effects of the environment. 
   Finally, this legislation also includes a program to address the unique needs of children with autism and related disorders. I look forward to working with Chairman FRIST, members of the Committee and others to assure that the needs of children with Fragile X are met in the final legislation. 
   This legislation deserves to be a major public health priority for the nation. Congress should send the President a strong bill on these issues before the end of this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Religious freedom is a bedrock principle in our nation. The bill we are introducing today reflects our commitment to protect religious freedom and our belief that Congress still has the power to enact legislation to enhance that freedom, even after the Supreme Court's decision in 1997 to strike down the broader Religious Freedom Restoration Act that 97 Senators joined in passing in 1993. 
   In striking down the Religious Freedom Restoration Act on constitutional grounds, the Court clearly made the task of passing effective legislation to protect religious liberties more difficult. But too often in our society today, thoughtless and insensitive actions by governments at every level interferes with individual religious freedoms, even though no valid public purpose is served by the governmental action. 
   Our goal in proposing this legislation is to reach a reasonable and constitutionally sound balance between respecting the compelling interests of government and protecting the ability of people freely to exercise their religion. We believe that the legislation being introduced today accomplishes this goal in two areas where infringement of this right has frequently occurred--the application of land use laws, and treatment of persons who are institutionalized. In both of these areas, our bill will protect the Constitutional right to worship, free from unnecessary government interference. 
   After numerous Congressional hearings on religious liberties, the evidence is clear that local land use laws often have the discriminatory effect of burdening the free exercise of religion. It is also clear that institutionalized persons are often unreasonably denied the opportunity to practice their religion, even when their observance would not undermine discipline, order, or safety in the facilities. 
   Relying upon the findings from Congressional hearings, we have developed a bill--based upon well-established constitutional authority--that will protect the free exercise of religion in these two important areas. Our bill has the support of the Free Exercise Coalition, which represents over 50 diverse and respected groups, including the Family Research Council, Christian Legal Society, American Civil Liberties Union, and People for the American Way. The bill also has the endorsement of the Leadership Conference for Civil Rights. 
   The broad support that this bill enjoys among religious groups and the civil rights community is the result of many months of difficult, but important negotiations. We carefully considered ways to strengthen religious liberties in other ways in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision. We were mindful of not undermining existing laws intended to protect other important civil rights and civil liberties. It would have been counterproductive if this effort to protect religious liberties led to confrontation and conflict between the civil rights community and the religious community, or to a further court decision striking down the new law. We believe that our bill succeeds in avoiding these difficulties by addressing the most obvious threats to  religious liberty and by leaving open the question of what future Congressional action, if any, will be needed to protect religious freedom in America. 
   The land use provision covers regulations defined as ``zoning and landmarking'' laws. Under this provision, if a zoning or landmarking law substantially burdens a person's free exercise of religion, the government involved must demonstrate that the particular law is the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest. This provision is based upon the constitutional authority of Congress under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment, as well as the Commerce and Spending powers of Congress. The institutionalized persons section applies the strict scrutiny standard to cases in which the free exercise rights of such persons are substantially burdened. This provision is based upon Congress's constitutional authority under the Spending and Commerce powers. 
   Applying a strict scrutiny standard to prison regulations would not lead, as some have suggested, to a flood of frivolous lawsuits by prisoners, and it will not undermine safety, order, or discipline in correctional facilities. Arguments opposing this provision have been made in the past, but they were based on speculation. Now, the arguments can be proven demonstrably false by the facts. 
   Since the Religious Freedom Restoration Act was enacted in 1993, strict scrutiny has been the applicable standard in religious liberties case brought by inmates in federal prisons. Yet, according to the Department of Justice, among the 96 federally run facilities, housing over 140,000 inmates, less than 75 cases have ever been brought under the Act--most of which have never gone to trial. On average, over seven years, that's less than 1 case in each federal facility. It's hardly a flood of litigation or a reason to deny this protection to prisoners. 
   Following the enactment of the 1993 Act, Congress also passed the Prison Litigation Reform Act, which includes a number of procedural rules to limit frivolous prisoner litigation. Those procedural rules will apply in cases brought under the bill we are introducing today. Based upon these protections and the data on prison litigation, it is clear that this provision in our bill will not lead to a flood of frivolous lawsuits or threaten the safety, order, or discipline in correctional facilities. Sincere faith and worship can be an indispensable part of rehabilitation, and these protections should be an important part of that process. 
   In sum, our bill is an important step forward in protecting religious liberty in America. It reflects the Senate's long tradition of bipartisan support for the Constitution and the nation's fundamental freedoms, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this past year, the men and women of the Armed Forces proved, once again, the value of a strong and ready military. Since the end of the Cold War, our Armed Forces have been busier, and have conducted a greater variety of missions around the world, than at any other time during our nation's history, short of war. 
   Our forces ended Serb aggression in Kosovo, brought peace to East Timor, and aided earthquake victims in Turkey. At this moment, American service men and women are monitoring the demilitarized zone in Korea, enforcing the no-fly zones over Iraq, patrolling the Arabian Gulf for oil smugglers, and assisting in the battle against drugs in Central and South America. These activities are in addition to the daily operations they conduct at home and with our allies overseas to maintain the readiness of our forces. 
   Our National Guard and Reserve members continue as equal partners in carrying out our national security and national military strategies. Last May, in the span of only one week, C-5 transport aircraft from the 439th Airlift Wing at Westover Air Reserve Base in Massachusetts carried helicopters and equipment to Trinidad-Tobago to aid in the war against drugs, flew the Navy's new mini-submarine to Hawaii, an unprecedented accomplishment and a tribute to their ingenuity and resourcefulness, airlifted Marines to Greece, carried supplies to Europe, and continued their very important training at home. 
   Last week, over a hundred citizen-soldiers from Bravo Company of the 368th Engineer Combat Battalion left their homes in Attleboro, Massachusetts for duty in Kosovo. 
   These are just a few examples of what Guard and Reserve members from every state, do for us each day around the world. 
   We ask the men and women of our Armed Forces to prepare for and respond to every contingency, from supporting humanitarian relief efforts, peacekeeping, and enforcing United Nations sanctions, to fighting a full-scale Major Theater War. A quarter million of our service members are deployed around the world to deter aggression, keep the peace, promote democracy, and foster goodwill and cooperation with our allies, and even with our potential adversaries. 
   All of our men and women in uniform put our nation's interests above their own. When called upon, they risk their lives for our freedom. As a nation, we often take this sacrifice for granted, until we are reminded of it again by tragic events such as the April training accident in Arizona, where 19 Marines lost their lives in the line of duty. These Marines paid the ultimate sacrifice for their country, and it was fitting for the Senate to honor them with a resolution. I commend my colleague Senator SNOWE for her leadership on that resolution. 
   More recently, this week, two Arizona Army Guardsmen lost their lives when their Apache helicopter crashed in a night training exercise. Two Navy pilots were killed in a training accident in Maryland. The cost of training in the name of peace and security is high. 
   One of Congress' most important duties is to make sure that our Armed Forces are able to meet the many challenges of an increasingly unstable international environment. Both the Director of Central Intelligence and the Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that, more than at any other time in the nation's history, we are at risk of ``substantial surprise'' by adversaries. Their views are supported by the worldwide expansion of information technology, the proliferation of dual-use technology, and the fact that the expertise to develop weapons of mass destruction is available and for hire on the open market. 
   The growing resentment by potential adversaries of our status as the last superpower makes us susceptible to hostile acts ranging from computer attacks to chemical or biological terrorism. Our military must be equipped to deter this aggression and, if necessary, counter it. The FY 2001 
   National Defense Authorization Bill takes a positive step toward doing so. 
   The many activities which our forces have undertaken and maintained in the past decade, in spite of reduced resources, has taken a toll on our people, their equipment, and readiness. This bill continues the increases in defense spending needed to reverse this trend that the President and Congress began last year. At $310 billion, this bill represents real growth, and a necessary investment in the future of the nation's security. At the heart of our armed forces are the soldiers, sailors,  airmen and Marines who took the oath of office to support and defend the Constitution against all of our enemies, foreign and domestic. Clearly, without them, we could not preserve our freedom. Attracting young men and women to serve, and retaining them in an all-volunteer force, is more challenging than ever. Last year, Congress authorized the largest pay raise in nearly two decades, reformed the pay table, and restored the 50% retirement benefit. This year, we continue these efforts to support our service members and their families, by granting a 3.7 percent pay raise, which is one-half percent above inflation. We also provide for the gradual reduction to zero--over five years --of out-of-pocket housing expenses for service members living off base, and we provide better military health care for family members. The bill also directs the implementation of the Thrift Savings Plan that Congress authorized last year. The welfare of the men and women of our armed forces is rightly at the center of this year's Defense Authorization Bill. 
   The bill also takes a bold and necessary step to honoring the promise of lifetime health care for military retirees. The Armed Services Committee heeded the needs of our military retirees, and addressed their number one priority--the cost of prescription drugs. The Defense Authorization Bill expands the Base Realignment and Closure pharmacy benefit--already available to 450,000 retirees--to the entire 1.4 million Medicare-eligible military retiree community. This benefit lets all men and women in uniform know that we care about their service, and that a career in the military is honorable and worth pursuing. It also lets all military retirees know that Congress is listening, cares, and is willing to act on their behalf. 
   The bill also continues and expands health care demonstration programs to evaluate how we can best address the health care needs of these retirees. We must complete the evaluation of these programs and move to answer their needs. I am hopeful that soon, we will be able to do more. 
   The bill also enhances efforts to prepare for and respond to other threats. It authorizes five additional Civil Support Teams to a total of 32 by the end of FY 2001. The teams will be specially trained and equipped to respond to the suspected use of weapons of mass destruction on American soil. While we hope they will never be needed, we must be prepared for any emergency. 
   The bill adds $74 million for programs to protect against chemical and biological agents, and it funds the research and development for a second generation, single-shot anthrax vaccine. The men and women of our Armed Forces need this support now. 
   Each service has taken steps to protect the environment, but too little has been done to detect and deal with the effects of unexploded ordnance. On the Massachusetts Military Reservation, unexploded ordnance may be contaminating the soil and groundwater in the area. This situation is unacceptable. If it is not addressed now, it could cause irreparable harm to the environment and the people who live there. 
   Unexploded ordnance is a problem in every active and formerly-used live-fire training facility. The bill includes $10 million to develop and test new technologies to detect unexploded ordnance and analyze and map the presence of their contaminants, so that they can be more easily cleaned up. For too many years, this issue has been ignored. The time has come for the Department of Defense to take on the task of removing UXO. This step is essential to ensure the continued operation of training ranges, which are vital to the 
   continued readiness of our forces and the safe reuse of facilities that have been closed. 
   Last May, the country felt the effect of a simple computer virus that disabled e-mail systems throughout the world, and cost industry billions of dollars. The ``Love Bug'' virus also reportedly infected classified e-mail systems within the Department of Defense. Last year, more than 22,000 cyber-attacks took place on DOD computer systems--a 300 percent increase over the previous year. The cyber threat to national security will become more complex and more disruptive in the future. Our armed forces must be better prepared to deal with this threat and to protect these information systems. The bill adds $77 million to address this serious and growing threat. 
   In the Seapower Subcommittee, under the leadership of our distinguished chair, Senator SNOWE, we heard testimony and continued concern about the Navy's force structure, the shipbuilding rate, and the overall readiness of the fleet. I support the Secretary of the Navy's decision to increase R&D spending for the new land-attack destroyer, DD-21, but I am concerned about the delay in the program, the effect of this delay on fire support requirements of the Marine Corps, and its effect on our shipbuilding industrial base. 
   The bill includes $550 million for DD-21 research and development. It also asks the Navy to report to Congress on the feasibility of starting DD-21 construction in FY 2004, as originally scheduled, for delivery by 2009, and the effects of the current delay on the destroyer shipbuilding industrial base. 
   To ease the strain on the shipbuilding industrial base, the bill authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 multi-year procurement, approved by Congress in 1997, to include procurements through fiscal year 2005. This increase will bring greater near-term health to our destroyer shipyards. It could raise the Navy's overall shipbuilding rate to an acceptable level of 9 ships for each of those years, and it could save almost $600 million for these ships by avoiding the additional unit cost of building them at a smaller rate. This increase benefits the Navy, the shipyards, and the shipyard workers, and it is fiscally responsible. 
   I am particularly concerned about one section of the bill that closes the School of the Americas and then reopens it as the Defense Institute for Hemispheric Security Cooperation. 
   Despite the additional human rights curriculum, I am concerned that well-known abuses by the School's graduates have caused irreparable harm to its credibility. The School accounts for less than 10 percent of the joint education and training programs conducted by the U.S. military for Latin American forces, but it has graduated some of the most notorious human rights abusers in our hemisphere. 
   A report of the UN Truth Commission on the School implicated former trainees, including death squad organizer Robert D'Abuisson, in atrocities committed in El Salvador. During the investigation of the 1989 murder of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador, it turned out that 19 of the 26 people implicated in this case were graduates of the School. Other graduates include Leopoldo Galtieri, the former head of the Argentine junta, Manuel Noriega, the former dictator of Panama, and Augusto Pinochet, the former dictator of Chile. In September 1996, after years of accusations that the School teaches soldiers how to torture and commit other human rights violations, the Department of Defense acknowledged that instructors at the School had taught such techniques. 
   I welcome the Army's recognition that human rights and civil-military relations must be a top priority in our programs with Latin America. The provision in this bill, will close the School and immediately reopen it with a new name at the same location, with the same students and with much of the same curriculum. But this step will not solve the problems that have plagued this institution. 
   I commend my colleague, Representative MOAKLEY, for his leadership on this issue and his proposal to create a Task Force to assess the type of education and training appropriate for the Department of Defense to provide to military personnel of Latin American nations. These issues demand our attention, and we must address them more effectively. 
   In summary, I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their leadership in dealing with the many challenges facing our nation on national defense. This bill keeps the faith with the 2.2 million men and women who make up our active duty, guard, and reserve forces. It is vital to our nation's security, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In response to the Senator, one of the amendments is to try to make sure that in the future there is going to be adequate training so we are not going to have to offer these jobs necessarily to immigrants, but they would be available to Americans who do not have those skills. To make an argument on the floor of the Senate that we are going to deny American workers the kind of training  to get these high-paying jobs and participate in the expanding economy is just preposterous. That evidently is what the Senator from New Hampshire is doing. That is one of the key amendments that has been objected to by the Republicans. 
   This is what we are trying to do, to have training programs that are basically structured or organized, or education in the computer sciences through the National Science Foundation, through existing training programs so that we are not duplicating other training programs. It has been objected to. 
   I commend our leader. These are common sense amendments to an issue which can mean a great deal in an expanding economy and can make a great difference to American workers. 
   I cannot understand--I do understand because I think the Senator has been correct--why our Republican friends are constantly objecting to common sense measures which are absolutely relevant and absolutely essential in terms of the H-1B issue.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Just for a question. 
   As I understand it, the majority leader is going to propound a unanimous consent request to consider the Defense authorization bill. I will not object to that. But I hope the leader would consider moving back to the consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act at an evening session following the disposition. 
   I do not want to object to moving to this particular proposal, but I expect to object to going to other proposals if we are not given at least some assurance that we are going to revisit the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I commend the leader for having the night sessions. I think this is challenging all of us. I think we ought to be responsive to that. I certainly welcome the leader's determination to move the process forward in the Senate, but I hope at least the leader could work out, with our leadership, some opportunity for an early return to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   I will not object on this particular request this evening, but I do want to indicate, as that debate is going on for tonight and tomorrow evening, I hope we will have the opportunity for the leader to speak with Senator DASCHLE and work out a process. If we are not going to do that, then I will be constrained to object in the future, until we have some opportunity, with certainty, of revisiting the elementary and secondary education legislation, which is so basic and fundamentally important to families in this country. 
   I thank the leader for yielding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I think that is a very reasonable request, with the understanding that school safety and security is also of fundamental importance to families and to schools. I think we have had good debates on class size, on afterschool programs, on well-trained teachers, new technologies, on accountability, measures about training programs and other programs. We can debate all of those matters. If we do not have safety in the 
   schools as well, those matters will have much less relevance than they otherwise might. 
   I guess we still have some differences with the majority leader on the issue of school safety. I think most parents in the country believe that is a relevant amendment. Under the particular procedures of the Senate, it might be declared not to be, but certainly I think, for most Members of the Senate, it would be. 
   I, for one, would be willing to let that decision be made by the Senate, if we could have a vote up or down on that issue, about whether it is relevant or not relevant. I have not mentioned it or talked it over with the sponsors of the amendment or the leader, but I would think we could have a judgment made on that by the Senate itself in a very quick order and have that resolved and then move to the other amendments, if it is agreeable with the majority leader.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to take a moment of the Senate's time to speak about the two issues that have been talked about recently. One is the H-1B visa issue, to which the majority leader referred, as did Senator REID and Senator DORGAN, which will lift the caps so that we can have available to American industry some of the able, gifted, and talented individuals who have come to this country and who can continue to make a difference in terms of our economy. 
   We are in the process--at least I thought so, as a member of the Immigration Subcommittee--of working with Senator ABRAHAM from the State of Michigan, in working that process through to try to respond to the concerns that the leadership have; and that is that we debate that issue in a timely way, with a limited number of amendments, and that we reach a final conclusion in a relatively short period of time. 
   I had believed that those negotiations, at least from our side, were very much on track. During the negotiations, we had talked to the White House as well as with the House Judiciary Committee members, all of whom have an obvious interest. 
   So it did come as kind of a surprise--not that we are not prepared to move ahead. I would be prepared to move ahead even this evening. I do not know where the Senator from Michigan, who has the prime responsibility for that legislation, is this evening. He is not on the floor. But he has been conscientious in addressing that question. 
   One of the fundamental concerns--as we move toward permitting a number of individuals who have special skills to come in and fill in with the special slots that are crying out for need in our economy--is a recognition that, within our society, these are jobs that eventually should be available to American workers. There is nothing magical about these particular jobs--that if Americans have the opportunity for training, for additional kinds of education, they would be well qualified to hold these jobs. 
   Many of us have believed, as we have addressed the immediate need for the increase, that we also ought to address additional kinds of training programs, so that in the future we will have these kinds of high-paying jobs which offer enormous hope and opportunity to individuals, as well as the companies for whom they work, being made available to Americans. We discussed and debated those issues with the Judiciary Committee. We made pretty good progress on those issues. So I think there is a broad degree of support in terms of trying to address that issue. 
   But there are also some particular matters that cry out for justice as well. When you look back on the immigration issues, there were probably 350,000, perhaps 400,000 individuals who qualified for an amnesty program that was part of the law. As a result of a court holding that was actually overturned, all of these individuals' lives have been put at risk and, without any 
   degree of certainty, subject to instances of deportation. So we wanted to try to address this issue. It seems to me that could be done in a relatively short period of time. It is a question of fundamental decency and fundamental justice. 
   We treat individuals who come from Central American countries differently, depending upon which country they come from. Therefore, there was some desire we would have a common position with regard to individuals. Senator MOYNIHAN had introduced legislation to that effect. That is basically a question of equity. There are really no surprises. It is not a new subject to Members of the Senate. It is something about which many of us have heard, on different occasions, when we have been back to see our constituencies. 
   These are some of the items that I think we could reach, if there were differences, a reasonable time agreement. But they are fundamental in terms of justice and fairness to individuals and their families. 
   If we are going to consider one aspect of change in the immigration law, it is not unreasonable to say if we are going to address that now, we ought to at least have the Senate vote in a responsible way on these other matters in a relatively short period of time so the Senate can be meeting its responsibilities in these other areas. So I look forward to the early consideration of this bill. 
   This isn't the first time we have dealt with the H-1B issue. We made some changes a few years ago. We were able to work it out in a bipartisan way. There is no reason that American industry should have concern that we are not going to take action. We will take action. Hopefully, we will do it in the next 3 weeks. There is no reason we should not. 
   The other issue is the question of elementary and secondary education. I certainly understand the responsibilities we have in completing Defense authorization, which is enormously important legislation. I am heartened by what the majority leader has said with regard to the follow-on in terms of elementary and secondary education. That is a priority for all American families. We ought to debate it. The principal fact is that we have debated it for 6 days and we have had seven amendments. Three of them were virtually unanimous. We didn't have to have any rollcall votes. On 2 of the 6 days, we were restricted because we were forbidden to offer amendments and have votes. We haven't had a very busy time with that as compared to the bankruptcy legislation, where we had 15 days and 
   more than 55 amendments. 
   In allocating time, we are asking for fairness to the American families on education. If the Senate is going to take 15 days and have 55 amendments on bankruptcy legislation, we can take a short period of time--2 or 3 days--and have good debate on the question of elementary and secondary education,  which is so important to families across the country. 
   With all respect to the majority leader, the issue of school safety is out there. We need to ensure that we will do everything we possibly can to make sure we are not only going to have small class sizes, well-trained teachers, afterschool programs, efforts to try to help to respond to the needed repairs that are so necessary to so many schools across this country, and strong accountability provisions but make sure that, even if we are able to get those, the schools are going to be safe. We have measures we believe the Senate should address to make them safe. 
   If the majority is going to continue to, in a real way, filibuster, effectively, the consideration of elementary and secondary education by never bringing the matter before the Senate, they bear the responsibility of doing so. It is their responsibility. Every family in this country ought to understand that because they have the power, the authority, and the responsibility to put that before the Senate. If there is a question in terms of the relevancy or nonrelevancy of a particular amendment, the Senate can make that decision. But when we are denying families in this country the opportunity to address that and respond to it, we do a disservice to the families and to the children in this country, and, I believe, to the Senate itself. 
   This issue isn't going to go away. It will not go away. We may have only 3 more weeks, but we are going to continue to press it. We are going to press it all during July and all during September as well. It will not go away. Elementary and secondary education needs to be addressed. We have to take action. We owe it to the American families, and we have every intention of pursuing it. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year the American Immigration Law Foundation and the American Immigration Lawyers Association sponsor a national writing contest on immigration. Thousands of fifth grade students across the country participate in the competition, answering the question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.'' 
   In fact, ``A Nation of Immigrants'' was the title of a book that President Kennedy wrote in 1958, when he was a Senator. In this book, and throughout his life, he celebrated America's great heritage and history of immigration as a principal source of the nation's progress and achievements. 
   As one of the judges of this year's contest, I was impressed by the quality of writing that was presented and the great pride of these students in America's immigrant heritage. Many of these essays told the story of their own family's immigration to the United States. 
   The winner of this year's contest is Kaitlin Young, a fifth grader at St. Anne Elementary School in Warren, Michigan. She wrote about her diverse immigrant background and how this diversity enriches her life. Other students honored for their creative essays were Shayna Walton of Arizona, John Klaasen of Washington, Allison Paige Sigmon of North Carolina, and Christa Conway of Connecticut.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know that Senators SPECTER and HARKIN worked diligently to craft a bill that could gain broad support. But during the floor debate, Republicans weakened this bill in critical ways that shortchange children in their education, subject hundreds of thousands of American workers to ergonomic injuries, and promote a sham patients' bill of rights. 
   I urge the Senate to reject this bill, and I urge the President to veto it if it reaches his desk. America's schoolchildren, workers, seniors, and everyone with health needs deserve a much better bill. 
   Republicans' very first order of business in debating this bill was to delay the Department of Labor's proposed protections against ergonomic injuries. Hundreds of thousands of American workers will continue to suffer these injuries if this bill is enacted. The companies that Republicans are helping in this bill have had years to study and respond to the overwhelming evidence that ergonomic standards improve worker safety. Yet these special interests continue to oppose these protections. This is unacceptable, and it alone warrants a veto of this bill. 
   Debate on many other parts of this bill fell into a regrettable pattern. Time and again Democrats came to the floor with proposals to improve schools, improve health care, or improve conditions in the workplace. Republicans rejected the amendments, because the amendments didn't allow room for the massive tax breaks they want, and the amendments were defeated. 
   Republicans think they've already done enough for the health and education of the American people. Democrats insist that more can be done and  should be done. That is a fundamental difference between the two parties. 
   The amendments that Democrats proposed to this bill highlight the obvious needs that the nation should be meeting. 
   The health of senior citizens is needlessly at risk, because they don't have affordable and dependable prescription drug coverage under Medicare. 
   Public schools across the country are literally falling apart. They need help in repairing their crumbling facilities and modernizing their classrooms. 
   One of every five children in the nation still lives in poverty. They lack educational opportunities at every step of the way from birth through college. They deserve a fair chance to do well in school--to go to college--to have a productive life and career. 
   The high-technology training needed to prepare the nation's workforce for the future economy is out of reach for millions of Americans. 
   Democrats want to do more to solve these problems. But again and again, our Republican colleagues refuse to act. Their refusal raises a fundamental question of priorities that the American people will decide in November if this impasse continues. 
   We have a budget surplus of $1.9 trillion over the next ten years. We can afford more than token efforts to improve education, health care, and working conditions for the nation's families. We need major improvements in current law--and we can afford them. They should be a high priority. 
   How long will we ignore the 20 percent of the nation's children who live in poverty? How long will we ignore the third of senior citizens who have no prescription drug coverage? How long will we send children to crumbling schools? How long will we refuse to address the hundreds of 
   thousands of ergonomic injuries suffered by workers each year? Now is the time to deal with these festering problems. 
   In fiscal year 2001 alone, a $49 billion surplus is now projected. All of the priorities I have described can be accommodated for a small fraction of this amount--and they should be accommodated. If we are ever going to make serious investments in the education of the nation's children, now is the time. 
   The record prosperity we are now enjoying also gives us an opportunity to save many more lives through better access to health care. It gives us an opportunity to modernize Medicare by adding a life-saving prescription drug benefit for senior citizens. It gives us an opportunity to provide many more children with a decent education and enable them to become full participants in the new economy. It gives us an opportunity to make every workplace safer, and to provide millions of workers with the skills they need in this rapidly growing high tech economy. 
   We can do all this, and also provide responsible tax relief for the vast majority of our citizens. Democrats support targeted tax relief for the nation's families, not the excessive and irresponsible tax breaks for the wealthy that our Republican colleagues insist on. 
   The Republican estate tax relief bill alone would cost $105 billion in the first ten years, and $50 billion a year after that. It's the ultimate tax break for the wealthy. Its relief goes to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans--those who have prospered most in our record-breaking economy--those who have no trouble affording education for their children, health care for their families, or the prescription drugs they need. 
   Other Republican tax breaks now pending in the Senate would cost a total of $711 billion over the next ten years, exploding to even higher costs in the following years. George W. Bush has proposed tax cuts that would consume the entire $1.9 trillion budget surplus projected over the next ten years. 
   If Republicans are willing to give even slightly less to those who already have the most, we will have more than enough resources to dramatically improve education and health care for all Americans. 
   The American people should be very clear on this issue. The Republican tax breaks are too extreme. They are keeping the nation from meeting its high priority needs in education, heath care, the workplace and other vital areas. These needs can be met, if Congress has the will to meet them. As we head into the final weeks of this year's session, I urge my colleagues to do a better job of meeting these all-important priorities. 
   The anti-labor rider that Republicans attached to this bill on ergonomics, combined with the failure to fund education priorities in class size and school construction, would be enough alone for me to vote against this bill. But yesterday, Republicans added yet another offensive provision--a sham patients' bill of rights. 
   Republicans went on record in favor of weak health care protections for Americans. And even those weak protections cover only a small fraction of the number of people who need protection. The Republican plan contains ineffective appeal procedures. These defects are the reason why the GOP plan is strongly opposed by all medical and nursing organizations and hundreds of patient groups and consumer groups across the country. Only the insurance industry supports the Republican plan, because it's a plan that only an HMO could love. 
   This flawed bill should be defeated. The American people deserve far better than this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support advanced appropriations for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. Senator WELLSTONE'S amendment continues the funding practice that has existed for years in this program. It enables states to plan ahead for the energy assistance they provide to needy families. 
   The bill as now written unfortunately ends this current practice. It introduces needless uncertainty into the funding outlook for the future. At this time of high energy prices and budget surpluses, we should strengthen the protection we provide low-income families, not weaken it. 
   A third of Massachusetts families rely on home heating oil, which nearly doubled in price last winter because inventories were too low to meet the sudden surge in need for heating oil when unseasonably cold weather suddenly arrived. Many families could not deal with this expense. But because heat is a basic necessity for families in New England, they had no choice but to make room in their limited budgets for the soaring cost of heat. 
   This year, all indications are that once again, heating oil inventories are dangerously low throughout the Northeast. The coming winter may bring price spikes that are even higher than last winter. Natural gas prices are unusually high this year as well, which may well increase demand for heating oil. 
   We should do more to ensure that adequate inventories of heating oil are maintained in the Northeast. Early in this year, I introduced legislation to do so. But the Energy Committee has not acted on this proposal, and the industry steadfastly refuses regulation as a means of protecting families that rely on oil heat. So we need to focus on other ways to address the problem. 
   The best defense for families that need reliable, economical heat to survive is to plan ahead to meet their needs. Secretary Richardson has urged consumers to fill their heating oil tanks this summer, while prices are stable, and I join him in strongly recommending this action. 
   State governments which distribute LIHEAP funds also need to plan ahead, but they need an entire fiscal year to properly plan. They need to plan to set eligibility limits and to distribute benefits. They need to know what level of federal assistance will be available, so they can budget their state assistance accordingly. They also need advance notice so that they can do what most companies do when they buy commodities that are subject to volatile prices--hedge against price surges by purchasing options contracts. 
   The decision to include advanced appropriations in LIHEAP was made years ago and has been faithfully followed. The current uncertainty in energy markets is the wrong time to inject further uncertainty in LIHEAP funding. That is why I join my colleagues from both sides of the aisle in calling for advance appropriations for this program. 
   The support made available by this program is literally a matter of life and death for millions of families in Massachusetts and New England. Congress should do everything possible to encourage planning that avoids the supply and price problems that left so many families in the cold last winter, and that threaten our region's economic health.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the bill before us provides over $1 billion in assistance to Colombia and represents a major increase in our political and financial commitment to the Colombian Government and the Colombian Armed Forces. 
   Many of us have been deeply concerned about the potential impact of this substantial increase in U.S. military assistance on human rights in Colombia. We have worked with the Senate Foreign Operations Appropriations Subcommittee to include human rights conditions on the aid. I commend Senators MCCONNELL and LEAHY for their leadership on this issue and for preserving the human rights conditions in the final version of the bill. The conditions are fully consistent with the laws and stated policies of the Colombian Government. They are also vital to ensuring that U.S. military aid does not contribute to human rights abuses in Colombia. We look forward to working with the Administration to achieve the Colombian Government's compliance with them. 
   The first condition requires that armed forces personnel alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights be suspended from duty and brought to justice in the civilian courts, in accordance with the 1997 ruling of Colombia's Constitutional Court. The Colombian Ministry of National Defense has stated that, ``the Commander General of the Military Forces will separate from active service, by discretionary decision, members of the various Military Forces for inefficiency or for unsatisfactory performance in the fight against illegal armed groups.'' Unfortunately, this policy has not been implemented, and there is no automatic process for suspending a member of the Colombian Armed Forces alleged to have violated human rights. 
   The Colombian Ministry of National Defense has expressed its support for the 1997 ruling of the Constitutional Court. In its March 2000 publication entitled ``Public Force and Human Rights in Colombia,'' the Colombian Ministry of National Defense stated that, ``Colombia has taken very important steps in limiting the jurisdiction of the military justice system. In effect, in 1997 the Constitutional Court concluded that crimes against humanity do not fall under its jurisdiction because it does not relate to the service provided by the Public Force. Such crimes constitute a serious violation of human rights and transgress the duties of armed services. Consequently, the Constitutional Court decided that such crimes be heard by the Ordinary Criminal Courts.'' 
   Unfortunately, the Colombian Armed Forces have grossly misrepresented their record of compliance with this Constitutional Court ruling. They have claimed that 576 human rights cases involving Armed Forces personnel were transferred to civilian courts when, in fact, only 39 cases of human rights violations were transferred--and those cases involved low level officials. 
   The human rights conditions contained in the bill also require the Colombian Government to prosecute in the civilian courts the leaders and members of paramilitary groups and armed forces personnel who aid or abet them. This provision is also fully consistent with the stated policies of the Colombian Government. In its publication entitled ``Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law Policies,'' the Colombian Ministry of National Defense stated that illegal self-defense groups ``are one of the main offenders of human rights and international humanitarian law.'' In its publication entitled ``Public Force and Human Rights in Colombia,'' the Ministry further stated that the Public Force confronts and combats guerrilla and illegal self-  defense groups ``with the same rigor.'' President Pastrana's ``Plan Colombia'' is quite clear on this issue, stating that ``the Government will not tolerate ties of any kind between any member of the military forces or the police and any illegal armed group or force.'' 
   Regrettably, the State Department, the United Nations, and human rights groups have documented continuing links between the Colombian Armed Forces and paramilitary groups. The State Department Human Rights Report for 1999 stated that the Armed Forces and National Police sometimes ``tacitly tolerated'' or ``aided and abetted'' the activities of paramilitary groups. According to the report, ``in some instances, individual members of the security forces actively collaborated with members of paramilitary groups by passing them through roadblocks, sharing intelligence, and providing them with ammunition. Paramilitary forces find a ready support base within the military and police.'' The report also concluded that ``security forces regularly failed to confront paramilitary groups.'' Human Rights Watch has documented links between military and paramilitary groups, not only in isolated, rural areas but in Colombia's principal cities, and these links involve half of Colombia's 18 brigade-level units. 
   The Colombian Armed Forces have resisted investigating these links. Instead of investigating a credible allegation of military collaboration with paramilitary groups in a civilian massacre that occurred in the town of San Jose de Apartado on February 19, the Commander of the 17th Brigade filed suit against the non-governmental organization that made these allegations, charging that it had ``impugned'' the honor of the military. 
   The human rights conditions contained in the bill reflect the Colombian Government's laws and policies and underscore the importance of human rights as a fundamental principle of U.S. foreign policy. Compliance with these conditions is essential if we are to ensure that U.S. military aid does not contribute to human rights abuses in Colombia. 
   I am disappointed that the conference agreement permits the President to waive the conditions in the interest of national security. However, the inclusion of this waiver authority does not exempt the Administration from responsibility for seeking the Colombian Government's compliance with these human rights conditions. Nor is the waiver an excuse for the Colombian Government not to address the continuing human rights problems in Colombia. I look forward to the good faith application of these important human rights provisions in the implementation of this legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators DODD, LEAHY, MACK, and I are introducing a resolution on police reform in Northern Ireland. 
   Policing has long been a contentious issue in Northern Ireland. The deep historical divisions in Northern Ireland have, according to the April 19, 1998 Good Friday Agreement, made policing ``highly emotive, with great hurt suffered and sacrifices made by many individuals and their families.'' 
   The Good Friday Agreement presented an historic opportunity to create a new police service that is accountable, impartial, representative, based on respect for human rights, and that works in constructive partnership with the entire community. It provided for the establishment of an Independent Commission on Policing to make recommendations for Northern Ireland, including ways to encourage widespread community support for the police. The Commission, chaired by Sir Christopher Patten, concluded its work on September 9, 1999, and issued a final report with 175 recommendations to ensure a new beginning for policing in Northern Ireland. 
   On May 5, a joint letter by the British Prime Minister and the Irish Prime Minister stated that ``legislation to implement the Patten report will, subject to Parliament, be enacted by November 2000.'' On May 16, the British Government published its proposed legislation to implement in law the Patten report.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this week, as the leader has pointed out, scientists announced the completion of a task that once seemed unimaginable; and that is, the deciphering of the entire DNA sequence of the human genetic code. This amazing accomplishment is likely to affect the 21st century as profoundly as the invention of the computer or the splitting of the atom affected the 20th century. I believe that the 21st century will be the century of life sciences, and nothing makes that point more clearly than this momentous discovery. It will revolutionize medicine as we know it today. 
   Already, genetic tests can be used to identify and help those who are at risk for disease, and those who are already diagnosed. Scientists are using new knowledge gained from the genetic code to design better treatments for cancer, AIDS, depression, and many other conditions and diseases. 
   Tragically, the vast potential of genetic knowledge to improve health care will go unfulfilled it patients fear that information about their genetic characteristics will be used as the basis for job discrimination or other prejudices. To realize the unprecedented opportunities presented by these new discoveries, we must guarantee that private medical information remains private and that genetic information cannot be used for improper purposes. 
   I commend our leader, Senator DASCHLE, for offering this important amendment that would do just that. It would give the American people the protections against genetic discrimination they need and deserve. 
   The amendment would prohibit health insurers and employers from using predictive genetic information to discriminate in the health care system and the workplace. It would bar insurance companies from raising premiums or denying patients health care coverage based on the results of genetic tests, and prohibit insurers from requiring such tests as a condition of coverage. In the workplace, the amendment would outlaw the use of predictive genetic information for hiring, advancement, salary, or other workplace rights and privileges. And, because a right without a remedy is no right at all, this important measure would provide persons who have suffered genetic discrimination in either arena with the right to seek redress through legal action. 
   In too many cases, the hopeful promise of genetic discoveries is squandered, because patients rightly fear that information about their genes will be used against them in the workplace or the health system. That fear is clearly well-founded. Today, employers and insurers can and do use this information to deny health coverage, refuse a promotion, or reject a job applicant--all in the absence of any symptoms of disease. 
   Although many genetic discoveries and technologies are new, the problems they raise with respect to discrimination in insurance and in employment have been with us for decades. 
   It was clear in 1973 that new developments in genetics had the potential for enormous good, as well as significant harm. That's why I worked with the scientific community to bring together legal scholars, medical professionals, and scientists at the Asilomar Conference Center to assess the risks and benefits of genetics. That conference formed the basis for laws and established procedures for the use of genetic technology that helped create today's thriving biotechnology industry. 
   It was clear in 1993 and 1996 that genetic tests and information had the potential not only to help patients, but also to harm them. That's why we included protections against genetic discrimination in the Health Security Act of 1993 and the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act of 1996. While the Health Security Act did not become law, Kassebaum-Kennedy did. Its protections were an important step forward, but were far from complete. Insurers can still use genetic information to outright deny coverage or charge outrageous rates to individuals who are currently healthy, but may have a genetic pre-disposition to a particular disease or condition. 
   And, with this week's announcement, it is more clear than ever before that in the year 2000 the American people need strong federal laws to protect them against the malicious misuse of genetic data. The century may have changed, but the problem of discrimination hasn't--and neither has my commitment to protect the American people from discrimination in all its ugly forms. Discrimination is discrimination whether it's done at the ballot box, on a job application, or in the office of an insurance underwriter who denies an otherwise healthy patient  the health care they need based solely on the result of a genetic test or medical history of a family member. 
   This is the same form of discrimination that would be evident on the question of race. Individuals have virtually no kind of control over their genetic makeup. What we are saying now is, without these kinds of protections, it will be permissible for insurance companies or for employers to say: I am not going to hire that person because of the genetic makeup they have, because it may mean they are going to get sicker over time and cost me in the workplace. Therefore, I am going to deny that person. On the other hand, it will require workers to take the test as a condition for employment. And then if they find that their genetic makeup demonstrates some kind of proclivity to acquire this kind of disease, they won't hire them. That is what is happening. They are going to find out that the workers are not going to take the test, which is increasingly the case, because they don't want to risk not being hired in a particular employment situation. 
   What happens is, they put themselves at greater risk of getting the disease because they deny themselves all the preventive health care that could keep them healthy and avoid getting sick and being more useful and valuable citizens in the community. 
   Fear of genetic discrimination causes patients to go without needed medical tests. The Journal of the American Medical Association reported that 57 percent of women at risk for breast or ovarian cancer had refused to take a genetic test that could have identified their risk for cancer and assisted them in receiving medical treatment to prevent the onset of these diseases because they feared reprisals for doing so. 
   As the potential for discrimination increases, more and more Americans are becoming concerned about the danger that employers and insurers will misuse and abuse genetic information. Just this week, in the aftermath of the historic completion of the genome sequencing project, a new CNN-Time magazine survey found that 46 percent of Americans believe that sequencing the genome would have harmful results. 
   Surely, using genetic information as a basis for discrimination would be one of the most harmful consequences of this remarkable scientific accomplishment. Experts in genetics are virtually unanimous in calling for strong protections to prevent such a misuse of science. Secretary Shalala's advisory panel on genetic testing--consisting of experts in the fields of law, science, medicine, and business--has recommended unambiguously that ``Federal legislation should be enacted to prohibit discrimination in employment and health insurance based on genetic information.'' 
   Dr. Craig Venter, the president of the company that led the privately-financed genome sequencing effort, has testified before the Joint Economic Committee that genetic discrimination is ``the biggest barrier against having a real medical revolution based on this tremendous new scientific information.'' 
   Without strong protections, the health and welfare of large numbers of our fellow citizens will be unfairly at risk. Last week, I was proud to stand with Terri Seargeant, a woman who carries a genetic trait that can--if untreated--lead to a lung disease often called ``Alpha-1 deficiency.'' Let me emphasize that this trait only carries the potential to develop the lung disease. If persons at risk for the disorder take a simple genetic test and are appropriately treated, they can prevent development of the disease. 
   Terri Seargent is such a person. She received a genetic test that revealed her risk for this disease, and took the preventive measures needed to avoid the onset of symptoms. She worked hard at her job and received consistently positive performance reviews and salary increases. Nonetheless, her employer--who had access to her medical files and the records of her genetic tests--decided to terminate this hard-working, healthy employee. What are we to conclude except that she had been fired on the basis of her genetic potential for disease? 
   And for every Terri Seargent, who has suffered actual discrimination, there are millions of men and women across the nation who are either at risk of genetic discrimination or fear getting tested because of possible reprisals in the workplace or health system. 
   National Human Genome Research Institute, ``Already, with but a handful of genetic tests in common use, people have lost their jobs, lost their health insurance, and lost their economic well being because of the misuse of genetic information.'' 
   Make no mistake: The potential for genetic discrimination is growing. Already DNA ``chips'' are available that can determine a person's genetic traits in only a few minutes. In the near future, genetic tests will become even cheaper and more widely available than they re today. If we do not pass legislation to ban genetic discrimination, it may become commonplace for an employer to require such tests, and to use the results of these tests to decide which employees to hire or promote and which to deny such advancement, based in whole or in part on their perceived risk for disease. 
   Even now, some employers require information about a person's genetic inheritance as a condition of employment or part of the job application process. A recent American Management Association survey of more than 2,000 companies showed that more than 18 percent of companies require genetic tests or family medical history data from employees or job applicants. According to the same survey, more than 26 percent of the companies that require this information use it in hiring decisions. 
   President Clinton recognized the need for employees to be protected from the dangers of genetic discrimination. In an action of great vision and wisdom, President Clinton signed an Executive order on February 8 of this year to ban any use of predictive genetic information as a basis for hiring, firing, promotion or any other condition of employment in the federal workplace. With the stroke of a pen, the President instituted for federal workers the types of protections that this amendment would provide for all workers and all patients. 
   Our amendment is strongly supported by leading patient groups, medical professional societies, and scientists. The need for these kinds of protections has been clearly and repeatedly endorsed by the two leaders of the genome sequencing project and by experts in law, medicine, and science. A host of editorial boards have written in favor of congressional action to protect people in this area. 
   In many respects, people's genetic composition is essentially a blueprint of their medical past and a crystal ball of the possibilities for their medical future. It is difficult to imagine more personal and more private information. This powerful information should be shared between patients and their doctors--not their employer and their coworkers. 
   The threat of genetic discrimination faces every American, because every American carries unique genetic characteristics that indicate risk of disease. This is not about Terri Seargent. This is about each and every one of us, and everyone we know. 
   The vote cast today in this Chamber will help determine whether the secrets of our DNA will be used for beneficial or for harmful purposes. Congress should give the American people the strong and comprehensive protection from genetic discrimination that they need and deserve. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I understand it, CBO says the cost impact of this proposal on business is negligible but a destructive impact on individuals and society of the failure to act will be immense. 
   On the part of this proposal that deals with employment, without this kind of amendment, those who have been responsible for the breakthrough in terms of the sequencing of the gene understand very well, and have stated repeatedly, we are going to have a new form of discrimination in employment. We want to avoid that. Two, from a health point of view, if people don't believe they are going to be secure either in employment or in getting health insurance, they are not going to take the tests and they are going to, therefore, deny themselves the kind of treatment that is going to be available to them in order to remain healthy. So we ought to take these steps that this amendment includes; it is essential. 
   We already know from what is happening today that a number of people aren't taking these genetic tests because they fear genetic discrimination. This is one of the most important health issues we are going to face in this century. It has been identified by those on the cutting edge of progress in terms of the sequencing of the gene. We should take their advice and counsel and accept the Daschle amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want the record to show that I was on my feet seeking recognition at the time the Senator from South Dakota yielded the time. 
   I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to review what has happened in terms of this policy issue in the Human Resource Committee so there is no confusion about it. We had a hearing on genetic discrimination in health insurance on 21 May 1998. That was a good hearing. That was in 1998. 
   Then, in May of 1998, a number of us asked the chairman of the committee to have a further hearing about discrimination in the workplace. We have not received it. So I don't take kindly to those who suggest that when we raise this issue on the Senate floor, we are somehow acting out of order. Our committee, the committee of jurisdiction, has tried to focus attention on the dangers of the utilization of genetic information toward possible discrimination for health insurance and employment, and we have been unable to do so. Thankfully, with the Daschle amendment, we will have the opportunity to do so this afternoon. 
   The Jeffords amendment pretends to be a half a loaf because it addresses insurance, but does not address employment. But it is not a half a loaf. It is no more than a thin crust or a thin slice. It will not deal with the central problem of people failing to get needed genetic tests because of unfair discrimination. That is the issue. As long as they can lose their job and as long as their children can be denied jobs, this protection is no protection at all. This program is as full of holes as Swiss cheese. They can still require genetic information. They can still disclose it, and there is still no meaningful enforcement. An insurance company can still get the information to the employer. There is no prohibition on that in the amendment of the Senator from Vermont. They can still do that. 
   The fact is, they are doing that. In a 1990 survey by the American Management Association, 20 percent of employers collected family medical history information on applicants, including genetic information. Five percent of the employers acknowledged using that information in hiring decisions. We already know that employers are using genetic information to make employment decisions. We must ensure that employees and applicants are not discouraged against getting those kinds of tests. That is what this is all about. 
   I ask for 1 more minute.

   Let us stand with the patients. Let us stand with the victims. Let us not stand only with the insurance companies.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue of providing protection for American families has been before the Senate for the past 3 years, but we have been unable to pass legislation that will guarantee to the families of this country that medical decisions that are going to affect them and the treatment of the family are going to be made on the basis of sound medical reasons rather than for the interests of the HMOs. That is what this issue is all about. 
   This chart indicates very clearly what has been happening. The Senate, in July 1999, about a year ago, passed legislation, the Republican bill, 53-47. This 47 was basically the Norwood-Dingell bill, virtually identical to the Norwood-Dingell bill, which is a party-line vote. The House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill 275-151 in October, 1999. Then the House and the Senate conferees appointed. Now 8 months have passed. We have nothing that has come out of that conference. 
   We are going to have something now before the Senate, offered as an alternative to the Dorgan proposal, that evidently has been drafted solely by Republicans. Whether it includes Republicans in the House of Representatives or not is something we will have to wait and see. I doubt it very much. 
   Why? Because just this afternoon Congressman NORWOOD, who was the principal sponsor of the Norwood-Dingell bill, said in a press conference: What is significant about today is that all 21 Republican sponsors of the Norwood-Dingell bill are standing behind me and each of us has declared that we will not support any bill that does not allow patients to choose their own doctor, that does not protect all Americans, and that does not hold the insurance industry accountable for its decisions. It doesn't matter what the Senate does today. The 25 us will vote against any bill that does not guarantee patients the protections they deserve. If the Senate passes anything less, they are killing the bill. 
   That isn't a statement made by Democrats; that was made by Republicans. 
   So let's understand it. Here are the leaders in the House of Representatives, in a bipartisan effort that got a third of the Republican Party to pass an effective bill that we should pass, and it failed by one vote only 2 weeks ago. We are being denied, week after week after week, from being able to protect American families from being harmed. 
   That statement is made by the Republican Congressman. The legislation we on this side of the aisle support is supported by 300 organizations, including every medical organization, every doctor organization, every patient organization, every organization that represents women, every organization that represents children, every organization that cares about cancer--you name it, they support our proposal. 
   Do you know who supports the other side? The insurance industry. They supported them before and they are supporting them tonight. So you will have a chance to show, on the floor of the Senate, whether you are going to cast your vote with those who have been dedicated to protecting the lives and well-being of the families in this country, or protecting the profits of the HMOs. That is the issue as plain and simple as can be stated. 
   That is why Congressman NORWOOD, I think, has been so courageous, because he understands it. He was there when the Senate considered 2 weeks ago the Norwood-Dingell bill that failed by one vote. He was supporting our efforts, as was the American Medical Association. 
   The particular amendment that Senator DORGAN has proposed is a very basic and fundamental amendment that affects the Patients' Bill of Rights. It is the question of scope. Are we going to cover 161 million Americans, or are we going to cover only a third of those, as was covered in the Senate Republican bill before and I daresay will be in the Republican bill tonight--although they have not shared that with us, only with the staff for a few minutes. I daresay that will be the fact. 
   Here it is. They cover 48 million--self-funded proposals. They do not cover those fully insured; those who are represented by Blue Cross or by Kaiser. They don't cover those 75 million. 
   They don't cover the individual markets, the self-employed, the farmers, child care providers, the truckers. 
   They don't cover the teachers and the firefighters and the police officers. 
   We cover all 161 million. They cover 48 million. Here is a picture of Frank Raffa, Vietnam veteran, decorated war hero, 21 years in the fire department of Worchester, MA. He has two children. Do you think he is covered? No, not covered under the Republican plan. Why should Frank Raffa not be covered? Why should his family not be covered, his wife and his children? He has dedicated his life to the people of Worchester, MA, as a firefighter and to this country in Vietnam. But, oh, no, the Republicans say we are not going to cover State and county officials. 
   No. 2, here we have Dave Morgan, with two of his 63 employees. He is a pharmacist in Boston. Tonya Harris right here, she is a pharmacy technician, a single mother of two, and Rhonda Hines, another of Dave's employees. She is married and has three children. Do you think working for a business they are going to be covered? Absolutely not. He is a community pharmacist. He worked hard building a business employing 63 members of the community. Some are in training, some are getting advanced degrees--are they covered? Absolutely not. Why not? Why do you exclude those? Norwood-Dingell did not exclude them, why should we? 
   Finally, Leslie Sullivan, a family nurse practitioner in the Quincy Mental Health Center, a Massachusetts employee. She is not covered under the Republican plan. She has worked hard all her life. 
   I want to hear a justification from Senator NICKLES tonight why these people are being excluded. They can't get it. We have insisted, in that conference, on three basic things: One, you are going to have coverage and cover all Americans; No. 2, you are going to have accountability; No. 3, you are going to have a definition of medical necessity that is going to protect American consumers. 
   At the end of 3 months of hearings, 3 months of meetings in the Nickles office--as much as I like and respect DON NICKLES and consider him a friend, the fact is, of the 22 differences, only 2 had been agreed to. 
   I will just take 3 more minutes. Here are the guarantees under the legislation that the Democrats support: 22  different protections here. I would like to hear from the other side: Which ones don't you want to guarantee to the American consumers? You don't want to protect all of them? You don't want to guarantee the specialists? You don't want to guarantee that women that are going to be able to go to an OB-GYN without first going to a general practitioner? You don't want to guarantee prescription drugs? You don't want to guarantee the emergency room? These are our guarantees. This is what we stand for. If the Republican bill embraces those without the loopholes, we will support it. But if it does not, it ought to get defeated. That vote ought to be no, and we ought to continue to fight in this Congress to make sure we get a good Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is always interesting to listen to my friend and colleague from Texas. But I still am trying to find out why he is opposed to the protections which are included in our Patients' Bill of Rights. There was a lovely, wonderful statement about his reservations and about the importance of freedom to HMOs: If we give total freedom to HMOs, the public be damned. That is what has happened too often. What we are talking about is the protections that are guaranteed in a Patients' Bill of Rights, which is, interestingly, all the kinds of protections he has in his health insurance under the Federal employees program. 
   There is not a Member of the Senate who has not accepted the Federal employees program, and it guarantees virtually every one of these protections we are talking about tonight with the exception of the right to sue. 
   The question before the Senate tonight is this: Are we going to insist that whatever protections we are going to pass in a Patients' Bill of Rights are going to be available and accessible to all Americans? That is the Norwood-Dingell bill, the bill we on our side of the aisle favor. Whatever protections we are going to put in ought to include the 161 million Americans with private health insurance. That is our principle, that is what we stand for. 
   All you have to do is read the Nickles bill and you will find out that it covers exactly what was in the Senate Republican bill--only the 48 million Americans who are self-insured. Whatever protections they are talking about cover only those 48 million. 
   Look at the Nickles access to pediatric provision: ``If a group health plan''--that would be 123 million people;--``other than a fully insured group plan.'' Other than; that knocks out the fully insured. It knocks all of them out. So the guarantees on pediatric care apply to only 48 million out of 161 million. 
   Go through the rest of the Nickles bill. Go through coverage of emergency services. It says, again, ``If a group health plan''--they are covering 123 million. The next sentence, ``other than a fully insured group health plan.'' Other than fully insured--75 million. How many are left out? Forty-eight million. They cover the same number of people they covered 7 months ago. That is the reality. Here it is in their bill. Every one of these guarantees: If a group plan, other than a fully insured group plan. You go for the 48 million in the legislation that is rejected by Dr. NORWOOD, who is the principal health spokesman for Republicans on health matters over in the House of Representatives. 
   There it is. Their own language. They cover 48 million. The Dorgan proposal said: Whatever we are going to do, in terms of protecting consumers, let's protect them all--161 million. 
   We are one vote away in the Senate from passing an effective Patients' Bill of Rights. The conference is a failure. The amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma does not even have the support of the House Republicans. And only one of the House Republican conferees was a supporter of the Norwood-Dingell bill. 
   There is no agreement on covering all Americans. There is no agreement on external appeals. There is no agreement on holding health plans accountable. There is no agreement on access to specialists, to clinical trials, or a host of other patient protections. There was no agreement. 
   This vote today is a chance for the Senate to make a statement. A vote for the Dorgan amendment is a vote for the proposition that every patient in America is entitled to protection. Establishment of that principle is a giant step towards the day the Senate will pass a true patients protection program. A vote for the Nickles amendment is a vote against patients and for insurance companies. It is a vote for covering less than a third of all Americans. It is a vote for the same limited coverage originally passed by the Senate. It is a vote for a review process that is not truly independent. It is a vote against meaningful accountability. It is a vote against access to specialists outside a plan, even if the specialist is the only one able to treat that condition. It is a vote against access to clinical trials for heart patients. It is a vote for a bill that is so inadequate it will never pass the House, and it will never be signed by the President. It will not protect the thousands of patients who are injured every day. 
   It is up to the Senate. We should vote for the principle that everyone be covered. We should vote against a plan rejected by every group of patients and doctors, and by House Republicans. And we should come back after the recess and pass a real patients' rights bill, of which we can all be proud, whether we are Republicans or Democrats. Let's protect patients, not HMOs. I withhold the remainder of my time. 
   Let's protect patients, not HMOs. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before the Senate are the appropriations bills which provide the funding for education, health, and training programs. As I have mentioned over the past few days, I respect the work by Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN in trying to shape that proposal. We have some differences, even within the limited budget figures that were allocated, in areas we feel were shortchanged. We tried to bring some of those matters to the floor yesterday. 
   On the issues of making sure we will reach out in the areas of recruiting teachers, providing professional development for teachers, and mentoring for teachers, we received a majority of the Members of the Senate. I believe it was 51 votes. A majority of the Members felt that should be a higher priority than designated. Even in the majority party, there is a clear indication, particularly against the backdrop of the announcements made in the past 2 days with these enormous surpluses, that one of the priorities of the American people is investing the surpluses in the children of this country. 
   I think that is something that needs to be done. We are going to proceed during the course of this day on amendments which I think are very important. The next one, which will be offered by Senator DASCHLE to deal with issues of genetic discrimination and employment discrimination, is very important. We will go on, as has been agreed to by the leaders. 
   But as we are going through this debate, I cannot remain silent on the allocating of resources. We are hopeful, as a result of the action of the President of the United States, there will be a different form and shape of this appropriations bill by the time it comes back from the conference, or by the time it is actually enacted in the fall. We are not giving the priorities in the areas of education, and I must say even in the health area, that I think the American people want and deserve. The principal reason for that is there is an assumption within the Republican leadership that there will be a tax break of some $792 billion. So if you are going to write that into the budget, or parts of that into the budget, you are  going to squeeze other programs. That is really what has happened. 
   I daresay that at a time when we are gaining increased awareness and understanding about what actually helps children expand their academic achievement and their accomplishments, as a result of some dramatic reports, which I find compelling--and actually self-evident--we find we are really not taking the benefits of those reports and using them in ways that can benefit the greatest number of children in this country. 
   I think again of the excellent presentations of the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, when she spoke time and time again about the importance of smaller class sizes. She referred again and again to the excellent studies done in Tennessee with thousands of children, going back to 1985, that resulted in smaller class sizes, and we find that children have made very significant progress. 
   I remember Senator MURRAY mentioning the SAGE Program in Wisconsin, which has been enacted in recent years. I myself met these past weeks with members of the school board, parents and teachers out in Warsaw, WI, who participated in that program and commented about the importance of investing in children with smaller class sizes. So we know this is something that works. If we are going to have scarce resources, we ought to give focus and attention to something that works, as Senator MURRAY has pointed out. I think she brings credibility to this issue because she is a former school board member and a former first grade teacher herself. She has been in the classroom and knows what works. We have been very fortunate to have her presentation on this issue and her enthusiasm for it. 
   We also know, looking over the recent history, that we have actually had bipartisan support for smaller class sizes. We saw yesterday her amendment was not successful, but it was very closely fought in a divided Senate, and I am hopeful, with the strong support of the Senate, we can finally persuade Congress, as we have in the past, to move ahead in that direction. 
   We have to understand this legislation is going to go to the House of Representatives, which has seen a very sizable reduction in its commitment to the funding of these various programs. Whatever we do here is going to be knocked back significantly. That is why many of us were very hopeful we could go ahead and add some additional resources so at least coming out of the conference we would have something worthy of the children of this country. But we have been unable to do that. We have to look back over the years and see what has happened, ultimately, in allocating funding resources in the area of education when have had Republican leadership. We hear a great deal about the importance of investing in children, but the tragic fact is that it is not reflected in the requests by the Republicans either in the House or the Senate in recent years. 
   I remember very clearly the 1995 rescission because I remember the debate in 1994, when we had a rather significant enhancement in our investment in children. The ink was hardly dry, the results were in, and the results of 1994 and 1995 were that we had a very vigorous debate on rescinding money that had already been appropriated and signed by the President. After the extraordinary efforts made by the Republican leadership to actually rescind those funds, we had those rescissions in 1995. 
   Then the House bill in 1996 was $3.9 billion below what was actually enacted in 1995. Then in 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below the President's request; the House and Senate bill in 1998 was also below the President's request. This was a time when the Republicans were trying to abolish the Department of Education. 
   I think most parents feel it is important to have a Cabinet Member sitting in the Cabinet room so that every time the President of the United States meets with the Cabinet to make decisions on priorities, there will be someone in there to say, ``What are we going to do on education, and particularly education that is going to affect the elementary and secondary schoolchildren of this country, particularly at a time when we have exploding numbers of children who are going into our classrooms?'' 
   Nonetheless, what we continue to see, in 1999, is the House was $2 billion below the President's request; in 2000, $2.8 billion below the President's request; and in 2001, $2.9 billion below the President's request. This is what has happened. 
   Members ask: ``Why do the Democrats try to force these issues? Why don't we just go ahead and accept what these appropriations committees have done?'' They try to defend their positions with all these facts about what is really happening out there in education, but when you add them all up, this is what you are finding: The Federal share of education funding has declined. If you look at higher education, from 1980 to 1999, the federal share declined from 15.4 percent to 10.7 percent. 
   If you look at elementary-secondary education, from 1980 to 1999, we see a decline from 11.9 percent to 7.7 percent. Only 7.7 percent of every dollar spent locally is Federal money, and this is perhaps the lowest figure we have had in elementary-secondary education. In terms of the amount of our budget, which is $1.8 trillion, this is less than one percent. It is less than one penny per dollar. If you combine the elementary and higher education, you may be getting close to two pennies. That, I think, is what concerns many of us, particularly at a time when we are finding out the total number of children is increasing. 
   We recognize there should be a partnership among the Federal, State, and local governments in enhancing academic achievement. We have learned important lessons: Smaller class sizes work and better trained teachers work. Take the two States that have invested in teachers: North Carolina and Connecticut. They are seeing dramatic results in academic achievement. 
   We have been fighting to provide the resources to do that. That is what the debate is about. We have, I think, demonstrated to this body and, hopefully, the American people the seriousness of our purpose in allocating resources to what the American families want, and they want to invest in children and education. We believe that is quite preferable to the large tax breaks which have been included in the overall budget. We will continue this battle. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I offer this amendment along with Senators REED, BINGAMAN, WELLSTONE, DODD, MURRAY, LEVIN, SCHUMER, and DURBIN. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is one of the most important policy matters that we are going to consider on this appropriation bill, and that is whether we are going to provide adequate resources to train the needed number of teachers for our classrooms and for children across this country. 
   We believe--at least I do--that the funds that have been allocated in the current bill are inadequate to do the job. I spelled out in my earlier comments that I know the Appropriations Committee received allocations. But, I don't believe those allocations given to the committee were adequate to really respond to the challenges we are facing in education. It is as a result of the fact that the Republican leadership wants to have a tax break. It seems to me that these priorities take preference over that. I wish these priorities had been given additional funds. In  spite of that, we ought to make an expression in the Senate about our priorities for the children of this country, particularly in the area of training teachers, so that we are going to have a well-trained teacher in every classroom in the country. 
   Mr. President, it was only in February of this year that the Wall Street Journal had an article on the front page:  
   Schools Turn To Temp Agencies for Substitute Teachers. 
   Most school districts begin each day with a nerve-racking hunt for substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With a tight labor market making the task especially tough, a few are starting to outsource the job. Kelly Services Inc. unveiled the first nationwide substitute teacher program four months ago, and now handles screening and scheduling for 20 schools in 10 States.  
   Mr. President, this is a national indictment of policy out of the local, State, and Federal level, where we are using the Kelly Services, which have provided professional secretaries and office assistants, and now they are out there recruiting teachers to teach in the schools for the children of this country. We have to be more serious about this issue. We know what needs to be done, and we ought to get about the business of doing it. 
   We have a number of groups that support our amendment, which include the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education, the Association of Community Colleges, American Council on Education, the National Association of Independent Colleges, the NEA, the AFT, Council of Chief State School Officers, and others.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in 1996, what is basically the most important document that has been published on the need for getting high-quality teachers for the children of this country has been published by the National Commission on Teaching in America's Future, in September of 1996--``What Matters Most: Teaching for America's Future.'' There are many other studies and documents, but I think this is about as fine a document as we could have. In our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we relied on it very substantially, but not completely. We had over 20 days of hearings on our elementary and secondary education bill. Nonetheless, this document was, I thought, very profound. 
   The problem in making recommendations is about how to address them. I will take a moment to read the major flaws in teacher preparation:  
   For new teachers, improving standards begins with teacher preparation. Prospective teachers learn just as other students do: by studying, practicing, and reflecting; by collaborating with others; by looking closely at students and their work; and by sharing what they see. For prospective teachers, this kind of learning cannot occur in college classrooms divorced from schools or in schools divorced from current research. 
   Yet, until recently, most teacher education programs taught theory separately from application. Teachers were taught to teach in lecture halls from texts and teachers who frequently had not themselves ever practiced what they were teaching. Students' courses on subject matter were disconnected from their courses on teaching methods, which were in turn disconnected from their courses on learning and development. They often encountered entirely different ideas in their student teaching, which made up a tiny taste of practice added on, without connections, to the end of their course work.  
   Mr. President, they made a series of recommendations about what we ought to do. One was to reinvent teacher preparation and professional development. It included professional development in the schools themselves. Also, it talked about the importance of mentoring. Those are two very important features which have been left out in terms of this underlying appropriations bill which were included in our authorization bill. 
   Then, further, it goes on and says:  
   ......fix teacher recruitment and put qualified teachers in every classroom.  
   That was one of the very strong commitments that we had in our Democratic proposal, our Democratic commitment for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--a commitment to American families that we would put a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in this country within 4 years. 
   Look at what happened last year across this country, where school districts hired 50,000 unqualified teachers. This isn't a problem of just 1996, this is a problem of the year 2000 and 2001. We have to address it. 
   So where are we in terms of these recommendations that we took to heart in a very bipartisan way--which I will come back to--in terms of our Elementary and Secondary Education Act? 
   In this legislation, there is effectively no new money for teacher preparation. We are going to have level funding for title II of the Higher Education Act. This is what is requested; $98 million was requested last year and $98 million for this year. So there is virtually no increase. There will be absolutely no new Federal participation in working with States and local communities in terms of enhanced teacher recruitment--zero, none. 
   If you look at what is happening in this last year, as this money is being expended in 2000, where the grants are being made, now, it is only the difference between $77 million and $98 million because about 95 percent of the $77 million is carried through in 2- to 3-year programs. So the current situation is that over a 
   2-year period, with the demand for 2.2 million teachers, our Federal response has been to provide $21 million to help States and local communities go out and recruit teachers, when we have a need for 2.2 million of them. That is effectively wrong. We cannot do that. It is so important, and I will come back to this. 
   Let me just show you here what happened. For the $77 million that we had, we had 366 total applicants, but only 77 applications could be funded. We had 5 times the number of applications for the number of grants available. The desire is out there. The interest is out there. Parents and local communities want this kind of help and assistance. We are funding one out of five. And this is what is happening, also: We are expecting $21 million in grants for this current year, zero for next year. We expect that 11 applications will be funded out of 141 total applications. That is more than 12 times the number. People across this country--States, educational centers, local communities--want the help. One of the most important aspects of education is having well-trained teachers. What I find so troublesome is the fact that we worked out a bipartisan effort in the Higher Education Act of 1998, which is basically what this is all about. 
   It is about funding the provisions in the 1998 Higher Education Act. When we authorized the Higher Education Act in 1998, we had strong bipartisan support. Efforts were led by Senators REED, BINGAMAN, JEFFORDS, and GREGG. Our goal was to create a program to address the Nation's needs and to recruit better qualified teachers to enter the classroom. Each day, we agreed on that basic principle. 
   I hope our colleagues will agree to give it the full support it deserves. 
   Senator DEWINE during the course of the debate on title II:  
   Really, there is nothing more important in regard to education than the teacher. Our children deserve to be taught by teachers who really understand their subject, understand the subject matter. 
   I have worked hard to incorporate measures concerning good teaching into this bill. I want to thank Chairman Jeffords for the  assistance that he has given me and the cooperation in getting these sections incorporated into this very good bill.  
   Senator JEFFORDS:   
   As its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that investing in the preparation of our nation's teachers is a good one. Well-prepared teachers play a key role in making it possible for our students to achieve the standards required to assure both their own well being and the ability of our country to compete internationally.  
   Senator MCCAIN on July 8:  
   Another important component of this bill is the establishment of a comprehensive program promoting statewide reforms to enhance the performance of teachers in the classroom by improving the quality of teacher training. Having professional, well-trained teachers is an essential component for ensuring that our children achieve high educational standards.  
   Senator SMITH of Oregon:  
   By improving the quality of teacher training and recruitment, increasing the purchasing power of students through Pell grants and other forms of student assistance, and by improving access to higher education for students with disabilities, this legislation provides opportunity for the young people of our Nation to seek a higher education.  
   The list goes on and on. It keeps going on, with the exception to stop when it comes to putting funding into these kinds of commitments. 
   These are efforts that have been made in a bipartisan way to try to get an effective program and partnership with the State and local communities. Effectively, we are zeroing this out. We had $21 million provided for this last year. That is wrong. 
   Research shows that the national need for high-quality teachers is growing: 
   Doing What Matters Most: Investing in Quality Teaching, November 1997:  
   Nationally, relatively few teachers have access to sustained, intensive professional development about their subject matter, teaching methods, or new technologies.  
   National Center for Education Services, The Baby Boom Echo Report, 1998:  
   An estimated 2.2 million teachers will be needed over the next 10 years to make up for a large number of teachers nearing retirement and rapid enrollment growth.  
   One thing is for sure: They are not getting them in here. The Federal Government is AWOL on that issue of education. 
   What matters most is teaching for America's future. 
   The National Commission on Teaching and America's Future found that more than 50,000 people who lack the training for the job enter teaching annually on emergency or provisional licenses. And, 30-50% of teachers leave within the first three to five years. In urban district, the attrition rate can be 30-50% in the first year. 
   That is what is happening. You get them in there, and they leave, unless you have some very important changes, such as providing skills for teachers who will be working with newer teachers in situations involving mentoring, where we have seen these figures change dramatically and where teachers will remain and work in these communities. 
   The Urban Teacher Challenge Report of January 2000:  
   One hundred percent of 40 urban school districts surveyed have an urgent need for teachers in at least one subject area. 95% of urban districts report a critical need for match teachers; 98% report a critical need in science; and 97% report a critical need in special education.  
   There it is. In urban areas across the country: No math, no science, no special education. We are asking ourselves: What can we do as a nation to try to make a difference for children in our country? I don't know how many more studies we have to have. I am not saying if you just pour buckets of money, it is going to solve the problem. But one thing we know is that without the investment of resources in these areas, we are not going to solve it either. 
   My colleagues will speak about other aspects. But we need investment in terms of recruitment and professional development and in terms of mentoring. 
   Listen to the results of some of these studies.  
   ``Teacher Quality and Student Achievement'', Linda Darling-Hammond, December 1999: The states that repeatedly lead the nation in math and reading achievement have among the nation's most highly qualified teachers and have made long-standing investments in the quality of teaching. The top scoring states--Minnesota, North Dakota, and Iowa, recently joined by Wisconsin, Maine, and Montana--all have rigorous standards for teaching that include requiring extensive study of education plus a major in the field to be taught. By contrast, states such as Georgia and South Carolina, where reform initiatives across a comparable period focused on curriculum and testing but invested less in teacher learning, showed little success in raising student achievement within this timeframe.  
   Do we have that? What are the conclusions? If you invest more in quality teachers and recruiting, and providing and keeping professional enhancement and mentoring, you are going to have the corresponding results in enhanced academic achievement. 
   That is what these reports show. If you do not do this, and spend the money in other ways, which you could do with the general funds--which I would call the block grant way--you find that you are failing the children in those particular areas.  
   1996 Mathematics Report Card for the Nation and the States, and 1994 Reading Report Card for the Nation and the States (National Assessment of Education Progress): Over the last decade of reform, North Carolina and Connecticut have made sizable investments in major statewide increases in teacher salaries and intensive recruitment efforts and initiatives to improve preservice teacher education, licensing, beginning teacher mentoring, and ongoing professional development. Since then, North Carolina has posted among the largest students achievement gains in math and reading of any state in the nation, now scoring well above the national average in 4th grade reading and math, although it entered the 1990s near the bottom of the state rankings. Connecticut has also posted significant gains, becoming one of the top scoring states in the nation in math and reading, despite an increase in the proportion of students with special needs during that time.  
   That has impacted many of our communities. Many of our communities are increasingly challenged with a wide expansion of diversity that eventually, of course, adds such extraordinary value to these communities. But they initially put additional kinds of pressures on education institutions and other institutions. That has been true in Connecticut, and it has been true in my own State of Massachusetts. 
   What does this report say? The report says that when you have sizable investments and intensive recruitment efforts and initiatives to improve preservice teacher educating, licensing, beginning teacher mentoring, and ongoing professional development, you see dramatic increases in the quality of education for these children. 
   I think that would be fairly self-evident for people in this Chamber to understand. We certainly understood it in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. It was understood there. As I pointed out, there is broad bipartisan support for those particular provisions. 
   We find that the various studies--I mentioned just a few of them--are compelling and convincing, and those who wrote those studies made presentations which were compelling. Others, in response to those measures, indicated they were compelling. 
   I see Senator REED. I understand I only have 10 minutes left. I yield myself 3 more minutes. 
   Let me point out exactly what this amendment does. 
   My amendment increases the appropriation for the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants from $98 million in the underlying FY2001 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill to the full authorization level of $300 million to enable much greater participation in this vital program to improve teacher preparation and recruitment. 
   This increase in appropriations from $98 million to $300 million will help fund over 100 additional partnerships. 
   The Teacher Quality Enhancement Program provides three types of grants to improve teacher training and recruitment: 
   One, local partnership grant to improve teacher training; two, State grants are to implement statewide teacher reform efforts; and three, local partnerships for State grants to focus on innovative teacher recruit programs. 
   The teacher quality enhancement grants support local partnerships among teachers, institutions, and local schools to help improve in many ways the quality of teachers entering the classroom. By increasing the cooperation between college programs that prepare new teachers in the schools that hire the teachers, teachers obtain  the effective training they need to teach in classroom settings. The prospective teachers have more opportunities to observe successful veteran teachers and obtain feedback. 
   I urge the Senate to support this amendment to increase the funding for this critical program so more of the Nation's schools and communities can improve teacher training programs. The Nation's children deserve no less. 
   Under the current proposal in the Senate, there is no new money for teacher preparation level for title II. There is minimal increase in the Eisenhower program, which effectively had been block granted in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, so it may disappear completely. There are no funds for mentoring or recruitment. I think the bipartisan program that passed out of our human resources committee on higher education considered these various measures and had bipartisan support. I think we ought to give life to those recommendations. That is what this amendment does. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and his explanation. But the fact remains, these allocations are within a context about how we are going to allocate resources in the Federal Government. This explanation we heard is in the context of a 10-year, $792 billion tax cut. If we did not have the $792 billion tax cut, we would have the opportunity to do more. 
   I personally believe this is a higher priority. I think most of us on this side of the aisle believe that it is a higher priority than having a tax cut and putting on the squeeze, in terms of improving quality of education. That is philosophical and that is decided in this body, where the majority are the Republicans and where they have had the votes in order to be able to do that. But that is the harsh truth. 
   The fact is, in more recent years, between 1980 and 1999, we are finding out the support for elementary and secondary education is falling down, and in higher education it is falling down. 
   Against that background, we have the explosion of the number of children who are going on to schools, K-12 schools. These are the numbers--54 million. I don't think we can do business as usual. I don't think it is a matter of shifting priorities from here to there on this matter, and shuffling the debt. I respect the Senator from Pennsylvania's strong commitment to education and health. There is nobody in this body who doubts it. But we are talking about the broader issue, and that is, given the announcement yesterday that we are going to have a $750 billion surplus in addition to what was expected, whether we are going to be able to find some $300 million to improve the quality of education, and do it in a program that has strong bipartisan support, that is what this is about. That is really what is at issue. 
   With regard to our program, in the legislation, the national commission, they say:  
   We recommend that colleges and schools work with the States to redesign teacher education so that the 2 million teachers hired in the next decade are adequately prepared.  
   Then they list the various criteria:  
   ..... stronger disciplinary preparation, greater focus on learning, more knowledge about curricula, greater understanding of special needs, multicultural competence, preparation for collaboration, technological skills, and strong emphasis on reflection.  
   Those have all been incorporated in our underlying amendment, which we are trying to fund. That is why it had the strong bipartisan support. Without this amendment, we have, effectively, flat funding. In our appropriation priorities, we are saying to the American people that we are not going to fund resources to provide the best teachers in the classrooms of America. I think we ought to be able to do so.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment is based upon a rather basic and fundamental concept; that is, every worker who enters the job market is going to have seven or eight jobs over the course of his or her lifetime. 
   A number of years ago when I first entered the Senate many of the workers in my own State got a job at the Fall River Shipyard, and their father or mother had a job there, and many times their grandfather had a job there, as well. They knew early in their lives that they would enter the same career as their family before them. They acquired their skills through training. They lived their lives more often than not with only a high school diploma. They acquired their skills and upgraded their skills at the place of employment, but usually their job changed very little. They were able to have a very useful and constructive and satisfying life. 
   The job market has changed dramatically in recent years. It is changing more every single day with the obvious globalization and the move towards the information economy. New technologies are creating new careers and new businesses, and many people are in jobs that didn't exist a generation ago. These new businesses are an important part of our new economy, and they also create many new jobs. But they have  also created new challenges for our workers. Education has become increasingly important to move up the ladder in the job market. And the idea of continuous skill development has become a critical part of workplace success. 
   We have learned that continuing ongoing training has to be a lifetime experience. We know that some companies are providing training programs. More often than not, those training programs are directed to those in the upper levels of the management of those companies. For too long we have left behind those who have been the real backbone of so many of these companies--the workers who often lack basic academic and technical skills. 
   These programs which have been included in the amendment that I have offered are basically to try to make sure we are going to offer more workers the skills necessary in order to continue to be the world leader in terms of our economy. 
   I don't know how many others in this body go back home over the weekends and meet with various groups, including various business groups. I find in my State of Massachusetts and generally throughout New England that the first issue people raise is: When are we going to do something about the H-1B issue? People who listen to talk about H-1B wonder what in the world it is. H-1B is a visa program. It permits importation of highly skilled foreign nationals to work in our plants and corporations. That is a key question on the minds of those involved in so many of the expanding economies in this country. 
   I always say: Yes. We ought to move ahead. I hope we can move ahead and expand that program before we leave this Congress. 
   H-1B visa provides a temporary solution to a labor market shortage of highly skilled workers. I think the answer to this is not only in the temporary way to have an expansion of the highly skilled workers coming to the United States, but to develop the skills for American workers so they can have those jobs in the future. Those are good jobs. They are well-paying jobs. Americans ought to be qualified for those. The only thing that is between Americans gaining those jobs are the training programs for upgrading their skills. We need to strengthen our secondary education and provide better access to post-secondary education for more students. And we have to improve the access to on-the-job training for current workers, and provide the resources to support dislocated workers with training and re-employment services. 
   What happened in the Senate? It is almost as if this appropriations bill just fell off the ceiling. It has lacked, with all due respect, the focus and attention to what we have tried to do in some of the authorizing committees. 
   This fall, for the first time, we will put in place the Workforce Investment Act, which I was proud to cosponsor with Senators JEFFORDS, DEWINE and WELLSTONE, to consolidate the 126 different workforce programs in 12 different agencies that too often are tied up with a good deal of bureaucracy. We started working on that legislation with Senator Kassebaum and it took three years before we passed that program. 
   I had the opportunity on Monday of this last week to go out to Worcester, MA. There were 800 people gathered there interested in the work training programs from all over New England. They are eager to know how they are going to get the resources to try to put together this consolidation of training programs in order to get the skills for people in our region of the country. Workers know that they have to increase their skills, especially in the area of computer technology, and they want to know how to access those programs. Those discussions are taking place in cities and towns all over the country. 
   Part of that consolidation was what we call one-stop shopping where a worker, for example, who has been dislocated or has lost their job, maybe because of the merging of various industries, would be able to come to one place to learn about all the options that they have for training. They would be able to have their skills assessed. They could get information on jobs that are available in their areas and the skills that they would need to compete for those jobs. And they would get an accurate assessment of their current skills. 
   They could see how long each training program takes, and a look at the employment prospects. They also get information about how many former participants in those programs did in the job market. How many of them got jobs right away, and at what salary? They also get a look at how many of those workers were still employed after a year, and how many were able to move up in those jobs to better paying jobs with their companies. 
   The person can make up their mind. They can say: OK. I want to take that particular program, and they are going to be able to go to that program and acquire the skills. It could be at a community college, a four year college or at a private center. Wherever they choose, they are aware of how participants of that program performed in the workplace. 
   That is what we attempted to do in a bipartisan way 3 years ago. Those programs are ready to go. What happens? The appropriations bill pulls the rug out from under those programs. 
   Our amendment is trying to restore the funding at the President's request to make sure we are going to have the training programs that are necessary so American workers can get the skills to be able to compete in the modern economy. 
   That is what this is all about. It may not be a ``front-page issue.'' It may not be a ``first-10-pages issue.'' But as workers can tell you all over this country, skills are the defining issue as to what your future is going to be and what you are going to be able to provide for your family. 
   This provides additional resources out of the surplus to be able to fund these programs in the way that the President has recommended. 
   There has been a lack of serious attention to the various programs which we mentioned. Tragically, I think the most dramatic has been in the Summer Jobs Program. 
   Here is the story in the Wall Street Journal: ``Fewer youths get a shot at the Summer Jobs Program. This summer the Workforce Investment Act replaces the Nation's previous federally supported summer jobs.'' 
   We tried to upgrade it and tighten it to eliminate some of the bureaucracy. We know that there needs to be a year-round connection to the job experiences that young people have in the summer. What happens? The minute we expand the mission of the 
   Summer Jobs program, they cut out all of the funds for the Summer Jobs Programs for youth. We mandate a year-round approach to getting some of the neediest youth equipped for the world of work and we critically under-fund that effort. In doing that we doom those young people to fail. 
   While local groups agree that the expansion will make the program more effective, it will be more expensive. Washington hasn't provided the funds. The Labor Department estimates participation will drop 25 percent to 50 percent from last year's 500,000 young people. 
   Dropping over 500,000 young people--most of them in the cities of this country--and cutting them loose is probably about as shortsighted of a decision as could be made by this Congress. 
   At a time where we just had the announcement yesterday of surpluses going up through the roof, we are talking about today cutting out effectively the Summer Jobs Program for the most economically challenged urban and rural areas of our country. 
   You can't talk to a mayor in any city of this country, large or small, who won't tell you that is the most shortsighted decision that could possibly be made by the Congress today. 
   I know in my own city of Boston where they have anywhere from 10,000 to 12,000 Summer Jobs Programs, what happens? The private sector comes in and provides maybe 2,000 to 3,000 jobs. They try to build upon the jobs program that existed in previous summers. High school students get a chance to improve their academic skills and learn important workplace skills that enable them to get higher paying jobs in future summers. Many of them make business connections that give them employment opportunities throughout high school and college. 
   They will find children who have completed 1 year in the Summer Jobs  Program, a second year in the Summer Jobs Program, and the third year the private sector picks them up, and more often than not they get the job. If the young person is interested enough to continue the Summer Jobs Program and acquire some skills, more often than not in my city of Boston they will be picked up and given a job to move ahead. 
   I wonder how many Members of this body have ever been with a young person in the summer youth program the day they get their first paycheck and see the pride and satisfaction and joy of those young people? They have a paycheck, many of them for the first time. They have a sense of involvement, a sense of participation, a responsibility, a willingness to stay the course. 
   We are saying to those young people: No way, we are cutting back. We have record surpluses, but not for you, young America. Then we wonder around this body about violence in school, we wonder why young people are upset, disoriented, or out of touch with what is going on. We send them back into the confusion of the inner city, send them out there without any supervision, send them out there without any sense of training or pride. That is what we are doing. We are basically abdicating our essential and important responsibility to the children of this country and abandoning our commitment to give workers help and assistance. 
   Soon the Senate will discuss the issue of expanded trade with China. The votes are there to pass it. Many have pointed out that some are concerned because some will benefit, and benefit considerably, while others are going to sacrifice, and sacrifice considerably. We have heard those arguments about this providing new opportunities for many aspects of our American economy. Many have said yes. But what about others who will be laid off? They ought to get a little training to find a future for themselves and their family. 
   What is happening now? We are closing the door for them. We are denying them the right to have that kind of job training. We are denying young people their first job experience and we are denying older workers the training programs to give them job security. It is fine for those who will make the big fortunes. Increase the number of billionaires in our society. What about those men and women who are laid off? The only way they can survive is to get training in a different job. That training will not be there with this budget. 
   Our amendment provides $1 billion additional dollars to the various training programs and the summer job programs. This is a tangible way to show Americans that we are going to provide the tools for them to fully participate in this growing, expanding, and global society. We need to send a clear message that workers are the backbone of this country, the backbone of our economy, and every hard-working American is going to be able to gain skills to be useful and productive workers in the future in our society. This amendment ought to pass.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I welcome the superb statement made by my friend and colleague from Illinois. The Commission for Economic Development says that half of manufacturing companies nationwide do not offer any training programs. Nationally, all employer training programs equal just 1 percent of their payroll costs. 
   I have here this ``Opportunity Knocks,'' a study done as a Joint Project of Mellon New England and Massachusetts Institute for a New Commonwealth. It says:  
   Which workers get employer-provided job skills? For large employers with 50 workers or more, 80 percent are management. These employers are more likely to provide job skills training for managers, computer technicians, and sales workers that for production or service workers. How are these lower skilled workers supposed to improve their skills and move up the ladder? This really is the case. Companies are doing more hiring and firing simultaneously than ever before. Workers who need a new set of skills are often replaced rather than retrained. We need to get workers the skills that they need to compete in this information-age economy. That is quite different from Europe, for example, where the companies are required to provide a range of different skills training so there is an investment in a company's workers. They value the individual, and they know that continual, ongoing training programs in each of those major industries makes good business sense.  
   This study goes on to say that the poor odds of an employer offering any training is only part of the problem. Access to employer-provided training is by no means equal across categories of workers. Most businesses are unlikely to provide any training opportunities to clerical or production workers and when they do offer training it is in the form of an orientation to their present job. There is no attention to up-grading the skills of those workers. 
   I want to mention, as we reach the end of this presentation, the comments of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. He recently said:  
   [The] rapidity of innovation and unpredictability of the directions it may take imply a need for considerable investment in human capital.  
   Workers in almost every occupation are being asked to strengthen their skills to ensure long-term success in the workplace. The technical know-how that workers need to stay on the cutting edge is being redefined every day. 
   We are being told by the head of the Federal Reserve that this is what is necessary to keep America's economy strong. We are being told that by the business community. We are being told that by workers. We are being urged to do that by the President of the United States. It makes no sense to undermine that. 
   We have taken action in a bipartisan way to develop a workforce development system that will be effective. In the next month every state will come on board to implement the new law. Without this amendment we are effectively undermining this Nation's commitment to provide important, necessary skills for America's workers so they will be able to be full participants in the American economy of tomorrow. 
   It is wrong. I hope the Senate will accept my amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print letters from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, National Association of Counties, and the Mayor of Boston.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which is a long overdue attempt to deal more effectively with suicide, a serious public health threat in the United States. 
   In 1998, suicide was the cause of more than 29,000 deaths --nearly 60 percent higher than the number of homicides in that year. The nation's Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher, issued a Call to Action to Prevent Suicide in 1999, in which he recommended a national strategy to reduce the high toll that suicide takes. Our amendment will provide grants through the Center for Mental Health Services to help support a national network of suicide hotlines and crisis centers, and to provide a certification program for the staff members of the network. This program will ensure that people who seek help during a crisis will receive an effective response from appropriately trained and certified personnel. 
   In Massachusetts, the state's 1999 Youth Risk Behavior Survey found that one of every five adolescents had seriously considered suicide in the previous year, and one in twelve--more than 20,000 teenagers--made an actual attempt. But this serious problem is not limited to young Americans. It affects all age groups. In fact, suicide rates increase with age, and are highest among men aged 75 years and older. 
   Suicide also affects all racial and ethnic groups. Between 1980 and 1996, the rate of suicide among African-American male teenagers more than doubled. Native American communities have long experienced high suicide rates. 
   Suicide and suicide attempts affect both genders. Although males are four times more likely to die of suicide, females are more likely to attempt suicide. Each year in the United States, half a million people require emergency room treatment for a suicide attempt. 
   But suicide and suicide attempts can be prevented. Ninety percent of people who complete suicide have depression or another mental or substance abuse disorder. These disorders respond to effective treatment. 
   The amendment we offer today will ensure that when a person is in crisis anywhere in our nation, there is a network of hotlines and crisis centers to call for help, and that a trained and certified staff member will be available to intervene effectively. Every 17 minutes another American completes suicide. We can do much more to prevent this national tragedy. Our proposal is a small, but significant, step toward preventing the unnecessary loss of American lives, and I urge the Senate to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment basically follows the President's recommendation, and that is to provide a cost-of-living increase to the training programs for youth and adult workers in this country. 
   At the present time, half of all the employers in this country provide no training whatsoever, the other half of the employers provide 1 percent of payroll costs, and 80 percent of that training goes to management level workers. 
   We have talked a good deal about H-1B visas and bringing into the United States those guest workers who have special skills, but I think we have a basic responsibility to ensure continuing training programs for America's workers as we continue to expand our economy and compete in the world. 
   That amendment provides an important increase for training programs. Two years ago, along with Senator JEFFORDS, we consolidated the training programs. We now have an effective one-stop system that will offer real opportunities for workers. 
   Finally, this amendment also restores the Summer Jobs Program. Without this amendment, there will be no Summer Jobs Program for the youth of this country. I hope this amendment will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his leadership in this area, and I commend Senator MOYNIHAN as well for his commitment to this important program. I believe the understanding we have reached is a satisfactory way to protect this program in conference. 
   The rescission of funds for children's health insurance would be a serious mistake. It would come at the expense of 12 million uninsured children in low income families across the nation. 
   It would override the reallocation system established with broad bipartisan support in the original law. It would use the funds to pay for other programs in this year's appropriations bill. While it does promise to restore in the year 2003 the funds taken away this year, the damage would be done long before 2003 arrives. In fact, more than 80 leading organizations have signed a letter urging rejection of this misguided policy. 
   Low-income working families should not be forced to pay the price for the budget pressures facing congress. Those pressures were created by the budget resolution, and its misguided priorities. The committee was operating under the budget instructions they were given. I believe they had good intentions. Unfortunately, however, this rescission robs needy children, and it is unacceptable. 
   Strong bipartisan support in the Senate created the Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997. We focused on guaranteeing health insurance to children in working families whose income was too high to be eligible for Medicaid, but too low to be able to afford private insurance. Estimates indicate that more than three-quarters of all uninsured children in the nation will be eligible for assistance through either CHIP or Medicaid in the near future. 
   This rescission would have established a devastating precedent at precisely the wrong time. The Children's Health Insurance Program is working. Every State is now participating. 
   Between 1998 and 1999, enrollment numbers doubled from just under 1 million children to 2 million. States, advocacy groups and other leaders are undertaking and planning impressive outreach efforts in the states. Last year, back-to-school campaigns helped dramatically increase enrollment. A month ago, the Governor of Mississippi announced a new campaign to cover all children in that State. We have every reason to expect that this trend will continue, as the programs become more established and States begin to do all they can to enroll eligible children. 
   If the rescission were enacted, it would penalize needy children in the States that have most actively sought and enrolled eligible children. States could be forced to halt enrollment until more funds are available. That's wrong. 
   The reallocation mechanism in the original legislation is designed to ensure that dollars remain targeted to uninsured children, regardless of location. Next year is the first year that the reallocation fund would be available. Senators should know that no State loses under current law. All States have the right to their allocations for three years. We have encouraged all States to take advantage of their funds. But, it a State cannot spend all its money, the excess dollars should be used by States that can. 
   If the Senate were to adopt this rescission, States would be 
   reluctant to expand their programs or actively enroll more children if they feel that future State allotments are unreliable. The National Governors Association has sent us two letters--one just last week--expressing their unified strong opposition for this reason. 
   We shouldn't second guess the original policy. It was well designed to direct money where it is most clearly needed. The policy was strongly supported when we enacted CHIP, and States have acted in good faith to implement it. It would be wrong for us to change the ground rules now, when so much progress is being made. 
   We know that lack of insurance is the seventh leading--and most preventable--cause of death in America today. That fact is a national scandal. 
   The majority of uninsured children with asthma--and one in three uninsured children with recurring ear infections--never see a doctor during the year. That's wrong. No child should have to be hospitalized for an acute asthma attack that could have been avoided. We know that uninsured children are 25 percent more likely to miss school. Children who cannot see the blackboard well or hear their teacher clearly miss lessons even when they are at school. That's wrong. No child should suffer permanent hearing loss and developmental or educational delays because of an untreated infection. 
   Every child deserves a healthy start in life, and the health security that comes with insurance. And under CHIP and Medicaid, every child will have a legitimate opportunity for health insurance. 
   Congress should do everything in its power to shore-up these programs, not undermine them. I welcome today's agreement, and I look forward to the continuing effective implementation of this worthwhile program to guarantee good health care for all children. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the letter to which I earlier referred and another related correspondence.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, Senator COCHRAN and Senator FRIST, in supporting this important amendment that will provide $25 million for CDC's programs on antimicrobial resistance. Deadly microbes are becoming increasingly resistant to the antibiotics that we have relied on to fight infections for more than half a century. Already, drug-resistant infections claim the lives of 14,000 Americans every year--meaning that every hour of every day, a family suffers the tragedy of losing a loved one to an infection that not long ago could have been cured with a pill. At a time when scientists are making amazing new discoveries in genetic medicine, it is a tragic irony that we are losing our battle against some of humanity's most ancient disease foes. 
   The amendment that we have introduced will strengthen the nation's defenses against disease-causing microbes that are becoming resistant to existing medications. The new resources will be used for research into the best ways to control the spread of resistant infections. The amendment will also fund education programs to make certain that doctors know when to prescribe antibiotics--and when not to. In addition, the extra funds provided by the amendment will help hospitals and clinics establish disease control programs to halt the spread of resistant infections in patients. Finally, new resources will strengthen the nation's public health agencies, which are the front line in the fight against disease. By fortifying these defenses, we can provide the country with increased protection against disease outbreaks of all types, including deliberate bioterrorist attack. I urge my colleagues to approve this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have had the good opportunity to listen to the persuasive arguments of the Senator from Washington. Does the Senator from Washington agree with me that historically the Federal role of helping local schools assist the most economically disadvantaged and challenged children in this country has been very limited? This was basically the origin of the Title I program back in the mid-1960s. We have had some success and we have had some failures. But I think the successes have been in the most recent time. 
   This is where we have been focusing our limited resources. However, the change in the formula in the underlying bill, which is in complete contrast to what the Senator from Washington has drafted, would target 80 percent of the funds for the neediest children, and 20 percent for the population. Now we are finding out that there has been a dramatic shift and the guiding force is going to be the population. So this whole block grant which has been explained to be available for smaller class size really isn't going to be targeted or really available to the children who probably need it the most. Am I correct in my understanding that this is one of the concerns the Senator has pointed out?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Further, there are no provisions to target these funds to the poverty districts, which runs in complete conflict as to what we understand. We are all for additional funding in terms of education, if the States want to do it. But the funding, historically, that we have provided has been targeted to those areas of special needs. 
   I have been enormously impressed with Project STAR in Tennessee, which studied 7,000 students in 80 schools. It was initiated in 1985 and has had extraordinarily positive and constructive results in terms of academic success for children. 
   I was in Wausau, WI, and met with a number of people who are involved in the SAGE Program, which was developed in 1995. Again, it is a program for smaller class size. 
   The SAGE program is intended to help raise student academic achievement by requiring that participating schools do the following: reduce the student-teacher ratio in class sizes from 15 to 1 in K through 3; stay open for extended hours; develop vigorous academic curriculums; and implement plans for staff development and professional accountability. 
   I listened to the Senator speak about each of these issues. In Wisconsin, they had at least one school serving 50% or more children living in poverty was eligible to apply for participation in SAGE. One school, with an enrollment of at least 30% or more children living in poverty, in each eligible district could participate. Again, it is targeted among the most challenged children. 
   The evaluation done on the 30 schools that implemented the program is absolutely remarkable. 
   In the SAGE Program, from 1996 to 1997, and again in 1997 to 1998, first grade classrooms scored significantly higher in all areas tested. 
   In 1997-1998, achievement advantage was maintained in the second grade classrooms. 
   The achievement benefit of SAGE small class size was especially strong for African-American students. In 1997-1998, the SAGE first grade post-test results showed that African-American students were closing the achievement gap. 
   Further, the analysis suggests that the teachers in these classrooms have greater knowledge, to which the Senator from Washington spoke. They spend less time managing their class and they have more time for individualize instruction emphasizing a primarily teacher-centered approach. 
   This has had extraordinary success--it has been tried. When the Murray amendment was first accepted, it had broad bipartisan support. That is why many of us find it troubling. When we have something that we know has been successful, why are we moving in a different direction? Will the Senator help me understand that in some way?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could just ask the Senator a question. 
   My State of Massachusetts hires an average of about 500 teachers each year. That is certainly not going to solve all of the problems. But it is making an important difference in my State, particularly when we know we have hired qualified teachers, and particularly when we know that across the country we have hired 50,000 unqualified teachers. We are getting qualified teachers who are involved in these programs. The selection of these teachers are worked out through the local process. That is a decision, I understand, that is made locally. 
   Unless the Senator's amendment is successful, what is going to happen to these teachers who have been effectively hired with the understanding that they are going to have the responsibility of teaching children in smaller class sizes? 
   We are now in the summertime. What sort of message does this send to school boards, to teachers, and particularly to parents who may be looking forward to their child staying in a smaller class size in the next year, if the Murray amendment is not accepted?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I have heard the Senator from Washington tell that story on other occasions, but I find it as powerful and as important hearing it again. 
   Does the Senator remember the first time the Class Size Reduction Amendment was accepted, and later it was promoted as one of the major achievements by the Republican Policy Committee? It was achievement No. 13: Teacher Quality Initiative. It mentions the $1.2 billion additional funds to school districts, returned to local schools for smaller class sizes. Then Mr. GOODLING said: 
   This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with Washington mandates, red tape and regulation. We agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal does not create big, new federal education programs. Rather our proposal will drive dollars directly to the classroom and gives local educators more options for spending federal funds to help disadvantaged children. 
   Mr. Gingrich called it, ``a victory for the American people. There would be more teachers and that is good for Americans.'' Mr. ARMEY said the same. 
   At one time, there was very strong support. The only thing that happened in the meantime is the record has demonstrated that it is even more effective than we could have imagined. 
   I am hopeful this Senate will go on record in support of the Murray amendment. I am also hopeful it will support the Bingaman amendment on accountability. We spent a great deal of time on that issue. It is enormously compelling. The most recent GAO studies indicate the reasons that should be supported. I hope we will support the Wellstone amendment to make sure we provide resources. At a time when we have the record surpluses in this country, it seems to me we ought to be able to use some resources to reach out, help, and assist children who would otherwise be eligible if there were those resources, and give 
   them a good start from an education point of view. 
   I thank the Senator from Washington for bringing this matter before the Senate. I hope we will have a strong vote.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Mississippi, Senator COCHRAN, and also Senator FRIST, for the introduction of the amendment. I welcome the opportunity to join with them in the hope that the Senate will accept that amendment because this amendment is focused on one of the very significant and important public health challenges that we face as a Nation, and that is antimicrobial resistance. 
   Microbes resistant to antibiotics are a major health threat. The World Health Organization reports that antibiotic-resistant infections acquired in hospitals kill over 14,000 people in the United States every year--that's almost two persons every hour, every day, every year. Unless we take action, drug-resistant infectious diseases will become even more widespread in the United States and kill even larger numbers of patients. 
   Infections resistant to antibiotics are extremely expensive to treat. It is a hundred times more expensive to treat a patient with drug-resistant TB than to treat a patient with drug-sensitive TB. The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases has estimated that the total cost of drug-resistant infections in this country is $4 billion a year--and this cost will rise as resistant microbes become more common. 
   The amendment takes an important step to address this health crisis by giving the nation more tools to win the battle against antimicrobial resistance. 
   Overuse of existing antibiotics contributes heavily to the problem of antimicrobial resistance. Patients often demand antibiotics and doctors often prescribe them for conditions in which they are clearly ineffective. We need to educate patients and medical professionals in the more appropriate use of antibiotics. 
   The nation's public health agencies are under-equipped to monitor and combat resistant infections. Many public health agencies lack even such basic equipment as a fax machine, and cannot even conduct simple laboratory tests to diagnose resistant infections. We need to strengthen the capacity of public health agencies to diagnose, monitor, and deal effectively with outbreaks of resistant infections. 
   Many patients acquire resistant infections in hospitals. Children, the elderly and persons with reduced immune systems are particularly at risk. We can do more to prevent the spread of resistant infections by strengthening infectious disease control programs in hospitals and clinics.  
   We are in a race against time to find new antibiotics before microbes become resistant to those already in use. We need to increase research on how microbes become resistant to antibiotics and on new ways to fight resistant infections. If we slow the rate at which existing antibiotics are losing their effectiveness and accelerate the pace of discovery, we can win the race against antimicrobial resistance. 
   The measures we take against microbes resistant to antibiotics will also allow the nation to respond more effectively to terrorist attacks using biological weapons. America is a nation at risk from bioterrorism. A deadly disease plague released into a crowded airport, shopping mall or sports stadium could kill thousands. A contagious disease like smallpox released in an American city could kill millions. 
   To fight such attacks effectively, we must strengthen the nation's ability to recognize, diagnose and contain outbreaks of infectious disease. The additional funds that the Cochran-Frist-Kennedy amendment provides to state and local public health agencies will improve their ability to combat any disease outbreak, whether caused by microbes resistant to antibiotics, new diseases like West Nile fever, or deliberate attacks using biological weapons. 
   The need is urgent to begin to arm ourselves for the fight against infectious disease, bioterrorism, and microbes resistant to antibiotics. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, tomorrow we are going to be addressing the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. In that legislation, we will have allocations of resources to fund the Federal participation in education. The federal government provides only 7 cents out of every dollar spent on education at the local level. But those are important funds for many different communities. 
   I regret very much that we are taking up this appropriations bill for education, before we have completed action on the authorizing bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. It seems to me that we are putting the cart before the horse. We should have had a good debate and resolved the issues on education policy before funding them. Instead, we are now addressing appropriations before we even have the authorizations in hand. There are important policy issues and questions that ought to be resolved. 
   At the outset, I thank our friends on the Appropriations Committee for the resources they provided in a number of different programs. But I believe some programs were underfunded in the allocation of resources. 
   The budget is established by the majority. In this case, it was decided by the Republican majority. The Republican Budget Resolution shortchanged education programs in order to pay for unwise tax cuts for the wealthy. In the Resolution, the Republican majority imposed cuts of more than 6%--more than $100 billion over the next five years--in discretionary spending, including education programs. 
   As a result of this resolution, the allocation for education is too low. Because of that inadequate allocation, the Senate Appropriations Committee was forced to make unwise cuts in key education and other discretionary programs. This $100 billion in order to afford a tax cut for wealthy individuals is the wrong priority. 
   That is what a good deal of the debate is going to be about--about whether we think we ought to have further tax cuts for wealthy individuals or whether we ought to invest in the education of the children of this country. I believe we ought to invest in the children of this country. 
   We didn't get the kind of allocation in the Appropriations Committee that we should have, and we are going to find, once this is approved, that it will go to the House, which has had a very significant reduction in terms of allocating resources. We are going to find further cuts in education. That troubles me. 
   If you look over the past years, we will see what has happened in the history of cutting education funding in appropriations bills. 
   We have seen, going back to 1995 when the Republicans took control of the Senate, that we had a rescission. We had money already appropriated. But then we had a rescission of $1.7 billion below what was actually enacted in 1995. 
   In 1996, the House bill was $3.9 billion below 1995. 
   In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below what the President requested. 
   In 1998, the House and Senate bill was $200 million below the President's request. 
   In 1999, the House bill was $2 billion below the President's request. 
   In 2000, the House bill was $2.8 billion below the President's request. 
   In fiscal year 2001, it is $2.9 billion below the President's request. 
   We have all of the statements being made by the Republican leadership about how important education is in terms of national priorities. We have our Republican Majority Leader, going back to January 1999, saying, ``Education is going to be a central issue 
   this year....... For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.'' 
   That was the bill which was set aside in May of this year. Some six weeks later, we still haven't had it back in order to be able to debate it. 
   In remarks to the Conference of Mayors, the majority leader said: ``But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to be just words.......'' 
   June 22, 1999: ``Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year.....'' 
   Then remarks to the Chamber of Commerce on February 1, 2000: ``We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I have been majority leader....... And Republicans are committed to doing that.'' 
   National Conference on State Legislatures, February 3: ``We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... Education will be a high priority.'' 
   April 20, the Congress Daily: ``LOTT said last week his top priorities in May include an agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills.'' 
   May of this year: ``This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.'' 
   Then, on May 2, on elementary and secondary education: ``Have you scheduled a cloture vote on that?'' Senator LOTT: ``No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote....... But education is number one on the minds of the American people all across this country and every State, including my own state. For us to have a good, healthy and even a protracted debate on amendments on education, I think is the way to go.'' 
   This is the record. We still don't have that debate. That was 6 weeks ago. We had 6 days of debate, and 2 days of the debate were without any votes at all. We had eight amendments, and three of those we were glad to accept. 
   We have effectively not had the debate on education. Here we are on Monday afternoon before the Fourth of July recess, and we have the appropriations bills up with a wide variety of appropriations to support the agencies in areas of health and of education. I believe we are giving education policy short shrift. You can't draw any other conclusion--short shrift. 
   We were prepared to spend 15 days on bankruptcy reform but only 6 days on education--and for 2 days we couldn't vote. 15 days on bankruptcy and 53 amendments; 4 days where we had amendments on elementary and secondary education and only 8 amendments. 
   That is an indication of priorities. I take strong exception. I think the American people do as well. 
   Money in and of itself doesn't solve all of our problems, but it sure is an indication of where our national priorities are. 
   If I look over this chart, the Federal share of education funding has declined. Look at what has happened in higher education: 15.4 percent in 1980 has declined to 10.7 percent in 1999. Take elementary and secondary education. In 1980, it was 11.9 percent on  elementary and secondary education. In 1999, it was only 7.7 percent. 
   We have seen a decline in elementary and secondary education. We don't even spend 1 percent of our budget in support of elementary and secondary education. That is amazing. 
   Think of any of us going into any hall across this country in any part of our Nation. Ask about the priorities of people in that hall. They would say: We need national security, national defense. We have to deal with that. Certainly we do. Save Social Security and Medicare--absolutely. Deal with Medicaid--absolutely. But among their four or five priorities would be education. 
   I think Americans will be absolutely startled to find out that we are spending less than one penny out of every dollar on elementary and secondary education. 
   This is what has been happening. In the area of elementary and secondary education, K through 12, we have now gone from 1990 with 46.4 million students up to 53.4 million in 2000. 7 million additional students at a time when our participation is going down in favor of tax cuts instead of investing in the children of this country. 
   That is what is happening. As we start off on this debate, I think it is important to understand that. I think most parents across this country believe there ought to be a partnership, at the local level, the State level, and the Federal level in terms of participation. 
   However, we are not meeting our responsibilities. We get a lot of statements, a lot of quotes, a lot of press releases, but when the time comes in terms of the Budget Committee--which is controlled by that side of the aisle--allocating resources on education, they are not doing it. They are not walking the walk. They are talking the talk, but they are not walking the walk. That is one of the important issues dividing our political parties, unfortunately. I think the American people ought to understand that. 
   Tomorrow, we are going to have several education amendments. One which I will offer will be to try to strengthen the recruitment, training, and mentoring for teachers in this country. We need 2 million teachers. Last year, we hired--``we,'' meaning the States across this country--50,000 teachers who did not have certification in the courses they are teaching. 
   We believe we ought to guarantee to the families in this country that within 4 years every teacher in every public school will be certified. We are committed to that. We are going to offer an amendment on that. We think that is one of the better ways of going with education. When we look at the results, better prepared teachers stay longer. The earlier intervention occurs for teachers, the longer they will stay. If we give them continued help and assistance that is school based, they will remain longer. 
   Providing professional training and mentoring for the teachers is enormously helpful. If we have experienced teachers working with younger teachers in the classroom, they stay longer. This is enormously important. We ought to be debating and discussing these issues. Hopefully, tomorrow, we will. 
   Amendments to be offered by our colleagues include after school programs, accountability, and the digital divide. We are going to have a series of amendments regarding helping, assisting, and modernizing our schools. All these amendments are for worthwhile programs. 
   We need to have this debate. We need to have this expression. We need to call the roll to find out where our colleagues are going to stand on the issues involving education in this country. 
   We will, of course, have the opportunity to debate smaller class size with the Murray amendment. We have had bipartisan support for that in the past. I will not take the time tomorrow to place again in the RECORD all of the press releases we had from Newt Gingrich and Mr. ARMEY celebrating the fact that we would go to smaller class size. We had strong bipartisan support, but they have emasculated the program in the appropriations legislation. We will have an opportunity, hopefully, to debate that, as well. 
   The bill before the Senate includes $2.7 billion for title VI block grants but eliminates the Federal commitment to reducing class size and does nothing to guarantee the funds for communities to address the urgent need for school repair and modernization. 
   Under the Class Size Reduction Program, the funds are distributed to school districts based on a formula that is targeted 80 percent by poverty and 20 percent by population. Under title VI, block grant funding is distributed based solely on population. It includes no provisions to target the funds to high poverty districts. It is basically a blank check--whatever the Governor wants to do with those funds--without the accountability which is so important and necessary. 
   I think people across this country want scarce resources utilized in an effective way, on proven, tested, effective programs that will enhance academic achievement and accomplishment. That is provided in the amendments we are going to offer tomorrow. 
   Better schools, a better education for all children, and making college more affordable are top priorities for the Nation's families and communities. 
   I regret very much that we are taking up this appropriations bill for education, before we have completed action on the authorizing bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. In many ways, we are putting the cart before the horse again. 
   We have an opportunity this year to do our part to help local communities improve their schools by strengthening the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. And, to Democrats, this is must-pass legislation. 
   The Republican majority has paid great lip service to the importance of education, but the reality is far different. We considered only eight amendments to that legislation over 6 days--and during 2 of these days, we were allowed to debate only, not vote. On May 9, the Republican leadership suddenly abandoned the debate, moved to other legislation, and haven't returned to it since then. 
   I hope that our Republican friends have just temporarily suspended the bill, and not expelled it. We owe it to the Nation's schools, students, parents, and communities to complete action on this priority legislation. 
   The Senate education appropriations bill now before us also has problems. It is a much better step towards funding education than the House bill, but it's not enough. 
   The Republican budget resolution shortchanged education programs in order to pay for unwise tax cuts for the wealthy. Because of the Republican budget resolution, the allocation for education is too low. 
   Because of that inadequate allocation, the Senate Appropriations Committee was forced to make unwise cuts in key education and other discretionary programs because of the unreasonably low funding level set for domestic discretionary programs in the budget resolution. In the resolution, the Republican majority imposed cuts of more than 6 percent--more than $100 billion over the next 5 years--in discretionary spending. These cuts are far from necessary to curb uncontrolled federal spending. The opposite is true. We are already spending less on domestic discretionary programs as a percentage of GNP than we ever have. Republicans are seeking to impose these drastic cuts for one reason only--to fund the massive tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   This is not the time for cuts in education. We need to increase our investment in education to ensure a brighter future for the nation's children. 
   Unfortunately, the bill approved by the House of Representatives is a major retreat from all of these priorities. It slashed funding for education by $2.9 billion below the President's request. 
   The House bill zeroes out critical funding to help states turn around failing schools. 
   It slashes funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers program by $400 million below the President's request, denying 900 communities the opportunity to provide 1.6 million children with after-school activities to keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble, and to help them with their studies. 
   It eliminates the bipartisan commitment to help communities across the country reduce class size in the early grades. 
   It cuts funding for title I by $166 million below the President's request, reducing or eliminating services to  260,000 educationally disadvantaged children to help them master the basics and meet high standards of achievement. 
   It reduces funding for the Reading Excellence Act by $26 million below the President's request, denying services to help 100,000 children become successful readers by the end of the 3rd grade. 
   It slashes funding for safe and drug free schools by $51 million below the President's request, denying communities extra help to keep their students safe, healthy, and drug-free. 
   It does nothing to help communities meet their most urgent repair and modernization needs. Those needs are especially urgent in 5,000 schools across the country. 
   It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $125 million below the President's request, denying more than 644,000 low-income middle and high school students the support they need for early college preparation and awareness activities. 
   It does nothing to increase funding for the teacher quality enhancement grants, so that more communities can recruit and train better qualified teachers. 
   It slashes funding for Head Start by $600 million below the 
   President's budget, denying 50,000 low-income children critical preschool services. 
   It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the President's request, denying over 100,000 dislocated workers much-needed training, job search, and re-employment services. 
   It reduces funding for adult job training by $93 million below the President's request, denying 37,200 adults job training this year. 
   It cuts youth opportunities grants by $200 million below the President's request, eliminating the proposed expansion to 20 new communities, reducing the current program by $75 million, and denying 40,000 disadvantaged youth a bridge to skills and opportunities of our strong economy and alternatives to welfare and crime. 
   It slashed summers jobs and year-round youth training by $21 million below the President's request, reducing the estimated number of low-income youth to be served over 12,000. 
   The Senate bill does take some positive steps towards better funding for education. 
   It increases the maximum Pell grant by $350 to $3,650. 
   It increases funding for IDEA by $1.3 billion. 
   Although these are important increases, they are not enough. In too many other vital aspects of education, too many children and too many families are shortchanged by this bill. 
   Once again, the Republican leadership has put block grants ahead of targeted funding for education reforms. Block grants are the wrong approach. They prevent the allocation of scarce resources to the highest education priorities. They eliminate critical accountability provisions that ensure better results for all children. The block grant approach abandons the national commitment to improve education by encouraging proven effective reforms of public schools. 
   Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong direction for the nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public schools. 
   The bill includes $2.7 billion more for the title VI block grant, but it eliminates the federal commitment to reducing class size. It does nothing to guarantee funds for communities to address their urgent school repair and modernization needs. 
   It is unconscionable to block grant critical funds that are targeted to the neediest communities to reduce class size. Under the Class Size Reduction program that has received bipartisan support for the past two years, funds are distributed based on a formula that is targeted to school districts 80 percent by poverty and 20 percent by population. But under the title VI block grant, funding is distributed based solely on population--it includes no provisions to target the funds to high poverty districts. This is unacceptable, when it is often the neediest students that are in the largest classes. 
   The national class size average is just over 22 students per class. But, in many communities--especially in urban and rural communities--class sizes are much higher than the national average. 
   In 1998, the publication Education Week found that half of the elementary teachers in urban areas and 44 percent of the teachers in nonurban areas had classes with 25 or more students. 
   A 1999 study found that 56 percent of the students in Portland, OR, in grades K through 3 were in classes with more than 25 students. 
   In fact, nationwide, K through 3 classrooms with 18 or fewer children are hard to find. For example, in 22 northern and northeastern counties in Kentucky, and in 5 districts in Mercer County, New Jersey, less than 15 percent of the children are in classes of 18 or less. Class size in New York City is an average of 28 students per class. 
   The federal Class Size Reduction program is making a difference. For example, in Columbus Ohio, class sizes in grades 1 through 3 have been reduced from 25 students per class to 15 students per class. 
   We need to invest more in this program, so that communities can continue to reduce class sizes. We should not block grant the program. If we do, it will no longer be targeted to the neediest communities, and parents will no longer be guaranteed that their children will be learning in smaller classes. 
   In addition, it is wrong to put the $1.3 billion that the President requested for repairing and modernizing schools into the title VI block grant. We need to target school modernization funds to the neediest communities, and the title VI block grant will not do that. Parents need a guarantee that they will get the support they need to help their children to school in buildings that are modern and safe, and are not overcrowded. 
   The bill also falls short in other areas. 
   It fails to increase the national investment in improving teacher 
    quality. It provides only level funding for the teacher quality enhancement grants that are helping colleges and communities recruit and train prospective teachers more effectively 
   It cuts funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers by $400 million below the President's request, denying 1.6 million children access to after-school programs. 
   It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $100 million below the President's request. That reduction will deny 407,000 low-income middle and high school students the help they need to go to college and succeed in college. 
   It slashes the title I Accountability program by $250 million below the President's request, eliminating critical funding for states to turn around failing schools. 
   It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the President's request. As a result, 100,000 American workers who lost their jobs because of down-sizing or business relocation will go without the important services that they need to find adequate employment in their communities. 
   It also slashes funding for youth opportunity grants by $125 million below the President's request, denying 27,000 youth in high-poverty communities access to vital education, training, and employment assistance, and eliminating the proposed expansion of the program to up to 15 new communities. 
   We should be doing more, not less, to improve public schools, to help make college affordable and accessible to every qualified student, and to increase training opportunities for the Nation's workers. 
   School and communities are already stretching their budgets to meet rising needs. 
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. Fourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. 
   The problems with crumbling school buildings aren't just the problems of the inner city. They exist in almost every community--urban, rural, and suburban. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, many communities need to build new schools, in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million students. Enrollment will continue to rise over  the next ten years. The number will increase by 324,000 in 2000, by 282,000 in 2001, and by 250,000 in 2002--and it will continue on an upward trend in each of the following years. 
   To meet this urgent need, the Nation faces the challenge of hiring more than 2 million new teachers over the next ten years. According to the Urban Teacher Challenge Report, released by Recruiting New Teachers last January, almost 100 percent of the 40 urban school districts surveyed have an urgent need for teachers in at least one subject area. Ninety-five percent of urban districts report a critical need for math teachers. Ninety-eight percent report a need in science. Ninety-seven percent report a need for special education teachers. 
   Unfortunately, the need for new teachers in 1998 was met by admitting 50,000 unqualified teachers to the classroom. And nearly 50 percent of those who do enter teaching, leave the profession within 5 years. 
   Parents, schools, and communities also need special help in providing after-school activities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are left home alone after school. Juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 6 p.m. We know that children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior. 
   The Nation's schools need more help to meet all of these challenges. 
   In addition, many families across the Nation are struggling to put their children through college. The burden of education debt is rising. Eight million seven hundred thousand students borrowed $32 billion in 1999 alone. 
   Only 53 percent of students with a family income below $25,000 go on to higher education, and only 26 percent--1 in 4--go on to 4-year colleges. But 90 percent of students with family income above $74,000 attend college. The opportunity for a college education should not be determined by the level of family income. Any student who has the ability, who works hard, and who wants to attend college should have the opportunity to do so. 
   We need to do more to fund programs such as GEAR UP that help make college a reality for more young people. 
   We also need to do more to help American workers who have lost their jobs because of down-sizing or business relocation to find other good jobs in their communities. Companies are doing more hiring and firing simultaneously than ever before. Workers need a new set of skills, 
    and globalization is driving more work abroad. Greater services for dislocated workers will guarantee that workers have the skills they need as we move full speed into the information-based economy. It will also help us respond to employer needs during the current labor shortage by having an efficient labor exchange system and retraining programs. 
   We must also do more to emphasize keeping young people in school, increasing their enrollment in college, and preparing and placing these young people in good jobs. Only 42 percent of dropouts participate in the labor force, compared to 65 percent of those with a high school education and 80 percent of those with a college degree. 
   Next week, when we have the opportunity to address education in the pending Senate appropriations bill, Democrats will offer amendments to address as many of these critical needs as possible. 
   I intend to offer an amendment to increase funding for title II of the Higher Education Act, to help communities recruit and train prospective teachers and put a qualified teacher in every classroom. In addition, I will offer an amendment to increase funding for skills training programs by $792 million to ensure that the Nation's workers get the support they need in today's workplace. 
   Senator MURRAY will offer an amendment to continue the bipartisan commitment we have made over the last two years to help communities reduce class size in the early grades. 
   Senator HARKIN and Senator ROBB will offer an amendment to ensure that communities get the help they need to meet their most urgent repair and modernization problems. 
   Senator DODD will offer an amendment to increase funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers program, so that more children will have the opportunity to attend after-school activities. 
   Senator BINGAMAN will offer an amendment to help states turn around failing schools. 
   Senator REED will offer an amendment to increase funding for the GEAR UP program, so that more children will be able to attend college. 
   Other colleagues will offer additional amendments to increase the Nation's investment in education. 
   The time is now to invest more in education. The Nation's children and families deserve no less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a few moments on another subject, the issue of our Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   A short while ago, we had an opportunity to vote on the issues on a Patients' Bill of Rights. This was basically as a result of the fact that the conference in which we are involved had reached a dead end and was going nowhere. It wasn't only my assessment of that development, but the conclusion of a great number of the conferees as well, not just the Democrats, but also those who had supported an effective Patients' Bill of Rights in the House of Representatives, Dr. NORWOOD and Dr. GANSKE. We offered an amendment on the floor, and we failed by one vote. 
   Now we understand the Republicans have decided that effectively they are not going to participate with the Democrats at all. They are writing their own bill. We had indicated we were still willing to participate. We wanted to get a bill. 
   It is interesting that the 300 organizations that represent the doctors, the patients, the nurses, the health delivery community, have all been in support of our position. They have not had a single medical organization that has supported the position taken by the Republican leadership in the Senate. 
   When we talk about bipartisanship, I think we ought to do what the medical professions, the patient organizations, and common sense tell us to do--to listen to doctors and nurses who have had training and follow their recommendations, rather than accountants for HMOs. That is what this bill is basically about. 
   In the Patients' Bill of Rights, we have outlined the various areas where we think patients need protection. We have asked those who have not been supportive of our position to spell out which protections they don't wish to provide for the American people. One, for example, is to make sure all patients are going to be covered. That is a rather basic and fundamental issue. It shouldn't take a long time to debate and discuss that. The House bill provided for comprehensive coverage for all of the patients and holds plans accountable. That seems to be common sense. Again, that was in the bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives. 
   In the category of access for specialists, we see a situation where a child has cancer; we want to make sure the child will see a pediatric oncologist. They ought to be able to get the specialist. We certainly have that opportunity for Members of the Senate. We ought to be able to understand that. We should guarantee the specialists. 
   Access to clinical trials. We are in a period of great opportunities for breakthroughs in research. The only way that breakthroughs get from the laboratory to the patient is through clinical trials. We ought to guarantee it. We don't need to study the question of clinical trials. 
   Access to OB/GYNs. That is common sense. 
   Prohibition on gag rules. We are going to take the gag off our doctors who have been trained to provide the best in medicine. They shouldn't be gagged by accountants for HMOs. 
   Emergency room access, another area of importance. 
   These are some of the points that are guaranteed. 
   Perhaps some of these are protections that our Republican friends don't want to guarantee. We wish they would state which ones. Why do we have to do it behind closed doors? Why not come out here and say which ones they don't want to guarantee, have some votes in the Senate, and then get legislation passed? 
   However, we have been buried in the darkness of our offices. We ought to have an opportunity to have matters decided or stated. These protections should be available to every American. Those Members representing our side of the aisle are committed to that. Republicans and Democrats alike in the House of Representatives were in support of it. A third of the Republicans voted for that and a few courageous Republicans in this body supported that position as well.  
   We should get about the business of closing this legislation down. Every day it delays people are being hurt. It is wrong. We ought to get about doing the people's business and pass a strong Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   To reiterate, the American people have waited more than 3 years for Congress to send the President a Patient's Bill of Rights that protects all patients and holds HMOs and other health plans accountable for their actions. 
   Every day that the conference on the Patient's Bill of Rights fails to produce agreement on meaningful patient protections, 60,000 more patients endure added pain and suffering. More than 40,000 patients report a worsening of their condition as a result of health plan abuses. 
   By all accounts, Republicans are working amongst themselves on the Patients' Bill of Rights. They are working in the middle of the night, behind closed doors, to produce a partisan bill that will surely fail the test of true reform. The crocodile tears were flowing form the eyes of the Senate Republican leadership on June 8 when we took the bipartisan, House-passed Managed Care Consensus Act to the floor for its first Senate vote. That legislation, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support last year, is a sensible compromise that extends meaningful protections to all patients and guarantees that health plans re held accountable when their abuses result in injury or death. 
   Democratic conferees sent a letter to Senator NICKLES on June 13. In that letter, we reiterated that we remained ready to negotiate on serious proposals that provide a basis for achieving strong, effective protections. But the assistant majority leader has not responded. The silence is deafening. 
   We have been forewarned of what to expect from a partisan bill. The American people won't stand for a sham bill, and we won't either. 
   Make no mistake. We want a bill that can be signed into law this year. There is not much time left. We need to act now. 
   The Republican leadership continues to refuse to guarantee meaningful protections to all Americans. They continue to delay and deny action on this critical issue. This debate is about real people. It's about women, children, and families. 
   The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan legislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. And the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing adequate progress. 
   Republican conferees steadfastly refuse to cover all Americans. Their flawed approach leaves out two-thirds of those with private health insurance--more than 120 million Americans. 
   The Senate Republican leadership says no to farmers, truck drivers, police officers, teachers, home day care providers, fire fighters, and countless others who buy insurance on their own or work for state or local governments. 
   The bipartisan legislation that we support and which we voted on in the Senate on June 8 covers everyone. But the Republican leadership said no. 
   The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed by patients across the country. Yet, the Republican leadership is adopting the practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use themselves to delay and deny patients the care they need. 
   It's just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed reforms, as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care. 
   Congress can pass bipartisan legislation that provides meaningful protections for all patients and guarantees accountability when health plan abuse results in injury or death. The question is, will we? 
   The American people are waiting for an answer.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this important amendment to increase funding for community health centers. Each year, these centers provide quality health care to 11 million Americans in 3,000 rural and inner-city communities in all 50 states, including 4.5 million people who are uninsured. As the number of uninsured Americans across the country continues to grow, the need for the services is especially great. 
   Community health centers recently touched Juan Ramon Centeno's life in Worcester, Massachusetts. Mr. Centeno was 54 years old when a bilingual nurse working with Great Brook Valley Health Center arrived at the public housing project where he lived to conduct health screenings. Mr. Centeno felt ill, but because he did not have insurance or resources for medical care, he had not sought care. The nurse found that his blood pressure was high, he had risk factors for diabetes, and had not received preventive health care for many years. 
   Health center physicians promptly examined Mr. Centeno and found him at high risk for a cardiovascular accident. This timely intervention enabled Mr. Centeno to receive good health care and to be placed on medication through the health center pharmacy, which enables patients to obtain prescription drugs at the reduced prices available under Medicaid. 
   Day in and day out, community health centers are providing life-saving services like these. Yet too often, the centers are struggling to obtain the resources they need. In Massachusetts, over a dozen community health centers currently face severe financial difficulties. Congress cut Medicare reimbursement rates for the centers in 1997, in spite of the fact that the number of people eligible for their services continues to rise. The result for many health centers has been bankruptcy, low morale among the health care professionals who are dedicated to serving the poor, and great concern in the communities that this needed access to health care will be lost. It is unacceptable for Congress to permit health centers that have proved so effective for so many years to suffer such severe financial difficulties, particularly in this time of prosperity. 
   The Senate made a wise commitment to double the funding over the next five years for medical research at the National Institutes of Health, and it has kept that commitment. By making a similar commitment to double the funding for community health centers--ten percent of the cost of the commitment we made to medical research--we can ensure that the benefits of modern medicine will remain available to millions of low-income working families. The Senate is at its best when it approves amendments like this one  on a bipartisan basis. I intend to do all I can to see that this year's final appropriations bill, and future appropriations bills, maintain our commitment to the extraordinary work of the nation's community health centers.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, before addressing the Senate on the matters before us in terms of education and the HHS appropriations bill, I commend my good friend from Iowa for a splendid presentation on energy policy as well as on prescription drugs. He talked with great knowledge and understanding about some of these advanced technologies which can make an enormous difference in terms of our region of the country, the Northeast. With the kinds of research he has supported and which the administration has tried to achieve with their budgets being denied by the other side, I am very hopeful that we can follow a number of those recommendations that he has made. I think they are sensible and responsible, and they can make an enormous difference on energy policy. 
   As always, he has summarized very completely the challenge that is before the American people on the question of prescription drugs. We had a brief debate last evening. We have been waiting some 17, 18 months to get action.  We still have not had the action by the respective committees. Given the fact that so many of our senior citizens are suffering, we want to move this process forward. 
   I join with the Senator from Iowa and our other colleagues, the Senator from Florida, Mr. GRAHAM, Senator ROBB, and our leader, Senator DASCHLE, who has done so much to advance this issue for us in the Senate, hoping that we can in the remaining days fashion and shape legislation that will have the support of this body. I think, as was evident last night, we still have a long way to go. 
   I regret very much that we are taking up the Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations bill for education, before we have completed action on the authorizing bill, the Elementary and Secondary Education At. I am distressed by this fact because we know that education is a national priority. 
   We have an opportunity this year to do our part to help local communities improve their schools by strengthening the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. And, to Democrats, this is must-pass legislation. 
   We have tried to make this a priority in the Senate. Six weeks ago we were debating education policy. That legislation was pulled. We did receive assurances that we would get back to the debate on education policy, but we have not had that opportunity to do so. I regret it. Parents regret it and students and teachers and those involved in the education of the children of this country should regret it. 
   We now have before us the funding mechanisms for education. We are really putting the cart before the horse. We are talking about the funding without having the debate on what the education policy should be. 
   That is not the way to deal with the Federal involvement and participation in sound education policy. We have differences about how to do what we ought to fund. We have a limited role, granted. Only 7 cents out of every dollar that is expended at the local level is actually provided by the Federal Government, but this is not an unimportant funding stream. 
   Historically, what we have tried to do is debate these issues, resolve these questions, develop a policy, and then fund that policy. But we have not had that opportunity. This is in spite of the fact that we have had a lot of bold statements about the importance of education. 
   We had our majority leader in January of this year saying:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   That is what I wish we had the opportunity to do. However, it has been 6 weeks since we had that legislation. We had it before the Senate 6 days, and 2 days we had debate only. We had eight amendments, and three of those were unanimously accepted. There were only 5 amendments that would not have been universally accepted by roll call votes. 
   We have our leader talking about the importance of education as a matter of national priority in January. At the Mayors Conference on January 29, he said:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to just be words. ..... 
   Education is number one on the agenda for Republicans in the Congress this year. .....  
   That was in 1999. 
   On February 1, 2000:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I've been majority leader. ..... And Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   Then he said on February 3, 2000:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. ..... Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   Congress Daily, April 20, 2000:  
   ..... LOTT said last week his top priorities in May include an agriculture sanctions bill, Elementary and Secondary Education Act reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills.  
   And we still haven't had the reauthorization. 
   On May 2, the majority leader was asked:  
   Senator, on ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? 
   Senator LOTT. No, I haven't scheduled a cloture vote. ..... But education is number one in the minds of the American people all across this country and every state, including my own state.  
   We are still waiting for that. We had 55 different amendments on the bankruptcy bill. Why aren't we saying that education is important? Why aren't we debating it today, or this afternoon, or next Monday, and having votes on it? We are not doing that and we ought to be doing that--It is the Nation's business. 
   So this is an important matter for policy makers and parents. When they hear the leaders of the Senate saying it is a priority and it is important, that we ought to do it, we have to do it, we are committed to doing it, yet we never do it, they have to ask are we serious about this issue. I think these are very serious questions: Are we going to find the time to debate what is on the minds of most families in this country? How their children are going to get the best possible education? What are we going to do at the local level, State level, and Federal level to try to be able to achieve it? This is a matter of very considerable concern. 
   Secondly, I remind our colleagues that education is only 2.3 percent of the Federal fiscal year 2000 budget. Defense is 15 percent. Interest on the debt is 12.3 percent. Entitlements are 12.6 percent. Medicare is 6.5 percent. Medicare is 11.1 percent. Social Security is 22.5 percent. Nondefense discretionary is 17.1 percent. 
   I don't think that is what American families think is a 
   priority. This institution is about prioritizing for the American people. How do we reflect their principal concerns in prioritizing and allocating resources in the budget? I daresay that American families want more than 2.3 percent of our Federal budget supporting education. 
   Now, there are those on the other side of the isle who do not want to see that. They say they don't want any Federal participation. Some on that side have advocated the abolition of the Department of Education. They have wanted to rescind money that we have appropriated. That has been their position, and I don't agree with it. 
   When you see that education is only 2.3 percent of the Federal budget--if you took any part of America and brought together a group of Americans and asked them how they wanted to allocate the Federal dollars, they will talk about national security, certainly, and that is an important priority, and Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security; those are obviously matters of priority. But they would also want to make sure we were going to do more in the area of education--more than 2.3 percent. If you take what we are doing at the K-through-12 level, it is below 1 percent. The remainder of the 2.3 percent includes higher education initiatives including Pell grants and Stafford loans. If you look at what we are doing for the 53 million American children going to school every day, we are at less than 1 percent--less than 1 percent of our budget. 
   I think we are talking about what most families want. They want a partnership between the Federal, State, and local governments to try to find out what programs are effective and what will enhance academic achievement and accomplishment for their children. Let's invest in those programs and let's have tough accountability measures to make sure we are going to get results. That is what this side of the aisle wants to do. 
   This chart is reflective of what has been happening. The Federal share of education funding has declined. This shows in 1980, elementary and secondary education--it was 11.9 percent in 1980, and it was down to 7.7 percent in 1999. The second part is higher education, 15.4 percent in 1980, and down to 10.7 percent in 1999. These indicators are going down when they ought to be going up. That is basically the issue of choice. 
   If you look at what is happening in terms of allocation of priorities in the elementary and secondary education, we are seeing the collapse of the national commitment in terms of educating children in this country. This is wrong. We are talking about priorities, and I think this is an issue that will have to be a matter before the country in this national election. 
   We have seen in the eighties and coming into the nineties a gradual decline in Congress assisting local communities, at a time when there has been an exploding population in K-12. There are scarcer resources going to  assist local communities, as we have been able to acquire an increasing knowledge and awareness about efforts that are actually working and enhancing academic achievement. 
   That is the dilemma. That is the dilemma with the budget resolution. The Republican budget resolution allocated a certain amount of resources for the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill. I admire the work that has been done by my colleagues, Senator HARKIN from Iowa and Senator SPECTER from Pennsylvania. In spite of their best efforts, because there has been a reduced allocation for their budget, there is going to be a cutback in many of the programs which make a vital difference in educating the children of this country. 
   It does not have to be that way. Included in this budget is a tax cut of some $718 billion over 10 years. When there is an allocation for a tax cut of $718 billion, there is going to be a short shrift of some programs, and in this instance it is education. The American people ought to understand that. I believe it is a higher priority to invest in children and in programs that work rather than having tax breaks for wealthy individuals and corporations of this country. 
   This ought to be an issue during the course of this election because if we are not going to see any departure or change in the leadership in the House or the Senate, we will continue to see this decline in assisting in education. That is irrefutable. 
   I am going to review for the Senate what has happened to some programs that have focused on the enhancement of education. There are cutbacks by the Republican leadership in allocating resources to the Senate appropriations subcommittee because they want a large tax break over a period of years. Democrats have some tax breaks, about a third of what the Republicans want. We have about a third of the cut, but we enhance the programs that are working. That is the major difference. 
   This is not a time for cuts in education. We need to increase our investment in education to ensure a brighter future for the Nation's children. Unfortunately, the bill approved by the House of Representatives is a major retreat from these priorities. It slashed funding for education by $2.9 billion below the President's request. The House bill is even worse than the bill that is before the Senate. Unless we are going to enhance some of these programs during the debate next week, then we cannot expect, when the House and Senate meet, that there is going to be a compromise that is not going to have a further diminution of our commitment than what is before the Senate at this time. 
   The House bill zeros out critical funds to help States turn around failing schools. It slashes funding for 21st century learning center programs by $400 million below the President's request, denying 900 communities the opportunity to provide $1.6 million for after-school activities to keep children off the streets, away from drugs and out of trouble, and help them with their studies. 
   Of all the requests for resources for programs by local communities, perhaps the highest number of requests is for after-school programs. They are working, they are effective, and they are keeping children out of trouble and enhancing academic achievement. These programs are being cut. 
   It eliminates the bipartisan commitment to help communities across the country reduce class size in the early grades. The federal Class Size Reduction program is making a difference. For example, in Columbus Ohio, class sizes in grades 1-3 have been reduced from 25 students per class to 15 students per class. We 
   need to invest more in this program, so that communities can continue to reduce class sizes. 
   It cuts funding for Title I by $166 million below the President's request, reducing or eliminating services to 260,000 educationally disadvantaged children to help them master the basics and meet high standards of achievement--260,000 fewer children will be able to benefit from that program. 
   It reduces the funding for the Reading Excellence Act by $26 million below the President's request, denying services to help 100,000 children become successful readers by the end of the third grade. What sense does that make? We ought to be enhancing our effort to ensure literacy among children in our country. We know what works. Instead, they are cutting back on that effort which has been very successful. 
   It slashes funding for Safe and Drug Free Schools by $51 million below the President's request, denying communities extra help to keep their students safe, healthy, and drug-free, with the development of conflict resolution programs to help schools and school teachers have more orderly, disciplined classrooms and schools. This program is used in schools all over this country. It is not going to resolve all the problems of school violence and school discipline, but it is enormously helpful and useful in trying to help teachers, parents, and officials in local communities to make schools safer and drug-free. 
   This bill does nothing to help communities meet the most urgent repair and modernization needs. 
   These needs are especially urgent in 5,000 schools across the country. We have the GAO study that says it will cost $112 billion to repair and modernize schools so that children go to school in buildings that are modern and safe, and not overcrowded. The administration has come up with a very modest program to help schools in this effort. This effectively turns its back on that effort. 
   It slashes funding for GEAR UP by $125 million below the President's request, denying more than 644,000 low-income middle and high school students the support they need for early college preparation and awareness activities. 
   It does nothing to increase the funding for Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants, so that more communities can recruit and retain better qualified teachers. 
   It slashes funding for Head Start by $600 million below the President's budget, denying 50,000 low-income children critical preschool services. 
   It slashes funding for dislocated workers by $181 million below the President's request, denying over 100,000 dislocated workers much-needed training, job search, and re-employment services. 
   It reduces funding for Adult Job Training by $93 million below the President's request, denying 37,2 and the second part is higher education 00 adults job training this year. 
   If this program goes through, in terms of trade with China, we know there are going to be sectors of our economy that are going to do very well, but there are others that are going to be adversely impacted. 
   Rather than cutting back and slashing training programs for workers who are going to be dislocated, we ought to be strengthening those programs, if we are going to be fair and have a fair and balanced policy on the issues of trade. We are going in the wrong direction. 
   It cuts youth opportunities grants by $200 million below the President's request, eliminating the proposed expansion to 20 new communities, reducing the current program by $75 million, and denying 40,000 of some of the most disadvantaged youth a bridge to the skills and opportunities of our strong economy and alternatives to welfare and crime. 
   It slashes Summer Jobs and Year-Round Youth Training by $21 million below the President's request, reducing the estimated number of low-income youth to be served by over 12,000. 
   What do you expect these young people are going to be involved in? You don't think they are going to look for other routes? And then we are going to have complaints about the problems in terms of an increase in violence and dangerous behavior when we are basically underserving and failing in terms of meeting these requirements--all because we are trying to save money for a tax break for wealthy individuals. That is the alternative. 
   The Senate bill does take some positive steps towards better funding for higher education. 
   It does increase the Pell grant by $350 to $3,650. This is enormously important. 
   The average income for those families is $9,000. If you take children with similar academic test results--not that test results are the only indicator; but let's take those--that makes it even more extraordinary because these children who are coming from low-income  and lower-middle income families don't have the advantages that many other children have in taking these prep courses for the SATs and other college aptitude tests. But if you take children with the same academic test results, the chance for children in the lower quarter percentile to continue in higher education is 25 percent of what it would be if they were in the top third of income. Mr. President, 82 percent of children in the top third income bracket continue in higher education. And for just the children who are eligible, 25 percent of them continue in higher education from the lower income bracket. 
   We are finding the disparity in education increasing. We made the efforts years ago, starting in the 1960s, with Republican and bipartisan support, to try to see that there was not going to be enormous disparity in the area of education. That is increasing now. The danger we are facing is whether we are going to see it further increase in the areas of technology. 
   There has been a funding increase of $1.3 billion in IDEA, which I strongly support. I remember offering the amendment last year when we had the tax bill. It was $780 billion over 5 years, to fully fund the IDEA. That would have taken a fifth of the tax bill. And it went down in a resounding defeat. It was a pretty clear indication that the Republican leadership won't fully fund IDEA for a tax cut, but will try to fund the IDEA even if it means cutting back in some of these very important programs that reach out to the neediest children. 
   Once again, the Republican leadership has put block grants ahead of targeted funding for education reforms. Block grants are the wrong approach. They prevent the allocation of scarce resources to the highest education priorities. They eliminate critical accountability provisions that ensure better results for all children. The block grant approach abandons the national commitment to improve education by encouraging proven effective reforms of public schools. 
   Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong direction for the Nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public schools. 
   The bill includes $2.7 billion more for the title VI block grant, but it eliminates the Federal commitment to reducing class size. It does nothing to guarantee funds for communities to address their urgent school repair and modernization needs. 
   It is unconscionable to block grant critical funds that are targeted to the neediest communities to reduce class size. Under the bipartisan Class Size Reduction Program that has received bipartisan support for the past 2 years, funds are distributed based on a formula that is targeted to school districts 80 percent by poverty and 20 percent by population. But under the title VI block grant, funding is distributed based solely on population--it includes no provisions to target the funds to high poverty districts. This is unacceptable, when it is often the neediest students that are in the largest classes. 
   The national class size average is just over 22 students per class. But, in many communities--especially in urban and rural communities--class sizes are much higher than the national average. 
   In 1998, the publication Education Week found that half of the elementary teachers in urban areas and 44 percent of the teachers in nonurban areas had classes with 25 or more students. 
   Next week, we will have the opportunity to address education in this pending Senate appropriations bill. 
   Democrats will offer amendments to address as many of these critical needs as possible. I intend to offer an amendment to increase funding for Title II of the Higher Education Act, to help communities recruit and train prospective teachers and put a qualified teacher in every classroom. In addition, I will offer an amendment to increase funding for skills training by $792 million to ensure the Nation's workers get the support they need in today's workplace. 
   Senator MURRAY will offer an amendment to continue the bipartisan commitment we have made over the last two years to help communities reduce class size in the early grades. 
   Senator HARKIN and Senator ROBB will offer an amendment to ensure that communities get the help they need to meet the most urgent repair and modernization programs. 
   Senator DODD will offer an amendment to increase funding for the 21st Century Learning Centers Program, so more children will have the opportunity to attend after-school activities. 
   Senator BINGAMAN will offer an amendment to help States turn around failing schools. 
   Senator REED will offer an amendment to increase funding for the GEAR UP programs, so more children will be able to attend college. 
   Other colleagues will offer additional amendments to increase the Nation's investment in education. The time is now to invest more in education. The Nation's children and families deserve no less. 
   Mr. President, I want to just take a moment of the Senate's time to speak on where we are on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The American people have waited more than 3 years for Congress to send the President a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects all patients and holds HMOs and other health plans accountable for their actions. 
   Every day the conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights fails to produce agreement on meaningful patient protections, 60,000 more patients endure added pain and suffering. More than 40,000 patients report a worsening of their condition as a result of health plan abuses. This is happening every single day we fail to take action. 
   By all accounts, Republicans are working amongst themselves on the Patients' Bill of Rights. They are working in the middle of the night, behind closed doors, to produce a partisan bill that will surely fail the test of true reform. The crocodile tears were flowing from the eyes of the Senate Republican leadership on June 8 when we took the bipartisan, House-passed Managed Care Consensus Act to the floor for its first Senate vote. That legislation, which passed the House with overwhelming bipartisan support last year, is a sensible compromise that extends meaningful protections to all patients and guarantees that health plans are held accountable when their abuses result in injury or death. 
   Democratic Conferees sent a letter to Senator NICKLES on June 13. In that letter, we reiterated that we remained ready to negotiate on serious proposals that provide a basis for achieving strong, effective protections. But the Assistant Majority Leader has not responded. The silence is deafening. 
   The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan legislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. And the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing adequate progress. 
   Make no mistake. We want a bill that can be signed into law this year. There is not much time left. We need to act now. The Republican leadership continues to refuse to guarantee meaningful protections to all Americans. They continue to delay and deny action on this critical issue. This debate is about real people. It is about women, children, and families. 
   This issue is a very basic and fundamental issue. It is whether doctors, nurses, and families are going to make the medical decisions for patients free of the decisions of the accountants for the HMOs. That is what this bill is really all about. That is why over 300 organizations support our particular proposal: patients organizations, every women's organization, every child's advocate, every cancer prevention and treatment organization is for us, every medical organization--including strong support from the American Medical Association. None of these organizations support the Senate Republican program or the lack of progress in the conference. 
   A third of all the Republicans in the House of Representatives supported the Dingell-Norwood bill. Now we have effectively 49 Members of the Senate who are supporting the Dingell-Norwood legislation. To just get a majority, one would think the changes that would have to be made in this would be extremely easy. I don't think they are that complex. But we still have the Republican leadership denying us the chance to do it. 
   I am always interested in the silence on the other side. I asked: In this Patients' Bill of Rights, which we have basically supported on our side, which one of these guarantees do you not  want to provide for your families and for your constituents? 
   The first one is to protect all patients with private insurance. This is the difference. Under the Democratic proposal, there are 161 million Americans who are covered. Under the Senate Republican program, there are only 48 million. Under the bipartisan House of Representatives program, it is 161 million. We ought to be able to decide that pretty easily. Do we want to cover everyone, which is 161 million, or are we going to cover only 48 million? If you put people together in a room, they have to be able to come out with some number. The Republican bill leaves out millions of Americans. I find it absolutely extraordinary to think 
   that we wouldn't provide protections for all Americans. 
   Do we want to leave out the 23 to 25 million State and local employees--teachers, firefighters, police officers, public health nurses, doctors, garbage collectors, et cetera? Do we want to leave them out? They were left out of the Senate bill sponsored by the Republicans. We included them. 
   Do you want to leave out those who are the self-employed--farmers, child care providers, cab drivers, people who work for companies that don't provide insurance, contract workers, workers who are between jobs and unemployed? We cover them, 12 to 15 million people. The Republican bill does not cover them. 
   The bipartisan legislation that we support and which we voted on in the Senate on June 8 covers everyone. But the Senate Republican leadership says ``no'' to farmers, truck drivers, police officers, teachers, home day care providers, fire fighters, and countless others who buy insurance on their own or work for state or local governments. Republican conferees steadfastly refuse to cover all Americans. Their flawed approach leaves out two-thirds of those with private health insurance--more than 120 million Americans. 
   The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed by patients across the country. Yet, the Republican leadership is adopting the practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use themselves to delay and deny patients the care they need. It's just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed reforms, as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care. 
   We have listened to statements on the other side that, ``This is all politics. This is all politics.'' We are asking: What is politics, to try to include everyone? What is politics is not including them and being in the debt of the HMOs and the industry. That is the politics. 
   So we ask, what is it that we don't want to provide--which one of over twenty different protections? Are we going to deny access to specialists? Are we not going to permit clinical trials? Are we going to refuse women access to OB/GYNs? What about prescription drugs that doctors give; are we not going to guarantee that? Or are we going to prohibit the gag rule so doctors can give the most accurate information on various treatments? I hope. Are we going to ensure external and internal appeals as well as accountability? Are we going to ensure emergency room access? I would think so. Which of these protections do the Republicans not want to guarantee to the American people? That is the question we are asking. The American people are entitled to an answer. Three hundred organizations that represent the American people say they are entitled to it. We ought to be doing something about it. 
   Every day, we find out that Americans are being harmed. We were able to get bipartisan legislation through the House of Representatives. At the dead end of our conference, the courageous Congressmen, Mr. NORWOOD and Mr. GANSKE, came over and indicated that they believe we are not making progress. They support our efforts in the Senate. Two prominent doctors who happen to be Republicans strongly support our effort in the Senate to get action. 
   We reject the concept that this is just a political ploy. It is interesting to me, having been here for some time, that whenever you agree with the other side, it is wonderful and you are a statesman. If you differ, you are a politician; it is done for political purposes. We have listened to that all the time. We heard it last night on prescription drugs. We heard it on hate crimes. We heard it with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The American people understand the importance of this legislation. We want to give assurances to the American people, we are not letting up on this issue. We are going to press this issue on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We are going to press it, and press it, and press it until we get the job done. 
   We are going to do the same with prescription drugs, so our 
   friends on the other side ought to get familiar with it. Just as we are going to come back to the issue of minimum wage, we are going to come back to it, and back to it, and back to it, if you want to dust off your speeches already and say that that is politics. 
   The idea of guaranteeing someone who works 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, that they are not going to live in poverty is a fairness issue which the American people understand. We ought to guarantee that minimum wage for work in America. You can name it or call it anything you want, as long as we vote on it and get it and make sure they get the fair increase they deserve. 
   I thought we would have the chance to get into the debate and discussion on a number of these issues, but we are not having that opportunity today. I look forward to debating the issues the first of the week. 
   Mr. President, Congress can pass bipartisan legislation that provides meaningful protections for all patients and guarantees accountability when health plan abuse results in injury or death. The question is ``will we''? 
   The American people are waiting for an answer.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a special honor for me today to pay tribute to the forty-seven outstanding individuals who have received this year's ``Heroes Among Us'' Award from the Boston Celtics. 
   These honorees are men and women of all ages who have chosen different career paths. What they all have in common is the extraordinary contributions they have made to our community. They are role models for us all. They demonstrate the fundamental importance of the individual in our society, by proving that each person can truly make a difference. All of these heroes saw a need to achieve change or take other action in order to improve the lives of others. 
   This past season was the third season in a row that the Boston Celtics have honored one or more these heroes at home games for the special contributions they have made to our society. In those three seasons, the Celtics have honored 114 men and women with the ``Heroes Among Us'' Award, which is one of many programs that the Boston Celtics Charitable Foundation has initiated. The Foundation is dedicated to improving the lives of the youths of New England through innovative outreach initiatives. The Boston Celtic  players actively participate in these programs in many ways--from washing cars, to raising funds for books for the Boston Public Schools, to cleaning up sites for the development of homes for low and middle income families in Boston. 
   I commend the Celtics for their commitment to improving the quality of life for the members of our community, and I commend all of these ``Heroes Among Us'' for their dedication and their inspiring leadership. I ask unanimous consent that the names of this year's 47 ``Heroes Among Us'' may be printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this resolution, S. Res. 303, which I introduced with Senator GRAMS and Senator LEAHY on May 4, expresses our deep concern about the continuing plight of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky. The resolution was approved unanimously by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 7. 
   Mr. Babitsky, an accomplished journalist working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, still faces serious charges in Russia after being held captive by Russian authorities, beaten, and detained in a ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators. 
   The resolution asks the Russian Government to drop its trumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky, and provide a full accounting of his detention.  
   In addition, the resolution states that the Senate condemns harassment and intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and other news organizations. It calls upon the Russian Government to adhere fully to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which calls for freedom of expression worldwide. 
   For 10 years, Mr. Babitsky has helped fulfill the mission of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to provide Russian listeners with objective and uncensored reporting. But Russian authorities, displeased with Mr. Babitsky's courageous reporting on the war in Chechnya, accused him of assisting the Chechen forces and ordered him arrested in the battle zone last January. 
   After six weeks in captivity, Mr. Babitsky was released, and then jailed again by Russian officials for carrying false identity papers. He says the papers were forced upon him. After an international outcry arose over his case, he was again released. But he still is not allowed to leave Moscow, and he still faces charges for carrying false papers and aiding the Chechens. 
   In addition, Russian authorities have continued to condemn Radio Liberty's coverage of the Chechen conflict, and have suggested that Radio Liberty should be forced to abandon its facilities in Moscow and throughout Russia. The authorities have taken steps to censor Radio Liberty and to intimidate its correspondents and others. 
   The United States should respond vigorously to this harassment and intimidation. The Russian government should drop its trumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky. I urge my colleagues to support the resolution.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this amendment to prohibit OSHA from moving forward with its ergonomics standard. OSHA has been attempting to implement an ergonomics standard for the past 10 years. But each year, Congress has delayed the standard. 
   As long ago as 1990, the Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole in the Bush Administration called ergonomic injuries ``one of the nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and health illnesses.'' Since that time, over 2,000 scientific studies have examined the issue, including a comprehensive review by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   All of these studies tell us the same thing--it's long past time to enact an ergonomics standard to protect the health of American workers and prevent these debilitating injuries in the workplace. 
   Each year, over 1.7 million workers suffer from ergonomic injuries and nearly 600,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of ergonomic injuries suffered on the job. Ergonomic injuries account for over one-third of all serious job-related injuries. 
   These injuries are painful and often crippling. They range from carpal tunnel syndrome, to severe back injuries, to disorders of the muscles and nerves. 
   Carpal tunnel syndrome keeps workers off the job longer than any other workplace injury. This injury alone causes workers to lose an average of more than 25 days, compared to 17 days for fractures and 20 days for amputations. 
   Ergonomics is also a women's issue, because women workers are disproportionately affected by these injuries. Women make up 46 percent of the overall workforce--but in 1998 they accounted for 64 percent of repetitive motion injuries and 71 percent of carpal tunnel cases. 
   The good news is that these injuries are preventable. The National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health have both found that obvious adjustments in the workplace can prevent workers from suffering ergonomic injuries and illnesses. 
   Congress has a responsibility to ensure that the nation's worker protection laws keep pace with changes in the workforce. Early in this century, the industrial age created deadly new conditions for large numbers of the Nation's workers. 
   When miners were killed or maimed in explosion after explosion, we enacted the Federal Coal Mine Safety and Health Act. As workplace hazards became more subtle, but no less dangerous, we responded by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act to address hazards such as asbestos and cotton dust. Now, as the workplace moves from the industrial to the information age, our laws must evolve again to address the emerging dangers to American workers. Ergonomic injuries are one of the principal hazards of the modern American workplace--and we owe it to the 600,000 workers who suffer serious ergonomic injuries each year to address this problem now. 
   Ergonomic injuries affect the lives of working men and women across the country. They injure nurses who regularly lift and move patients, and construction workers who lift heavy objects. They harm assembly line workers whose task consists of constant repetitive motions. They injure data entry workers who type on computer keyboards all day long. Even if we are not doing these jobs ourselves, we all know people who do. They are mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters, sons and daughters, and neighbors--and they deserve our help. 
   We need to help workers like Beth Piknick from Massachusetts, who was an intensive care nurse for 21 years before a preventable back injury required her to undergo a spinal fusion operation and spend two years in rehabilitation. Although she wants to work, she can no longer do so. In her own words, ``The loss of my ability to take care of patients led to a clinical depression. *.*.* My ability to take care of patients--the reason I became a nurse--is gone. My injury--and all the losses it has entailed--were preventable.'' 
   We need to help workers like Elly Leary, an auto assembler at the now-closed General Motors Assembly plant in Framingham, Massachusetts. Like many, many of her co-workers, she received a series of ergonomic injuries--including carpal tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Like others, she tried switching hands to do her job. She tried varying the sequence of the routine. She even bid on other jobs. But nothing helped. Today, years after her injury, when she wakes up in the morning, her hands are in a claw-like shape. To get them to open, she has to run hot water on them. 
   We need to help workers like Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at General Dynamics in Quincy, Massachusetts in the mid-1980's. He suffered a career-ending back injury when he was told to install a 75 pound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try to work, he found that on many days, he could not endure the lifting and the use of heavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented him from participating in basic activities. But the loss that hurt the most was having to tell his children that they couldn't sit on his lap for more than a few minutes, because it was too painful. To this day, he cannot sit for long without pain. 
   We need to protect workers like Wendy Scheinfeld of Brighton, Massachusetts, a model employee in the insurance industry. Colleagues say she often put in extra hours at work to ``get the job done.'' She developed carpal tunnel syndrome from using the computer at work. As a result, Wendy has lost the use of her hands, and is now permanently unable to do her job, drive a car, play the cello, or shop for groceries. 
   Even though it may be too late to help Beth, Elly, Charley and Wendy, workers just like them deserve an ergonomics standard to protect them from such debilitating injuries. 
   Some in Congress argue that OSHA is rushing the process too much. But let's review the record. OSHA's rulemaking effort began ten years ago in the Bush Administration under Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole. Years of study and development have laid the groundwork for this proposed standard. OSHA held nine stakeholder meetings following its Advance Notice of Public Rulemaking in 1992. OSHA also held 11 best-practices conferences between 1997 and the end of 1999. Since November, 1999, there has been a 100-day pre-hearing comment period and nine weeks of public hearings. 
   The Agency is currently in the midst of a 30-day comment period on an economic analysis and a 60-day post-hearing comment period on the proposed standard. There will be another public hearing on July 7. All told, the public will have had over 8 months of opportunity for public comment since the publication of the proposed standard last November. After 10 years of attempting to address this serious problem, this amendment would delay OSHA's standard yet again. 
   Last fall, when we considered the Labor-HHS appropriations bill, opponents of an ergonomics standard wanted us to wait for the National Academy of Sciences to complete a further study before OSHA establishes a standard. But it was just another delaying tactic. As we said then, over 2,000 studies on ergonomics have already been carried out. 
   In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health reviewed 600 of the most important of those studies. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the studies again. Congress even asked the General Accounting Office to conduct its own study. 
   The National Academy of Sciences found that work clearly causes ergonomic injuries. They concluded that ``the positive relationship between the occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders and the conduct of work is clear.'' The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health agreed. They found ``strong evidence of an association between MSDs and certain work-related physical factors.'' 
   The Academy also found that ergonomics programs are effective. As the Academy found, ``Research clearly demonstrates that specific interventions can reduce the reported rate of musculoskeltal disorders for workers who perform high-risk tasks.'' 
   Finally, the GAO concluded that ergonomics is good business. Its report declared, ``Officials at all the facilities  we visited believed their ergonomics programs yielded benefits, including reductions in workers' compensation costs.'' 
   The truth is that the Labor Department's ergonomics rule is based on sound science. In addition to the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, medical and scientific groups have expressed widespread support for moving forward with an ergonomics rule. 
   The American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine, representing over 7,000 physicians, has stated that ``there is * * * no reason for OSHA to delay the rule-making process while the NAS panel conducts its review.'' The American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, representing 16,000 surgeons, the American Association of Occupational Health Nurses, representing 13,000 nurses, and the American Public Health Association, representing 50,000 members, all agree that an ergonomics rule is necessary and based on sound science. 
   Many members of the business community support ergonomics protections, because good ergononics is good business. Currently, businesses pay out $15 to 20 billion each year in workers' compensation costs related to these disorders. Ergonomic injuries account for one dollar in every three dollars spent for workers' compensation. If businesses reduce these injuries, they will reap the benefits of lower costs, greater productivity, and decreased absenteeism. 
   That's certainly true for Tom Albin of Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, who said, ``Our experience has shown that incorporating good ergonomics into our manufacturing and administrative processes can be effective in reducing the number and severity of work-related musculoskeletal disorders, which not only benefits our employees, but also makes good business sense.'' 
   Similarly, Peter Meyer of Sequins International Quality Braid has said, ``We have reduced our compensation claims for carpal tunnel syndrome through an effective ergonomics program. Our productivity has increased dramatically, and our absenteeism has decreased drastically.'' 
   This ergonomics rule is necessary, because only one-third of employers currently have effective ergonomics programs. 
   Further delay is unacceptable, because it leaves workers unprotected and open to career-ending injuries. Since OSHA began working on this standard in 1990, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered serious injuries from workplace ergonomic hazards. 
   It is time to stop these injuries--and stop all the misinformation too. This year's attack on OSHA's ergonomics standard is just the latest in a long series of attacks against this important worker protection measure. 
   American employees deserve greater protection, not further delay. It's time to stop breaking the promise made to workers, and start supporting this long overdue ergonomics standard now.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to speak about one of the most important parts of the proposed aid package for Colombia, the human rights conditions. 
   Narcotics traffickers, rebel forces, and paramilitary groups present a clear threat to democracy and economic development in Colombia. The bill before us provides $934 million to help the Colombian Government meet this threat. About 75 percent of this aid is for military equipment, training, and logistical support. The Colombian Government says it needs this military assistance--especially the helicopters--to enable its armed forces to retake the southern part of the country from the narcotraffickers and the rebel forces who protect and profit from their activities. 
   Like my colleagues, I am interested in ensuring that this aid does not contribute to human rights abuses. While allegations of human rights violations by military personnel have decreased in the past several years, the State Department's 1999 Country Report on Human Rights Practices concluded that the Colombian Government's human rights record ``remained poor'' and that ``armed forces and the police committed numerous, serious violations of human rights throughout the year.'' The Colombian Armed Forces are consistently and credibly linked to illegal paramilitary groups, which are now responsible for the majority of serious human rights abuses in Colombia, including an estimated 153 massacres in 1999 which claimed 889 lives. These paramilitary groups have stepped up their own illegal narcotics operations, which, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration, include drug trafficking abroad. 
   When I met with President Pastrana last December, he emphasized his commitment to improving the human rights performance of the Colombian Armed Forces, which have a long history of human rights violations. The  bill before us makes this commitment the basis for new military assistance to Colombia. The bill requires the Secretary of State to certify that the Colombian Government has met or is meeting four conditions before new military aid can be provided. 
   The first condition requires the Secretary of State to certify that the President of Colombia has directed in writing that Colombian Armed Forces personnel who are credibly alleged to have committed gross violations of human rights will be brought to justice in Colombia's civilian courts, in accordance with the 1997 ruling of Colombia's Constitutional Court. 
   Currently, the military justice system does not aggressively or consistently pursue cases against high-ranking military personnel accused of human rights abuses. The 1999 State Department Human Rights Report states that ``authorities rarely brought officers of the security forces and the police charged with human rights offenses to justice, and impunity remains a problem.'' It concludes that the ``workings of the military judiciary lack transparency and accountability, contributing to a generalized lack of confidence in the system's ability to bring human rights abusers to justice.'' 
   To rectify this problem, in August 1997, Colombia's Constitutional Court ruled that ``crimes against humanity'' could never be considered acts of military service and that military personnel alleged to have committed such crimes must be prosecuted in civilian courts. However, the military has consistently challenged civilian court jurisdiction. The military has retained jurisdiction by threatening government investigators and by arguing that alleged violations of human rights, such as collusion with paramilitary groups, are simply acts of omission. Acts of omission are considered acts of military service, as if they were simple dereliction of duty. Most importantly, the military continues to retain jurisdiction in human rights by relying on the support of a pro-military block within the Superior Judicial Council, the body responsible for determining the jurisdiction of individual cases.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will sum up where we are on these two extremely important issues, one involving safety in the workplace. 
   The whole issue of ergonomics addresses the most important worker safety issue in the workplace. Now we have an amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, my dear friend, who wants to undermine what has been a 10-year review and a study about how we can provide protection for workers in the workplace who are affected by ergonomics. 
   As has been pointed out, this whole issue was raised by Secretary Dole in the Bush administration who called ergonomic injuries one of the Nation's most debilitating across-the-board worker safety and health issues. Since that time, there have been over 2,000 studies on ergonomics carried out. 
   In 1997, NIOSH, the principal agency of Government that studies these issues, reviewed 600 of the most important of these studies. They made recommendations. In 1998, the National Academy of Sciences reviewed the studies again and again, and they came to the same conclusion. The fact is, the science is clear. The question is whether we will have the will and the determination to take steps to protect our workers. We know what needs to be done. The subject has been studied. Now we have the chance to take a step to protect American workers. 
   These are the facts: 35 percent of the most harmful injuries in the workplace are ergonomic injuries. That is what is happening today. More than 600,000 workers are affected. When you look at who are disproportionately harmed by ergonomic hazards, in lost time, 67 percent who lost working time from repetitive motion injuries were women, and those who lost work time for carpal tunnel injuries were women again, 77 percent. This is a woman's issue; this is a worker's issue. 
   The science is overwhelming. The fact is, historically we have been prepared to take actions to make the workplace safe. We had the great development of our mining systems, and we passed mine safety legislation. Now we need to pass legislation to protect American workers in this area. 
   It has been studied, restudied, and studied again. Once again, we are being asked to discard the various studies and reviews and put the profits of the private sector ahead of the interests of the workers. That is wrong. That is the issue: Are we going to stand for workers or are we going to stand for the profits of the industries in this country? 
   On the second issue, Medicare, I was there, like most of the Members of the Senate, when the President of the United States, in his State of the Union Address, asked the Congress of the United States to pass a prescription drug program based upon Medicare that would deal with the incredible hardship of so many of our seniors. 
   I was also here in 1964 and 1965 when the Senate eventually passed the Medicare program. This issue was discussed during that period of time: Were we going to pass a prescription drug program. The judgment at that time was: Let's pass in Medicare what they are doing in the private sector. A great majority of the private sector, over 90 percent, did not include a prescription drug program, so we did not pass one in the Medicare program. At that time, less than 3 percent of every dollar expended was used for prescription drugs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 2 more minutes. 
   Now it is 20 to 30 percent, as the Senator from Florida has pointed out. We now know this is absolutely an essential need for our seniors. How much more does it have to be studied? 
   With all due respect to the Finance Committee, they had a 
   whole set of hearings last year. We did not have any legislation reported out from the Finance Committee. We have not had any legislation reported in the final weeks of this Congress. We have no commitment that the chairman of the Finance Committee or the Finance Committee members will say: We will have a prescription drug bill on the floor of the Senate for you in July--absolutely not. 
   We have a well-thought-out program that can make the difference for our senior citizens. When Medicare was passed, it was a fundamental commitment by the Federal Government to senior citizens: Work hard, play by the rules, and your health care needs will be attended to. That was the commitment in 1964 and 1965. 
   Every day we fail to pass a prescription drug benefit, we are violating that commitment. Every single day, we find our seniors are in pain and agony and suffering irreparable damage, in many cases because they cannot afford a prescription drug program. That is a fact. That promise is being broken every day because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. This is wrong. This is fundamentally wrong. Every Member of the Senate knows it in their hearts. Every family in America knows it is wrong. Certainly, every senior citizen knows it is wrong. 
   We have a chance to do something right. We have a chance to put the health care of our senior citizens ahead of the profits of the private special interests.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 1 more minute. 
   That is what this vote is all about. For whom are we going to stand? This is the vote on prescription drugs. This is a program that is tied to the Medicare system. Our elderly people understand Medicare. They believe in Medicare. They know the need for prescription drugs. It is as simple and fundamental as that. It is comprehensive, it is all inclusive, it is affordable, and it will meet the needs of our senior citizens. 
   That is the vote we are going to have in the Senate, and we should meet our commitments to our senior citizens. We know what their needs are. We should meet them. We have that opportunity tonight. Let us not fail them. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to a lover of music and an institution on Boston radio who recently passed away at age 68. In his long and brilliant career, Robert J. Lurtsema touched vast numbers of people in the Boston area with his ``deep organ voice'' and his love of classical music. For twenty-nine years, he was host and producer of ``Morning Pro Musica'' for radio station WGBH in our city, and he was widely loved and admired. 
   A native of Cambridge, Massachusetts, Robert J., as he was known to many, graduated from Boston University School of Journalism. He joined WGBH in 1971 as a weekend host, and after four months became the host and producer of ``Morning Pro Musica.'' In addition to the renown he won through his dedicated listeners, he has composed chamber music, the music for an award-winning documentary film, and the music used in Julia Child's cooking program on PBS. 
   Robert J.'s passion and devotion to classical music extended well beyond his broadcast responsibilities. He served with distinction as a board member for many New England musical organizations. He will be deeply missed for his dedication to the arts, and long remembered for his extraordinary service to the people of New England.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce a bill to reauthorize the Corporation for National Service, along with 25 co-sponsors from both sides of the aisle. 
   In 1993 Congress created the Corporation for National Service to enhance opportunities for all Americans to participate in contributing to their communities by actively engaging in local service programs. Community service should not be an option only for those who can afford to perform an important job without pay. It should be an opportunity for everyone. Every week, I have the privilege of reading with a third grade student in Washington, and I have seen her make very impressive progress during the last three years. I know first-hand that those who engage in community service gain as much as they give when they participate. 
   The Corporation for National Service is expanding these opportunities for service by offering stipends and education awards to AmeriCorps members, and stipends to senior volunteers. It also offers professional development opportunities to teachers and identified leader schools, who will mentor other schools interested in beginning to pursue service learning. In the last five years, 150,000 adults have given a year of service to communities across the country as AmeriCorps members. 500,000 senior citizens each year provide service to their communities in Foster Grandparent Programs, Senior Companion Programs, and the Retired Senior Volunteer Corps. In addition, over 1 million school children each year participate in service learning programs. 
   The national service movement has also encouraged businesses to become actively involved in improving their communities. Local business leaders have stepped up to the plate to sponsor service corps programs, to offer technical support for existing programs, and to use community service as a way to work with local schools. 
   As Robert Kennedy said, in words that became the hallmark of his life, ``Some people see things as they are and say why. I dream things that never were, and say why not?'' Because of community service, more and more citizens are asking that question every day in communities across the country. 
   In Massachusetts, under the leadership of Maureen Curley and her talented Board of Directors, the Massachusetts Service Alliance has helped citizens to act against the injustices that they see around them. From City Year and Peace Games in Boston to Greenfield READS and the Barnstable Land Trust, they have created new opportunities to tutor, to provide useful information on health care, to fight domestic violence, to help senior citizens live independent lives, and to repair and revitalize their communities in many other ways. They have found that many citizens in their communities are eager to be involved and to stay involved, and they have been successful in creating large numbers of opportunities for that involvement. Last year, 180,000 citizens contributed 3.5 million hours of service in 140 communities across the state. Programs such as City Year, which began as a dream of Michael Brown and Alan Khazei in Boston, has a program in 13 sites across the country, engaging over 2,000 Corps members in service. We will welcome their newest site here in Washington in September. 
   This bipartisan bill that we offer today will allow these programs to continue to grow and enable many more Americans to participate in improving their communities and building a stronger America. 
   Our former colleague, Dan Coats, has written an eloquent article in support of AmeriCorps. The article appeared in today's edition of The Hill, and I ask unanimous consent that it be made a part of the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, and I commend my colleagues, Senator MURRAY and Senator SNOWE, for introducing it again this year. This is an issue of basic fairness for all of the women who have voluntarily dedicated their lives to protecting our country or who are dependents of military service members. 
   The current ban on abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas discriminates against women who are serving abroad in our armed forces. This ban is not fair to our servicewomen, and it is unacceptable. They are willing to risk their lives for our country, and it is wrong for our country to ask them to risk their lives to obtain the health care that is their constitutional right as American citizens. 
   Abortion is illegal in many of the countries where our servicewomen are based. The current ban on abortions endangers their health by limiting their access to reproductive care. Without proper care, abortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling procedure. It is unacceptable to expose our dedicated servicewomen to risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death, when appropriate care can easily be made available to them. 
   Over 100,000 American women live on military bases overseas and rely on military hospitals for their health care. They should be able to depend on military base hospitals for all of their medical needs. They should not be forced to choose between lower quality medical care in a foreign country, or travelling back to the United States for the care they need. Forcing women to travel to another country or return to the United States to obtain an abortion imposes an unfair burden on them and can lead to excessive delays and increased risk. 
   Servicewomen in the United States do not face these burdens, since quality health care in non-military hospital facilities is readily available. It is unfair to ask those serving abroad to suffer a financial penalty and expose themselves to health risks that could be life-threatening. 
   Congress has an obligation to provide safe medical care for those serving our country both at home and abroad. This amendment does not ask that these procedures be paid for with federal funds. It simply asks that servicewomen overseas have the same access to all medical services as their counterparts at home. 
   Every woman in the United States has a constitutionally-guaranteed  right to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. A woman's decision to have an abortion is a very difficult and extremely personal one, and it is wrong to impose an even heavier burden on women who serve our country overseas. It is time for Congress to end this double-standard for women serving abroad. I urge the Senate to support the Murray-Snowe amendment and correct this grave injustice.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself the remaining time. 
   Mr. President, hate crimes are a national disgrace, and they attack everything for which this country stands. We, as a Congress, must take a clear and unequivocal stand. We have the opportunity to do so this afternoon. It ought to be bipartisan, and it ought to be an overwhelming statement of law.  
   As a country and as a people, we are committed to equal protection under the law. We all take pride in that. We do not say we have equal protection under the law only if you are a white male. We do not say we have equal protection under the law if you have no disability. We are not going to say we have equal protection under the law only if you are ``straight.'' 
   We say equal protection under the law must apply to all Americans. That is what this is about. The Hatch amendment is a study. We are beyond studying. The American people want action on hate crimes. That is what our amendment does, very simply. 
   We ought to have the support of the overwhelming majority of the Members of this body. Hate crimes are rooted in hatred and bigotry. If America is ever going to be America, we should root out hatred and bigotry. We do not have all of the answers, but we ought to be able to use the full force of our power to make sure we are going to do everything we can--that we are not going to stand alongside but are going to be involved in freeing this country from hate crimes. Our amendment will do so.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for addressing this issue on this Monday afternoon. We generally, on Monday afternoons as well as on Friday afternoons, have less heavy matters before our body. 
   This afternoon we have had a very impressive series of statements that have urged us to take the action on tomorrow to move ahead and pass strong hate crimes legislation. I listened earlier to a number of our colleagues. I thought there were many excellent statements, which I am hopeful our Members will have a chance to review in the early morning in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. These statements have been absolutely superb. We have had a wide variety of different Members from different backgrounds and experiences, different political viewpoints, speak on this issue. That is the way it should be because we are talking about a matter of fundamental importance for our society and our country. We are talking about what our country is really about, what steps we are prepared to take to make America, America. 
   We have shown that over a period of time, certainly since the end of the Civil War, this Congress has taken steps to guarantee the protection of constitutional rights, going back to 1866. In the more modern time, we enacted civil rights legislation in the early 1960s, after the extraordinary presence of Dr. King who awakened the conscience of our Nation in the latter part of the 1950s and early part of the 1960s. We went ahead and took action in 1964 on what was known as the Public Accommodation Act. We were asked: Will the kinds of enforcement mechanisms stand up under constitutional challenge? And they did. 
   Then, in 1965, we took action in order to preserve the right to vote for our citizens. Now it seems almost extraordinary that a large number of Americans were denied the right to vote. At that time, it was debated for some time. We took strong steps to ensure that America was going to be America in terms of the right to vote. In 1968, we had our Fair Housing Act to make sure that citizens whose skin was a different color were not going to be denied the opportunity to purchase homes. We took action in 1968 to protect that right. It wasn't very effective. We had to come back and revisit that again in 1988. Still, the progress went on. In 1988, we passed legislation to protect the rights of the disabled in our society. We had made some progress with what is known as Title VII over time, but the Americans with Disabilities Act was the legislation that established protections. We were saying to the American people--and the American people supported it--that if individuals have a disability, they should not be discriminated against in our society. 
   This is what we are talking about. We are talking about forms of discrimination. Discrimination is rooted in the basic emotion of hatred, of distrust, and of bigotry. We have seen it manifested in race relations in our country. Hatred, distrust and bigotry have also been reflected in other ways: on the basis of religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, and disability. We freed ourselves from discrimination based on national origin with the 1965 Immigration Act. The Immigration Act had certain rules for those who came from the Asian Pacific Island triangle. We only permitted less than 150 Asians to come onto our shores prior to 1965. Then we also had what was called the national origin quota system which discriminated against people who came from a number of the European countries. All of this is part of our national history. 
   One of the amazing and important aspects of the progress that America has made in recent time is in trying to free us from the stains of discrimination. We are talking not only about those who have been discriminated against but those who have perpetrated the discrimination. 
   We are talking about a continuum of this Nation attempting to define what America ought to be--a nation free from the forms of discrimination and hatred and bigotry. That is what distinguishes hate crimes from other criminal activities. Crimes based upon hatred and bigotry wound not only the individual, but they also wound and scar an entire community. 
   Hate crimes occur on a daily basis in the United States of America. Numerous hate crime incidents have been mentioned by our colleagues and illustrated time and again. According to FBI statistics, nearly one hate crime is committed every hour. 
   My colleagues and I want to take action that will move this country forward and free us from those acts of hatred that divide us. 
   We can't solve all of these problems, but there is no reason, when we have violence in our society, that those who are charged with protecting the Constitution of the United States ought to be standing on the sidelines when violence based upon discrimination is taking place in the United States of America. Why should we limit ourselves--those who have a responsibility--from helping and assisting those who are involved in local enforcement and State law enforcement, particularly when we are talking about these hate crimes against women in our society? 
   An individual was charged in Yosemite this past year with the murder of four women. He told the police investigators he had fantasized about killing women for three decades. A gay, homeless man in Richmond, VA, was found with a severed head and left at the top of a footbridge in James River Park near a popular gay meeting place. In Crystal Lake, IL, a Japanese American shopowner was shot to death outside of Chicago, based upon the fact of discrimination against Asians. Three synagogues in Sacramento, in July of 1999, were destroyed by arson on the basis of anti-Semitism. 
   These things are happening today. With all due respect to my friend and colleague from Utah, his legislation is basically to have a further study about whether these kinds of activities are taking place. This amendment that he has, on page 1, talks about studies, the collection of data, the data to be collected. Then it shows the number of relevant offenses, the percentage of offenses prosecuted. It continues on with the identification of trends. Then it has provisions for grants to local communities, and eligibility, and grants of $100,000.  
   We have had the FBI doing the study for the last 10 years. We have the figures that the FBI has produced. The one thing that the FBI has testified to, and is very clear about in their studies, is they believe it is vastly underestimating the amount of hate crimes that are taking place, because in so many instances there isn't the local training or prioritizing of hate crimes by local communities and State communities in order to collect the information or data on this. 
   So we do know that this is happening today. It is happening in increasing numbers. The reports that we do have basically underestimate the amount of action and activity that is taking place, and the States themselves--some of them--have taken action. But very few, if any, have taken the kind of comprehensive action we are talking about. 
   There are enormous gaps in the activities of the States in the kinds of protections they are providing. Others have talked about it, and I am glad to get into the various kinds of protections that we are talking about here, the reasons for this legislation. Again, I say, this is our opportunity--and tomorrow--to say whether we are going to be serious about taking action in this area of bigotry and hatred that is focused on particular groups in our society. We have been willing to take action in the past. We were willing to do it in the past. I have mentioned six or eight instances when this Congress thought there was such a compelling reason for us to take the action that we went ahead and took that action in order to try to do something about discrimination in our society. 
   We have the same issue in a different form before the Senate now. In the early 1960s, we had discrimination against blacks because we were not going to permit them to vote. We passed legislation and then implementing legislation. We said we were not going to protect discrimination and bigotry, discriminating against blacks in the areas of housing. We did the same regarding the disabled on the Americans With Disabilities Act. We made progress on discrimination against women in our society, and we have made progress as well in terms of understanding the various challenges on freeing ourselves from some forms of discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation--although we have made very little in that 
   area. 
   The question is not the issue on sexual orientation. It is about violence against individual Americans. That is what it is about when you come down to it. It is violence based on bigotry. You can read long books about the origins of hatred and the origins of bigotry and the origins of prejudice and how they develop against individuals or individual groups. Many of them are different in the way that they did develop. But there is no difference about what is there basically when it is expressed in terms of violence. It is still violence against those individuals, and that is what we are attempting to address. 
   I will put in the RECORD the various justifications, in terms of the constitutional issues. We can get into those and debate and discuss those in the course of the evening. We believe we are on sound basis for that. We have spent a great deal of time in assuring that the legislation was going to meet the challenges of Supreme Court decisions. I believe that we do. I respect those who believe we have not. But we are talking about taking action and doing it now. 
   There are all kinds of reasons in this body why not to take action. But if we want to try to have an important response to the problems of hate crimes in our society, this is the way to do it. It is a bipartisan effort, and it has been since the development of our initial efforts under the leadership of Senator Simon and others a number of years ago, with just the collection of material. It has been, since that time, basically bipartisan, and it is on this measure now. It is whether we in the Senate are going to say that we have enough of the Matthew Shepard cases, that we have enough of the kind of vicious murdering on the basis of race, that we have enough prejudice and discrimination and expression of violence against Jewish individuals in our society, and we have had enough in terms of the violence against those who have a different sexual orientation. That is what the issue is, no more and no less. 
   I want to take a few moments, and if others want to address the Senate, I will obviously permit them to do so. I want to give the assurances to our colleagues about how this particular legislation has been fashioned and has been shaped. It is targeted, it is limited, it is responsive in terms of its constitutional standing and how it basically complements the work of the States, which are attempting to try to deal with those issues, and how it is positive in terms of helping those States, and how, in many circumstances--for example, in a number of the rapes or aggravated sexual assaults, because criminal penalties under State laws are actually more severe than under Federal laws, the prosecution quite clearly would fall in those circumstances. 
   As has been pointed out, in all the hate crimes prosecutions, the Federal authorities consult with the State and local enforcement officials before initiating an investigation or prosecution. The Federal jurisdiction allows the States to take advantage of the Department of Justice resources and personnel. Even if the State authorities ultimately bring the case, the Federal jurisdiction also allows the Attorney General to authorize the State prosecutor to bring a case based on Federal law, 
   when that should be important or necessary. 
   In cases where the States have adequate resources to investigate and prosecute a case and it appears determined to do so, the Federal Government will not file its own case. As has been the case under existing law, prosecutions under expanded case law would occur primarily in four situations: where the State does not have jurisdiction or the State prosecutors decline to act; or, after consultation between Federal and local authorities there is a consensus that a Federal prosecution is preferable because of the higher penalties and procedural advantages due to the complexity of the case; third, the state does not object to the Justice Department assuming jurisdiction; or fourth, that the State prosecution does not achieve a just result and the evidence warrants a subsequent Federal prosecution. 
   Those are very limiting factors because they effectively give the States veto rights over Federal jurisdiction. We are talking about having an extremely effective remedy, one that will be in the interest of justice but one that is carefully sharpened in terms of its scope to make sure that we maintain local involvement and consider local priorities. 
   The point is made that the Federal Hate Crimes Act would, in many cases, continue to overlap State jurisdiction. People have opposed this proposal for that reason. Violent crimes, whether motivated by discriminatory animus or not are generally covered under State law, and such an overlap is common. For example, there is overlapping Federal jurisdiction in cases of many homicides, in bank robberies, in kidnapings, in fraud, and other crimes. 
   We have been willing to do it in other circumstances, and I believe that we must have overlapping jurisdiction for violent crimes based on animus and hatred as well. We must take meaningful steps to do something about it. Clearly, I think we have an important responsibility to act. 
   The importance of the amendment is to provide a backstop to State and local enforcement by allowing a Federal prosecution, if it is necessary, to achieve an effective just result and to permit Federal authorities to assist in local investigations. 
   As has been mentioned, every Federal prosecutor would have to prove motivation beyond a reasonable doubt in all cases. The prosecution would present evidence that indicated that a motivating factor in the defendant's conduct was bias against a particular group. That is a question for the jury to decide. Obviously, the prosecutor must convince the jury that the crime was based upon bias in order to secure a conviction. 
   I withhold and yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on tomorrow we will have the opportunity to choose between the proposal of the Senator from Utah and the amendment Senator SMITH and I are recommending to our colleagues. 
   When it is all said and done, as I mentioned earlier, the proposal that has been put forward by my friend and colleague from Utah is basically to conduct a study about the problems and frequency of hate crimes, permits up to $5 million in authorization, and permits the Justice Department to provide grants for prosecution. That is really the extent of the amendment of the Senator from Utah. 
   He has outlined his reasons for supporting that particular approach. I heard him say earlier he believes that it is really going to solve the problem and that it is going to really deal with the issue of hate crimes. Of course, I do not believe that to be the case. 
   We reviewed this issue on a number of different occasions in the Judiciary Committee. I understand his position. I respect it, although I do have some difficulties in being persuaded by it this evening. 
   For example, he basically has not questioned the existing limited hate crimes legislation that is on the books, 18 U.S.C. 245, dealing with the issue of race, color, religion, and national origin in our society, even though it is restricted in its application. He did not say we ought to eliminate that situation. He did not really refer to eliminating current hate crimes law. 
   The fact is, we have very limited hate crimes legislation on the books. Current law is restricted, as the Justice Department testified before the Judiciary Committee, in ways that virtually deny accountability for the serious hate crimes that are committed by individuals on the basis of race, color,  religion, or national origin in our society. Specifically, it requires the federal government to prove that the victim was engaged in a federally protected activity during the commission of the crime. We are trying to address this deficiency and to expand current law to include gender, disability, and sexual orientation. 
   Those of us who will favor our position tomorrow believe the ultimate guarantor of the right for privacy, liberty, and individual safety and security in our society is the Constitution of the United States. That is where the repository for protecting our rights and our liberties is enshrined. It is enshrined in the Constitution, as interpreted by the Supreme Court. But ultimately we are the ones who help define the extent of the Constitution's protection. 
   When we find that we have inadequate protection for citizens because of sexual orientation, or gender, or race, that challenge cries out for us to take action. 
   My good friend from Utah does not mind federalizing class action suits to bring them into the Federal court. He does not mind federalizing property issues in the takings legislation, to bring those into Federal court. For computer fraud, he does not mind bringing those crimes in Federal courts. But do not bring in Federal power to do something about hate crimes. I find that absolutely extraordinary. 
   Why are we putting great protection for property rights and computer fraud and class actions into Federal court, giving them preference over doing something about the problems of hate crimes in our society that even Senator HATCH admits are taking place? We see from the data collected by the FBI and various studies that hate crimes are taking place. That is a fact. Look at the statistics that have been collected over the last few years, from 1995 through 1998. We see what is happening with regard to race, religion, national origin, ethnic background, sexual orientation, 
   and disability. As we have heard from the FBI and the Justice Department, they believe the FBI statistics vastly underestimate what is happening in our society. 
   The fact is, hate crimes are unlike any other crimes. Listening to the discussion of those who are opposed to our amendment, one would think these crimes were similar to pick-pocketing cases, misdemeanors, or traffic violations. 
   The kind of impact that hate crimes have in terms of not only the individual but the community is well understood. It should be well understood by communities and individuals. I do not have to take the time to quote what the American Psychological Society says about the enduring kind of burden that individuals undergo when they have been the victims of hate crimes over the course of their lifetime, even in contrast to other crimes of violence against individuals. It has a different flavor, and it has an impact on the victim, the family and the community. Hate crimes are an outrageous reflection of bigotry and hatred based on bias that cannot be tolerated in our society. 
   We have an opportunity to take some moderate steps to do something about it--to untie the hands of the Department of Justice. That is what tomorrow's vote is about. We have the constitutional authorities on our side, including the Justice Department, and others. 
   I will include the list of distinguished constitutional authorities that are supporting our positions.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I was startled to hear my friend and colleague suggest that when they asked the Justice Department which States took no action in the Federal Government prosecution, he said there was not any. He did not read his response from the Justice Department because I have in my hand the response from the Justice Department that lists their response. I am not going to take the time tonight to go all the way through, but they have been listed. He ought to ask his staff for that because it has been sent to the Judiciary Committee, of which he is the chairman. 
   Included in the Justice Department's response are cases showing instances where the Department has pursued cases Federally when the State cannot respond as effectively as the Federal Government. For example, when State penalties are less severe than Federal penalties or where there are differences in applicable criminal procedure. 
   The idea that there really aren't times when States are unable to prosecute a case just does not hold water, because the cases are out there and have been supplied by the Justice Department. 
   Furthermore, this chart shows what is happening across the country in the various States. Eight States have absolutely no hate crimes statutes, 22 States have criminal statutes for disability bias crimes, 21 States plus the District of Columbia have criminal statutes for sexual orientation bias crimes, and 20 States identify gender bias crimes. 
   But, if you are in any of these States shown on this chart which are colored gray, including many in the Northeast, as well as out in the West, and you are involved in the beating or battering of an individual American because of their sexual orientation, there are no hate crimes statutes under which to prosecute the perpetrator. 
   The States shown in yellow on the chart have no hate crimes statutes at all. As I said, the States shown in gray have no protection at all for crimes committed because of a person's sexual orientation. Many of those States that have hate crimes laws are inadequate because they do not include all of the categories, including sexual orientation, gender and disability. 
   We have one particular State, Utah, where a judge found the hate crime law to be incomplete because it specified no classes of victims--the State included itself as having a hate crimes law. The judge was forced to dismiss the felony charges against two defendants who allegedly beat and terrorized people in a downtown city. The case was effectively dismissed because the state hate crime law was so vaguely drafted that it failed to provide any of the protections that other state hate crimes law do that clearly define classes of people who are protected by race, religion, national origin, ethnic background, gender, sexual orientation, or disability. 
   The reality in the United States today is that either we believe we have some responsibility to protect our fellow Americans from these kinds of extraordinary actions based upon bigotry and prejudice or we don't. 
   We have taken action in the past. We have done it when the action was based upon bigotry and prejudice and denial of the right to vote. We have taken action when prejudice and bigotry have denied people public accommodation. We have taken action against bigotry and prejudice when people have been denied housing. We have taken action against bigotry and prejudice toward people with disabilities. 
   Now we are asking the Senate to take action when there is violence against American citizens based upon prejudice and bigotry. That is why this vote tomorrow is so important. That is what the issue is about. It is very basic and fundamental, and it is enormously important. 
   It is part of a continuing process of the march towards a fairer and more just America. We have been trying to free ourselves from the stains of discrimination on the basis of race. We are making progress in terms of religion, national origin, and ethnic background. We are doing it with regard to gender, disability, and sexual orientation. 
   What we are doing with this legislation is saying, at least in these areas, protect American citizens from prejudice and discrimination and violence that is being directed towards them. Let us make that a priority; let all Americans know that we are not going to fight prejudice and discrimination with one hand tied behind our backs. The Federal Government should have both hands involved in trying to protect our citizens from this form of discrimination. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as I mentioned, the cases were provided by the Justice Department. 
   Let me give you one case, U.S. v. Kila, 1994, a Federal jury in Fort Worth, Texas acquitted three white supremacists of Federal civil rights charges arising from unprovoked assaults upon African Americans, including one incident where the defendants knocked a 
   man unconscious as he stood near a bus stop. For several hours, the defendants walked throughout the town accosting every African American they met, ordering them to leave whatever place or area they were in. Some of these encounters consisted of verbal harassment; in others, Black victims were shoved on the streets, their hats knocked off. Throughout their movements through the city, the subjects were using racial epithets and talking about white supremacy. 
   The subjects' parade of racial hate erupted into serious violence with the assault on Ali--that is the name of the individual--at the bus stop, an assault which knocked him unconscious. According to witnesses, Ali was punched in the face after he fell to the ground, and kicked in the head. He was transported by ambulance to the hospital, having sustained head injuries. He did not have medical insurance. When the doctors asked him to remain for further tests, he left against their wishes. 
   The Federal Government became involved in the case when State officials went to the U.S. Attorney's Office asking for Federal assistance. The State could only proceed on misdemeanors, and in their judgment, the conduct warranted felony treatment, treatment available under Federal law. Some of the jurors revealed after the trial that although the assaults were clearly motivated by racial animus, there was no apparent intent to deprive the victims of the right to participate in any federally protected activity. 
   It is this federally protected activity barrier under current law that is unduly restrictive, and must be amended. 
   The Government's proof that the defendants went out looking for African Americans to assault was insufficient to satisfy the statutory requirements and effectively the case was dropped. 
   I could go back as far as 1982. Maybe in some cases defendants get tried for a misdemeanor, as they did in a Western State case I mentioned previously, but they are not getting prosecuted with the full weight of the law. That is what we are talking about. In the 1982 case that I referred to, two white men chased a man of Asian descent from a night club in Detroit and beat him to death. The Department of Justice prosecuted the perpetrators under existing hate crimes laws, but both defendants were acquitted--despite substantial evidence to establish their animus based on the victim's national origin. Although the Justice Department had no direct evidence of the basis for the jurors' decision, the Government's need to prove the defendants' intent to interfere with the victim's engagement in a federally protected right--the use of a place of public accommodation, was the weak link in the prosecution. 
   These defendants committed murder on the basis of hate. Do we need more cases? I am glad to stay here and go through a whole pile of them. These are examples of what we are talking about. This is what is taking place. The question is whether we are going to do something about it. That is the issue that will be presented to this body tomorrow. 
   I will take a moment to read into the RECORD the letter from Judy Shepard addressed to the members of the Judiciary Committee:  
   Thank you for your hard work and commitment to combating hate violence in America. I appreciate the opportunity to testify before your committee last year. As the mother of a hate crime victim, I applaud your interest in trying to address this serious problem that has torn at the very fabric of our nation. However, I do have concerns with your bill (S. 1406) as currently written, and I would like to take this opportunity to discuss them with you. 
   As I am sure you remember from our visit last fall, two men murdered my son Matthew in Laramie, Wyoming in October 1998 because he was gay. Though your amendment is well intentioned, it fails to address hate crimes based on sexual orientation, nor does it include disability or gender. The time has long passed for halfway measures to address this devastating violence. While I appreciate your efforts, the appropriate and necessary response is the Smith-Kennedy measure (S. 622), and I strongly urge you to support this approach. 
   Though forty states and the District of Columbia have enacted hate crime statutes, most states do not provide authority for bias crime prosecutions based on sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Including the District of Columbia, only 22 states now include sexual orientation-based crimes in their hate crime statutes, 21 include coverage of gender-based crimes, and 22 include coverage for disability-based crimes. 
   There is currently no law that allows federal assistance for localities investigating and prosecuting hate crimes based on sexual orientation. As a result, though Matt's killers were brought to justice, the Laramie law enforcement officials told me, as I know they told you last year, that they were forced to furlough five employees to be able to afford to bring the case. The Smith-Kennedy amendment would add sexual orientation, gender and disability to current law, while your amendment would not. I urge you to support the Smith-Kennedy amendment, which is more comprehensive and inclusive. 
   I know that legislation cannot erase the hate or pain or bring back my son, but I believe that passage of this legislation is an essential step in the healing process and will help allow the federal government to assist in the investigation and prosecution of future hate crimes. 
   Again, I respect your commitment to making America a more understanding and just country where hate crimes are no longer tolerated. But I urge you to promptly address my concerns that are shared by so many others, so our nation can be safe for all people, including gay people like my son Matthew. 
   Sincerely, JUDY SHEPARD.   
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at an appropriate time, I intend to offer the Hate Crimes Prevention Act as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Act. It is essential for the Senate to deal with this important issue. 
   Hate crimes are modern day lynchings, and this is the time and the United States Senate is the place to take a stand against them. We must firmly and unequivocally say ``no'' to those who injure or murder because of hate. Every day that Congress fails to act, people across the Nation continue to be victimized by acts of bigotry based on race, religion, sexual orientation, gender, or disability. 
   Hate crimes are a national disgrace and an attack on everything this country stands for. These crimes send a poisonous message that minorities are second class citizens with fewer rights. And, sadly, the number of hate crimes continues to rise. 
   70,000 hate crime offenses have been reported in the United States since 1991. In 1991 there were 4,500 hate crimes; 7,500 in 1993; 7,900 in 1995, and over 8,000 in 1997. There were 7,700 hate crimes reported in 1998, and although the numbers dropped slightly, the number and severity of offenses increased in the categories of religion, sexual orientation, and disability. 
   This is a serious and persistent problem--an epidemic that must be stopped. 
   All of us are aware of the most highly-publicized hate crimes, especially the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. But these two killings are just the tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have occurred this year: 
   On January 28 in Boston, a group of high school teenagers sexually assaulted and attacked a 16-year-old high school student on the subway because she was holding hands with another young girl, a common custom from her native African country. Thinking the victim was a lesbian, the group began groping the girl, ripping her clothes and pointing at their own genitals, while shouting ``Do you like this? Do you like this? Is this what you like?'' When the girl resisted, officials said, a teenage boy who was with the group pulled a knife on the girl, held it to her throat and threatened to slash her if she didn't obey her attackers. The girl was left unconscious from the beating. Three high school students were arrested in the attack and charged with civil rights violations, assault with a dangerous weapon, assault and battery, and indecent assault and battery. 
   On February 6 Tuscon, Arizona, a 20-year-old gay University of Arizona student was sitting at a cafe when a man came up behind him and punched and stabbed him with a large knife. Witnesses heard the perpetrator using vicious anti-gay epithets. The victim was treated at a local hospial and survived. The attack spurred an anti-hate rally on the campus a few days later, drawing over 1,000 people. 
   March 1 in Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, a black man was charged with a hate crime after going on a shooting rampage killing three white men and leaving two others critically wounded. Prior to the attack, he told a black woman that he wouldn't hurt her because he was ``out to get all white people.'' The perpetrator was shouting racial epithets at white maintenance workers, and shot only white men on his rampage. Authorities found anti-white and anti-Jewish writings in his home. 
   On April 29 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Richard Scott Baumhammers, 34, a white man was charged with murder and hate crimes in a shooting rampage targeting minorities that left five people dead and one critically wounded. The first victim was a Jewish neighbor who was shot half a dozen times before her house was set on fire. The perpetrator then went from shopping mall to shopping mall, shooting and killing two Asian Americans at a Chinese restaurant, an African American at a karate school, and a man from India at an Indian grocery. He also fired shots at two synagogues, and the word ``Jew'' and two swastikas were painted in red on one of the buildings. According to press reports, attorney of the accused is raising an insanity defense. 
   On June 4 in Rapid City, South Dakota, press reports indicate that police are baffled by a series of eight inexplicable drowning deaths among mostly Native Americans along Rapid Creek that have occurred over the course of 14 months. Law enforcement officials initially thought that the severely intoxicated men had drowned by accident. But local Native Americans believe an ``Indian-hater'' is waiting for the victims to become drunk and then dragging, rolling or pushing them into the water. These incidents come on the heels of a March 2000 report from the U.S. Civil Rights Commission that shows that racial tensions in South Dakota are high, and that Native Americans in the state feel that the justice they received is unfair. 
   The most brutal and shocking hate crimes continue to make national headlines. Yet this list highlights just a few of the many hate crimes that afflict communities throughout the nation. This problem cannot and should not be ignored. 
   We know that hate groups have increased in number in recent years. A study by the Southern Poverty Law Center reported last year that 474 hate groups exist nationwide. Clearly, the Internet has given them a larger megaphone. In earlier years, hate groups would spread their messages of hate by using bulletin boards, newsletters, cable television, and occasional rallies. Now, the Internet gives them a vastly increased audience that can be reached  with little effort. Hate sites have proliferated at distressing rates, and recruitment by hate groups has increased substantially. No minority is safe. African-Americans, Hispanics, Jews, gays, lesbians, Arab-Americans, Native Americans--all are targeted by these hate groups, which hide behind the first amendment as they spread their hateful messages. Unless we find better antidotes to the poison of high-tech hate, the problem of hate crimes in our free society will become increasingly severe. 
   The federal government has a special role in protecting civil rights and preventing discrimination. We need to take two major steps. We need to strengthen current federal laws against hate crimes based on race, religion or national origin. We also need to add gender, sexual orientation, and disability to the types of hate crimes where federal prosecution is available. 
   Our goal is to make the Justice Department a full partner with state and local governments in investigating and prosecuting these vicious crimes. We must find a way to act on this important issue and now is the time to do it. The silence of Congress on this basic issue has been deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't care--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that Congress continues to be A.W.O.L. in the national battle against hate crimes. 
   Recent incidents of hate crimes have shocked the conscience of the country. It is clear that tolerance in America faces a serious challenge. We cannot hide behind the nation's record economic prosperity or its tremendous technological advances, when issues that go to the heart of the nation's founding ideals and basic values are at stake. When bigotry exists in America, we have to root it out. 
   Current federal laws are clearly inadequate. It's an embarrassment that we haven't already acted to close the glaring gaps. For too long, the federal government has been forced to fight hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. Federal participation in civil rights prosecutions in nothing new. In fact, it is Federalism 101. Federal involvement in the prosecution of racial bigotry dates back to the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. These fundamental civil rights laws were updated in the 1960's, but now they are no longer adequate to meet the current challenge. Civil rights is still the unfinished business of America, and action we propose is in the best tradition of responsible federal legislation. 
   Our amendment addresses two serious deficiencies in the principal federal hate crimes statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167;245, which currently applies to hate crimes committed on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. 
   First, in these cases, the statutes requires the government to prove that the defendant committed an offense not only because of the victims race, color, religion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's participation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected activities'' listed in the statute. These activities are:

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this morning's session of the Senate was opened by Reverend Monsignor Lloyd Torgerson of Santa Monica, California. I welcome this opportunity to commend Monsignor Torgerson for his eloquent prayer and for the wisdom he has offered the Senate. 
   Monsignor Torgerson is a pastor at the Santa Monica Parish where he has served with great distinction for many years. He ministers to over 7,000 families, as well as an elementary school and a high school. He also serves at the Archdiocese level in Los Angeles, and is Dean of the 19 Westside parishes. 
   Over the years, Chaplain Ogilvie and Monsignor Torgerson have developed an excellent friendship through their work in the Los Angeles community. In fact, Monsignor Torgerson baptized all four of Chaplain Ogilvie's grandchildren.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I don't oppose Senator MCCAIN's amendment. It reflects the current broad understanding about the status of the Central Artery/Tunnel project in Boston. 
   The Big Dig project has suffered from serious cost overruns and there is no disagreement about who will pay for those costs. The Chairman of the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, the governor of Massachusetts, the leaders of the State legislature, the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Inspector General of the Department, the Massachusetts Congressional delegation, and Senator MCCAIN all agree that the total federal contribution remains as it was--$8.549 billion. It is the responsibility of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts to cover any increased costs. 
   The state has developed a plan to do just that, and it is a good plan. The state legislature and Governor Cellucci have worked effectively to prepare a realistic plan to pay for the increased costs of the Big Dig, without asking for  additional federal assistance, and without shortchanging important transportation projects throughout the rest of the state. The plan is currently being reviewed by the Federal Highway Administration and is likely to be approved very soon. 
   It is also important to appreciate all that is involved in this project, and all that it will do for Boston and the region. Work of this magnitude and duration has never before been attempted in the heart of an urban area. Unlike any other major highway project, the Central Artery/Tunnel Project is designed to maintain traffic capacity and access to residents and businesses. Using new and innovative technology, it has kept the city open for business throughout the construction. 
   The Big Dig is replacing the current six lane elevated roadway with eight to ten underground lanes. The project will create 150 acres of new parks and open space, including 27 acres where the existing elevated highway now stands. 
   This is an urgently needed project. Today, the Central Artery carries 190,000 vehicles a day with bumper-to-bumper traffic and stop-and-go congestion for six to eight hours every day. If nothing were done, the elevated highway would suffer through bumper-to-bumper conditions for 15 to 16 hours a day by the year 2000. 
   The new underground expressway will be able to carry 245,000 vehicles a day with minimal delays. The elimination of hours of congested traffic will reduce Boston carbon monoxide levels by 12 percent citywide. Without such improvements in its transportation, Boston would not be able to continue to grow as the center of economic activity for the state and the region. 
   Work on this important project is progressing effectively again. I look forward to its conclusion so that the city, state, and region can benefit from the needed improvements this project will bring.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Corporation for National Service recently announced the winners of the second annual National Service--Learning Leader Schools Program, a Presidential Award that recognizes schools for excellence in service-learning. 
   Learn and Serve America, one of the three national service programs of the Corporation for National Service, is sponsoring the Leader Schools initiative. In its second year, the Leader Schools program is honoring 34 middle schools and 32 high schools in 31 states for thoughtfully and effectively combining academic subjects with community service in a way that benefits students, teaches civic responsibility, and strengthens communities. 
   Service-learning is expanding in the United States. The Department of Education found that in 1984, only 27 percent of all high schools had school-sponsored community service projects and only 9 percent offered service-learning. By the 1998-99 school year, those numbers rose to a remarkable 83 percent and 46 percent, respectively. 
   Three schools in Massachusetts--Wareham High School and Wareham Middle School in Wareham and Tantasqua Regional Junior High School in Fiskdale have been leaders in our state on service-learning and were honored as National Service Learning Leader Schools this year. I commend each of these schools for the important work they have accomplished in making community service an integral part of school life. These schools are impressive models for Massachusetts and for the nation. 
   The Leader Schools program is not simply an awards program. The schools being honored are making a two year commitment to assist other schools through mentoring and coaching, thereby contributing to the spread of service-learning throughout the country. 
   The Corporation for National Service also administers AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps that is engaging Americans in extensive, service activities in this country. In addition, the Corporation administers the National Senior Service Corps which enables nearly half a million Americans age fifty-five and older to share their time and talents to help solve local problems. 
   All of these outstanding programs are achieving great success under the strong leadership of our former colleague in the Senate, Harris Wofford, the chief executive officer of the Corporation.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, between 44,000 and 98,000 patients die each year from medical errors, making it the eighth leading cause of death in the United States. Each day, more than 250 people die because of medical errors--the equivalent of a major airplane crash every day. Estimates of the annual financial cost of preventable errors run as high as $29 billion a year. We can do better for our citizens. We must do better. 
   The Voluntary Error Reduction and Improvement in Patient Safety Act of 2000, which Senator DODD and I are introducing today, will provide the federal investment and framework necessary to take the first steps to effectively treat this continuing epidemic of medical errors. Today, there errors are a stealth plague hidden deep within the world's best health care system. This legislation will support needed research in this area, and identify and reduce common mistakes. 
   Reducing medical errors can save lives and health care dollars, and avoid countless family tragedies. The field of anesthesia had the foresight to undertake such an effort almost 20 years ago, and today, the number of fatalities from errors in administering anesthesia has dropped by 98 percent. Our goal should be to achieve equal or even greater success in reducing other types of medical mistakes. This legislation lays the foundation to achieve this goal. 
   The 1999 Institute of Medicine report, To Err is Human, documented the compelling need for aggressive national action on the issue. The IOM report recommended the creation of two reporting systems, each with different goals. The first is a voluntary confidential reporting system to learn about medical errors and help researchers develop solutions for future error prevention and reduction. The second is a mandatory public reporting system for certain serious errors and deaths in order to inform the public and hold health care facilities responsible for their mistakes. 
   Our legislation today deals with the first issue, but the second issue is also critical. I believe that the public has a right-to-know about certain serious events, and public disclosure is an important tool to assure that institutions  put safety on the front burner, not the back burner. 
   I commend the Administration for recognizing the value of mandatory reporting by recently establishing such programs in the Department of Veterans Affairs and Department of Defense health care systems. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality is also in the process of evaluating existing mandatory reporting systems, and the Health Care Financing Administration is planning to sponsor a mandatory reporting demonstration project for selected private hospitals. I believe our next step should be to move ahead with mandatory reporting, and 
   the results of these studies will shed needed light on the effectiveness of different options. 
   The bill we introduce today would take a significant first step toward implementing and providing support for the recommendations in the IOM report. 
   The overwhelming majority of errors are caused by flaws in the health care system, not the outright negligence of individual doctors and nurses. Our hospitals, doctors, nurses, and other health care providers want to do the right thing. Our proposal gives the health care community the tools to identify the causes of medical errors, the resources to develop strategies to prevent them, and the encouragement to implement those solutions. 
   First, the Act creates a new patient safety center in the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. The Center for Quality Improvement and Patient Safety will improve and promote patient safety by conducting and supporting research on medical errors, administering the national medical error reporting systems created under this bill, and disseminating evidence-based practices and other error reduction and prevention strategies to health care providers, purchasers and the public. 
   Second, the legislation would establish national voluntary reporting and surveillance systems under AHRQ to identify, track, prevent and reduce medical errors. The National Patient Safety Reporting System will allow health care professionals, health care facilities, and patients to voluntarily report adverse events and close calls. The National Patient Safety Surveillance System would establish a surveillance system, which is modeled on a successful CDC initiative that tracks hospital-acquired infections, for health care facilities that choose to participate. Participating facilities will include a representative sample of various institutions, which will monitor, analyze, and report selected adverse events and close calls. Researchers will provide feedback to the participating facilities. 
   Reports submitted to both programs will be analyzed to identify systemic faults that led to the errors, and recommend solutions to prevent similar errors in the future. 
   In order to encourage participation, reports and analyses from both programs will be protected from discovery, and health care workers who submit reports to the programs will be protected against workplace retaliation based on their participation in the reporting systems. 
   In exchange for establishing this reporting system, health care facilities and professionals would be expected to voluntarily implement appropriate patient safety solutions as they are developed. In addition, in recognition of the significant federal investments in error reduction strategies and the provision of health services, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be required to develop a process for determining which evidence-based practices should be applied to programs under the Secretary's authority. The Secretary will take appropriate, reasonable steps to assure implementation of these practices. 
   Our proposal also requires the Director of the Office of Personnel Management to develop a similar process for determining which evidence-based practices should be used as purchasing standards for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Plans will also be rated on how well they met these standards, and compliance ratings will be provided to federal employees and retirees during the annual enrollment period. 
   The bill authorizes $50,000,000 for the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality for FY 2001, increasing to $200,000,000 in FY 2005, to fund error-related research and the reporting systems. 
   Systemic errors in the health care system put every patient at risk of injury. The measure we propose today is designed to reduce that risk as much as possible. Americans deserve the highest quality health care. This bill will raise patient safety to a high national priority, and ensure that patient safety becomes part of every citizen's expectation of high quality health care. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to expedite its passage and to develop companion legislation that establishes a mandatory reporting system. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the following summary, fact sheet, and letters of support be inserted into the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are introducing legislation to improve the health of Medicare beneficiaries and the health of the Medicare program itself. Under Medicare, the health and quality of life for millions of older adults and people with disabilities have significantly improved. The rate of chronic disability among adults over 65 continues to decline, but we can do better. A recent report by the World Health Organization showed that the U.S. falls behind 23 other nations in ``healthy life expectancy.'' On average, Americans can expect only 70 healthy years, compared to Japanese citizens who can anticipate 74 1/2 years of life without disability. Chronic disability robs too many older Americans of active and productive years, and adds $26 billion annually in health care costs as people over 65 lose their ability to live independently. 
   In the next 30 years, the viability of Medicare will be challenged as the baby boom generation ages. Nearly one fifth of the population will be 65 and older by 2025, which means that a larger number of beneficiaries will be supported by a smaller number of workers. The current debate over the future of Medicare often revolves around benefit cuts or tax increases. But an obvious alternative that should be part of the debate is to reduce the demand for Medicare by improving the health of senior citizens. Unfortunately, Medicare today contains few incentives to encourage beneficiaries and providers to take health promotion and disease prevention seriously. This bill will help older adults and individuals with disabilities to improve their health. It will also educate health providers about the best practices for treatment of Medicare patients. 
   Older adults are generally health conscious and are interested in taking steps to maintain their health and independence. Poor lifestyle factors--which include lack of exercise, poor diet, at-risk behaviors, smoking, and alcohol abuse--account for 70% of the physical decline and disease that occur with aging. Experts agree that the potential for better health through health promotion and disease prevention is great. Too often, however, older Americans lack the accurate information that would help them take advantage of these opportunities. This bill will ensure that Medicare beneficiaries are better informed about the lifestyle changes they can make to improve their health, and the preventive health services they can use to prevent disease. 
   To encourage more beneficiaries to use the preventive services that Medicare currently offers, our legislation will eliminate cost-sharing for these services. Prevention saves lives and saves money. The incidence of cancer in adults over 65 is approximately eleven times higher than in persons under 65. Most cancers can be treated and many can be cured if detected early. But cancer screening tests are significantly underused by Medicare beneficiaries. Thirty-eight percent of women over 65 who have survived breast cancer (and remain at risk) do not receive an annual mammogram. Our bill will waive cost-sharing for mammography, screening pelvic 
   exams, colorectal cancer screening, prostate cancer screening, bone mass measurement, hepatitis B vaccine and its administration, and diabetes self-management training. 
   Despite the great potential of preventive services to improve the quality of life for older Americans, few clinical guidelines focus on preventive care for this population. Our bill calls for a task force to conduct studies to determine which preventive services in primary care are most valuable to senior citizens. A separate demonstration project will determine effective means to reduce smoking by Medicare beneficiaries. Cessation of smoking can reduce the risk of lung cancer, heart disease, and stroke. In 1997, smoking-related expenditures were estimated to cost the Medicare program a total of $20.5 billion. 
   There are substantial defects in the quality of care provided to Medicare beneficiaries. Medical research has established that early use of a beta blocker after a heart attack reduces the risk of mortality and rehospitalization. Yet 51 percent of older adults fail to receive this treatment when it is indicated. In fact, patients at the highest risk of death in the hospital are least likely to receive a beta blocker. 
   Every senior citizen deserves quality health care. The gaps between the best medical practice and actual practice must be narrowed. Our bill asks the Department of Health and Human Services to determine which areas in the treatment of Medicare beneficiaries do not meet the highest professional standards, and to determine the best practices in those areas. Steps will then be taken to inform health care professionals about these standards for treatment. 
   The opportunities for better health care and budget savings are great, if care can be delivered to beneficiaries with high-cost chronic conditions in a more coordinated and effective way. Our legislation authorizes demonstration projects to develop innovative approaches to increase the quality of care and reduce costs for Medicare beneficiaries in skilled nursing facilities. Similar demonstration projects are authorized for beneficiaries with serious or chronic illness who do not reside in nursing facilities.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several months ago, my distinguished colleague, Senator BILL FRIST, and I began to develop legislation needed to enhance the nation's protections  against the triple threat to health posed by new and resurgent infectious diseases, by ``superbugs'' resistant to antibiotics, and by terrorist attacks with biological weapons. Today, Senator FRIST and I are introducing the Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000. I commend Senator FRIST for his leadership and commitment on this important legislation. 
   The bill that we are introducing today will provide the nation with additional weapons to win the battle against the deadly perils of infectious disease, antimicrobial resistance and bioterrorism. The Public Health Threats and Emergencies Act of 2000 will revitalize the nation's ability to monitor and fight outbreaks of infectious disease, control the spread of germs resistant to antibiotics, and protect the nation more effectively against bioterrorism. 
   Today we face a world where deadly contagious diseases that erupt in one part of the world can be transported across the globe with the speed of a jet aircraft. The recent outbreak of West Nile Fever in the New York area is an ominous warning of future dangers. Diseases such as cholera, typhoid and pneumonia that we have fought for generations still claim millions of lives across the world and will pose increasing dangers to this country in years to come. New plagues like Ebola virus, Lassa Fever and others now unknown to science may one day invade our shores. 
   Less exotic, but also deadly, are the simpler infections that for almost a century we have been able to treat with antibiotics, but that are now becoming resistant even to our most advanced medicines. Drugs that once had the power to cure dangerous infections are now often useless--because ``superbugs`' have now become resistant to all but the most powerful and expensive medications. Strains of tuberculosis that are resistant to antimicrobial drugs are prevalent around the world, and are a growing danger in our inner cities and among the homeless. If action is not urgently taken, we may soon return to the days when a simple case of food poisoning could prove deadly and a mere cut could become severely infected and cost a limb. 
   The growing financial burden of antimicrobial resistance on the health care system is staggering. Treating a patient with TB usually costs $12,000. But when a patient has drug-resistant TB, that figure soars to $180,000. The National Foundation for Infectious Diseases estimates that the total cost of antimicrobial resistance to the U.S. health care system is as high as $4 billion every year--and this figure will only rise as resistant infections become more common. 
   But the most potentially deadly of these threats is bioterrorism. We are a nation at risk. Biological weapons are the massive new threats of the twenty-first century. The Office of Emergency Preparedness estimates that 40 million Americans could die if a terrorist released smallpox into the American population. Anthrax could kill 10 million. Other deadly pathogens known to have been developed in biological warfare labs around the world could kill millions. 
   Our proposal will strengthen the nation's public health agencies, which provide the first line of defense against bioterrorism and many other threats to the public health. Our legislation authorizes the Secretary of Health and Human Services to respond swiftly and effectively to a public health emergency, and provides the Secretary with needed resources to mount a strong defense against whatever danger imperils the nation's health. 
   The bill calls upon the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish a national monitoring plan for dangerous infections resistant to antibiotics, and to work closely with state and local public health agencies to ensure that this peril is contained. 
   It is also essential to educate patients and medical providers in the appropriate use of antibiotics. Too often, patients demand antibiotics and doctors provide them for illnesses which do not require and do not respond to these drugs. Our legislation calls upon the federal government to lead a national campaign to educate patients and health providers in the appropriate use of antibiotics. 
   The threat of bioterrorism demands particular attention, because of its potential for massive death and destruction. Currently, dozens of federal agencies share responsibility for domestic preparedness against bioterrorist attacks. This bill will enhance the nation's preparedness by improving coordination among federal agencies responsible for all aspects of a bioterrorist attack. Better coordination will allow us to develop the public health countermeasures needed to defend against bioterrorism, such as stockpiles of essential supplies and effective disaster planning. 
   Since the infectious organisms likely to be used in a bioterrorist attack are rarely encountered in normal medical practice, many doctors or laboratory specialists are likely to be unable to diagnose persons with these diseases rapidly and accurately. Recognizing a bioterrorist attack quickly is a major part of containing it. This bill will improve the preparedness of public health institutions, health providers, and emergency personnel to detect, diagnose, and respond to bioterrorist attacks through improved training and public education. 
   One of the highest duties of Congress is to protect the nation against all threats, foreign and domestic. Deadly infectious diseases, new ``superbugs'' resistant to antibiotics, and bioterrorism clearly menace the nation. We must resist these threats as vigorously as we would fight an invading army. the Frist-Kennedy bill is intended to provide the weapons we need to win this battle.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to join my colleagues in again offering this amendment to restore the reputations of two distinguished military officers who have unfairly borne the sole blame for the success of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor at the beginning of World War II--Admiral Husband E. Kimmel of the United States Navy and General Walter C. Short of the United States Army. 
   The Senate passed this same amendment as part of last year's Department of Defense Authorization Act, but unfortunately it was dropped in conference. Now, our amendment is part of this year's House version of the Defense Authorization Act. 
   At last, we have an excellent opportunity to correct a serious wrong from World War II that has unfairly tarnished the reputation of our military and our nation for justice and honor. 
   Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the Navy and Army commanders at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941. Despite their loyal and distinguished service, they were unfairly turned into scapegoats for the nation's lack of preparation for that attack and the catastrophe that took place.  
   Justice for these men is long overdue. Wartime investigations after the attack concluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the command of Admiral Kimmel and our land forces under the command of General Short had been properly positioned, given the information they had received. The investigations also found that their superior officers in Washington had not passed on vital intelligence information that could have made a difference in America's preparedness for the attack. These conclusions of the wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to protect the war effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification for ignoring these facts. 
   Since these initial findings, numerous military, governmental, and congressional investigations have concluded that the blame for this attack should have been widely shared. This amendment, and the case for Admiral Kimmel and General Short, have received strong support from former Chiefs of Naval Operations, Army Chiefs of Staff, and Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, including Admiral Thomas H. Moorer, Admiral Carlisle Trost, Admiral J.L. Holloway III, Admiral William J. Crowe, Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, General Andrew J. Goodpaster, and General William J. McCaffrey. 
   Our amendment recommends that the President posthumously advance Admiral Kimmel and General Short to their highest wartime rank in accord with the Officer Personnel Act of 1947. Admiral Kimmel and General Short are the only two officers eligible under this act who did not receive advancement on the retired list. The amendment involves no monetary compensation. It simply asks that now, at this late date, these two military leaders finally be treated the same as their peers. 
   I first became interested in this issue when I received a letter 2 years ago from a good friend in Boston who, for many years, has been one of the pre-eminent lawyers in America, Edward B. Hanify. As a young Navy lawyer and Lieutenant J.G. in 1944, Mr. Hanify was assigned as counsel to Admiral Kimmel. 
   He accompanied Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board of Investigation, and he later heard the testimony in the lengthy congressional investigation of Pearl Harbor by the Roberts Commission. 
   Mr. Hanify is probably one of the few surviving people who heard Kimmel's testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry, and he has closely followed all subsequent developments on the Pearl Harbor catastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that disaster. 
   I would like to quote a few brief paragraphs from Mr. Hanify's letter, because it eloquently summarizes the overwhelming case for justice for Admiral Kimmel. Mr. Hanify writes:  
   The odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made by the Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable damage to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel, despite the fact that the finding was later repudiated and found groundless. 
   I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to callous and cruel treatment by his superiors who were attempting to deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, particularly on account of their strange behavior on the evening of December 6 and morning of December 7 in failing to warn the Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army Department that a Japanese attack on the United States was scheduled for December 7, and that intercepted intelligence indicated that Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack. Washington had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and Army in Hawaii did not have it, or any means of obtaining it. 
   Subsequent investigation by both services repudiated the ``dereliction of duty'' charge. In the case of Admiral Kimmel, the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the information which he had from Washington.  
   Adequate and competent in light of the information which he had from Washington. 
   Mr. Hanify concludes, ``The proposed legislation provides some measure of remedial justice to a conscientious officer who for years unjustly bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor catastrophe.'' 
   Last year, the Senate took a giant step toward correcting this great wrong by passing our amendment. I urge the Senate to support this amendment again this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this important step to compensate workers who became sick from occupational exposure to beryllium, radiation, and other toxic substances as part of the Cold War build-up. I commend my colleagues Senator THOMPSON, Senator VOINOVICH, Senator DEWINE, and Senator BINGAMAN for their leadership on this issue. 
   During the cold war, thousands of men and women who worked at the nation's atomic weapons plants were exposed to unknown hazards. Many were exposed to dangerous radioactive and chemical materials at far greater levels than their employers revealed. The debilitating, and often fatal, illnesses  suffered by these workers came in many forms of cancer, as well as other illnesses that are difficult to diagnose. This provision brings long overdue relief to these workers and their families. 
   The Department of energy investigated this issue. It found that workers who served for years to maintain and strengthen our defenses during the cold War were not informed or protected against the health hazards they faced at work. Only during the Clinton Administration has the government openly acknowledged that these workers were exposed to materials that were much more radioactive--and much more deadly--than previously revealed. 
   I commend Secretary Richardson for his leadership in bringing this issue to light, and for his efforts to close this tragic chapter in the nation's history for the thousands of workers and their families whose lives were affected. 
   On of the earliest instances of the health dangers of beryllium occurred during World War II at the Sylvania Company in Salem, Massachusetts. At this plant, doctors first identified cases of beryllium disease, an acute and often fatal lung illness that seemed similar to tuberculosis. At the time, the company used beryllium in manufacturing fluorescent light bulbs. 
   Some of the earliest radiation experiments were conducted at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge as part of the Manhattan Project. Scientists at MIT were also among the first to conduct experiments with beryllium oxide ceramics for the Manhattan Project and the Atomic Energy Corporation. Many of the first cases of beryllium disease occurred among these scientists. 
   We have an opportunity today to remedy the wrongs suffered by these Department of Energy workers. Our amendment creates a basic framework for compensation. It is the least we can do for workers who made such great sacrifices for our country during the cold war. They have already waited too long for this relief.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
   At the outset of this debate, I express my sincere appreciation to the leadership on both sides, particularly on our side, Senator DASCHLE, as well as to Senator LOTT, to permit an opportunity to vote on a matter which I think is of central concern and importance to families all across this country. I think the timing of this is enormously significant for the reasons we will point out in the time available this afternoon. 
   The American people have waited more than 3 years for Congress to send the President a Patients' Bill of Rights that protects all patients and holds all HMOs and other health plans accountable for their actions. Every day that the conference on the Patients' Bill of Rights fails to produce agreement on meaningful patient protections, 60,000 more patients endure added pain and suffering, and more than 40,000 patients report a worsening of their condition as a result of health plan abuses. 
   For more than 3 months, we have participated in a charade of a conference that refuses to make progress on these basic issues. We have tried to reach agreement with the Republican leadership on the specific patient protections that are critical to ending abuses by HMOs and other managed care plans. But the Congress has failed to guarantee patients even the most basic protections. This is not rocket science. It is long past time for this Congress to stop protecting HMO profits and start protecting patients' health. 
   The House passed a strong bipartisan bill last year to give patients the rights they need and deserve. It has the support of more than 300 leading organizations representing patients, doctors, nurses, working families, small businesses, religious organizations, and many others. 
   The House bill has overwhelming bipartisan support. One in three House Republicans voted for this legislation. President Clinton would sign that bill today, this afternoon. Unfortunately, the Republican leadership in Congress and the Republican conferees appear to have no intention of reaching a conference agreement that can be signed into law. 
   We have repeatedly asked the Republican conferees to produce an offer on the critical issues that need to be resolved such as whether all patients will be protected by the reforms and whether patients can sue for injuries caused by HMO abuses. Republican staff submitted a document on Sunday night which they claim is a starting point, but it falls far short of what is needed to start a serious discussion. That isn't only our opinion. That happens to be the opinion of the principal Republican sponsors in the House of Representatives. 
   We continue to hope that the conference can be productive, but so far it has been an endless road to nowhere. The clock is ticking down on the current session of Congress. It is time to take stronger action. Make no mistake, we want a bill that can be signed into law this year. There is not much time left. We need to act and act now. 
   The gap between the Senate Republican plan and the bipartisan legislation enacted by the House in the Norwood-Dingell bill is wide. And the intransigence of the Republican conferees is preventing quality progress. The protections in the House-passed bill are urgently needed by patients across the country, yet the Republican leadership is adopting the practice of delay and denial that HMOs so often use themselves; delay and deny patients the care they need. 
   It is just as wrong for Congress to delay and deny these needed reforms as it is for HMOs to delay and deny needed care. It is wrong for HMOs to say that a patient suffering a heart attack 
   can't go to the nearest hospital emergency room. It is wrong for Congress not to take emergency action to end this abuse. It is medical malpractice for HMOs to say that children with rare cancers can't be treated by a qualified specialist. And it is legislative malpractice for Congress not to end this abuse. It is wrong for HMOs to deny access to patients to clinical trials that could save their lives. And it is wrong for Congress not to guarantee that the routine costs of participating in these lifesaving trials are covered. 
   The Clinton administration announced yesterday that Medicare will cover the medical costs for senior citizens participating in clinical trials. Congress should demonstrate equal leadership and do the same for all patients. 
   The House-Senate conference has made almost no progress on issues of vital importance to patients across America. The slow pace is unacceptable. After many weeks, despite the rhetoric from the Republican conferees, only two issues have been settled. They were virtually identical in both bills. While there seems to be conceptual agreement on a few more provisions, we have yet to reach agreement on the actual legislative language. The critical issues of holding health plans responsible for their actions and assuring that every American with private insurance is protected have not even been discussed seriously. 
   Staff of the Republican conferees have provided proposals that they portray as a step towards consensus. Those who support genuine patient protections on both sides of the aisle are committed to making real progress towards a successful resolution of the differences between the Senate bill and the bipartisan House bill. However, the GOP proposals fall far short of what is needed to give patients the protections they need. With a minor exception, their proposal would essentially maintain the current gaping loophole that allows so many health plans to escape responsibility when they make decisions that cause injury or death of the patient. 
   The Republican author pretends to indicate a sudden willingness to hold health plans accountable in some circumstances, but the American people would be shocked to see the details of this proposal. It is a sham. It is little more than a slap on the wrist for HMOs that refuse to comply with the law. It does nothing to address the vast majority of cases in which patients are injured or killed because of the health plan abuses that arbitrarily deny or delay needed care. 
   It is riddled with restrictions and limitations. It would protect employers  from liability when they were the ones who made the decisions that led to injury or death. In countless cases where persons were injured or even killed by the wrongful actions of their health plan, there would be no remedy. 
   It would force patients to go through an external appeals process, even if the disputed benefit could no longer help the patient because the injury was irreversible or because the patient has died. 
   Our amendment requires patients to exhaust the external appeals process before turning to the courts, but there is a key exception that allows patients who have already been harmed, or the family members of those who are killed, to go directly to the court. Few, if any, patients would ever be helped by the Republican proposal. It gives the appearance of a remedy without the reality. 
   The Republican proposal on the scope of the patient protections is another smokescreen. It does nothing to provide realistic guarantees for any individual not covered by the original Senate Republican bill. In fact, the proposal would reduce current protections for millions of Americans in many HMOs by explicitly preempting State laws. The result is that teachers, farmers, firefighters, police officers, small business employees, and many others would be turned into second-class citizens with second-class rights. 
   Here is the list: 23 million to 25 million State and local employees. These are the teachers, these are the firefighters, these are the police officials, these are the nurses, these are the doctors. They are effectively excluded from the GOP coverage. Not so under the Norwood-Dingell proposal. I don't know why they want to have second-class citizens with second-class rights for those individuals. All Americans deserve protection against HMO abuses. No patient should be denied adequate protection because of where they live or where they work. 
   The Republican claim that they have offered a serious compromise rings hollow for the millions of patients across this country who deserve protection for their rights, their health, and their lives. We are committed to passing a bill that protects all patients. At this point, the conference does not seem to be willing to produce a bill that will do the job, so we intend to pursue other options to enact these critical protections. 
   President Clinton has repeatedly urged the conference to complete work on a strong bill he can sign into law. That bill should include the key provisions of the Norwood-Dingell measure. It should not be delayed by controversial and unrelated tax or other proposals. 
   Our amendment contained the House-passed bipartisan consensus reforms written by Georgia Republican CHARLIE NORWOOD and Michigan Democrat JOHN DINGELL. It says we are putting patients first, not HMO profits. It says medical decisions will be made by doctors and patients, and not insurance company accountants. 
   The amendment establishes important protections for all patients, including coverage for emergency care at the nearest hospital, access to needed specialty care, transitional care for certain patients, direct access to obstetrical and gynecological care, coverage for routine costs of life-saving clinical trials, prohibition of improper HMO financial incentives and HMO gag clauses on physicians, and many other protections. 
   It establishes a fair, prompt, independent appeal process for all decisions involving medical judgments. It holds health plans accountable by holding them liable in cases where patients are injured or killed by HMO abuses. It protects employers from liability, with an exception only if they actually participate in the decision that results in injury or death in the particular case. It prohibits punitive damages if the HMO follows the recommendation of the independent reviewers. 
   The Senate stands, today, at a major crossroad for millions of patients across this Nation. We have an opportunity to provide long-overdue protections for all Americans in managed plans. We have an opportunity to hold HMOs accountable for their abuses. For the first time, the Senate has the opportunity to vote on the bipartisan compromise that passed the House overwhelmingly last year. 
   Last October, the House passed the Patients' Bill of Rights. Month after month after month, the Senate has refused to give patients across the Nation the protections they deserve. Today, at long last, the issue is out of the back rooms where it has been stalled for so long. The issue is in the open, and it is time for the Senate to vote. 
   I withhold the remainder of our time.

   Mr. President, we know a stall when we see one. This conference is a stall. And we know when we are on an endless road to nowhere. That is where we are. It isn't the Senator from Massachusetts saying it. It is here. It is the Republican principal leader in the House of Representatives, CHARLIE NORWOOD, I say to the Senator. He is the one who is saying it:  
   ``The Senate had eight months to develop a concise alternative to the House liability proposal,'' says NORWOOD, ``and if all they have to show is a three page staff-level letter that could mean anything and everything, it's impossible to take this conference process seriously.''  
   Dr. NORWOOD is trained in the right profession. He is a doctor and he is a dentist; and he knows how hard it is to pull teeth around here. That is what we have been trying to do with our Republican conferees. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, my good friend from Texas--he is my good friend--talks about freedom. He has put his finger on an issue. He wants to  give freedom to the HMOs and not provide the important services to patients. That is his kind of freedom. 
   I always enjoy listening to the Senator from Texas. I remember listening to him in 1993 when we had President Clinton's economic program. The Senator from Texas, I remember--someone can correct me--said: If we pass President Clinton's economic bill, we are going to have unemployment all around the nation, all around the nation. If we pass President Clinton's bill, we are going to have interest rates right up through the top of the roof. 
   We heard that speech. PHIL GRAMM was wrong then, and he is wrong tonight. 
   This issue is very basic and fundamental. It is an important one. This bill should have passed and become law in the last Congress. The first HMO bill to make sure that patients' rights were going to be protected was in 1997. It took us 2 years to get this legislation out of our committee. It took months of delay to get it before the Senate. It was passed almost a year ago. We still have not been able to have an agreement that will protect patients. 
   That is what is at issue, when you come right down to it. As much as PHIL GRAMM might like to say it, it isn't just Senator KENNEDY saying it. It is the fact that 300 organizations--representing the doctors and nurses in this country and every other health and medical group--support our position today. Two Republican leaders on this issue in the House of Representatives stood before their constituency earlier today and said that they believed we ought to take this action this afternoon. 
   I ask my friends from Oklahoma and Texas: What particular rights don't you want to provide to the American people who are included in our Patients' Bill of Rights? 
   What about the ability to hold plans accountable? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about making sure that children get specialists? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about having clinical trials? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about guaranteeing women access to an OB/GYN? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about having the right to get prescription drugs? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about prohibiting gag rules? Is that unacceptable? 
   What about independent external appeals? Is that unacceptable? 
   When you cut through the rhetoric--and we welcome the opportunity to cut through the rhetoric--you tell us that you are going to vote against this this afternoon. You spell out for us those agreements made in conference. We challenge you to lay out on the floor of the Senate this afternoon these various agreements that were made. The last agreement that was made was in March of this year. That was the last one in open session. We want to know what kind of protections you are not prepared to give the American people. We stand to protect the consumers, protect the patients, protect the children, protect the women, and protect the disabled in this country. That is what this is about. 
   In the movie ``As Good As It Gets'' last year, that wonderful picture for which Helen Hunt won the Oscar, there was a wonderful scene that everyone remembers. Helen Hunt starred as a mother whose child was not being provided needed care by her HMO. And every parent across this Nation laughed as they commiserated and said that is the way it is. 
   The consumers of America understand what is going on here. The question is whether the Senate of the United States is going to understand. 
   We have an opportunity to do something about it. I hope the Senate will vote for the Daschle amendment. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President it is a privilege to take this opportunity to honor Mr. and Mrs. J. Walter McCann of Burlington, Massachusetts. On Saturday, June 10, they will celebrate their golden wedding anniversary of 50 years together. They have been proud residents of Burlington since 1959, successfully raising 7 children, 16 grandchildren and one great granddaughter. 
   These two distinguished Americans have seen extraordinary advances in our state and our country in their lifetime. They are part of the great generation that saw the nation through the Depression and World War II, and their strong values give us all a deep and enduring sense of what it means to be an American. 
   Ruth Gertrude McCann is the youngest of eight sisters and one brother. She was born in her parents' home at 58 Warren Street in Arlington, Massachusetts on June 29, 1921, the beautiful daughter of Annie and Charles Dennen. Over the next three decades, ``Ma'' or ``Mom'' became an accomplished athlete and opera singer. She made a recording of her own, and gave a distinguished performance at Radio City Music Hall in New York City. There, she met and fell in love with Walter McCann, and they've had a wonderful marriage ever since. As she likes to say, ``Walter, why did you lead me to the altar?'' The answer is obvious to all. 
   In their neighborhood in Burlington, Ruth was every child's mom, especially when making jelly from the grapes picked on the hill behind her home, or ringing the metal triangle on the porch to call the children home each night for dinner. She loved her children's activities, and was often at Glee Club or Athletic Booster events, at bingo or bowling, or in the grandstand even on cold days at Pop Warner games. Her husband often traveled, and she became the ``Little Birdie in the Window'' who guided her family as it grew. 
   Joseph Walter McCann was born on January 21, 1920 in Lowell, Massachusetts in his family home, the second son of four children raised by Alma and William Francis McCann. An energetic young man, ``JW'' or ``Walter'' was an avid skier at Tuckerman's Ravine in New Hampshire each winter. He loved to ``walk uphill in the snow'' for the love of the sport with his cousin Jackie Stowell, his childhood best friend. 
   His wife and children have warm and vivid memories of his enormous trust and faith in the federal and state governments, whose actions were often eloquently and vigorously debated at the dinner table. His ``stand up and be counted'' philosophy of life was always challenging to those around him, and his quick wit entertained all who came to know him. 
   As a father, he would often take the family camping and nourish them with ``Campers Delight'' for dinner. Returning home from business trips, he was always well informed by the ``Little Birdie in the Window'' about his children's activities--and even about their mischievous behavior. His children were in awe that he knew so much. But most of all, each of his children and grandchildren will always remember listening to him read stories, especially at Christmas, and the loving phone calls made by Santa to each one of them every year. 
   Mr. President, on this special occasion, I congratulate Walter and Ruth McCann as they enjoy and celebrate their golden anniversary together. Their commitment to the principles and values of their marriage, their family, and their country deserve to be recognized and saluted. I wish them a very happy 50th wedding anniversary, and continuing wonderful times together in the years to come.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the distinguished Chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER. It takes the next step toward honoring the promise of lifetime health care for our military retirees. It removes the Title 10 provision that limits eligibility for military health care benefits to retirees under the age of 65. 
   The amendment expands health care benefits for Medicare-eligible military retirees by removing the age limitation on who qualifies for military health care programs. It gives all military retirees one consistent health care benefit, with TRICARE supplementing Medicare after the retiree reaches the age of 65. This is the right thing to do for our retirees. 
   I also support the amendment offered by Senator JOHNSON. It corrects an inconsistency in access to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Currently, our retired service members do not have the opportunity to participate in this program. While the out-of-pocket costs for some health plans offered under FEHBP may make this approach less attractive to senior military retirees, they should be given the option to join. Again, this is only fair. One, consistent health care program for all beneficiaries makes sense and is the right thing to do. 
   I commend Senator WARNER and Senator JOHNSON for their leadership in this important area. I support their amendments, and I urge my colleagues to approve them. 
   This year is, indeed, the Defense Department's ``Year of Health Care!'' In the Armed Services Committee, we began the year considering how to improve health care for active duty service members and their families, and to address the well-documented health  care needs of military retirees, especially those over the age of 65. 
   The Administration's budget request was a major positive step for active duty service members and their families. It proposed to expand TRICARE Prime to the families of service members who live far from military hospitals. It also proposed to eliminate the co-payments by active duty service members' families for medical care by civilian health care providers in TRICARE Prime. 
   We heard testimony from Secretary Cohen, General Shelton, the Service Secretaries, and each of the Service Chiefs, that the availability of health care for senior military retirees is a serious problem. They are conducting a variety of TRICARE demonstration programs to find the best way to address it. We also heard from retirees and the organizations that represent them that the problem is urgent, and that Congress needs to act now. 
   A promise of lifetime health care was made to our service members at the time of their enlistment. We have an obligation to meet that commitment. It is wrong that service men and women who have dedicated their lives serving and defending our country should lose their military health care benefits when they reach the age of 65. We must fix this injustice, and we must do it now. 
   The pending DOD Authorization Bill takes a first step towards honoring this promise by giving military retirees a retail and mail-order pharmacy benefit. Almost a third of them already have this benefit. 450,000 military retirees over the age of 65 have a pharmacy benefit under the base closing agreement. It provides a 90-day supply of prescription drugs by mail for an $8 co-payment, or a 30 day supply of prescription drugs from a retail pharmacy network for a 20 percent co-payment. The pending Defense Authorization Bill expands this benefit to all 1.4 million Medicare-eligible retirees. It makes sense, and it is fair that all military retirees over 65 have the pharmacy benefit, not just those affected by the base closing process. 
   This pharmacy benefit addresses one of the most important concerns of the military retiree community--the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   All of us are pleased that the Senate is taking this step to make good on our promise of health care to military 
   retirees. But we should not forget the millions of other senior citizens who need help with prescription drugs too. 
   It's long past time for Congress to mend another broken promise the broken promise of Medicare. Medicare is a guarantee of affordable health care for America's senior and disabled citizens. But that promise is being broken every day because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. It is time to keep that promise. 
   When Medicare was enacted in 1965, only three percent of private insurance policies offered prescription drug coverage. Today, ninety-nine percent of employment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug coverage--but Medicare is caught in a 35-year-old time warp. 
   Fourteen million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries--one-third of the total have no prescription drug coverage today. The most recent data indicate that only half of all senior citizens have drug coverage throughout the entire year. 
   The only senior citizens who have stable, secure, affordable drug coverage today are the very poor, who are on Medicaid. The idea that only the impoverished elderly should qualify for needed hospital and doctor care was rejected when Medicare was enacted. Republicans say they want to give prescription drugs only to the poor. But senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. 
   Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. 
   Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while almost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from negotiated discounts. 
   Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to Medicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or cannot afford to take them correctly. 
   Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for a host of dread diseases. But millions of Medicare beneficiaries will be left out and left behind if Congress fails to act. In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion in conducting research on new medicines and bringing them to the public. These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. 
   All patients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, which is the nation's largest insurer, does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy price for this glaring omission. 
   The ongoing revolution in health care makes prescription drug coverage more essential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare is as essential today as was coverage of hospital and doctor care in 1965, when Medicare was enacted. Senior citizens need that help--and they need it now. 
   So I say to my colleagues--while we are making good on broken promises, it's long past time to cover prescription drugs under Medicare for all elderly Americans. If we can cover military retirees, we can cover other senior citizens too. 
   Elderly Americans need and deserve prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their children and grandchildren. It is time to make this need a priority as well.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday we passed the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act. I commend everyone in the Senate who has worked so effectively on the issue of HIV and AIDS, beginning with Senator JEFFORDS, who has been a champion on this issue since the CARE Act was first authorized in 1990. I also thank the sponsors of this bill and our colleagues on the Health Committee who have sounded the alarm about the HIV/AIDS crisis through their unwavering support of the CARE Act reauthorization. 
   There is no stronger or more effective support than a full Senate unanimous vote today to show that, in each and every one of our states, we stand behind a bill that will enable so many citizens to receive the benefits of advances in therapies and support developed through our efforts over the past ten years. 
   At times of great human suffering or great tragedies or epidemics, it has often been the leadership of the federal government that has helped our fellow citizens deal with difficulties. It is in that very important tradition that this legislation was originally enacted and I urge the Senate to approve this important reauthorization of it today. 
   Ryan White, the young boy after whom the CARE Act was named, would have celebrated his twenty-eighth birthday this year. If we had we been as far along as we are now in providing life-prolonging and life-saving therapies, Ryan might well have been here with us, thanking each of us for the lifeline and the hope provided through the CARE Act. 
   Since the beginning of this epidemic, AIDS has claimed over 400,000 lives in the United States, and an estimated 900,000 Americans are living with HIV/AIDS today. AIDS continues to claim the most vulnerable among us. Like other epidemics before it, Aids is now hitting hardest in areas where knowledge about the disease is scarce and poverty is high. The epidemic has dealt a particularly severe blow to communities of color, which account for 73% of all new HIV infections. Women account for 30% of new infections. Over half of all new infections occur in persons under 25. This means that HIV infection of the nation's youth is a national crisis. 
   AIDS continues to kill brothers and sisters, children and parents, friends and loved ones--all in the prime of their lives. From the 30,000 AIDS orphans in New York City to the 21 year old gay man with HIV living in Iowa, this epidemic knows no geographic boundaries and has no mercy. 
   An estimated 34% of AIDS cases in the U.S. are in rural areas, and this percentage is growing. We know the challenges faced in rural communities where pulling together in the face of adversity is commonplace in other case. But where too often today there is silence and isolation because of the fear of condemnation over AIDS. 
   In addition, access to good medical care is often a significant barrier for many of our citizens with disabling diseases, who have to travel to urban centers to receive the care they need and deserve. As the AIDS crisis continues year after year, it has become more and more difficult for anyone to claim that AIDS is someone else's problem. In a very real way, we are all living with AIDS or are directly touched by AIDS. 
   The epidemic still kills over 47,000 persons a year. But we have good reason today to feel encouraged by the extraordinary medical advances made over the past ten years. AIDS deaths declined by 20% between 1997 and 1998. Many people with HIV and AIDS are leading longer and healthier lives today. 
   In addition, we have witnessed the smallest increase in new AIDS cases--11% in 1998, compared to an 18% increase in 1997. More families are leading productive lives in our society, in spite of their HIV diagnosis. This is the good news. But unfortunately, the number of people living with AIDS who can't afford expensive medical treatment is growing which means that greater demands are being placed on community-based organizations and state and local governments that serve them. 
   The advances in the development of life-saving HIV/AIDS drugs has come with an enormous price tag and these advances have been costly. An estimated 30% of person living with AIDS do not have health care coverage to pay for costly treatments. For these Americans, the CARE Act continues to provide the only means to obtain the health care and the treatment they need. 
   In Massachusetts we have seen an overall 77% decline in AIDS and HIV-related deaths since 1995. At the same time, however, like many other states, the changing HIV/AIDS trends and profiles are serious problems. AIDS and HIV cases increased in women by 11% from 1997 to 1998. 55% of persons living with AIDS in the state are person of color. State budgets often provide funds for prevention, screening and primary care. But no state could provide the major financial resources needed to help person living with HIV disease to obtain the medical and support services they need, without the Ryan White CARE Act. 
   By passing this legislation, we are making clear that the AIDS epidemic in the United States will receive the attention and public health response it deserves. The CARE Act reauthorization brings hope to over 600,000 persons each year in dealing with the devastating disease. It also brings hope and help to their families and their communities. 
   The enactment of this legislation in 1990 was an emergency response to the devastating effects of HIV on individuals, families, communities, and state and local governments. The Act targets funds to respond to the specific needs of specific communities. Title I targets the hardest hit metropolitan areas in the country. Local planning and priority-setting requirements under Title I assure that each of the Eligible Metropolitan Area can respond effectively to the local HIV/AIDS needs. 
   Title II funds emergency relief to states. It helps them to develop HIV care infrastructure, and to provide effective and life-sustaining drug therapies through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to over 61,000 persons each month. 
   Title III funds community health centers and other primary health care providers that serve areas with a significant and disproportionate need for HIV care. Many of these community health centers are located in the hardest hit areas, serving low income communities. Title IV of the CARE Act meets the specific needs of women, children, and families. 
   This reauthorization builds on these past accomplishments, while recognizing the challenge of ensuring access to HIV drug treatments for all who need them. Our goal is to reduce health disparities in vulnerable communities, and improve the distribution and quality of services. Senator JEFFORDS and I have worked together to address new challenges we face in the battle against AIDS. This reauthorization will create additional funding for states that have had to limit access to new therapies due to lack of resources. The bill also targets new funds to smaller metropolitan areas and to rural and urban communities, where the epidemic is growing and adequate infrastructure is lacking. 
   In addition, the bill funds early intervention services to promote early diagnosis of HIV disease, referral to health  care, and initiation of effective treatments to reduce the onset of the illness and its progression. Health disparities in communities of color will be reduced by requiring states and local communities funded by the Act to plan, set priorities, and fund initiatives to meet documented local needs in dealing with the epidemic. The reauthorization will also establish quality and accountability in HIV service delivery, by strengthening quality management activities to make them consistent with Public Health Service guidelines. 
   Our action yesterday affirmed our long-standing commitment to citizens with HIV/AIDS and to sound public policy for all citizens, families and communities touched by this devastating disease. We have the resources to continue to battle AIDS. We must continue to deal with this disease with the same courage shown to us ten years ago by the valiant ten year old, Ryan White, who spoke out against the ignorance the discrimination faced by so many people living with AIDS. The lives saved by our efforts through the CARE Act will mean a chance for real hope as medical research comes closer and closer to finding a cure.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I am reintroducing this important bill because of the seriousness of the problem it addresses and to spur this Congress to take action. I commend Senator MIKULSKI for her continued leadership on this legislation to close the critical gaps in our imported food safety laws. 
   Citizens deserve to know that the foods they eat are safe and wholesome, regardless of their source. The United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world. Yet, every year, millions of Americans become sick, and thousands die, from eating contaminated food. Food-borne illnesses cause billions of dollars a year in medical costs and lost productivity. Often, the source of the problem is imported food. 
   The number of reports in the press of illnesses caused by eating contaminated imported foods has grown steadily over the past few years. 
   For example, in 1997, school children in five states contracted Hepatitis A from frozen strawberries served in the school cafeterias. Fecal contamination is a potential source of Hepatitis A, and the strawberries the children ate came from a farm in Mexico where workers had little access to sanitary facilities. 
   Earlier this year, cases of typhoid fever in Florida were linked to a frozen tropical fruit product from Guatemala. Again, poor sanitary conditions appear to be at the root of the problem. 
   Gastrointestinal illness has been linked to soft cheeses from Europe. Bacterial food poisoning has been attributed to canned mushrooms from the Far East. 
   The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and an increase in the number of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, make microbial contamination of food a major public health challenge. 
   Ensuring the safety of imported food is a huge task. Americans now enjoy a wide variety of foods from around the world and have access to fresh fruits and vegetables year round. In 1997, the Food Safety Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture handled 118,000 entries of imported meat and poultry. The FDA handled far more--2.7 million entries of other imported food. Current FDA procedures and resources allowed for less than two percent of those 2.7 million imports to be physically inspected. Clearly, we need to do better. 
   The FDA lacks sufficient authority to prevent contaminated food imports from reaching our shores. The agency has no legal authority to require that food imported into the United States has been prepared, packed and stored under conditions that provide the same level of public health protection as similar food produced in the United States. Under current procedures, the FDA takes random samples of imports as they arrive at the border. The imports often continue on their way to stores in all parts of the country while testing is being done, and it is often  difficult to recall the food if a problem is found. Unscrupulous importers make the most of the loopholes in the law, including substituting cargo, falsifying laboratory results, and attempting to bring a refused shipment in again, at a later date or at a different port. 
   The legislation we are reintroducing today will give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the additional authority needed to assure that food imports are as safe as food grown and prepared in this country. 
   It will give the FDA greater authority to deal with outbreaks of food-borne illness and to bar further imports of dangerous foods until improvements at the source can guarantee the safety of future shipments. This authority covers foods that have repeatedly been associated with food-borne disease, have repeatedly been found to be adulterated, or have been linked to a catastrophic outbreak of food-borne illness. 
   The legislation will also close loopholes in the law and give the FDA better tools to deal with unscrupulous importers. 
   In addition, the legislation will authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to target resources toward enhanced surveillance and prevention activities to deal with food-borne illnesses, including new diagnostic tests, better training of health professionals, and increased public awareness about food safety. 
   Too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of food-borne illness. The measure we are proposing is designed to reduce that risk as much as possible, both immediately and for the long term. We know that there are powerful special interests that put profits ahead of safety. But Americans need and deserve laws that better protect their food supply. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that it is enacted as soon as possible.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to work with Senator DOMENICI on this important issue of mental health care, and I commend him for his leadership. In American medicine today, patients with biochemical problems in their liver are treated with compassion, but those with biochemical problems in their brain are treated harshly. That discrepancy is unacceptable. The stigma against the mentally ill is a blatant form of discrimination. The legislation that Senator DOMENICI and I are introducing is intended to correct this inequity and to assure that those with mental illness will get the treatment they need. 
   The first-ever Surgeon General's Report on Mental Health was released last December. It provides a solid foundation on which to build. It is a powerful statement that treating the problems of mental illness more effectively must be one of our Nation's highest priorities. The Surgeon General's Report makes two basic points. Mental illness is a national crisis--and our treatment of the mentally ill is a national disgrace. 
   One in five Americans will experience some form of mental illness this year. Mental illnesses are our second leading cause of disability. Yet success rates for treating mental illnesses are as high as 80 percent. Effective drugs with limited side effects have become available in recent years. Note that the success rates for treatment of other chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes, are not quite as high. But people with high blood pressure or diabetes still seek treatment. Unfortunately, fear, stigma and lack of available treatment combine to prevent individuals with mental illness from seeking treatment. 
   There are several reasons for this. First is stigma. People are afraid to admit mental illness to their doctors, or even to themselves. In fact, two-thirds of those with diagnosable mental illnesses do not seek treatment. Second, there is a very low public understanding of mental disorders and of the fact that they are treatable. Third, individuals with mental illness may not be correctly diagnosed or appropriately referred for treatment. Fourth, people who do seek treatment for mental illness find that it is not available or that their insurance plans will not cover it. 
   One result of the lack of treatment is suicide. Fifty percent more Americans die by their own hand each year than  are killed by other; 29,264 suicides occurred in 1998 compared with 17,350 homicides. Suicide is the third leading killer of the Nation's youth. 
   What is happening to many of those who suffer from mental illness? Jails and prisons represent the largest residential center for those suffering from mental illnesses, but few prisoners receive treatment there. 
   The bill that Senator DOMENICI and I are introducing today, ``The Mental Health Early Intervention, Treatment, and Prevention Act of 2000,'' is a giant step toward giving mental health the priority it deserves. But we cannot promote mental health without eradicating the stigma surrounding mental illness. Since fear and ignorance compound the problem, a campaign to improve public understanding about mental illness will combat the ignorance and decrease the fear. 
   Increased public understanding is not sufficient, however. Successful treatment of those suffering from mental illness requires effective care by skilled professionals. Many individuals with mental illness do not realize the nature of scope of their problem, and those whom they might encounter in daily life are unable to assist them. Our bill will enable us to reach out to find persons with mental illness. It will train teachers, police and others to provide front-line help. 
   Our legislation provides for the establishment of suicide prevention programs. It will also develop screening programs to identify and reach out to those with mental illnesses so that they seek effective treatment. We will also establish response teams and designate centers to provide patients with such treatment. 
   Patients suffering from mental illness are more likely to experience a greater number of physical ailments as well. Their primary care physicians are often not equipped to recognize mental illness or to make the appropriate referral to a mental health professional. Our bill will develop programs to train primary care health providers to treat the physical symptoms of those who suffer from mental illness, while making sure that they obtain care for their mental well-being too. 
   In addition, ignorance of the biology of the brain and the mind has often prevented the development of cures for many forms of mental illness. Our bill will develop educational programs to increase the numbers of researchers investigating the science of mental illness. Special emphasis will be given to training psychiatrists and psychologists in effective ways to bring the discoveries of the laboratory more quickly to the bedside of the patient. 
   Our bill will develop new strategies to assist individuals with mental illness in the criminal justice system and to strengthen the understanding of mental illness by law enforcement officials. It is likely, as a result, that many who suffer from mental illness will receive treatment rather than punishment, so that they contribute to society instead of being incarcerated by society. 
   Mental illness is a serious national problem that all of us must deal with more effectively. Our goal in this legislation is to give mental health the high priority it deserves. The enactment of this bill will help those millions of our fellow citizens who, at this moment, are suffering in silence.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if I could ask the majority leader, since probably the first priority of American families--even beyond having small class sizes, well-trained teachers, modern schools and computers, digital divide, afterschool programs, and safety and security in the schools--is the reduced opportunity for children to be able to have access to guns prior to going to school, it is not going to make much difference if we have small class sizes and guns are in the school. 
   I am asking the majority leader if he is unwilling to permit a vote on the Senate floor of the Lautenberg amendment, which is really directed towards safety and security in the schools, as part of the measure. I think this is enormously important because we want to see the conclusion of the debate on ESEA. But I think it is important for Members to know whether we are going to be denied an opportunity to deal with what is the most important concern of parents; that is, safety and security in schools. 
   I am wondering what the position of the majority leader is on that issue.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If I could briefly follow up, in 1994, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM, offered an amendment cosponsored by the Republican leader. There was no objection from that side of the aisle to that measure at that particular time. I don't know how the Senator voted at that time, or whether he indicated it was appropriate to bring it up at that time. But it was noted as the gun amendment. The Senate has addressed the gun issues. It was brought up by the Senator from Texas and was cosponsored by the majority leader at that time. I believe the Senator from Mississippi voted for it at that time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues, and thank Senator MIKULSKI for offering this resolution. I join my friend from the State of Washington in urging that all Members--Republicans and Democrats alike--support it. But I commend Senator MIKULSKI for her initiation of this issue. And we express our appreciation to Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN for the action they have taken to express our full confidence and support for the police officers here at the Capitol. 
   How time flies, as we remember those memorial services for Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, who gave up their lives in order to try to save the lives of the Members of Congress. That is the kind of professionalism that is typical of this corps of men and women and that all of us too often take for granted. I strongly oppose any provision in the Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill that would slash the Capitol Police budget. Any such reduction would show a flagrant disregard for the security of the Capitol. It is shocking that House Republicans voted for this cut, after a non-partisan study concluded that even the ``current Capitol Police Force staffing is insufficient to meet today's threat environment.'' Members on both sides of the aisle should be able to agree on this basic necessity of our time. 
   The budget must have room for adequate law enforcement. Police officers deserve a fair wage, equal to their risks and responsibilities. The way we treat Capitol Police officers is a measure of the respect we hold for them as professionals. No officers should have to jeopardize their lives to do their job because of inadequate resources and inadequate support. 
   The Capitol Police deserve enormous respect for their dedicated service. What these officers do as professionals affects the welfare and the very lives of every member of Congress, every staff person, and every visitor to the Capitol. They deserve our highest praise and gratitude for the skill and commitment they bring to their work. 
   The House Republican bill is a symptom of the larger problem facing communities across the country. Democrats have strongly supported the hiring of more local police officers and more school resource officers--giving communities and schools the tools they need to ensure the safety of citizens and students. Yet, Senate and House Republicans consistently fight us every step of the way. 
   Last week, the Senate Republican leadership attempted to block debate on sensible and long overdue gun control measures. 
   Last year, Republicans defeated an amendment to expand the Community Oriented Policing Program, which would have provided additional needed resources to communities across the United States in the ongoing battle against crime. And Republicans continue to target that successful program for elimination; 
   On the Juvenile Justice bill, Republicans blocked a Democratic effort to create a National Center for School Safety and Youth Violence; 
   On the same bill, Republicans rejected a Democratic amendment to encourage more effective after-school programs, so that one million additional children would be off the streets, out of trouble, and engaged in worthwhile school and community activities. 
   Republicans also defeated one Democratic amendment to expand the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative, to enable 150 additional communities to build partnerships between schools, parents and law enforcement to reduce truancy. The initiative would also provide mentoring for troubled youth, and teach students how to resolve conflict without resorting to violence. 
   Time and again, Democrats are placed in the position of fighting against Republican opposition in our effort to enact public safety measures that make sense--that keep families, schools and neighborhoods safe. Republicans would rather kowtow to 
   the National Rifle Association and other special interest groups than listen to the American people. 
   We too infrequently recognize the professionalism and also the dedication of these officers. The least we can do is to treat these men and women fairly. And more importantly, what we can do--and we should do--is to commend them for their continued professionalism and for their devotion to duty. 
   I join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation to the two leaders on this appropriations bill, Senators BENNETT and FEINSTEIN, for what they have done in this area. 
   I will mention one other area, though, that finds fault with the actions of the leadership in the House of Representatives, in this term, the Republican leadership. 
   I find it difficult to understand what the Republican leadership has against low-income workers. Here we have the greatest prosperity in the history of this country, and the Republican leadership has been aligned to deny us a simple vote on a 50-cent increase in the minimum wage for 1 year, and a 50-cent increase in the next year. We have effectively been denied the opportunity to do so. 
   We have had to go through extraordinary gymnastics here on the floor. And then, finally, we end up with a 3-year bill, which is an insult to even the 10 million Americans who are working at the lowest levels of the economic ladder, and then tying on to that $100 billion in unpaid tax goodies for the wealthiest individuals and the most powerful corporations of this country. I think that is shameful action by this body. 
   But we have been battling, and we are going to continue to battle. We are going to remind our friends that even though they do not like voting on an increase in the minimum wage--and they use every effort to try to avoid that--they are going to be faced with the continued opportunities to do so until we get a fair adjustment in the minimum wage, which these working families are due. 
   But now we have not only opposition in terms of an increase in the minimum wage, but opposition to an adjustment in the cost of living for those individuals who are at the lowest level of service in the National Government. The House Republican leadership wants  to make sure that these employees are not going to get any cost of living increase, even though we have seen a generous cost-of-living increase for the Members. These workers are the ones who will get no increase--they are the press operators who work the presses, the bindery workers who bind the volumes of paper that we produce in this chamber, and the workers at the printing plant who haul paper and move the printed products. There is no increase for even these workers, the laborers in the printing office who publish the reports that go across to the libraries to inform the American people as to the actions of the Congress. 
   But it is not just the Government Printing Office employees who will suffer from this cutting of the cost of living adjustment. Mail clerks and laborers in the Library of Congress, Secretaries in the Congressional Budget Office, and Information Receptionists, Library Aides, and Reference Files Assistants at the Congressional Research Service--those who carry and sort the mail, who type and file our various reports and documents, and those who assist with the cataloguing and researching of all the reports and documents that we in Congress generate--all of these employees will be denied a fair cost of living increase by the House Republican leadership. 
   These are among the lowest of the low paid by the Federal Government. They are men and women who have a great sense of pride and dignity in the work they do. They are part of the team in terms of trying to serve this country. Nonetheless, the way we deal with them is to say: No, you are not going to be able to get the adjustment that others are going to be able to get in the 
   Congress, and that those of the higher level pay scales are going to get in general. 
   That is basically unfair, and it is unwise and unjust. I do not know what the explanation is. Why is it? Why is it that we effectively make sure that those individuals who are working in the darkest areas of the building and are absolutely key elements do not get an increase? If you take those individuals out of this whole process, you are not going to get the printing of the records, which are reflective of the Government in action, and you are going to basically paralyze, in a very important respect, the representatives of Government having the information which is necessary to make sound judgment. 
   Maybe there is an explanation for it, but I do not see it. It is unfair and unjust. It is something where we have to say, if you have opposition to an increase in the minimum wage, you are hurting those workers. And who are those workers? They are primarily women because 60 percent of minimum-wage workers are women. This impacts children because fully one-third of the women who are earning the minimum wage have children under 18. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue because a disproportionate percent of minimum-wage workers are men and women of color. 
   Most of all, it is a fairness issue that men and women who are going to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, should not live in poverty in the richest country in the world, when we are having the most extraordinary economic prosperity in the history of this Nation. It just is wrong. 
   We are facing that blind opposition by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States that says no to those working members of our economy. Who are they? They are the men and women who work in our nursing homes looking after parents who may be in nursing homes. They are the men and women who are working in our schools as assistant teachers. They are men and women who are looking after children when their parents are out there working and trying to put food on their table. 
   We are saying, no, they are not going to get an increase in the minimum wage. No, we are not going to give it to them. And no, we are not going to give a cost of living increase to other members who are at the lower level of the pay scale in our nation's Capitol. 
   That is an absolutely unfair, unjust, and unacceptable position. I am delighted that here in the Senate, in a bipartisan way, that position has been rejected.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at long last, the Senate is considering the nomination of Timothy Dyk for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Mr. Dyk is an exceptional nominee who has waited far too long for action by the Senate. He is a nationally known and respected attorney who has been approved by the American Bar Association and was well received by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He deserves confirmation by the Senate by an overwhelming bipartisan majority today. 
   Mr. Dyk is an honors graduate of Harvard College and Harvard Law School, where he was a member of the Law Review. After graduation, he served as a Supreme Court law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren, as well as for Justices Stanley REED and Harold Burton. He served in the Justice Department for a year in the early 1960's and has spent the last 37 years as a distinguished and highly respected attorney in private practice in Washington, D.C.. He has argued cases before the Supreme Court and in numerous federal courts of appeals, including five cases before the Federal Circuit. He clearly has the qualifications and ability to serve on that Circuit with great distinction. 
   Mr. Dyk's nomination is supported by a variety of corporations and organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Labor Policy Association, the American Trucking Association, Kodak, and IBM. He is also supported by the American Center for Law and Justice and has been described by that group as ``an exceptional advocate,'' who ``would be a fine jurist on the Federal Circuit.'' 
   For a number of years, Mr. Dyk served as lead counsel for the Lubrizol Corporation in a number of patent litigations. Lubrizol's Chairman and CEO has written,  
   Mr. Dyk was exceptionally effective in briefing and arguing the several appeals in the Federal Circuit that occurred in those cases and demonstrated the ability to provide exceptional service on the federal bench. He also performed an instrumental role in ultimate disposition of those cases through mediation, which he urged on the parties and skillfully guided through extensive and difficult negotiations.  
   Mr. Dyk is also an active member of numerous bar organizations, and he has served as Chair of the D.C. Circuit Membership Evaluation Committee of the American Academy of Appellate Lawyers. In addition, he is an active participant in the community. In every respect, he is well-qualified for appointment to the Federal Circuit. He should have been confirmed long ago, and I urge my colleagues to approve his nomination today.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I once again bring the attention of the Senate to the importance of completing action on an issue that is of fundamental importance to families all across this country, and that is the role of the Congress in addressing the elementary and secondary education challenge which exists across our Nation in which local communities and States are taking action and in which the Federal Government is also a partner. 
   We have had a total of 6 days debate. Of the 6 days, 2 were debate only. We were not permitted to have votes on 2 of those 6 days, so we had 4 days of debate and votes. We had a total of 8 amendments. One was a voice amendment. There were 7 rollcalls. Of the 7 rollcalls, 2 of those rollcalls were on amendments we had indicated we were prepared to accept. Essentially, we have had 4 days of debate and 5 votes on this legislation. 
   This is what our good Republican friends have indicated to us about the priority of education. 
   In January 6, we have our majority leader saying:  
   Education is going to be a central issue this year. For starters, we must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is important.  
   These are his remarks to the U.S. Conference of Mayors luncheon on January 29:  
   But education is going to have a lot of attention, and it's not going to be just words.  
   On June 22, he said:  
   Education is No. 1 on the agenda of Republicans in the Congress this year.  
   In remarks to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on February 1, 2000, he said:  
   We're going to work very hard on education. I have emphasized that every year I have been majority leader, and Republicans are committed to doing that.  
   On February 3, in a speech to the National Conference of State Legislatures, he said:  
   We must reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Education will be a high priority in this Congress.  
   Congress Daily, on April 20, said this:  
   Lott said last week that his top priorities in May include an agriculture sanctions bill, ESEA reauthorization, and passage of four appropriations bills.  
   May 1:  
   This is very important legislation. I hope we can debate it seriously and have amendments in the education area. Let's talk education.  
   On May 2, I asked Senator LOTT:  
   On ESEA, have you scheduled a cloture vote on that? Senator Lott said: 
   No, I have not....... But education is No. 1 in the minds of the American people all across the country, in every State, including my own State. For us to have a good, healthy, and even a protracted debate and amendments on education I think is the way to go.  
   On May 9, at the time when the legislation was pulled down, I asked the majority leader:  
   As I understand, we will have an opportunity to come back to ESEA next week. Is that the leader's plan?  
   He said:  
   That is my hope and intent.  
   We are about to go out for a period of 10 days. We are reaching the end of May. We have no end in sight for the completion of legislation dealing with the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We have been prepared to enter into short time agreements on the various proposals. I don't know of a single amendment on this side on which we could not enter into a time agreement of 1 hour equally divided. We put that forward and we have outlined in detail the various education amendments that we had intended to offer. But we are not getting focus, attention, and priority on this legislation. 
   I don't believe the American people want us to stonewall on the issue of education. I don't think they want the Senate gagged from having a full debate, discussion and action. We have had other legislation, such as the bankruptcy bill, that went for 15 or 16 days of debate before completion. We can take the time that is necessary and also complete the work on the appropriations bills. But we are serious about bringing this matter to the floor. We are going to raise it continuously. We want to take action. We think families across this country know appropriations are important, but those appropriations are not going to actually be expended until the fall. Families want to know, as we go on into this year, what we are going to do on education and education policy. We owe it  to the families, and we have every intention of pursuing it on this side of the aisle. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, literacy is the foundation of learning, but too many Americans today are not able to read a single sentence. Nearly 40 percent of the nation's children are unable to read at grade-level by the end of the third grade. In communities with high concentrations of at-risk children, the failure rate is an astonishing 60 percent. As a result, their entire education is likely to be derailed. 
   In the battle against literacy, it is not enough to reach out more effectively to school-aged children. We must start earlier--and reach children before they reach school. Pediatricians like Dr. Barry Zuckerman at the Boston Medical Center have been telling us for years that reading to children from birth through school age is a medical issue that should be raised at every well child visit, since a child's brain needs this kind of stimulation to grow to its full potential. Reading to young children in the years before age 5 has a profound effect on their ability  to learn to read. But too often the problem is that young children do not have access to books appropriate to their age. A recent study found that 60 percent of the kindergarten children who performed poorly in school did not own a single book. 
   The Book Stamp Act that Senator HUTCHISON and I are introducing today is a step to cure that problem. Our goal is to see that all children in this country have books of their own before they enter school. 
   Regardless of culture or wealth, one of the most important factors in the development of literacy is home access to books. Students from homes with an abundance of reading materials are substantially better readers than those with few or no reading materials available. 
   But it is not enough to just dump a book into a family's home. Since young children cannot read to themselves, we must make sure that an adult is available who interacts with the child and will read to the child. 
   In this day of two-parent working families, young children spend substantial time in child care and family care facilities, which provide realistic opportunities for promoting literacy. Progress is already being made on this approach. Child Care READS!, for example, is a national communications campaign aimed at raising the awareness of the importance of reading in child care settings. 
   The Book Stamp Act will make books available to children and parents through these child care and early childhood education programs. 
   The act authorizes an appropriation of $50 million a year for this purpose. It also creates a special postage stamp, similar to the Breast Cancer Stamp, which will feature an early learning character, and will sell at a slightly higher rate than the normal 33 cents, with the additional revenues designated for the Book Stamp Program. 
   The resources will be distributed through the Child Care and Development Block Grant to the state child care agency in each state. The state agency then will allocate its funds to local child care research and referral agencies throughout the state on the basis of local need. 
   There are 610 such agencies in the country, with at least one in every state. These non-profit agencies, offer referral services for parents seeking child care, and also provide training for child care workers. The agencies will work with established book distribution programs such as First Book, Reading is Fundamental, and Reach Out and Read to coordinate the buying of discounted books and the distribution of the books to children. 
   Also, to help parents and child care providers become well informed about the best ways to read to children and the most effective use of books with children at various stages of development, the agencies will provide training and technical assistance on these issues. 
   Our goal is to work closely with parents, children, child care providers and publishers to put at least one book in the hands of every needy child in America. Together, we can make significant progress in early childhood literacy, and I believe we can make it quickly. 
   We know what works to combat illiteracy. We owe it to the nation's children and the nation's future to do all we can to win this battle.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, of the 10 minutes, I yield myself 8 1/2 minutes. 
   I hope the American people are beginning to understand the difficulty those of us who want sensible and responsible opportunities are having in putting before the Senate proposals which we think can reduce youth violence and the availability of weapons to children in this country. We were stalled yesterday, and we have been stalled again to the point where we are acting only on a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. We are, because of what I consider an abuse of the rules of the Senate, denied an opportunity for accountability by the Members. 
   I hear a great deal about responsibility. I hear the speeches about how we ought to be responsible and parents ought to be responsible. I say the Senate ought to be responsible. The Senate of the United States ought to be responsible, the House of Representatives ought to be responsible, and at least have a debate about these issues rather than relying on the gymnastics of parliamentary procedures to deny us that opportunity. 
   When our good friends talk about responsibility, let's start right where it should begin, and that is right in the Senate. 
   It ought to be self-evident that children in the United States of America have the easiest access to guns of any country in the world. 
   We know we have more youth deaths than the next 25 industrial nations combined. Easy access to weapons has been demonstrated. 
   The argument is: Why aren't we doing more in terms of prosecutions? Or, Why aren't we doing more in terms of helping children? I daresay, that those of us who are in strong support of the Daschle amendment take a back seat to no one in trying to find ways to help and assist parents, schools, local communities, and church leaders in local communities to try to deal with the problems of violence in the community. 
   What we have also seen from Justice Department statistics is that there has been vigorous enforcement of the laws in sending people off to jail who are violating gun laws. Where the penalty is above 3 years, there is a 30-percent increase in prosecutions. In State law, there is a 25-percent increase in prosecutions for those with a penalty below 3 years. There are 25 percent more criminals going to jail today than 7 years ago in relation to gun offenses. 
   Let's free ourselves from the adage: we have enough laws on the books--let's just enforce them. The statistics respond to that statement. 
   The second question is, if we go ahead and pass these laws, that isn't the only problem. We understand it is not the only problem. But we are stalemated in trying to deal with the underlying problems, as well. 
   Let's think of where we are. We have a number of different proposals to try to help and assist parents and schools and local communities. For example, we have our Safe and Drug Free Schools Program that provides help and assistance to every school in this country. We have found that any effort to increase the funding for that program has been opposed by the Republicans. That is the principal instrument to try to help our schools develop their own kinds of programs to deal with the problems of violence in the schools. 
   The Justice Department's Safe Schools and Healthy Students Program attempts to help schools. And it too has been sidetracked by the majority. 
   The various prevention programs in the Juvenile Justice bill like the juvenile drug and alcohol treatment programs, school counseling, and other school-based prevention programs like the FAST Program--which is the Families and Schools Together Program--and the centers of excellence to treat children who have witnessed or suffered serious violent crimes, all of those programs are put on the back burner. We cannot get funding or support for those programs. 
   Let's not stand out here and say that there are other causes of violence. We understand that. We also understand that people in other countries are seeing our movies, they are viewing our games, and yet they do not have this proliferation of violence. Maybe we ought to be taking a look at some of those issues, but we are being denied now on the most basic and fundamental issue, and that is the issue of the proliferation of weapons. 
   With all due respect to our friends on the other side of the aisle, let's look at what their position has been in terms of the proliferation of weapons. I was here when we passed the McClure-Volkmer Act. I voted in opposition to that bill, which opened up the whole gun show loophole. The McClure-Volkmer bill effectively facilitated the sale of guns to criminals and juveniles by turning gun shows into a booming business. It severely restricted the ability of the ATF to conduct inspections of the business premises of federally licensed firearms dealers. It raised the burden of proof for violations of federal gun laws. That is what the NRA has supported on the McClure-Volkmer bill. 
   Then we had the Brady bill. They resisted it every step of the way. It took 7 years to pass the Brady Bill. And the NRA's ongoing attacks on the National Instant Check System show that 
   their claims to support background checks are utterly specious. 
   Then we had the whole question about the ATF. As I have mentioned previously, the NRA and the Republicans oppose sufficient numbers of law enforcement officials in the ATF. We have the same number of law enforcement officials now as we had 25 years  ago, with basically flat funding. Everyone around here knows what that means. It means a real drop in the funding by about 30 percent. So to our good friends on the other side: untie the hands of law enforcement. Their hands are tied behind their backs, and you ask: why aren't they enforcing the laws? Come on now. 
   We are prepared to do something in terms of these other issues, as I mentioned. We have passed the SAMSHA program, which deals with issues of mental health and tries to provide resources to local communities to work with schools, religious organizations, and law enforcement, to reduce the proliferation of weapons. 
   What are the radical proposals we keep hearing about that are going to basically undermine the Constitution of the United States? 
   We have a gun show loophole. We want to go back to where we were prior to the time of the McClure-Volkmer Act. That is where we basically want to go. It has passed the Senate and we cannot even get consideration of it. 
   I listened to my good friend from Montana talk about holding parents responsible. That is the proposal of the Senator from Illinois, what is called the CAP proposal. We have it in Massachusetts. 
   Is the Senator from Montana, or anyone on the other side, willing to sponsor that and bring it up this afternoon? Of course they are not. 
   Holding parents responsible is what we want and what they oppose. We listened to how we want family responsibility, parental responsibility. That is what this child access prevention legislation is all about. But we are denied even the opportunity to debate it. 
   So don't lecture us about it. Don't lecture us about it. 
   Safety locks, to try to make sure the 1,200,000 guns which are loaded and unlocked in households across America--where children will go this afternoon--have safety locks. Requiring that every new gun have a safety lock, and trying to hold parents responsible, is that so dramatic? Of course it is not.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I have a minute and a half, I believe. 
   Mr. President, the possession of automatic weapons, to change this from the age of 18 to 21, we are opposed on that. 
   This morning I looked on the web to see what has been happening in the last few days. 
   May 15: Georgia boy 12, accused of killing a 10-year-old cousin. 
   May 15: Chicago sees five youths injured by gunfire in 36 hours. 
   May 15: Michigan boy 17, son of mayor and Congressman--one of our colleagues--dies from self-inflicted gunshot. 
   May 11: Mississippi, 5-year-old shoots sister, 2, with mom's unlocked gun. 
   May 11: Arkansas boy uses gun from home to shoot at officer. 
   May 10: Florida, 5-year-old takes gun to prekindergarten. 
   May 8: Montana, teen dies from accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. 
   The list goes on. That is in the last week alone. 
   For how many more weeks will we have these lists? How many more weeks are we going to be denied by the Republican leadership the opportunity to do something about it? 
   That is what this debate is about. That is why their position is irresponsible. That is why we are going to continue to battle during the course of this Congress to protect these children in this country who need our protection. 
   To recap, since Columbine, the National Rifle Association and the Republican leadership in Congress have succeeded in blocking any action on new or stronger gun laws with a blunt response: ``We don't need new gun laws, just enforce the laws already on the books.'' 
   We need to expose the National Rifle Association and the Republican hypocrisy. The NRA has systematically weakened federal gun laws over the past two decades and has made law enforcement's job of apprehending criminals more difficult. 
   There are three major components of our weak gun laws that have the fingerprints of the NRA all over them: The McClure-Volkmer Act, the Brady Law, and the funding of ATF agents. 
   The NRA-sponsored Firearms Owners' Protection Act of 1986, also known as the McClure-Volkmer Act, is perhaps the strongest evidence of NRA hypocrisy on gun enforcement. With its passage, the NRA accomplished the following: 
   It allowed unlicensed individuals to sell their personal firearms as a ``hobby.'' The result has been the sale of massive numbers of firearms to criminals and juveniles without background checks. This provision not only created a vast secondary market --it also opened up the ``gun show loophole,'' which many of us in Congress are now struggling to close. 
   It facilitated the sale of guns to criminals and juveniles by turning gun shows into a booming business. 
   It allowed criminals to keep or regain their rights to own guns. 
   It severely restricted the ability of the ATF to conduct inspections of the business premises of federally licensed firearms dealers. 
   It raised the burden of proof for violations of federal gun laws. 
   The seven-year battle to pass the Brady Bill and the NRA's ongoing attacks on the National Instant Check System show that the NRA's claims to support background checks is utterly specious. 
   Before the Brady Bill was passed, 32 states lacked a background check system. A criminal could walk into a gun store, sign a form stating he is not a prohibited purchaser, and walk out with a gun. The form would simply be filed away, with no follow-through to make sure that the purchaser's statements were accurate. The Brady Bill was designed to close this loophole by reducing an honest background check and waiting period, and the NRA worked tirelessly to defeat it. 
   Only when the NRA realized that the Brady Bill was unstoppable did it shift its efforts to weaken the law as much as possible. It attempted to push through the immediate reliance on an ``instant check'' system--a system that was not technically feasible at the time. 
   Even after embracing an ``instant check'' system, the NRA has continually sought to undermine the system's integrity and efficiency, by preventing law enforcement from maintaining any records on the background checks it conducts. 
   Most telling is the NRA's continued opposition to background checks on all gun purchasers, including all gun show sales and private sales. If the NRA supports background checks, why do they want to keep this gaping loophole open in our gun laws? 
   Finally, it is no secret that the NRA has tried to undermine federal law enforcement, particularly the ATF. NRA rhetoric combined with its campaign to financially cripple the ATF demonstrate the gun lobby's single-minded thoroughness in carrying out its extremist agenda. The NRA makes the gun laws weak and difficult to enforce--and it also undermines the agency that has primary responsibility for enforcing those laws.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I hope our majority leader understands the friendship and the personal affection that many of us feel for him personally. This really isn't a personal issue. It is about how we are defining the role of the Senate. 
   As I remember history, our Founding Fathers wanted this to be a place where there would be free and open discussion and the clash of ideas--not a place for a narrow, partisan agenda; not where there was going to be, as the Democratic leader pointed out, effectively, the gagging of Members from being able to represent different ideas and different positions. 
   We come from all different parts of the country. We represent a variety of interests. This institution is supposed to be, as I thought it was going to be, about representing various positions and having the clash of ideas. 
   There isn't anyone who has questioned the majority leader's leadership in asking for a delay in terms of the consideration of various pieces of legislation. That is not what this is about. 
   But there are many of us who believe it is a matter of importance that we deal with the availability of guns to children in this country. We don't think that this is just some simple Democratic proposal. We believe it is something that goes to the core of many families in this nation. We think we ought to be able to debate and then call the roll. 
   We don't think it is just a matter of some narrow interest about whether we debate and finally resolve the issue of prescription drugs. We think that this is something of major importance and consequence. 
   We had to go through the hoops in order to try to deal with the No. 1 issue of people in this country; that is, whether doctors are going to make the decisions in treating people or whether it is going to be insurance agents. We are being denied the opportunity to bring those up. We were denied that opportunity and we've had to go through gymnastics. 
   We are denied the simple opportunity to have a vote in the Senate on the issue that affects 12 million of the neediest people in this country, the minimum wage. 
   So the leader shouldn't take this as a personal matter. This is what we think this institution is all about. They have their agenda. They have the votes. But let us at least try to represent what we believe families in this country are all about. That is what I think our leader is attempting to make sure we do. 
   With all respect to our leader and all the history he has represented, I have been here for a good period of time and we have never had this kind of termination and basic denial of individuals being able to raise these issues. 
   We were here when Jim Abourezk, Howard Metzenbaum, and one other Senator closed down the Senate day in and day out because of their concerns on the deregulation of natural gas. People respected this. And at the end of 3 days and nights, Members of the Senate were going out and embracing and shaking hands because they respected the fact that people had strong views and that this institution responded to them. 
   That is all we are asking. Let's let the Senate be the Senate of the United States. That is what we are going to fight for, and that is what we are going to insist on. 
   I agree with my good friend, the Senator from South Dakota. This isn't about feeling threatened. No one is threatening. If you want to shut this thing down, go to it. If you are not going to let the work get done, so be it. If you want to threaten with being red in the face, so be it. No one is talking about that. We are talking about trying to advance the agenda that is of central concern to people in this country. 
   That is what this institution is about. I thought Senator DASCHLE spoke for the institution. I think it is an agenda that should be pursued.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes, the Senator from Minnesota, 7 minutes, and the Senator from Iowa, the remaining time. 
   First of all, I join with our colleagues who spoke earlier about the extraordinary events we saw on The Mall this past weekend. 
   I was here a few moments ago when we listened to the majority leader talk about the urgency of passing a comprehensive energy program. Energy programs are important, and we have a great interest in it in our part of the country, particularly as we are looking forward to another fall and another winter, and the importance of developing some protections in the form of reserves and other factors. That is a very important policy issue. I am glad our Republican leader thinks that is of such urgency. 
   But the fact is, the issues which the Senator from California and others have spoken about, and taking sensible and responsible and commonsense actions on guns, particularly to ensure greater safety and security in the schools of this country, are also a matter of enormous importance. 
   I am reminded of the debate we had on elementary and secondary education. We had 6 days of debate, although some of that was limited in terms of being able to debate only a handful of amendments. We took 16 days on the bankruptcy bill and had 67 amendments. 
   Many of us on our side believe we ought to put our priorities straight. One of them is to take action in terms of sensible and commonsense issues on the proliferation of guns. 
   Second, we ought to be addressing the education issue, which is of such importance to families across this country. 
   We reject the position of the majority in giving short shrift on the issue of education. We want to debate that, and we want action on it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the continued deterioration of the position which had been accepted previously by the Senate on the issue of bankruptcy. 
   That may seem an issue that is distant and remote to many of our colleagues or many around this country, but it is an issue that will affect basically working women who are disproportionately hit by the pressures of bankruptcy because of the allocations of credit at the time of separation or their shortage of alimony or the shortage of child payments. It hits them disproportionately. 
   It hits older workers disproportionately in terms of their medical bills. About half of those bankruptcies are a result of the escalation and the costs of medical bills, coupled with the fact of prescription drug costs and the shortage of prescription drugs. That is another matter of priority. That is another matter we believe ought to be addressed. The failure of this body to address providing decent quality prescription drugs on the basis of need and on the ability to pay is also a major gap in our Medicare system. We should be taking action on that. When we don't, we find increasing numbers of individuals are falling into bankruptcy because they can't afford the prescription drugs. The credit cards last for only so long, and the payments they receive in terms of working families last only so long, and then they get overwhelmed with their payments and they go into bankruptcy. 
   There is a third group of individuals who go into bankruptcy as a result of being downsized. They worked hard all of their lives. The people who go into bankruptcy have the same work habits as those who do not. The overwhelming majority are hard-working Americans who fall into hard times. 
   As has been stated time and time on the floor of this body, it is always useful to ask who is going to benefit from a piece of legislation and who is going to pay a price with the passage of a piece of legislation. I have not seen in this Congress or any recent times the scales so unbalanced. Those that are going to benefit are going to be the credit card companies, banking interests; those harshly treated will be average working Americans who have fallen into difficult times, either economically or because of health care needs or because of age and the job challenges they are facing. 
   Only recently there was an excellent article in Time magazine. The total number of individuals going into bankruptcy is declining. Still, we have this economic power that is trying to jam this legislation through the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States behind closed doors. I was listening to my colleagues talk about actions taken behind closed doors. They find out on the bankruptcy legislation these are matters that are taking place behind closed doors as well. 
   The Time magazine article pointed out what is happening to an average family. Charles and Lisa Trapp are mail carriers in Plantation, FL, where Annelise, 8 years old, developed a muscular disorder and needed around-the-clock nursing care. Lisa had to quit her job, and with $124,000 in doctor bills, insurance will not cover paying off credit cards, which is the least of their worries. They have filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. The medical costs are what the Trapp family insurance did not cover. They had to use credit cards to buy groceries and they have an accumulation of $59,000 in credit card bills. The point is, they used the funds available on the credit cards for their groceries so they could use what income they had to pay for the needed prescription drugs. 
   This family, under this Republican bill, is treated harshly and poorly. The Trapp family are a brave and courageous family. And this situation is being replicated. It is fundamentally wrong. 
   Mr. President, for over two years, Congress has been struggling to reform the bankruptcy laws. From the beginning, the debate has been unfairly slanted toward the credit card companies and banks at the expense of vulnerable Americans. It is especially disturbing that the final bill may well be drafted without the appointment of conferees or even public meetings. The American people deserve a better process and a fairer bill. 
   A fair bankruptcy reform bill will balance the needs of debtors and creditors. It will not allow credit card companies and other special interests to take unfair advantage of thousands of citizens who find themselves in economic crisis--citizens like the Trapp family recently featured in Time magazine. 
   The Trapps are not wealthy cheats trying to escape their financial responsibilities. They are a middle class family engulfed in debt because of circumstances beyond their control. Like half of all Americans who file for bankruptcy, the Trapp family had massive medical expenses. 
   Charles and Lisa Trapp met while working as mail carriers in Plantation, Florida. They married and have three children--the youngest, Annelise, has a degenerative muscular condition. She requires round-the-clock medical care. In her wheel chair or in bed, she uses a respirator at least eight hours a day. As a result, the Trapps have $124,000 in doctors' bills that insurance won't cover, and $40,000 of credit card debt for groceries and other necessities. 
   The plight of the Trapp family is similar to that of many other American families confronted with serious illness and injury. Over 43 million  Americans have no health insurance, and many millions more are under-insured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 percent of their income on medical care. Older Americans are hit particularly hard. Too often, each of these families and senior citizens is one serious illness away from bankruptcy. 
   A report recently published in Norton's Bankruptcy Adviser says,  
   The data reported here serve as a reminder that self-funding medical treatment and loss of income during a bout of illness or recovery from an accident make a substantial number of middle class families vulnerable to financial collapse . . . For middle class people, there is little government help, so that when private insurance is inadequate, bankruptcy serves by default as a means for dealing with the financial consequences of a serious medical problem.  
   The data collected in the report make clear that this problem affects both the poor and the middle class. In many cases, health insurance is insufficient to protect a family with medical problems. ``The bankruptcy courts are populated not only with the uninsured, but also with those whose insurance does not cover all the financial consequences of their medical problems''--families facing medical debts that have outrun their policy limits--facing co-payments beyond their means--facing lost income not covered by their insurance. 
   When the health care system fails these men and women and children, the bankruptcy system catches them before they hit rock bottom. What will happen to these families if we fundamentally destroy the bankruptcy system? 
   What will happen to those who can't pay their bills because they were laid off in a merger or downsizing that left them without adequate income or basic benefits? Over half of all Americans say that the reason they file for bankruptcy is because of job loss. That fact is not surprising. Despite low unemployment, a record-setting stock market, and large budget surpluses, Wall Street cheers when companies--eager to improve profits by down-sizing--lay- off workers in large numbers. 
   Often, when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a study of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only about one-quarter of these workers were later employed in full-time jobs paying as much as or more than they had earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are forced to accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, and jobs with fewer benefits or no benefits at all. 
   For many hard-working men and women, these job benefits--particularly a pension-- can be the difference between a secure retirement and poverty. But instead of action by Congress to expand pension benefits, an offensive anti-pension provision was quietly slipped into the bankruptcy reform bill at the last minute. 
   It is wrong for Congress to let credit card companies and other lenders pressure workers to give up the protection they now have for their pensions in bankruptcy. Clearly this so-called ``pension waiver'' provision should be struck from the final bill. 
   It would also be a mistake to ``cap'' the amount of pension assets that a worker can protect in bankruptcy. Federal law already imposes strict limits on pension contributions. Unlike homestead abuses, retirement plans can't be used as part of a scheme to divert assets before bankruptcy. 
   It was the combination of a medical problem and a job loss that pushed Maxean Bowen--a single mother--into bankruptcy. Maxean told Time magazine that she was a social worker in the foster-care system in New York City when she developed a painful condition in both feet that made her job, which required house calls, impossible. As a result, she had to give up her work and go on the unemployment rolls. Her income fell by 50 percent. She had to borrow from relatives, and she used her credit cards to make ends meet. Like so many others in similar situations, she believed that she would soon be back on her feet and able to pay her debts. But, like thousands who file for bankruptcy, even when Maxean was able to work again, she owed far more than she could repay. 
   She was at the mercy of her creditors. ``They would call me on the job ..... that was very embarrassing. They call you early in the morning. They call you late at night. Sometimes I get calls at 10 o'clock at night. And they are very nasty.'' Maxean tried paying her creditors a few hundred dollars when possible, but it wasn't enough to keep her bills from piling up because of interest changes and late-payment fees. Maxean said she was ``going crazy.'' 
   If she was going crazy, so are many others. Reports show that by the time individuals and families file for bankruptcy protection, more than 20 percent of income before taxes is going toward paying interest and fees on their debts. Time magazine reports that study after study proves that Chapter 7 debtors have little if any ability to repay more of their debts. ``The notion that debtors in bankruptcy court are sitting on many billions of dollars that they could turn over to their creditors is a figment of the imagination of lenders and lawmakers.'' 
   Maxean's plight was made worse by the fact that she is a single mother. In 1999, over 500,000 women who head their own households filed for bankruptcy to try to stabilize their economic lives. 200,000 of them are also creditors--trying to collect child support or alimony. The rest are debtors struggling to make ends meet. Divorced women are four times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. 
   The House and Senate bankruptcy bills are especially harsh on divorced women and their children. Under current law, an ex-wife trying to collect support enjoys special protection. Her claims--like very few others--survive her husband's bankruptcy and provide a realistic opportunity to collect support payments from her former husband. Under the pending bill, however, credit card companies are given a new right to compete with women and children for the husband's limited income after bankruptcy. 
   It is true that the bill moves support payments to the first priority position in the bankruptcy code. But that only matters in the limited number of cases in which the debtor has assets to distribute to a creditor. In most cases--close to 99 percent --there are no assets, and the list of priorities has no effect. 
   The claim of ``first priority'' in bankruptcy is a sham to conceal the real problem--the competition for resources after bankruptcy. This legislation creates a new category of debt that cannot be discharged after bankruptcy--credit card debt. And, when women and children are forced to compete after bankruptcy with these sophisticated lenders, the women and children lose. 
   In ways like these, the bankruptcy reform bills currently being negotiated by the House and the Senate are a travesty. They remove the bankruptcy safety net that has been a life-line for the poor and middle class. The credit card companies will receive a huge windfall, and they will walk away with few incentives to act more responsibly. And in a further insult, the House Republican negotiators want to preserve one of the most flagrant fat-cat loopholes--the ability of wealthy debtors to escape their responsibilities by using the homestead loophole in the current bankruptcy code. 
   The Time magazine article makes these points effectively by comparing the plight of two debtors--James Villa and Allen Smith. James Villa is a 42 year-old stockbroker living in a $1.4 million home in Boca Raton, Florida. He was President, CEO and indirect owner of 99.5 percent of the stock of H.J. Meyers & Co., Inc--a brokerage firm with offices around the country. During the firm's heyday, Mr. Villa bought expensive cars, boats, and jewelry. But he fell on hard times when Massachusetts securities authorities found that his firm had engaged in fraudulent and unethical practices. Before further action could be taken, the firm closed its doors and Mr. Villa moved to Florida. That state has a broad homestead exemption, which allowed him to protect $1.4 million of assets--his Boca Raton home--from creditors, including clients of the brokerage firm who had lost their savings. 
   How can that be fair, when Allen Smith, a retired security worker, has lost everything? Mr. Smith served in the Coast Guard during World War II and later went to work at Chrysler. He was eventually laid-off during a downsizing. Too young to collect Social Security, he started working as a security guard. He and his wife Carolyn  bought a home and lived a solid middle-class lifestyle until their lives started to crumble. 
   Beginning in 1984, Mr. Smith's wife lost her toe, then one leg, then the other leg to diabetes. To accommodate her disability, Mr. Smith renovated their home using money borrowed against the equity. He developed throat cancer, high blood pressure, and a heart murmur and had to leave his job. The family was $115,000 in debt--double their annual income--so the Smiths filed for bankruptcy. They agreed to pay $100 a month under the requirements of Chapter 13. 
   Carolyn Smith died later that year, and Mr. Smith was left--without her companionship or Social Security checks--to struggle alone. Eventually--after being hospitalized with a stroke, after cataract surgery, and after an irresponsible friend didn't pay his mortgage--Mr. Smith's Chapter 13 bankruptcy failed. His situation isn't unusual--two-thirds of all Chapter 13 plans fail--but the consequences were devastating. Mr. Smith will be moved to Chapter 7, and he will lose his home. 
   Any bill sent to the President for his signature must not make Allen Smith's life more difficult while protecting James Villa's ability to live in luxury. Congress must pass a better and fairer bill worthy of the name reform. The President should not hesitate to veto a bad bankruptcy bill that flunks the fairness test. 
   For over a century, the bankruptcy laws have provided needed relief for those who fall on hard times. This Congress should not be a party to unfair reforms designed to benefit the powerful credit card industry and wealthy debtors, at the expense of the large numbers of needy citizens whom the bankruptcy laws are supposed to help, not hurt.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Two days ago, to honor Mother's Day, hundreds of thousands of mothers from across the United States marched on the nation's  Capitol, to insist that Congress do more to protect children from the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our country. 
   The Million Mom March has focused the attention of the entire country on this critical challenge--and the question now is whether Congress will at long last end the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control. 
   The National Rifle Association is not the Majority Leader of the United States Senate. It shouldn't be dictating our agenda. It's irresponsible for the Republican Senate leadership to stonewall every opportunity to enact responsible gun control legislation. 
   For many months, Democrats have continued to ask the Republican leadership for immediate action on pending legislation to close the loopholes in the nation's gun laws, but every request so far has been denied. 
   Gun laws work. Experience is clear that tough gun laws in combination with other preventive measures have a direct impact on reducing crime. 
   In Massachusetts, we have some of the toughest gun laws in the country. 
   We have a ban on carrying concealed weapons. A permit is required to do so. Local law enforcement has discretion to issue permits, and an individual must show a need in order to obtain the permit. 
   We have a minimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun. We have increased penalties for felons in possession of firearms. 
   We require the sale of child safety locks with all firearms. 
   We have an adult responsibility law. Adults are liable if a child obtains an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself or any other person. 
   We have a Gun-Free Schools Law. 
   We have a licensing law for purchases of guns. 
   We have strict standards for the licensing of gun dealers. 
   We have a waiting period for handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 days to obtain a permit. 
   We have a permit requirement for secondary and private sales of guns. 
   We have a ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials. 
   We have a requirement for reporting of lost or stolen firearms. 
   As Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans testified last year in the Senate Health Committee, ``Any successful approach to youth violence must be balanced and comprehensive. It must include major investments in prevention and intervention as well as enforcement. Take away any leg and the stool falls.'' 
   Commissioner Evans also stated that to be effective, efforts must be targeted and cooperative. Police officers must be able to work closely with churches, schools, and health and mental health providers. After-school programs are essential to help keep juveniles off the streets, out of trouble, and away from guns and drugs. In developing an effective approach like this, Boston has become a model for the rest of the country. 
   There are partnerships between the Boston Public Schools and local mental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health professionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in order to prevent violence by students. The Boston police work actively with parents, schools and other officials, discussing incidents in and out of school involving 
   students. The Boston Public Health Commission promotes programs by the Boston Police Department. 
   The results have been impressive. The success of Boston's comprehensive strategy is borne out in these outstanding results: 
   From January 1999 through April 2000, no juvenile in Boston was killed with a firearm. 
   In 1990, 51 Boston young people, ages 24 and under, were murdered by a firearm. Last year, there were 10 such murders. 
   Reports from emergency rooms about firearm injuries are also down dramatically. 
   It's no coincidence that the firearm death rate in Massachusetts is significantly lower than the national average. We've taken strong and effective steps to protect our citizens, our children, and our communities. 
   When we compare states with tough gun laws to those that have weak gun laws, the differences are significant: 
   In 1996, across the nation, the number of firearm-related deaths for persons 19 years old or younger was 2 deaths per 100,000 persons. 
   In states that have the weakest gun laws, the number was significantly higher: 
   Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people--two and a half times higher than the national average. 
   Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three times higher. 
   Idaho had 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three and a half times higher. 
   Mississippi had 9.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--four and a half times higher. 
   No other major nation on earth tolerates such shameful gun violence. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control in 1997, the rate of firearm deaths among children 0-14 years old is nearly 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other industrial countries combined. 
   Every day we fail to act, the tragic toll of gun violence climbs steadily higher. In the year since the killings at Columbine High School in Colorado, 4,560 more children have lost their lives to gunfire, and countless more have been injured. 
   We intend to do all we can to see that the Senate votes on these common sense measures as soon as possible. 
   Today is a new dawn for gun control. On Sunday, finally, the immoveable object we call Congress met the irresistible force of the Million Mom March--and the immoveable object moved. 
   I believe that at long last, Congress will say no to The National Rifle Association, and yes to the hundreds of thousands of mothers from across the United States who marched on the nation's Capitol to demand an end to the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our children, our homes, our schools, and our country. 
   The Million Mom March focused the attention of the entire country on this critical challenge. It is time--long past time--for Congress to end the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control. 
   We already know what needs to be done to reduce the irresponsible proliferation of guns and gun violence in communities across the country. This is not rocket science. We should close the gun show loophole. We should require child safety locks for guns. We should insist on licensing for all handgun owners. We should take guns out of schools and let children learn in safe classrooms. 
   Enough is enough is enough is enough. 
   I am sure those Americans who have been watching the Senate now for the last 2 hours wonder whether we are going to be able to take very much action on matters which they consider important to their families. 
   In this particular instance, the issue is whether we are going to pass a sense-of-the-Senate resolution--not even an amendment that would be the basis for legislative action, but just an expression of the Members of this body, as the Senator from California has pointed out, effectively commending the participants of the Million Mom March. They should be commended for rallying to demand sensible gun safety legislation. 
   Congress should pass a conference report on violent juvenile offender accountability before the Memorial Day recess and include the Lautenberg gun show provision which passed in the Senate, and other Senate-passed provisions to limit access to firearms by juveniles, convicted felons, and other persons prohibited by law from purchasing or possessing firearms. 
   That took just over 2 hours of the Senate's time primarily because of the Republican leadership saying they were not going to permit the Democratic leadership to go on record in the Senate this evening just for the sense of the Senate commending the Million Mom March, and also asking that the Senate do what it already should do--that is, pass the violent juvenile offender legislation out of conference where it has been for 7 months. 
   As a member of the conference committee, we met on two different occasions: on the opening occasion, and on the organization. And that was it. 
   It has taken the Republican leadership 2 1/2 hours to say that we can vote on this tomorrow with their permission. They ought to get used to the fact  that we are going to continue to press this issue--2 hours to get a sense of the Senate to say the mothers, the 750,000 moms who marched with their daughters on Sunday--that they are to be commended. That is troublesome, evidently, to the other side. 
   These moms came from all different parts of the country. Many of them had never participated in any political process at all. They came here because they wanted the Congress of the United States to debate and take action. They had different views about what specifically should be out there. But they had a common sense and a common purpose that we should take some action. We are commending them for doing so. That evidently was unacceptable to the Republican leadership. 
   That is what we are facing here, for those who are watching this program tonight and who saw the march. In the last 2 hours we have been unable to get action. It is as clear as can be. 
   There has been objection, parliamentary maneuvering, and gymnastics using the rules of the Senate to deny an expression that we ought to commend the Million Mom March and that we ought to complete what is our responsibility to complete; that is, the conference, and pass sensible and commonsense gun control. You would have thought we were repealing the first amendment of the United States. That is what we are facing here. It is so interesting for us to find that out at this time in this session--the difficulty and the complexity we are going to have. But we are going to continue to pursue it. 
   I see my friend and our leader from California, Senator BOXER. I am glad to yield for a question.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. 
   We have a short period of time remaining. As a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we have responsibilities to try to pass education legislation. We had seven votes over a period of 5 days. That legislation was pulled. We are saying we don't have enough time, we don't have enough time to consider this, although we had all day Friday where there were no votes and all day Monday where there were no votes. 
   What we see now is that during the whole course of the afternoon, we were denied the opportunity to have just an expression of the Senate. 
   As I mentioned, this resolution is a simple, straightforward measure. Fact: Over 400 young people have been killed by gun violence since 1997. Fact: In the year since the Columbine tragedy, the Senate and House juvenile justice conference has not taken action to ensure the passage of meaningful gun legislation. Fact: Our continued inaction poses a threat to public safety. 
   The sense of the Senate does only two things. It commends the participants of the Million Mom March and calls upon the conference to pass the language of the Lautenberg measure on the gun show loophole that has passed the Senate, and to take action that is sensible and responsible. 
   I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to respond to an argument and to discuss some of the facts which are so compelling, particularly about the children, because we as a country and as a society refuse to take action. The latest data released in 1999 shows in a single year--and this can't tell the story because for every statistic, for every individual there is a name and a face behind this--what has been happening: 4,205 children and teens were killed by gunfire--1 every 2 hours, nearly 12 a day; 2,562 were murdered by gunfire; 1,262 committed suicide using a firearm--more than 3 every day; 306 died from accidental shooting; 2,357 were white and 1,687 were black; 629 were under 15; 191 were under 10; 84 were under 5 years of age; nearly 3 times as many children under 10 died from gunfire as the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. We know that the American children under 15 are 12 times more likely to die from gunfire than children in 25 other industrial countries combined; homicide is the third leading cause of death among children 5 to 14; 61% of the 80,000 children killed by gunfire since 1979 were white; 36% were black; children are twice as likely as adults to be victims of violent crime, and more likely to be killed by adults than other children; white youths are six times more likely to commit suicide than black youths although the suicide rate for black youths is up more than 100 percent since 1980. 
   We do not believe this legislation is necessarily going to be the only answer. We understand that. We do understand this is a step that can be taken now to make a difference about the proliferation of weapons and the easy access to weapons. 
   Various studies and polls show the number of children who say how easy it is for them to acquire weapons in our country today. We want to reduce that availability and that accessibility. We understand there are legitimate issues with which we have to deal. I want to dispose of a few of them. One has been the argument that has been raised that there hasn't been a sufficient effort in the area of law enforcement. 
   Reading through our Republican sense of the Senate, they talk about law enforcement. It is an interesting fact that Republicans have cut back on the total number of agents who have been most involved in law enforcement--the ATF agents--over the last 15 years. 
   Back to the prosecutions and the important point which our Republican friends ought to understand because their sense-of-the-Senate resolution is basically flawed in what they say about the prosecutions: Although the number of Federal prosecutions for lower level offenders--persons serving sentences of 3 years or less--has dropped, the number of high-level offenders--those sentenced to 5 years or more--is up by nearly 30 percent. Do we understand that? If we are talking about the more serious aspect of gun prosecutions, they are up by 30 percent. 
   I hope our Republican friends acknowledge their findings which are flawed in their presentation on this issue. At the same time, the total number of Federal and State prosecutions is up sharply. About 25 percent more criminals are sent to prisons for State and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992. The number of high-level offenders is up nearly 30 percent. The total number of Federal and 
   State prosecutions is up 25 percent or more. The total number of prosecutions--local, Federal, and State--are up significantly. 
   We hear from the National Rifle Association that all that is needed is further prosecution under the law, but that is happening at the present time. What we need is action over the proliferation of weapons. We have tried in recent times on our side, with strong support, to make progress regarding the proliferation of weapons. 
   Moving along to some of the other challenges that children are facing, in November of last year in the Senate, the mental health bill was passed unanimously, by Republican and Democrats alike. We are still waiting over in the House of Representatives for the Republican leadership to call that up. 
   What does that bill do? That bill directly addresses the problems of violence in children's lives. The first section of the bill provides grants to public entities for programs in local communities to help children deal with violence. Community partnerships are created among law enforcement, education systems, mental health, and substance abuse systems. These partnerships provide a comprehensive response to violence, and include security, education reform, prevention, and early intervention services for mental health and substance abuse problems, as well as early childhood and development and social services. 
   Recognizing what is happening in many of our urban areas, I know in my city of Boston, a third of the children who come to school each day come from schools where there is abuse--physical abuse and substance abuse. Those children need help. They have problems. Those who are the strongest supporters of eliminating the proliferation of weapons available to children have been fighting for these kinds of efforts. 
   Nonetheless, our Republican leadership is opposed to all of our efforts and  refuses to take action in those areas. It wasn't that long ago, in 1995, when we tried to get the Center for Disease Control to have a survey of gun violence and our House Republican budget proposed a phaseout of the Center for Injury Control because it was just collecting information about violence and guns in schools. 
   Not only are they opposed to trying to take direct action on the proliferation of guns, not only are they opposed, evidently--because they are refusing to take up legislation to deal with some of the other aspects of guns--but on the other hand, they are absolutely opposed to even permitting the Center for Disease Control, the premier organization in the world in terms of public health services, from having any collection of material on gun violence. 
   In 1996, the appropriation was cut by $2.6 million, the appropriation of the Center for Disease Control, for injury control. That is the exact amount CDC was spending to survey gun violence. Since then, the CDC found other ways to continue the survey of gun violence, but Republicans have fought us every step along the way. That is what we are pointing out. 
   We are pointing out a number of things. First of all, if you can do something for effective law enforcement as well as prevention programs, you can have a dramatic impact on violence in communities. I want to show what has happened in my own State of Massachusetts where we have passed some of the toughest gun laws. We have a ban on carrying concealed weapons. A permit is required to do so. Local law enforcement has discretion to issue permits, and an individual must show a need in order to obtain the permit. 
   We have a minimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun. 
   We have increased penalties for felons in possession of firearms. 
   We require the sale of child safety locks with all fire arms. 
   We have an adult responsibility law. Adults are liable if a child obtains an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself or any other person. 
   We have gun-free school laws. 
   We have a licensing law for the purchase of guns. We have strict standards for the licensing of gun dealers. We have a waiting period for handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 days to obtain a permit. We have a permit requirement for secondary and private sales of guns. 
   We have a ban on Saturday night specials, and we have a requirement for reporting lost or stolen firearms. 
   What have been the results? In the city of Boston, we see what the difference has been. In 1990, homicides of those 16 and under: 10 a year. See how this has gradually been phased out as these measures have been passed, down to the year 2000 where, in the first 3 months of the year, for youth homicides, we have not had one yet. 
   Does that mean something to anybody? Obviously we have had a very powerful impact. That is not just because of this legislation which has been enormously important, but we have also had a very effective program in prevention and intervention as well as enforcement. As Commissioner Paul Evans said, you have to have all the legs of the stool to be effective. Commissioner Evans also states: 
   To be effective, efforts must be targeted and cooperative. Police officers must be able to work closely with churches, schools, health and mental health providers. Afterschool programs are essential to help keep juveniles off the streets and out of trouble, away from guns and drugs. 
   In developing an effective approach like this, Boston has become a model for the rest of the country. On this chart, here is the city of Boston: Firearm homicides, 50 a year in 1990, and now we are down, in the year 2000, to 3 this particular year. That is because of tough laws with effective efforts that include many of the different provisions we have talked about here in our SAMSHA program: Working with troubled youth; trying to work with children to deal with violence in their communities; community partnership among law enforcement, education, and mental health and substance abuse systems. Those have been local efforts--some supported by 
   the States--that are effective. Prevention and tough laws; we are finding out the scores, the hundreds of children who are alive today that I dare say probably would not be if we did not have an effective effort against the proliferation of weapons as well as prevention. 
   There are partnerships between the Boston public schools and local mental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health professionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in order to prevent violence by students. Boston police work actively with parents, schools, and other officials discussing incidents in and out of schools involving students. The Boston Public Health Commission promotes programs by the Boston Police Department and the results have been impressive. 
   From January 1999 through April of 2000, no juvenile in Boston was killed with a firearm. We ought to be able to at least debate this issue in the Senate. If there are those who take issue with what we have represented tonight about the effectiveness of a strong prevention program in terms of proliferation weapons, and also a prevention program working with a range of different social services, come out here on the floor and let's debate it and call the roll. 
   But, oh, no, the Republican leadership says. Oh, no, we are not even going to let you, over 5 hours, pass a resolution commending the Million Mom March, or that we ought to get the bill out of the conference, where we have been for 8 months. Why is it they are so nervous about it? Why is it, when we have results that we are prepared to defend that can demonstrate we can save lives in this country, but that we are denied the opportunity to do so? That is what is unacceptable. People are milling around saying: when are we going to end this evening? We have places to go. We have places to go--here on the floor of the Senate. We have things to do, and that is here in the Senate. That is what we are elected for. 
   The leader, Senator DASCHLE, has outlined what we want to be able to do. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Let me point out, when we compare States with tough gun laws to those that have weak gun laws--let's take a look at that. We are constantly told tough gun laws do not make any difference, they really do not make any difference. 
   Listen to this. In 1996, across the Nation the number of firearm-related deaths for persons 19 years old or younger were 2 deaths per 100,000. That is across the country, 2 deaths per 100,000. In the States that have the weakest gun laws, the number was significantly higher. Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000, 2.5 times higher than the national average. These are, effectively, for children under 19 years of age. Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000, 3 times higher; Idaho, 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000, 3.5 times higher; Mississippi, 9.2 firearms-related deaths per 100,000, 4.5 times higher. No other nation on Earth tolerates such shameful gun violence. 
   Where we have had effective laws and preventive programs we have reduction in the violence against children. Where we have weaker laws, we see the expanded number of deaths of children in our country. There may be other reasons for it, but come out here and defend it. We are prepared to debate these issues. But we are unable to do so because of these magic words: ``I suggest the absence of a quorum.'' 
   If you took away the words, ``I suggest the absence of a quorum,'' perhaps we could get some action around here. But we cannot and therefore we are stymied, at least to date, although we will have some opportunities to get some expressions tomorrow, and we are going to try to get action on these measures before the end of the session. 
   We are prepared to insist that action be taken on these measures. I will just conclude by reading some of the comments of children. These are the words of Columbine students who witnessed a horrible tragedy last year. This is a quote from Valeen Schnurr:  
   The nights are always the worst. Inevitably, I find my thoughts drifing into nightmares, terrifying images of the library at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. The sound of students screaming as explosive and gunshots echo through the school; the burning pain of the bullets penetrating my body; the sound of my voice professing my faith in God; seeing my hands fill with my own  blood; and my friend Lauren Townsend lying lifeless beside me as I try to wake her. 
   In the mornings when I look in the mirror, the scars I see on my arms and upper body always remind me that it's not just a nightmare, but the memory of a real event that will stay with me for the rest of my life. The scars are a part of me now, but they help me to remember that I've been blessed with a second chance at life.  
   From Garrett Looney:  
   I've never been ashamed to be an athlete. I started playing football when I was eight, and baseball and basketball too. This spring, I'll run track. Sports have always been part of me. * * * 
   I'd been in the library that day, about 11 a.m., making some copies. Then I left with friends for lunch. We were heading back to school and thought there was a bad wreck because a fireman stopped us. We went to Clement Park, next to Columbine, and saw a sea of kids running from the building. We couldn't believe it. It's beyond me how two kids could go that crazy * * * 
   A friend of mine, Corey Depooter was killed. I had one [woodworking] class with him, and we did projects together. It was hard going back to that class. The seniors on the football team took memorial pictures of a columbine flower to the victims' houses, including Mrs. Depooter's. She wanted to know how we were doing and told us stories about Corey. That was tough for me.  
   The list goes on, Mr. President. Here is Nicole Nowlen:  
   I was only at Columbine for seven weeks be fore (the shooting). My parents are divorced, and I had been living in Sioux Falls, S. Dak., with my mother and younger brother, Adam. When my mom moved to California, I chose to live with my dad in Colorado. * * * 
   On April 20, I was sitting alone at a table in the library doing my math homework when this girl ran in and yelled. ``There are guys with guns downstairs:'' I thought it was a senior prank * * * 
   The time seemed to go in slow motion. And then they came in. 
   I don't remember much until they got over into our area. I could see John watching where they were walking. I was trying to pick up expressions from his face, and I could hear them walking over to this table full of girls next to us. I remember this gun going off, and one of the gunmen saying, ``Do you believe in God?'' And I remember thinking, ``These people are sick.'' 
   The stories go on. 
   We have had Paducah, KY. We have had Jonesboro, AR. We have had Columbine. Those who forget history are fated to repeat it. We have failed to take action. America has witnessed these shootings over the years. Every single day in cities, in communities, in rural areas, 12 children die. These are dramatic incidents which catch the heart, as they should, and the soul of every American, and it is happening every single day. 
   We can make a difference. We can reduce these incidents. Perhaps we cannot eliminate them all, but we can reduce significantly the total number of children who are lost every day. We fail to reduce the number if we refuse to take action in this area. 
   I hope the Senate will go on record in support of the Daschle sense-of-the-Senate amendment. I hope this will just be the beginning. I know it will be for many of our colleagues, including my two dear friends, the Senators from California and Illinois, who have been providing leadership for our Nation in this area. We are going to respond to the Million Mom March. They asked for action. We committed ourselves to taking action. 
   I look forward to working with them and others in making every effort we possibly can to reduce the proliferation of weapons that should not be available to children in this country. We can make a difference. I look forward to working with them.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator from California, it defies every logical explanation. The alleged explanation is that we do not need these additional laws; what we need is the enforcement of existing laws; why waste our time on the floor of the Senate in considering these measures because if we dealt with these other measures, our problems would be resolved. 
   That is, of course, a flawed factual representation, as I mentioned, in terms of total prosecutions, and it is wrong in terms of fact, not only, as I mentioned, in total prosecutions, but it is wrong in terms of what can be done in States across this country. 
   I thank the Senator from California for raising these questions this evening for Americans. The question is, At least, why can't we vote? Why can't we vote? Why can't we have accountability? Why aren't they proud of their position? Why aren't they proud of their position and willing to take a stand on it? That is what this office is about: making choices and decisions; exercising some judgment. Why constantly try to frustrate the ability of Members to make some difference on this? 
    I think that is the inexcusable position which hopefully the American public will find unacceptable in the remaining weeks of this session and, if not, then during the election. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, I am introducing legislation to give the Food and Drug Administration board authority to regulate tobacco products for protection of the public health. With the recent 5 to 4 decision by the Supreme Court rejecting FDA's claim that it had authority to regulate tobacco products under current law, it is now essential for Congress to act. We cannot in good conscience allow the federal agency most responsible for protecting the public health to remain powerless to deal with the enormous risk of tobacco, the most deadly of all consumer products. 
   The provisions in this bill are identical to those in the bipartisan compromise reached during Senate consideration of comprehensive tobacco control legislation in 1998. Fifty eight Senators supported it at that time. That legislation was never enacted because of disputes over tobacco taxation and litigation, not over FDA authority. 
   This FDA provision is a fair and balanced approach to FDA regulation. It creates a new section in FDA jurisdiction for the regulation of tobacco products, with standards that allow for consideration of the unique issues raised by tobacco use. It is sensitive to the concerns of tobacco farmers, small businesses, and nicotine-dependent smokers. But, it clearly gives FDA the authority it needs in order to prevent youth smoking and to reduce addiction to this highly lethal product. 
   I had hoped to be introducing this bill with the same bipartisan support we had for this FDA provision in 1998. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach agreement. I believe the changes in the 1998 language now being proposed by Republicans will undermine the FDA's ability to deal effectively with the enormous health risks posed by smoking. This concern is shared by a number of independent public health experts who have reviewed the proposed Republican changes and by the FDA officials who would be responsible for administering the law. The bipartisan compromise agreed to in 1998 is still the best opportunity for Senators to come together and grant FDA the regulatory authority it needs to substantially reduce the number of children who start smoking and to help addicted smokers quit. Nothing less will do the job. 
   The stakes are vast. Three thousand children begin smiling every day. A thousand of them will die prematurely from tobacco-induced diseases. Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in the nation today. Cigarettes kill well over four hundred thousand Americans each year. That is more lives lost than from automobile accidents, alcohol abuse, illegal drugs, AIDS, murder, suicide, and fires combined. Our response to a public health problem of this magnitude must consist of more than half-way measures. 
   We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that target children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug Administration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, distribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco. 
   The tobacco industry currently spends five billion dollars a year to promote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways designed to tempt children to start smoking, before they are mature enough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk. The industry knows that more than 90% of smokers begin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood. 
   Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' own words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children into dependency on their deadly product. Recent studies by the Institute of medicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the substantial role of industry advertising in decisions by young people to use tobacco products. If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the power to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children wherever it will be seen by children. This legislation will give 
   FDA the ability to stop tobacco advertising which glamorizes smoking from appearing in publications likely to be read by significant numbers of children. 
   FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. Nearly every state makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children under 18, but surveys show that those laws are rarely enforced and frequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of cigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the purchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-service displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious enforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling tobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that children under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes. 
   The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, studying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of children who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were received in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its proceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which cigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those regulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing youth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no sense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new multi-year rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will give the youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by FDA the immediate force of law, as if they had been issued under the new statute. 
   The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette and smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These warnings  will be more explicit in their description of the medical problems which can result from tobacco use. The FDA is given the authority to change the text of these warning labels periodically, to keep their impact strong. 
   Nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say that it is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco companies have vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. No one can forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under oath before Congress as recently as 1994 that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. Overwhelming evidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process proves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness for decades, but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing strategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers chemically manipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more addictive. 
   The tobacco industry has a long, dishonorable history of providing misleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These companies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far less hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product design seem far more significant for the health of the user than they actually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous authority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest disinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end. 
   Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the FDA regulate them for the protection of the public health. Over forty million Americans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible public health official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban would leave forty million people without a way to satisfy their drug dependency. FDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers overcome their addiction, and to make the product less toxic for smokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA must have the authority to reduce or remove hazardous ingredients from cigarettes, to the extent that it becomes scientifically feasible. The inherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded. 
   Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they plan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. This legislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced risk'' products to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No health-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified to the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent deceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public into a false sense of health safety. 
   Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. Congress must vest FDA not only with the responsibility for regulating tobacco products, but with full authority to do the job effectively. 
   This legislation will give the FDA the legal authority it needs to reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children--to prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors--to help smokers overcome their addiction--to make tobacco products less toxic for those who continue to use them--and to prevent the tobacco industry from misleading the public about the dangers of smoking. 
   The 1998 compromise we reached in the Senate is still the right answer. We cannot allow the tobacco industry to stop us from doing what we know is right for America's children. I intend to do all I can to see that Congress enacts this legislation this year. The public health demands it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, last Tuesday, the Senate suspended consideration of the education bill. I hope that our Republican friends have just temporarily suspended the bill, and not expelled it. We owe it to the nation's schools, students, parents, and communities to complete action on this priority legislation. 
   So far, we have considered only eight amendments to the bill over six different days. 
   When the bankruptcy bill was on the floor, our Republican colleagues did everything they could to satisfy the credit card companies. That bill was debated for 16 days, and 67 amendments were considered. 
   Obviously, when the credit card companies want a bill, our Republican friends put everything else aside to get it done. But when it comes to education, the voices of parents and children and schools and communities go unheard. 
   We should be debating education. It's a top priority for parents. It's a top priority for communities. It's a top priority for the country. And, it should be a top priority for Congress. 
   It is wrong for the Senate to leave the nation's schools with so much uncertainty about whether and when they will get urgently needed help to ensure better teachers, modern schools, smaller classes, and safe classrooms. 
   Democrats are ready to debate and address these issues now, and finish Senate consideration of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But, we have no assurance from the Republican majority that we will be able to do so. 
   Clearly, there are strong disagreements about how to address the issue of education reform. But, we should all agree to make it a top priority for final action. 
   Republicans have made block grants the centerpiece of their education proposal. But, block grants are the wrong approach. They undermine the targeting of scarce resources to the highest education priorities. They eliminate critical accountability provisions that ensure better results for all children. The block grant approach abandons the national commitment to help the nation's children obtain a good education through proven effective reforms of public schools. 
   The lack of commitment by our Republican colleagues to genuine education reform is also clear in the recent actions by the Senate and House Appropriations Committee. 
   Both bills eliminate critical funding for reducing class size and improving teacher quality. Instead, they put some of those funds into the title VI block grant. 
   Both bills do nothing to guarantee communities help for modernizing their school buildings. 
   Both bills eliminate critical funding for helping states to increase accountability for results and turn around schools that aren't getting results. 
   At the same time that they expand support for block grants and eliminate 
   support for greater accountability, Republicans are cutting funds to communities to improve education. Under the President's budget request, communities would have received a total of $4.05 billion in the coming fiscal year to reduce class size, modernize school buildings, and improve teacher quality. The Republican bill block grants these programs and cuts total funding by $2 billion below the President's request in the House and $500 million below the President's request in the Senate. 
   Under the Republican block grant scheme, communities get less aid and parents get no guarantee that their children's classes will be smaller, that their teachers will be better qualified, or that their schools will be safe and modern. 
   Block grants are the wrong direction for education and the wrong direction for the nation. They do nothing to encourage change in public schools. 
   In the Republican ESEA bill, states are not held accountable for educational results until after 5 years. By that time, many students will have lost five years of potential gains in student achievement. 
   Block grants also leave the door open for needless waste and abuse. They provide no focus on proven effective strategies to help schools. Senator DEWINE, in urging increased accountability, pointed out the poor history of states and local school districts in spending Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities funds. He characterized those dollars as being ``raided'' for pet projects or to support ineffective methods. 
   Under block grants, school districts and schools can use scarce public tax dollars to support fads and gimmicks, with no basis in research or proven practice. They can even use the funds to support the football team, buy computer games, or buy new office furniture, if they decide that these uses serve so-called ``educational purposes.'' 
   In short, block grants provide no assurance that federal education funds will be used where they're needed most--to improve instruction and teacher quality, strengthen curriculum, reduce class size, provide after-school learning opportunities, or support other proven strategies for helping all students reach high standards. 
   The Republican block grant also undermines local control, because it concentrates educational decision-making at the state level. By authorizing the state to decide whether it will enter into a performance agreement, the Republican bill gives the state ultimate authority to determine the parameters of the agreement, including which schools and which school districts will receive funds, and how funds may be spent. Far from giving local districts flexibility, as the policies and waiver provisions under current law do, the Republican block grants will increase the power of governors over local education policy at the expense of local districts, local school officials, and parents. 
   The American people want a strong partnership that includes the important involvement of parents, local school boards, local community authorities, States, and the Federal Government. We are not looking to take over education. We are saying that educating the nation's children is a top national priority, and Congress ought to be a strong partner in efforts to improve education. 
   The Republican proposal says there will only be one member in the education partnership, and that will be the State. It won't be the local community or parents, because they give all of the funds to the States. Then the States make the judgment about how it is going to go down to the local level. 
   Parents want a guarantee that, with scarce resources, we are going to have accountability for results and for getting national priorities. They know and we know small class sizes work. We guarantee there will be a well-qualified teacher in every classroom. 
   We guarantee more afterschool programs, which are absolutely essential to help and assist children and enhance their academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   We guarantee strong accountability provisions. 
   We guarantee resources for technology in schools so we can eliminate the digital divide, as Senator MIKULSKI speaks to with great knowledge, awareness, and, correctness. 
   But all of those efforts I have just mentioned are at risk with the proposal of the Republicans to just provide a blank check to the States and let the States work out what they might. 
   The Republican block grant approach abdicates our responsibility to do all we can to improve the current federal efforts. All that the GOP approach does is hand off the many current problems to states and local communities to solve. 
   Block grants are particularly harmful, because they abdicate our responsibility to help those most in need, such  as homeless children, migrant children, and immigrant children. States rarely spend their own funds to help these children now--and they won't do it under a block grant. These children need targeted federal assistance to help them succeed in school. 
   Prior to the time the Federal Government provided targeted programs for the homeless under the McKinney Act, the Emergency Immigrant Education program, and the Migrant Education program, these children were not getting the help they needed. 
   State help for these children is virtually nonexistent. The only help and assistance for any of these children is the assistance provided in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. But the Republican bill wipes out these programs. 
   The parents of migrant children are among the most industrious, yet neglected, populations in the country. Poverty, mobility, health problems, isolation from the larger community are characteristics common to migrant families. In the 1997 to 1998 school year, an estimated 752,000 migrant children were counted as eligible for the Migrant Education Program. That would be block granted under the Republican blank check approach. Obviously, the States didn't worry about the problems of migrant children because they were here today and gone tomorrow. That has been the history. We are talking 752,000 children who are going to be cast adrift. 
   We had seen important progress, as I mentioned in the debate last week, where those working on the education of 
   migrant children have worked out a process where they were able to get children's school records, provide some waivers that were essential to get children enrolled in the schools. We are having at least some positive impact in helping meet the needs of some of these children. With a block grant that goes to the States, that effort will be ended. Without the Federal Migrant Education Program, there are few incentives for schools to implement a means for improving instruction for migrant children. 
   The Republican block grant bill also wipes out assistance for the homeless children. Nationwide, homeless children are isolated and often stigmatized. They face significant barriers to obtain adequate services of all kinds, including education. According to the December 1999 report of the Interagency Council on the Homeless, most homeless children are young, 20 percent are age 2 or younger; 22 percent are age 3 to 5; 20 percent are age 6 to 8; and 33 percent are between 9 and 17. 
   According to a 1990 report from the Better Homes Fund, a nonprofit charity dedicated to helping homeless families, homeless children face extremely stressful situations. Each year, 90 percent of homeless children move up to three times; 40 percent attend two schools; 38 percent attend three or more schools; 21 percent of homeless children nationwide repeat a grade due to homelessness, compared with only 5 percent of other children; 14 percent of homeless children are suspended from school, double the rate of other children. 
   This is what the National Coalition on Homeless says: The Federal program requirements that accompany McKinney funds focus upon State responsibility to ensure equal opportunity for homeless children and youth. They set forth the rights of homeless children to receive the same educational opportunities as their nonhomeless peers. 
   Under the Republican proposal, States that opt for the block grant would no longer have to follow these programs. Without the McKinney Act requirements, homeless children and youth are shut out of school again, destroying their chance for school success. It is wrong for Congress to turn its back on these children. 
   Finally, the block grant ignores the pressing needs of immigrant children. In 1997, the foreign-born population in the United States was 25.8 million, the largest in the Nation's history. In fiscal year 2000, States reported that more than 864,000 recent immigrant students were enrolled in schools, with an increase of these students of 55,000 over 1995. Large numbers of immigrant students traditionally have been enrolled in schools in seven States: Arizona, California, Illinois, Florida, New Jersey, New York, and Texas. However, with the increase of immigrant students in other States, the percentage in these States has fallen from 80 percent in 1995 to 71 percent in 2000. 
   This year, a number of other States reported a dramatic increase in the recent immigrant student enrollment: Connecticut, up 72 percent; Georgia, up 39 percent; Louisiana, up 34 percent; Michigan, up 35 percent; Missouri, up 50 percent; Oregon, up 28 percent; Tennessee, up 33 percent; Utah, up 38 percent. Immigrant students, particularly those with limited-English proficiency, are at significant risk of academic failure. Among all youth ages 16 through 24, immigrants are three times more likely to be drop outs than native born students. 
   Our overall goal in this legislation should be to write an education guarantee to parents, children, and schools, a 
   guarantee that we will work with them to improve their schools and ensure every student receives a good education. We want to guarantee a qualified teacher is in every classroom. We want to guarantee small class sizes. We want to guarantee modern and safe schools. We want to guarantee afterschool opportunities for children to help them succeed in school and stay off the street. We want to guarantee the parents have more opportunities for significant improvement in their public schools. We want to guarantee a good education for homeless children, migrant children, and immigrant children. We want a guarantee that States, districts, and schools are held accountable for results. We want to guarantee parents that their children are free from guns in their schools. 
   Yesterday, to celebrate Mother's Day, hundreds of thousands of mothers from across the United States marched on the Nation's Capital to insist we do more to protect children from the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our country. The Million Mom March has focused the attention of the entire country on this critical challenge. The question now is whether Congress will at long last end the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control. 
   For many months, Democrats have continued to ask the Republican leadership for immediate action on pending legislation to close the loopholes in the Nation's gun laws, but every request so far has been denied. In fact, as a conferee on the juvenile violence legislation, in 8 months in caucus, we have had 1 day of meetings. The reason is because, evidently, the leadership is sufficiently concerned that perhaps as a result of a conference between the House and the Senate we might pass sensible and responsible legislation that deals with gun show loopholes in our present laws. 
   Yesterday, hundreds of thousands of mothers from across the United States marched on the Nation's Capital to insist that we do more to protect children from the epidemic of gun violence that continues to plague our country. The Million Mom March has focused the attention of the entire country on this critical challenge. The question now is whether Congress is willing at long last to end the stonewalling and act responsibly on gun control. For many months, Democrats have continued to ask the Republican leadership for immediate action on pending legislation to close the loopholes in the Nation's gun laws, but every request has been denied. 
   Each day we fail to act, the tragic toll of gun violence climbs steadily higher. In the year since the killings at Columbine High School in Colorado, 4,560 more children have lost their lives to gunfire, and countless more have been injured. It is inexcusable that the Republican Congress continues to block every attempt to close the gaping loopholes that make a mockery of the Nation's current gun laws. The guns used to kill 9 of the 13 people murdered at Columbine High School were purchased at a gun show. The woman who bought the guns for the two young killers said she never would have purchased the weapons if she had to go through a background check. 
   Perhaps six year old Kayla Rolland in her first grade class in Flint, Michigan, would be alive today, if the gun her classmate used to kill her had a child safety lock on it. If Congress had listened after the school killing in West Paducah, Kentucky in 1997--or Jonesboro, Arkansas in 1998--or Columbine High School in 1999--thousands  more children would have been alive to celebrate Mother's Day yesterday. 
   By refusing to learn from such tragedies, we condemn ourselves to repeat them. How many wake-up calls will it take before Congress finally stops kowtowing to the National Rifle Association and starts doing what is right on gun control? 
   The evidence is all around us that more effective steps are needed to protect schools and children from guns. In a survey of over 100,000 teenagers conducted last month, 30 percent said they could get a gun in a few hours--and 11 percent said they could get a gun in one day. Four in ten of these teenagers said there are guns in their homes; more than half say they have access to those weapons themselves. The fact is there are more than a million children returning home today to homes where there are guns that are loaded and unlocked. 
   No other major nation on earth tolerates such shameful gun violence. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control in 1997, the rate of firearm deaths among children 0-14 years old is nearly 12 times higher in the United States than in 25 other industrial countries combined. 
   In fact, I heard it said best from a person who was out marching yesterday on The Mall for the Million Mom March. She was asked about the presence of guns in our society and responded that only the United States and the IRA allow virtually unlimited access to guns. At least the IRA are preparing to turn theirs in. 
   At the very least, Congress owes it to the nation's children to take stronger steps to protect them in their schools and homes. 
   Gun laws work. Experience is clear that tough gun laws in combination with other preventive measures have a direct impact on reducing crime. In Massachusetts, we have some of the toughest gun laws in the country. We have a ban on carrying concealed weapons. A permit is required to do so. Local law enforcement has discretion to issue permits, and an individual must show a need in order to obtain the permit. We have a minimum age of 21 for the purchase of a handgun. We have increased penalties for felons in possession of firearms. We have an adult responsibility law. Adults are liable if a child obtains an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself or any other person. We require the sale of child safety locks with all firearms. We have a Gun-Free Schools Law. We have a licensing law for purchases of guns. We have enhanced standards for the licensing of gun dealers. We have a waiting period for handgun purchases. It takes up to 30 days to obtain a permit. We have a permit requirement for secondary and private sales of guns. We have a ban on the sale of Saturday Night Specials. We have a requirement for reporting lost or stolen firearms. 
   As Boston Police Commissioner Paul Evans testified last year in the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, ``Any successful approach to youth violence must be balanced and comprehensive. It must include major investments in prevention and intervention as well as enforcement. Take away any leg and the stool falls.'' 
   Commissioner Evans also stated that to be effective, efforts must be targeted and cooperative. Police officers must be able to work closely with churches, schools, and health and mental health providers. After-school programs are essential to help keep juveniles off the streets, out of trouble, and away from guns and drugs. 
   There are partnerships between the Boston Public Schools and local mental health agencies. School districts are employing mental health professionals. Teachers and staff focus on identifying problems in order to prevent violence by students. The Boston police work actively with parents, schools and other officials, discussing incidents in and out of school involving students. The Boston Public Health Commission promotes programs by the Boston Police Department. 
   In developing an effective approach like this, Boston has become a model for the rest of the country. The results have been impressive. The success of 
   Boston's comprehensive strategy is borne out in these results: 
   From January 1999 through April 2000, no juvenile in Boston was killed with a firearm. 
   In 1990, 51 Boston young people, ages 24 and under, were murdered by a firearm. Last year, there were 10 such murders. 
   Reports from emergency rooms about firearm injuries are also down dramatically. 
   It's no coincidence that the firearm death rate in Massachusetts is significantly lower than the national average. When we compare states with tough gun laws to those that have weak gun laws, the differences are significant. In 1996, across the nation, the number of firearm-related deaths for persons 19 years old or younger was 2 deaths per 100,000 persons. 
   In states that have the weakest gun laws, the number was significantly higher: 
   Utah had 5.1 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 people--two and a half times higher than the national average. 
   Indiana had 5.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three times higher. 
   Idaho had 6.9 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--three and a half times higher. 
   Mississippi had 9.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000--four and a half times higher. 
   It is clear that strict gun laws help to reduce gun deaths. Yet, every time that Democrats propose steps to keep guns out of the hands of young people--proposals that would clearly save lives--our Republican friends have nothing to say but no. No to closing the gun show loophole. No to child safety locks. No to support for stricter enforcement of current gun laws. No to every other sensible step to reduce the shameful toll of gun deaths. 
   Nothing in any of our proposals threatens in any way the activities of law-abiding sportsmen and women. Surely, we can agree on ways to make it virtually impossible for angry children to get their hands on guns. We can give schools the resources and expertise they need to protect themselves from guns, without turning classrooms into fortresses. 
   We must deal with these festering problems. There is ample time to act before this session of Congress ends this fall. We could easily act before the end of the current school year this spring. We could act this week, if the will to act is there. All we have to do is summon the courage and the common sense to say no to the National Rifle Association--and yes to the Million Mom March. 
   I want to take a moment or two more to talk about the issue which has been raised by others who say, really the answer is just Federal enforcement of existing gun laws. 
   The National Rifle Association calls in public for more effective enforcement of the nation's gun laws. But it has waged a shameful and cynical campaigns over the years to undermine Federal enforcement activities by restricting the budget for the very enforcement it calls for. 
   Between 1980 and 1987, for example, the number of ATF agents was slashed from 1,502 to 1,180, a reduction of over 20 percent, and the number of inspectors dropped from 655 to 626 even as the number of licensed firearms dealers soared. 
   For the past 25 years, Congress has provided ATF with far fewer funds than necessary to support enough inspectors and agents to effectively enforce the nation's firearms laws. In 1973, ATF and the Drug Enforcement Agency had comparable numbers of agents and nearly equal funding--about $250 million a year. From 1973 to 2001 we see the cuts--in the number of agents--that have been made when we had the Republican leadership here in the Senate and in the House. 
   By 1998, however, the number of DEA agents had almost tripled, from 1,470 to 4,261, while ATF's remained constant. 1,631 ATF agents were on payroll in 1998--only 9 more than in 1973. Yet there are more licensed firearm dealers in the United States than there are McDonalds franchises. 
   A substantial increase in funding is needed if we're serious about helping ATF enforce the gun control laws. At every opportunity, the NRA and the Republicans say ``We don't need more gun laws. We need to enforce what's already on the books.'' Well, enforcement is exactly what Federal agents and prosecutors are doing. The facts are clear: 
   Overall firearms prosecutions are up. Criticism of Federal prosecution statistics ignores the basic fact that both  Federal and State authorities prosecute gun cases, and Federal authorities generally focus on the worst type of offenders. 
   The gun lobby says that the Federal Government should prosecute every case in which a person lies on the background check form, without exception. The fact is that ATF and DOJ do not have the resources to prosecute every case. Instead, their strategy is to have state law enforcement officials investigate and prosecute most of the gun violations while federal law enforcement officials pursue the more serious cases. 
   Although the number of Federal prosecutions for lower-level offenders--persons serving sentences of 3 years or less--is down, the number of higher-level offenders--those sentenced to 5 years or more--is up by nearly 30 percent--from 1049 to 1345. 
   Do you understand that, Madam President? The number of Federal prosecutions for low-level offenders serving a sentence of 3 years or less is down. The number of higher level offenders of 5 years or more is up more than 30 percent. Why don't our Republican friends quote those statistics? 
   At the same time, the total number of Federal and State prosecutions is up sharply--about 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992, from 20,681 to 25,186. The number of high-level offenders is up by nearly 30 percent. 
   The total number of Federal and State prosecutions is up. Twenty-five percent more criminals were sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses in 1997 than in 1992. 
   The instant background check, which the NRA initially fought, is a successful enforcement tool. It has stopped nearly 300,000 illegal purchases since 1994. It has also resulted in the arrests of hundreds of fugitives. 
   Violent crimes committed with guns, including homicides, robberies and aggravated assaults, fell by an average of 27 percent between 1992 and 1997, and the Nation's violent crime rate has dropped nearly 20 percent since 1992. 
   The results speak for themselves. The increased collaboration among Federal, State, and local law enforcement has resulted in a more efficient distribution of prosecutorial responsibilities, a steady increase in firearms prosecutions on a cumulative basis, and, most important, a sharp decline in the number of violent crimes committed with guns. 
   Those are the facts. We will hear, as I have heard in the Judiciary Committee and in various debates: This is not really about more laws; what we need to do is prosecute. 
   The Republicans have cut the agents who are responsible for the enforcement of the laws by 20 percent, and on the other hand, we have seen the total prosecutions, not only the prosecutions but the results of those prosecutions--people going to jail as a result of the combination of Federal, State, and local prosecutions--has increased significantly. I hope in these final weeks of debate we will not keep hearing those arguments that have been made. 
   I mentioned Boston a few moments ago and about the stringent gun laws. Also, as Chief Evans has pointed out, we need effective prosecution; we need the laws, but we need prevention as well. 
   In Boston, between 1990 and 1999, homicides dropped by 80 percent. 
   In 1990, there were 152 homicides in Boston as compared to 31 in 1999. Indeed, serious crime across the board is at its lowest level in 30 years. 
   In 1999, no juvenile in Boston was murdered by a gun and none so far this year. 
   In 1990, 51 young Boston people, age 24 and under, were murdered by a firearm. Last year, there were 10; this year, thus far, 3. 
   Between 1990 and 1999, there was an 80-percent drop in young people age 24 and under murdered by a firearm. 
   There can be effective efforts, and they are making them. We ought to continue to eliminate, to the extent possible, the proliferation of weapons in the hands of children and those who should not have them. Every day in this country 12 children die. We need to make sure we take steps, including safety locks, parental responsibility, smart-gun technology, and the range of options to cut into that figure dramatically. We can do that. We cannot solve all the problems of violence in our society, but we can make a very important downpayment on it. That power is in our hands. I hope very much we will heed the mothers of this country who spoke out yesterday and listen to their message. They have spoken the truth with power. We should respond. I look forward to working with my colleagues in making sure we do. 
   Madam President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in welcoming the Million Mom March to Washington this weekend. Their campaign for sensible gun control has captured the attention of the nation, and it deserves to capture the attention of Congress too. Their message is irresistible. Gun crimes and gun violence are a serious challenge to the nation, and it is wrong for the United States Senate to bury its head in the sand on this fundamental issue. More than a year has passed since the Columbine tragedy, and we have failed to finish the job we began last year on the Juvenile Justice Bill. Democrats have repeatedly asked for the House and Senate conferees to meet and approve a final bill that includes the Senate-passed gun control provisions. We wait and wait and wait, while schools and children across the country continue to suffer from the epidemic of gun violence that plagues so many of our communities. 
   Too many children are in continuing danger of gun violence in their homes and schools and neighborhoods. These are not new problems, but they have become increasingly serious, and it is irresponsible for Congress to look the other way and ignore them. 
   Our goal is to support parents, youths, educators, law enforcement authorities, and communities. We have a shared responsibility to find solutions to these problems. Fifty million school children are waiting for our answer. 
   The greatest tragedy of the school shootings across the nation is they have not shocked us into doing everything we can to prevent them in the future. By refusing to learn from these tragedies, Congress is condemning the country to repeat them. How many wake-up calls will it take before Congress finally responds? 
   Current statistics on children and guns are unacceptable. 
   For every child killed with a gun, four others are wounded. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the rate of firearm deaths of children 0-14 years old is twelve times higher in the United States than in 25 other industrial nations combined. 
   Over 6,000 students were expelled in 1996-97 for bringing guns to school. The Journal of the American Medical Association reports that between 36% and 50% of male eleventh graders believe they could easily get a gun if they wanted one. 
   In a 1997 survey, 9% of high school students had carried a weapon to school during the 30 days preceding the survey; 6% had a gun. 
   Between July 1, 1994 and June 30, 1998, there were 173 violent deaths in schools. 
   In a recent survey of over 100,000 teenagers conducted last month, 30% said they could get a gun in a few hours and 11% more said they could get a gun in one day. 
   1 in 5 of these teenagers have felt afraid at school since the Columbine High School shootings a year ago. 
   4 in 10 of these same teenagers said there are guns in their homes, and more than half of them say they have access to those weapons. 
   In 1996, more than 1300 children aged 10-19 committed suicide with firearms. Unlike suicide attempts using other methods, suicide attempts with gun are nearly always fatal, which means that a temporarily depressed teenager will never get a second chance at life. Two-thirds of all completed teenage suicides involve a firearm. 
   The firearm injury epidemic, due largely to handgun injuries, is ten times larger than the polio epidemic of the first half of this century. 
   The nation's gun laws are a disgrace. We need to close the gun show loophole, support child safety locks on guns, and provide greater resources for strict enforcement of the gun laws now on the books. 
   The guns used to kill nine of the 13 people murdered at Columbine High School were purchased at a gun show. The woman who bought the guns for Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold said that she would never have purchased those guns if she had to submit her name for a background check. 
   More than 800 Americans, young and old, die each year from guns fired by children under the age of 19. It shouldn't take a Columbine, a Jonesboro, or an urban drive-by shooting to persuade us to act. 
   Perhaps six-year-old Kayla Rolland would be alive today if the gun that her classmate used had a child safety lock on it. 
   Perhaps a 13-year-old school girl in Deming, New Mexico and a school vice-principal in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania would still be alive if the young shooters did not have access to the guns. 
   American children are more at risk from firearms than the children of any  other industrial nation. In a recent year, firearms killed no children in Japan, 19 children in Great Britain, 57 children in Germany, 109 children in France, 153 children in Canada--and 5,285 children in the United States. 
   Shame on the National Rifle Association, shame on the Republican Party, and shame on the United States Congress for tolerating figures like that. My fervent hope is that the Million Mom March will succeed where so many other efforts in recent years have failed, and that Congress at long last will be persuaded to act. The irresistible force of the Million Mom March is about to meet the immoveable object of Congress--and I intend to do all I can to see that the immoveable object of Congress finally moves.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to an outstanding officer of the U.S. Navy. 
   Captain George Street, a World War II submarine war hero and Medal of Honor winner, proudly served our country in the United States Navy for over 39 years. Sadly, he passed away on February 28, in Andover, Massachusetts, his home for many years after his retirement from the Navy in 1966. 
   Captain Street was a native of Richmond, Virginia, and a 1937 graduate of the United States Naval Academy. He served on two naval surface combat ships, the USS Concord and the USS Arkansas, before reporting to submarine school. His first submarine assignment was in the USS Gar where he made nine wartime patrols in the Pacific. On his very first patrol, as the submarine's Torpedo Data Computer Operator, his leadership and courage earned him the Silver Star for actions in which the Gar sank over 10,000 tons of enemy shipping. 
   On a subsequent patrol, he earned a second Silver Star as the Gar's Assistant Approach Officer. Operating in Japanese-controlled waters, he played a vital role in sinking three enemy ships, and was also instrumental in enabling the Gar to evade a barrage of enemy countermeasures and return safely to port. Captain Street continued to build upon his brilliant service as the war went on. 
   In November 1944, he took command of the USS Tirante and on March 3, 1945, he led the submarine out of Pearl Harbor on her first war patrol. Within a month, Captain Street and the crew of the Tirante sank three enemy ships off the shores of Japan and survived a seven-hour counterattack by Japanese ships. Captain Street continued his patrol in the East China Sea, near Japan's southern coast, wreaking havoc on Japanese shipping. 
   On April 14, 1945, the Tirante began a major battle that would earn the crew a Presidential Unit Citation and result in President Harry S. Truman awarding Captain Street the Congressional Medal of Honor. Receiving intelligence that a major Japanese transport ship and escort vessels had anchored in a harbor on Quelpart Island off the coast of Korea, Captain Street took the fight to the enemy. He surfaced the Tirante and manned his gun crews since the Tirante would have to fight her way out on the surface if attacked. He maneuvered to penetrate the mined, shoal-obstructed, and radar-protected harbor. He evaded enemy patrols and, once in the inner harbor, fired two torpedoes into a large Japanese ammunition ship, completely destroying it. The resultant explosion revealed the Tirante's position to the enemy. In the light of the burning ammunition ship, two Japanese Mikura class frigates spotted the Tirante and attacked. Quickly bringing his submarine to bear on the leading frigate, Captain Street counterattacked with a torpedo, and then swung his boat around and fired his last torpedo at the other frigate. Clearing the harbor at emergency full-speed-ahead, he slipped undetected along the shoreline and safely evaded a depth charge attack by a pursuing patrol. The ammunition ship and both frigates had been sunk. 
   Captain Street was awarded the Navy Cross for another bold action two months later. On June 11, 1945, the Tirante sank several hostile freighters and other vessels, then moved through treacherous shallow waters into the heart of Nagasaki Harbor, where he sank another Japanese ship and destroyed docking facilities vital to the  enemy. The Tirante surfaced and escaped from the harbor under hostile gunfire from ship and shore batteries. 
   After World War II, Captain Street continued to serve with distinction as the commanding officer of three naval surface ships, as a submarine division commander, and as the commander of a submarine group. On his retirement in 1966, he became an active member of numerous local, state, and national veterans organizations and was a popular speaker at patriotic and community functions in Massachusetts and New England. Captain Street often helped veterans and veterans organizations, and had a strong interest in talking with and inspiring school children. 
   Captain Street's dedication and service to his country and community were extraordinary. I am grateful, as I know the entire nation is, for his lifetime of outstanding service. He was a great American hero, role model, and citizen. He will be missed, but his memory and example will live forever.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have just witnessed this week another example of indifference by Congress to the needs of lower-wage and hard-working American workers. While our minimum wage bill still languishes in the Congress in spite of all our efforts, the House Appropriations Committee just passed a bill that will eliminate the cost-of-living adjustments for the low-wage workers in the legislative branch. They cut the COLAs of the Library of Congress, the Government Printing Office, and other vital congressional agencies. This is after the Members of Congress got a cost-of-living increase of $4,600 last year. 
   The Republican leadership has cut out a COLA increase for these workers who happen to be the lowest-paid Congressional workers. If you are a truck driver for the Government Printing Office, you are out of luck. Again, when it comes to the staffs of the Members, they made sure their interests were protected. Drawing that kind of a line with workers who work for this institution is absolutely scandalous. 
   What is it about our Republican friends that they believe they have to be so harsh with the lowest-income working families in this country, refusing to permit us to vote on a pay increase, an increase in the minimum wage, of 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year? They have taken convoluted parliamentary tricks to block us from considering that, and then we find their own priorities are that this institution takes $4,600 for its COLA increase and cuts out the COLA increase for the lowest-paid workers who are serving the Congress. That is wrong. I hope the House of Representatives will change it. I hope it will not be tolerated. 
   There will be an effort on the Senate floor to make amends because that is wrong and unjust. We are not going to permit it to stand. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to call the attention of the Senate to neurofibromatosis, or NF, a cruel neurological disorder that affects so many of our citizens. In the past, groups who come together to fight NF have asked Congress to designate May as ``World Neurofibromatosis Awareness Month.'' This year, they are directing their energies to more substantive issues. I commend NF Inc. and other advocates across the nation for their leadership and their strong commitment to this cause. 
   NF is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that can cause tumors on nerves anywhere in the body at any time. It is a progressive disorder that affects all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. It is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States--affecting one in every 4,000 births. 
   There are two genetically distinct forms of this disorder--NF-1 and NF-2. The effects are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. 
   NF-1 is the more common type, occurring in about 1 in 4,000 people in the United States. Symptoms include five or more light brown skin spots known as caf&#233;-au-lait macules, as well as tumors that can grow on the eyes or spine. In most cases, the symptoms are mild and people can live normal and productive lives. In some cases, however, NF-1 can be severely debilitating. 
   NF-2 is less common, affecting about 1 in 40,000 people, and much more severe. Tumors grow near the auditory nerve and often cause pressure on other nerves in the head and the body. Tumors also grow on the spine, and attack the central nervous system. People with NF-2 often experience deafness, frequent headaches and facial pain, facial paralysis, cataracts, and difficulty with balance. 
   There is no known cure for either form of the disorder, even though the genes for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment, other than the surgical removal of tumors, which sometimes grow back. 
   The disorder is not infectious. Only half of those affected with it have a prior family history of NF. If someone does not have NF, they cannot pass it on to their children. 
   Talented researchers across the country are making impressive strides in finding a cure for this serious disorder. Thanks in great part to the research sponsored by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at NIH, scientists have already identified the two genes that cause NF, and significant progress in developing new treatments is being made. 
   Much of the cutting-edge research on NF is being performed at the NF Clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, which was founded in 1982 by Dr. Robert Martuza. It was one of the first clinics to recognize the unique multi-disciplinary problems that NF patients and their families face--and the vital role that a dedicated clinic plays in the research community. The McLain Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts also has a vital role in supporting important research, particularly for NF-2. 
   One of the most difficult aspects of having NF, or caring for a patient with NF, is not knowing what the future will bring. Our lack of knowledge about the cause of the tumors associated with the disorder also makes the evaluation of potential therapies difficult. In association with Children's Hospital of Boston and the House Ear Institute in Los Angles, the NF Clinic at MGH is participating in an international study to define the types of tumors most commonly associated with NF. 
   Congress has a responsibility to provide these dedicated medical professionals and researchers with the resources and support necessary to continue their lifesaving work. President Clinton has asked for increased funding to fight this disorder and many other neurological illnesses. 
   We must also ensure that a person's genetic information cannot be used as a basis for discrimination. To receive appropriate care for NF, patients must have access to genetic tests, free from the concern that the results of those tests will be used to discriminate against them in any way. 
   I commend the dedicated researchers and physicians across the country for their commitment to this important issue, and I commend advocates like NF Inc. for their leadership. I look forward to rapid progress in the years ahead, and I am confident that Congress and the Administration will do as much as possible to support their all-important efforts. Together, we can cure NF.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator DASCHLE, Senator MOYNIHAN, and I, and the majority of the members of our caucus are introducing legislation to provide prescription drug coverage under Medicare. It is a program supported not only by the Senate Democrats but by House Democrats and the President as well. Senior citizens deserve prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Democrats are committed to providing it and providing it this year. 
   It is long past time for Congress to mend the broken promise of Medicare. Medicare is a guarantee of affordable health care for every senior citizen, but that promise is being broken every day because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. The need is urgent. Too many elderly citizens face an impossible choice between food on the table and medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. They take half the pills their doctors prescribe, or do not even fill a needed prescription at all because they cannot afford the high cost of the prescription. 
   They pay twice as much for the drugs they need because they pay full price, while almost everyone with private insurance pays less because of negotiated discounts. Too many seniors end up in the hospital at immense cost to Medicare because they cannot afford the drugs they need, or can't afford to take them correctly. 
   Opponents say we cannot afford this coverage, in spite of the budget surplus. The issue is priorities. Health care for the elderly is more important than new tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   Others say this coverage should be available only to the elderly who are poor. But senior citizens want Medicare, not welfare. They should not be forced into poverty in order to obtain the medications they need. 
   The ongoing revolution in health care makes this coverage more essential now than ever. Coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare is as critical today as coverage of hospital and doctor care. Senior citizens need help now. The President knows it, Democrats and the House and Senate know it, senior citizens know it, and so do their children and grandchildren. 
   Congress should listen to their choices. The time for excuses is over. The time for action is now. 
   I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to review where we are on the issue of Medicare and Medicare coverage. This chart shows the number of senior citizens who have prescription drug coverage.  
   Senior citizens lack affordable, reliable, quality coverage.  
   The only group of senior citizens who have coverage today that is reliable, affordable, and dependable are the 4 million seniors covered under Medicaid. Today, we have 12 million senior citizens who effectively have no coverage at all; that is a third of all of our senior citizens. Eleven million seniors have employer sponsored coverage, and I will come back to that because employer sponsored coverage is disappearing. 
   Three million seniors have coverage under Medicare HMOs, 4 million are covered under Medigap--and we will examine that particular phenomenon--4 million under Medicaid, and 3 million now switched plans during the year or have other coverage. 
   We have a about a third who have no coverage whatsoever. Another third have employer-sponsored coverage, but we are finding that this coverage is declining rapidly. Medicare HMO coverage is also declining, and Medigap coverage is often unaffordable. That is the current situation. Let's look a little further. If we look at the income of senior citizens, what we see is that 57 percent of senior citizens have incomes under $15,000; 21 percent have incomes above $15,000 but under $25,000. If you add those together, obviously 78 percent are below $25,000. Elderly people in our country have very modest means--very, very modest means. 
   The average income for a person over 65 is just above $13,000. The cost of coverage is going up. I just showed a chart of the 
   different types of coverage we had, pointing out one-third of our senior citizens have no coverage, and another third have health coverage that is related to their former job. The next chart shows firms offering retiree health coverage. 
   The chart indicates coverage ``drops 25 percent.'' 
   There was a 25-percent drop in employers covering prescription drugs for their retirees in the 3 years from 1994 to 1997. This is a dramatic reduction in coverage. 
   Remember I showed the other chart that said a third had coverage through employer sponsored retiree benefits? This shows that the number of firms offering retiree health benefits is dropping absolutely dramatically. 
   We saw there were a number of our senior citizens, about 4 million, who had coverage through Medicare HMOs. Look at what is happening to Medicare HMO coverage. It is inadequate and unreliable. 
   First of all, the drug benefit is offered only at the option of HMOs, so some HMOs offer coverage and others do not. More than 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year. That is because the HMOs moved out of the areas where those seniors live. Seniors lost their coverage. Look at this: 75 percent of Medicare HMOs will limit prescription drug coverage to less than $1,000 this year. That is an increase of 100 percent in the number of HMOs capping coverage since 1998. And 32 percent of Medicare HMOs have imposed caps of less than $500 this year. So even though you have 4 million Americans who have prescription drug coverage through Medicare HMOs, what you find out is there is a cap on the amount of prescription drugs they are able to receive. After that, they pay for all prescription drugs themselves. 
   What the trend is, the dramatic trend, is that the dollar cap is going down and down, with a third of HMOs having a cap of $500. Many seniors in Medicare HMOs will exceed the cap. What we find is that Medicare HMO prescription drug coverage is increasingly inadequate and increasingly unreliable. 
   There is a dramatic reduction in the number of employers providing coverage for retirees, and a dramatic increase in the amount of money that individual seniors are paying out-of-pocket, even if they have some coverage under their HMO. 
   The third group I pointed out were those who had Medigap coverage, drug coverage which basically is unaffordable. These are sample Medigap premiums for a 75-year-old. In Delaware, just over $2,600; just under $2,000 in New York and Iowa; and just under $2,400 in Maine and Mississippi. 
   Against that background, what has been happening to the cost of drugs? The average seniors income is just above $13,500. A third of all of our seniors have no coverage; another third are losing it dramatically. We find that 4 million of the remaining have increasingly limited coverage due to caps, so they are paying more and more out of pocket. Medigap, which is another way they are able to get some coverage, is going right up through the roof. So they are being hard-pressed, and all at a time that 78 percent of all the elderly people have incomes below $25,000. 
   Let's see what is happening to the cost of prescription drugs. Since 1995, drug costs have been growing at double-digit rates. On this chart: Percent increases in drug costs. Let's look at the increase in the cost of the drugs: almost 10 percent in 1995, 10 percent in 1996, 14 percent in 1997, almost 16 percent in 1998, 16 percent in 1999. 
   Let's compare that to the Consumer Price Index for all goods. It is 2.5 percent in 1995, it is 3.3 percent in 1996, 1.7 percent in 1997--1.7 percent cost-of-living increase and look at the cost of the prescription drugs-- 14 percent. In 1998 it is 1.6, and 2.7 in 1999, and look at the cost of these drugs. 
   This is not just a peripheral issue for our seniors. When we passed the Medicare program in 1964, as we heard so eloquently today from both our leader on this side, Senator DASCHLE, and Congressman GEPHARDT, we had a lot of the same kinds of criticisms that are being made now against this program: This is the beginning of a takeover by the Federal Government; this is the beginning of socialism. 
   Of course, they were wrong then and we were right because the Medicare program has worked. But one area we did not take care of was prescription drugs because private coverage at that time did not provide for drug coverage.  I daresay prescription drugs are as necessary for our senior citizens today as hospital care or doctor care. 
   Prescription drugs coverage is necessary for elderly people. Yet it is left out. In a very important way, our Medicare system is not living up to its guarantee--for the men and women who fought in the wars and brought this country out of the depths of the Depression and have educated their children--to live their golden years with a degree of security and peace with respect to their health care needs under Medicare. We are now finding now with that major gap--today, more than 95 percent of the private sector provides prescription drug coverage although they are dropping it for retirees--that Medicare does not provide prescription drug coverage. It is a major gap. 
   We are saying: Let's fill that gap; let's meet our commitment to our seniors; let's include under Medicare a program that is going to be worthy of our names and which is absolutely essential if we are going to have our seniors--our parents and grandparents--live in the peace, dignity, and security they deserve. 
   That is why we believe the program ought to be voluntary, there ought to be coverage for all, it ought to provide basic coverage and have catastrophic coverage, and it ought to be affordable. 
   The President has embraced and endorsed the program, and it is endorsed by the overwhelming majority of our caucus in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, and it is strongly supported by our leader and Mr. GEPHARDT. 
   The President in the Rose Garden today asked our Republican friends to join in this effort to pass this legislation this year. We have to pass something that is going to be meaningful and worthy of our efforts. He invited our Republican friends to join us in this effort and outlined the program and spelled out the details as well as the cost of this program. 
   When we pass this program and send it to the President's desk, we in the Congress will say: Why did it take us so long? Every day we delay passing this program, millions of our fellow citizens are being asked to make decisions about their very lives which they should not have to make. That is wrong. We ought to respond. We know how to do it. The question is whether we have the will. 
   We are going to insist this Senate and House of Representatives address this issue in this Congress. We give those assurances to the American people, and we invite our friends on the other side of the aisle to join us in meeting our responsibilities to our senior citizens.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take about 3 minutes because we do want to hear particularly from the cosponsors. Since I was mentioned in the remarks of my good friend from New Hampshire, I think I should respond. 
   I have been listening for the last 4 days in the Senate to how the schools that are serving underserved children and disadvantaged children are in crisis in America. We have heard that in speech after speech on the other side of the aisle and many on this side as well as from myself because of the challenges we are facing. The fact remains today the Governors have 96 cents out of every dollar. Do my colleagues understand that? The Federal Government has maybe 6 or 7 cents out of the dollar. They have 96 cents. If the schools are not working well, I believe perhaps we ought to have educational recommendations in programs that have been tried and tested and are working. The Governors have had their chance, and they have come up short on this issue. We have been making that case. 
   Finally, on title I funds, 98.5 cents out of every title I dollar goes to the local level; 1 percent is retained at the State level. I would like to hear from my friend from New Hampshire what the basis of his study is, but we have the GAO reports, studies, and allocations. I know, for example, with respect to the old block grants that used to go to the States in higher education, very little of that ever got out of the State offices because the Governors in those States, including my own State of Massachusetts, used that money to fund the departments of education for child and maternal care. I doubt a nickel of that ever--also in my own State of Massachusetts--helped people because it was all absorbed as a result of the 
   flexibility. We are trying to get away from that. 
   I yield the floor. I thank the Senator from Indiana for his patience.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object--I will not object--historically, although we get away from the history, those who are the principal proponents are generally recognized to make the case before opposition speaks. So we have tried to go back and forth. We have done pretty well. Since there are a number on our side who are prime sponsors, generally, as a courtesy, we have followed that historically and traditionally. We have gotten away from that. 
   I think the proposal is eminently fair. If it is all right, we might let them go in order to make the presentation, and then I would be glad to hear from two or three on the other side. These are all prime sponsors. Generally, in order to be able to make the case, I think we ought to have a chance to hear from them, certainly before the noon hour. I ask that we extend the time a bit before going into recess because I think they ought to be heard in outlining the presentation on the agreement. I have no objection.

I think all Members in the Senate know the issue of teacher quality and recruitment and also how to get quality teachers in rural areas and underserved areas. That has been an area of great specialization. Those who had the alternative have benefited from her knowledge, including Senator LIEBERMAN, as well from her energy in these particular needs and by the very sound judgment of her positive suggestions. I thank the Senator. She has placed the important aspect of education on her agenda and we have benefited from her interaction and her recommendations.

   I had the pleasure of talking with the President of the United States on Wednesday evening after he came back from his trip. He told me about the school in Owensboro. I want to just give the assurance to the Senate that he told me it is one of the schools with the highest number of children receiving nutrition programs, which defines the disadvantaged children. They have a superb literacy program. They had small class size. They had a great emphasis on teacher training. It moved from one of the lower level schools, in terms of academic achievement, up to one of the top ones in Kentucky.

I have the notes back in my office about the percentage of progress that was made. 
   What he was talking about was well trained teachers, smaller class size, and support programs for children who are in need. Those are concepts we have tried to have in this program. I know we have some differences on that, but I wanted any reference to the President's trip to Owensboro also to relate the quality and very strong improvement in the education he witnessed down there. I think it is worthwhile taking note. We all ought to know what works and be encouraged by it. 
   I thank the Senator.

What kind of message does the Senator think a child gets who goes to a school that has windows open in the wintertime, an insufficient heating system, or a dilapidated electrical system so they can't plug in computers? What kind of subtle message does the Senator think that sends to the child where, on the one hand, we say it is important to get a good education, but on the other hand the child goes to a crumbling school, whether it is in the urban or rural areas, or Indian reservations?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 4 1/2 minutes. 
   Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator LIEBERMAN and his cosponsors for the focus and attention they have given to really the central priority for all families in this country in the area of education. The restlessness those Senators and others have with regard to making sure we are going to try to reach every needy child in this country is something we all should embrace and support. 
   I am not sure at this hour of the day, so to speak, in terms of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, if it is possible to bring about the kind of change and focus that is desirable. But there are broad areas of support and agreement for that concept in terms of enhanced resources and enhanced accountability. 
   I certainly look forward to working with him in the future on this whole area of education. 
   I think the ideas that have been out there in terms of Safe and Drug-Free Schools, which has been basically a bipartisan effort in giving national focus and attention to that, and a sense of urgency, are still important to preserve. Senator DEWINE and Senator DODD worked out an effort in that area in our committee. I think it is important to preserve it. The progress we have made in technology I think is worth preserving. The afterschool programs are really the most heavily subscribed programs. They also have bipartisan support and are a matter of national urgency. I don't think they have gotten the kind of attention they should have in the Lieberman amendment. 
   Finally, there are several programs that are working very well in terms of being included in the consolidation program. One of them I have particular interest in is ``Ready to Learn.'' There is $11 million on ``Ready to Learn.'' It is done through the Public Broadcasting System. It reaches 94 percent of the country, 87 million homes, 37 million children, and received 57 Emmys. If you ask any public broadcaster in the 130 stations nationwide what the best children's program is, they will mention this one. I don't want to see that lost and sent back to any State thinking that could be recomposed. 
   The Star Schools Program works through nonprofits, again, led by strong bipartisan support, to try to reach out to schools that may not have a math and science teacher and up-to-date educational programs, and has been done through a number of States. It has been very effective through nonprofits. That is another program. It is a small program, but it has enormous educational values. 
   With reluctance, because I have great friendship and affection for my friend from Connecticut, I will not vote in support of it. But I want to certainly guarantee to him and to all of those who have been uniformly strong sponsors in our committee that I want to work closely with our colleagues on the other side to try to give greater focus and attention to the problems of the neediest students in the country. 
   I yield the remainder of my time. 
   I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I express my appreciation for the excellent statement that the Senator from Alaska has just given and thank him for his leadership on this issue. I also thank the chairman, Senator JEFFORDS, for his hard work on this issue as well. Both of them have helped us understand how parents and other caregivers can have a very positive impact on children and infants at very early ages. I thank colleagues on our side, including my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator JOHN KERRY, who has been particularly interested in this issue and has spent a great deal of time on it, and also the Senator from Connecticut, Senator CHRIS DODD, who has  led our efforts on issues involving children for many, many years. Finally, I want to thank Stephanie Robinson of my staff, who is sitting here on my left, for her insight and diligence as we have worked through the details of this early learning proposal. 
   I think the Senator from Alaska has really outlined a compelling case for this issue. If we go back a little while and think of the first studies--the Perry Preschool Program, which Senator STEVENS mentioned--almost 30 years ago, where the results have been followed over a period of years and have documented how early interventions for children resulted in more positive academic and lifestyle outcomes for many children. 
   I think that the Perry Preschool study caught the attention of a lot of educators. Then we had the meeting in 1990 when the Governors were together--the Charlottesville meeting. Many of the issues we have been talking about these past few days recall the discussion surrounding early learning that the Governors initiated back in 1990. And there the Republican and Democratic Governors together announced that our first priority should be to have children ready to learn when they enter school. They understood what was happening in the States, and that early learning was a matter of enormous positive consequence for all educational and social service efforts. Even before brain research provided a clear medical basis, Governors sensed that ``the earlier the better'' in terms of early interventions. 
   Then we had the studies done by the Carnegie Commission in 1993, which focused on impacts of these early interventions. Later, when we had the Year of the Brain in 1996, I believe, we found further information as described by the Senator from Alaska, about the importance of proper stimulation to the formation of brain synapses in young children. Important work continued throughout the 1990's by Dr. Brazelton and Dr. Zigler, who are really the godparents of this concept of early intervention. 
   The bottom line is that quality early learning experiences help children develop self-confidence, curiosity, social skills, and motor skills. These are the building blocks that children use to expand their interest in learning when they get to school. They may also develop a sense of humor. They certainly learn consideration of others. These are basic benefits of early learning, and they last a lifetime. They are absolutely essential in terms of learning and academic achievement, but also essential 
   in terms of interpersonal skills, their own personal happiness, and their own productivity and contributions as members of a society. 
   As we debate education policy, we must continue to find common ground that enables us to act effectively. One of the most important opportunities is in early learning. Last month's Senate Budget Resolution included a bipartisan amendment that reserved $8.5 billion to improve early learning services throughout the Nation. The Senate is clearly moving toward a commitment to ensure that each of the 23 million American children under age six is able to enter school ready to learn. 
   Senator STEVENS and I worked together to build a strong bipartisan coalition for this reserve fund in the Senate resolution, and now is the time to continue these efforts. As we consider the investments that are needed in education, we cannot ignore early childhood learning. 
   Education occurs over a continuum that begins at birth and extends throughout life. The need to do more to make greater educational opportunities available in a child's very early years is clear. Study after study proves that positive learning experiences very early in life significantly enhance a child's later ability to learn, to interact successfully with teachers and peers, and to master needed skills. It is long past time to put this research into practice. 
   Just last week Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, a 700-member bipartisan coalition of police chiefs, sheriffs, and crime victims, released yet another convincing report. It finds that children who receive quality early learning are half as likely to commit crimes and be arrested later in life. 
   Early learning programs are good for children, good for parents and good for society as a whole. Unfortunately, far too many parents lack access to quality early learning activities for their children while they work. Although two thirds of mothers work outside the home, only 58% of 3- and 4-year-olds living above the poverty level, and 41% of those living below the poverty level, are enrolled in center-based early learning programs. 
   A dramatic recent survey found that more parents are satisfied with Head Start than any other federal program. But only two in five eligible children are enrolled in Head Start - and only one in 100 eligible infants and toddlers are enrolled in Early Head Start. As a result, literally millions of young children never have the chance to reach their full potential. What a waste! We must do better. We can do better. 
   The Committee for Economic Development reports that we can save over five dollars in the future for every dollar we invest in early learning today, the investment significantly reduces the number of families on welfare, the number of children in special education, and the number of children in our juvenile justice system. Investment in early learning is not only morally right - it is economically right. 
   We must steadily expand access to Head Start and Early Head Start. We must make parenting assistance available to all who want it. We must support model state efforts that have already proved successful, such as Community Partnerships for Children in Massachusetts and Smart Start in North Carolina, which rely on 
   local councils to identify the early learning needs in each community and allocate new resources to meet them. We must give higher priority to early childhood literacy. In ways such as these, we must take bolder action to strengthen early learning opportunities in communities across the Nation. 
   The Rand Corporation reports: ``After critically reviewing the literature and discounting claims that are not rigorously demonstrated, we conclude that these [early learning] programs can provide significant benefits.'' Governors, state legislatures, local governments, and educators have all called for increased federal investments in early learning as the most effective way to promote healthy and constructive behavior by future adults. As we strengthen education policy, we cannot lose sight of the evidence that education begins at birth--and is not a process that occurs only in a school building during a school day. 
   We must examine children's experience during the five or six years before they walk through their first schoolhouse door. Our goal is to enable all children to enter school ready to learn, and maximize the impact of our investments in education. 
   It is especially important that low-income parents who accept the responsibility of work under welfare reform to have access to quality early learning opportunities for their children. The central idea of welfare reform is that families caught in a cycle of dependence can be shown that work pays. Today I am proud to stand with so many Senators who agree that children's development must not be sacrificed as we help families move from welfare to work. 
   A decade ago the Nation's Governors agreed that helping children enter school ready to learn should be America's number one priority. We have made some progress since then, but we are still falling far short of our goal. 
   In Massachusetts, the Community Partnerships for Children Program currently provides quality full-day early learning for 15,300 young children from low-income families. Yet today in Massachusetts over 14,000 additional eligible children are waiting for the early learning services they need--and some have been on the waiting list for 18 months. A 1999 report by the Congressional General Accounting Office on early learning services for low-income families was unequivocal--``infant toddler care [is] still difficult to obtain.'' 
   Even as the need to provide these opportunities increases, it is clear that many current facilities are unsafe. The average early learning provider is paid under seven dollars an hour--less than the average parking attendant or pet sitter. These low wages result in high turnover, poorer quality of care, and little trust and bonding with the children. 
   Here in the Senate, we have worked together for several months on a proposal to enable local communities to  fill the gaps that impair current early learning efforts. Our amendment provides $3.25 billion for early learning programs over the next three years. Local councils will direct the funds to the most urgent needs in each community. The needs may include parenting support and education--improving quality through professional development and retention initiatives--expanding the times and the days 
   children can obtain these services--enhancing childhood literacy--and greater early learning opportunities for children with special needs. These funding priorities are well-designed to strengthen early learning programs in all communities across the country, and give each community the opportunity to invest the funds in ways that will best address its most urgent needs. 
   I urge the Senate to approve it as a long overdue recognition of this important aspect of education reform.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, first of all, we all reach out again to Mike's family. I think all of us in the Senate, just a few days ago, were very grateful of our good friend and colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, for giving us the opportunity to add a word to the comments on the extraordinary life of Mike Epstein. 
   As PAUL--Senator WELLSTONE--had pointed out last week, the hours were passing along and there was very little time left. But I think the challenge for all of us is to live a productive and useful life. That is the criterion the great philosophers have defined as the purpose in life, and Mike lived that. We all are the beneficiaries of it. 
   Our hearts reach out to PAUL at this time, and to all the members of the family. I think Mike would feel right at home here this afternoon, where we are debating the education act. He had strong views about these issues, as well as many others. 
   He made life better for people in this country. We will think of him during the course of this debate, too.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will speak briefly. As soon as the Senator from New Hampshire is on the floor, I will be glad to yield so he will be able to make a presentation on his amendment. I have had the chance, over the weekend, to study it closely. I will reserve my comments on it until we have had an opportunity to hear his presentation in the Senate this afternoon. 
   Just to review very briefly, we have had, now, as I understand it, probably 4 days of discussion of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. Of those 4 days, 1 day was a general kind of presentation, although that was a good presentation by the speakers who had different views on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We had five votes: on Senator GORTON's amendment, what they call Straight A's; our Democratic alternative, which was introduced by Senator DASCHLE and a number of us; Senator ABRAHAM's merit pay amendment--I offered a second-degree on the Abraham amendment; and then on the Murray class size amendment. 
   We had indicated there would be a number of others, although a relatively small number. Actually, the total number that would be offered by this side would be somewhat less than has been usually offered in past considerations of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   We were going to have proposed an amendment that would address the whole issue of the quality of our teachers, to guarantee we would have a well-  trained teacher in every classroom at the expiration of the authorization bill. I will come back to that, how we are going to do it, and the importance of it for strengthening the quality of education and what the results are if you do have an excellent teacher, and what the academic results are, from various examinations of whether having a well-trained teacher, who is competent and knowledgeable about the content of the subject matter, and a good teacher. The difference that makes to children's ability to learn is intuitively obvious. 
   Nonetheless, we will have an opportunity to present some very important and powerful evidence about why the way we have approached this will result in more favorable results. 
   Secondly, we have the whole issue about assisting many of the schools in this country that are older and are in great need of repair and modernization. We want an opportunity to make a presentation to make. The Senator from Iowa, Mr. HARKIN, has a powerful presentation to make. We need over $112 billion a year to bring our schools up to standard. There is much work that needs to be done, again, through a partnership among the Federal Government, States, and local communities. 
   We want to address the important issue of afterschool programs. Senator DODD, Senator BOXER, and others have been involved in the development of that program. We have important results as to how that program is working and has worked in advancing the cause of teachers. 
   We want to have a good debate on accountability. We believe the most knowledgeable member is on our side, Senator BINGAMAN of New Mexico, who has, going back to the time of the Governors' conference a number of years ago, made that a speciality of his. Most of the pieces of legislation that are before us reflect a good deal of what he has developed and has broad support. That has been very important. 
   Senator MIKULSKI has reminded us a number of times about the importance of addressing the digital divide. In a time of new technology, it is important we not look back 10 years from now and find that the new technology has been used in such a way it further divides our children who are attending schools, but instead that we have been creative enough to use technologies in ways that have reduced the divide that exists in our schools rather than exacerbate it. That is very important. Senator MIKULSKI wants an opportunity to talk about this issue. 
   Senator REED has made a very important contribution to our legislation. He was a member of the Education Committee in the House of Representatives prior to coming to the Senate, following Senator Pell. He wants to talk about the importance of the involvement of parents in decisionmaking in the local communities. That is very important. 
   Senator WELLSTONE will be bringing up the issue of fair testing of children. He has spoken about that issue a number of times. We have voted on some aspects of it in the past. 
   Those are the principal education issues. There are some on our side who feel safety and security in our schools is an important issue, and we will be addressing that issue. 
   We have a limited number of amendments. In my conversations with most of our colleagues, we are prepared to enter into very reasonable time limits. I know on six or eight of those subject matters, we are prepared to enter into time agreements of an hour or so evenly divided so we can move this process forward. These are not subjects the Senate has not addressed. We have addressed these issues in the full committee in our markups. We have spoken about these issues during the debate. I intend to speak on the issue of the quality of our teachers because that is relevant to the Gregg amendment. 
   I have talked with our leader, Senator DASCHLE, who will be talking with the majority leader and hopefully will work out a program so we can reach a determination on these issues in the next few days. There is no reason why we should not do that. 
   There are amendments on the other side as well. We have had an 
   opportunity to look at some of those. There is no reason we cannot pick up the pace and resolve some of these issues in a timely way. We had hoped to do more of these amendments at the end of last week, and we are in the situation today, with the funeral of His Eminence Cardinal O'Connor, of being unable to reach a conclusion on some of these debates this afternoon. 
   Hopefully, we can, by the end of the day, give an indication of how the Senate wants to proceed. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, we have the Gregg-Lott amendment before us. The Senator has spoken about the liability provisions that have been included. There are four other provisions that are included in the amendment. 
   At the appropriate time, I am going to urge the Senate to accept the Gregg amendment. 
   It seems to me the case ought to be made within the States, since the States have the power to take action on the matter discussed here during the course of this afternoon. The liability provision the Senator has mentioned would say if the States have weaker provisions, then these standards would stand. If they have stronger standards in order to deal with the problems of protecting those who are involved in education, than those would stand. 
   A number of States have taken it. It always seemed we were focused on what was going to happen in the classroom. If the States wanted to take that action, they should take it. A number of them have. The Senator has offered an amendment which includes these provisions. We are going to recommend they move ahead and they be accepted. 
   There were other provisions that were included in the Gregg amendment. It makes some small adjustments to what they call the TOPS Program by requiring every local district to take advantage of what the TOPS Program would be. They change the requirements to say that every local district has to do it, instead of just failing ones. I think that is an improvement. 
   It adds a part of our Democratic teacher quality accountability provision, so after 3 years, if the local district is not improving, the district cannot get the fourth and fifth year funds. We do that plus provide additional kinds of protections. Theirs is a modest change, but a useful one. 
   As I said, it provides teacher liability, which is acceptable. Then, as I understand it--I read it--there is, in addition, a small pot of money for financial incentives for certifications of teachers. That is not objectionable. It is a very modest program. It might provide some value for teachers. 
   But I want to come back to the underlying themes of where we are in this legislation. The amendment itself can be easily wiped out by the Governors of the States; the teacher quality program is blockgranted under Straight A's in S. 2. 
   So in effect, if the Governor wanted to block grant the whole TOPS Program--their basis for recruitment, mentoring, and upgrading skills for teachers in classrooms, which is their teacher education program, they could do it. It disappears. The teacher quality program can be block granted in the 50-State block grant and the 15-State block grant. 
   So we are effectively eliminating--or under the Republican program we are giving the Governor, at his own whim, the ability to eliminate all the teacher enhancement programs. 
   We are not there. Democrats are not there. We believe in having a strong emphasis in our program, a $2 billion program, that recognizes high quality recruitment, mentoring, and professional development. 
   Just on page 630, there is the treatment of the eligible programs, those which can be block granted. Here we have subparts 1, 2, and 3 of part (A) of title II, that is teacher empowerment. That is true on page 656, which is the 15-State block grant. 
   Why do we have this debate on a Monday afternoon? We say OK, we will accept it. If we are going to eventually pass S. 2, it will not be in effect in any event. So let's get on to other issues. 
   This is what has bothered many of us during the course of this whole debate. There is this fundamental commitment of our Republican friends to block grant these programs and issue a blank check for these programs. But, on the other hand, they say that they are really serious about these programs. 
   How can we accept the fact that they are serious about putting a well-qualified teacher in every classroom when they give an opportunity to the Governors to wipe out that entire program? We do not do that. We say it is essential, as part of the program to which we are committed, that you are going to have an effective program in recruiting and also in professional development. 
   Let's take another look at page 632 under the block grant program. We call it the blank check--block grant program. On page 632 it says:

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the good Senator from Maine and our chairman of the committee for urging the Senate to accept this amendment. I join with her in making that recommendation. 
   In 1998, with the reauthorization of the Perkins Act, we made improvements in the coordination of vocational education, adult education and job training. We did this in a bipartisan way with Senator JEFFORDS and Senator DEWINE. We took valuable lessons that we learned from the school-to-work program, emphasizing the importance of partnerships between education and business. 
   Unfortunately, the school-to-work legislation is not being considered for reauthorization. I hope that my colleague will work with me to make sure this important program finds a way to exist in ESEA. 
   What we have found is the importance of integrating academic skills with state of the art career and technical skills. Every child should graduate from high school with the academic credentials necessary to give him or her a wide variety of career choices within a given industry. Children should be able to choose to go on to post-secondary education or directly enter the workforce, with a competitive edge. So there have been, as she pointed out, very important and significant changes in these vocational and professional schools. I think we are at a place where they are offering great opportunities for young people in an economic climate of higher academic challenge and higher skill challenge. I think the value of her amendment is it is going to complete the process rather than undermine it, which I think was one of the principal dangers of having it as a block grant. 
   I thank the Senator. We in Massachusetts, as in Maine, as in other States in New England, place a very high value on these training programs and academic programs. They have been a lifeline to many of our communities and to our economy over a very long period of time. Nothing is more dramatic of an example than the ability to channel our career and vocational education students directly into high skill, high wage jobs in industry. They are enormously important and they do good work and their work will be enhanced because of the Senator. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we took a valuable and useful step a few moments ago when we preserved the vocational education legislation outside of the block grant, the basic Perkins program, which affects some 6 million children in the K-12 and some 3 million students in post-secondary programs. 
   I intend to offer an amendment on teacher quality tomorrow. I have spoken on it this afternoon. 
   Before this legislation is finished, there will be efforts made by members of our committee to also exclude the block granting of the Migrant Education Program and the homeless programs. I will take a moment to mention what the current situation is with regard to the Migrant Education Program. 
   The Migrant Education Program provides financial assistance to State educational agencies to establish and improve programs of education for children of migratory farm workers that enable them to meet the same academic standards as other children. To help achieve this objective, program services help migrant children overcome the educational disruption and other problems that result from repeated moves. Program funds also promote coordination of needed services across the States. The most recent data reported by States indicate more than 750,000 migrant children are eligible for services. 
   The Federal Migrant Education Program is the only ongoing source of support for these highly mobile migrant children. The poverty and mobility, and often limited English proficiency, characteristics of the migrant student population combine to make demands for educational services go well beyond the services traditionally supported under State and local education budgets. 
   No State currently provides ongoing funding for migrant programs to help these children. We are wiping out the Federal commitment. For example, the Migrant Education Program supports supplementary instruction in core academic subjects, beyond which title I typically provides, often provided outside the regular schoolday and in the summer designed to address the special educational needs of children who move and are out of school frequently. 
   Without these funds, many highly mobile migrant children may attend school sporadically throughout the year or not attend school at all. Without the funds, the local education groups are unlikely to provide the normal range of services to children who attend their schools for brief periods of time, or go out to find and enroll migrant children outside of normal school enrollment procedures, or grapple with either the school interruption problems faced by migrant children or their needs for special summer programs. 
   Without this program, States and the local educational authorities would have little incentive to identify and serve migrant children, who cross school districts and/or State boundaries. 
   No single local educational agency, and, in many cases, no single State, is responsible for the education of a migrant child. No single local educational agency, and, in many cases, no single State, provides educational services to a migrant child during a single year. 
   The Migrant Education Program encourages and supports collaborative efforts and interventions across State lines to accommodate the needs of migrant children. 
   The Migrant Education Program provides support services that link migrant children and their families to community services. For example, during the regular school year, almost half of migrant students receive social work/outreach services, about 30 percent receive guidance and counseling, and almost a fourth receive health services under the Migrant Education Program. 
   Effectively, the point is that certainly at the national level we are dropping the commitment to try to do something about all of these children. 
   With regard to the homeless children, nationally there were 625,000 school age children identified as homeless during the 1997-1998 school year. Without separate funding for this national program, it is unlikely that significant numbers of these children and their unique problems will be addressed. They have higher than average rates of poor health, anxiety, depression, withdrawal, delinquency, aggressive behavior, learning disabilities, and suicides. Those problems will not be addressed. Through participation in the existing program, the States are focusing on reducing the barriers homeless children face in enrolling in and attending school on a regular basis. 
   Because of national leadership, almost all the States have revised their laws. Almost all the States revised their laws, regulations, and policies to improve the access to education for homeless students. Twenty-seven States changed their residency laws or regulations. Otherwise, the children would not be able to be eligible. Almost all State coordinators report either that all the students can enroll without school records--that previously stopped children from being able to participate in the schools--or that they have made special allowances to expedite their record transfers. Thirty-five States eliminated the barriers of immunization and guardianship requirements, otherwise some homeless children would be prohibited from participating in services. 
   These are enormously vulnerable children. There is absolutely no reason or justification to eliminate these programs, block grant them, and send them to the States. The States have not responded to this population's unique needs. 
   In the absence of the homeless program, I think States would not have the resources to employ a State coordinator for homeless children and youth, a position that is responsible for ensuring that homeless children and youth have access to a free, appropriate public education. 
   Without the homeless program, the local educational authorities that rely on Federal funds to provide services to homeless children would have to find funds in their own operating budgets, which are already overextended, or stop providing supplemental services to these children, who are among the neediest. 
   Last year, we provided $29 million for the education of homeless children. That is going to be eliminated. These funds most likely will not be made up by the States. These children are going to be ill served. It is basically and fundamentally wrong. I think we are going to be abdicating our responsibilities if we do not target some resources to what I think has been an effective program. 
   We have had some hearings on this problem in the past. People have just been extraordinary in how committed and dedicated they have been and how they have stretched scarce resources to make a real difference in children's lives. 
   We in this body rarely go a day when someone isn't talking about our future being our children and our responsibility to them. We ought to understand what we are doing to the most vulnerable children in our society, the poorest children, the homeless children, the migrant children, the immigrant children, and others in failing to guarantee their protection. I take strong exception. And I will offer an amendment, with others. Others have offered an amendment to restore those programs. I look forward to that. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to address that. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's a privilege for me to commend the new sister cities of North Adams, Massachusetts and Noisiel, France. They will officially establish a sister-city relationship on May 20. I extend my warmest congratulations to both cities as they embark on this excellent opportunity. 
   North Adams and Noisiel have a great deal in common. They have similar population sizes, and they are communities that worked effectively to overcome economic difficulties during the 1980's. Both cities have revitalized former manufacturing plants to create contemporary arts facilities that will attract visitors from many other nations. These two cities have shared remarkably similar experiences, and I commend them both for their impressive success. 
   Last year, the City of North Adams welcomed Deputy Mayor Daniel Vachez of Noisiel. He visited the many cultural and historic treasures that make North Adams a wonderful example of New England's history and heritage. Mayor John Barrett III has done an outstanding job of supporting impressive development initiatives for the city, and I commend him for his leadership. 
   I'm sure that the new sister city relationship will be a successful initiative. The relationship is a tribute to the vision and dedication of Mayor Barrett, Deputy Mayor Vachez and the many others in both cities whose enthusiasm and energy have made this project possible. I'm confident that both North Adams and Noisiel will benefit significantly from this relationship, and that their program will be an outstanding example to cities worldwide. I congratulate them for their achievement, and I look forward to a very productive sister city relationship.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just make a brief opening comment. I want to start off by mentioning where we are on the issue of teacher training and teacher enhancement that is being addressed by my good friend from Michigan. Under the Republican bill, there is $2 billion for teacher quality and class size--that is a total of $2 billion. Included in that, is $1.3 billion which is presently allocated for the class size reduction program that has been implemented for 2 years in a row. Therefore, the 29,000 teachers teaching today in grades 1, 2, and 3, who are getting paid out of class size reduction program funds, will effectively be receiving pink slips because the Republicans are taking that program's money and putting it into the Republican bill. 
   Second, part of that $2 billion is the $350 million that is currently being used in math and science professional development across the country. The $350 million program, named after President Eisenhower, helps local schools to develop the capability of math and science teachers. It has been a good program and is working effectively around the country. 
   So, the Republicans want to wipe out the new teachers who have been hired for the first, second, and third grade; they want to end the Eisenhower math and science professional development program. 
   On the other hand, our total proposal on the Democrat side is $3.75 billion. We have $2 billion which is for professional development, mentoring and recruitment, and $1.75 billion for class size reduction. We had, as part of our debate yesterday, included our $3.75 billion in the democratic substitute. Last evening, I reviewed what we did in our particular proposal and the guarantees we provided for teacher quality and education. We made sure in our amendment that there was going to be a guarantee of funds for professional development. The other side only mentions ``a portion of funds for professional development''. It is ironic to hear my friends talk about the importance of professional development, when they barely target any funds in their existing bill for professional development. ``A portion can be spent.'' 
   Furthermore, their bill does not guarantee any funds for mentoring programs, which we all know are so important and effective for retaining teachers. 
   We find the turnover of teachers serving in title I underserved areas averages 50 to 60 percent in 4 years as compared to those who have mentoring, which can make a great deal of difference to teachers. Their amendment does not address the issue of how to resolve the high turnover rate issue. It does not guarantee that teachers are going to get special skills to help students with disabilities or limited English proficiency. It does not give priority to developing math and science training programs. 
   When all is said and done, our Republican friends have come up with nothing to ensure that a certain amount of these funds go for professional development, mentoring programs, recruitment programs--activities we know are proven to improve teacher quality and retention. 
   We were anticipating, maybe unreasonably so, that in the areas that are tried, tested, and true, such as enhanced teacher training in the classroom, that our friends were going to come up with something. Basically, what they came up with is merit pay and testing of teachers. We have listened carefully to what the Senator stated. We are, as I mentioned, somewhat interested in the fact that these are the two areas. 
   In looking through the studies and reports of incentives for teachers to advance their capability of academic achievement and results, the cumulative studies are very compelling and are rather common sense. 
   Obviously, the academic background of the teacher's expertise is enormously important. But, we still are finding out that of the more than 50,000 teachers who were hired this past year, the majority of those serving in high-poverty areas are not fully qualified. We need to do something about this. We find there is a higher turnover rate in high-poverty schools. We know that if the schools want to hold on to new teachers, mentoring by experienced teachers, is effective. Studies have shown this. 
   Also, it is very evident that there ought to be continuing education and professional development for all teachers. As the information comes in and more studies are conducted, it is clear that professional development ought to take place not outside the school but in the classrooms and schools. 
   These are the models which have had the greatest success in ensuring all of our teachers are of the highest quality. For those who are not going to measure up, after evaluations and professional development, they ought to be given their fair due in terms of a hearing, but then moved out of the educational system. 
   That is what we believe, that is for what we stand, and that is included in our educational provisions. Those are the issues that we feel are important. 
   I ask the Senator whether he knows of any States that have embarked on a merit pay program.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I asked the question because last night I tried to find out which States have merit pay programs, and I was unable to find any. 
   Currently, there is nothing prohibiting States from implementing merit pay programs. If it is so successful, I would have thought we would have had several States already doing it and demonstrated that it has improved student achievement. 
   I can give the Senator a number of places where it has been tried and dropped. In Fairfax County, VA, they developed a merit pay program in the last few years, but the program was dropped. 
   I am all for incentives for teachers who move ahead in their academic achievements and accomplishments. We ought to provide incentives to encourage professional development and more advanced degrees. I am all for schools that are able to move ahead, and for giving flexibility to the States and the educational districts to provide financial incentives to do that. But in the areas where we are talking about rifleshot programs, which this amendment does, for particular individuals--I can, probably like the good Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, think of teachers who are teaching in some of the toughest schools in Boston, in Holyoke, MA, and in a number of other communities, who are showing up every day, working hard, facing extraordinary challenges where almost a third of all the children attending those schools are coming from homes where there is either physical abuse or substance abuse. 
   They deserve combat pay. 
   But that isn't what this is really about. This is about individuals and principals giving individual financial incentives. What we want to try to do is to make available--at least on our side--the kinds of financial resources available to local communities, for whole school reform. 
   I know the other side believes that States should have block grants--blank checks--but we want to support tried and tested programs that have worked. 
   I have a very interesting study here that was just completed by the National Commission on Teaching & America's Future, the Consortium for Policy Research in Education. A review of 65 studies of science teaching concluded that teachers' effectiveness in  teaching science depends on the amount and kind of teacher education, disciplinary training, and the professional development opportunities they experience later in their careers. 
   That is what we should have, the continuing, ongoing availability and requirement that there is going to be a continuing upgrading of the skills of teachers. That is what they want. 
   What we have seen to be a strong determinant of teacher effectiveness stems from the quality of the teacher's initial teaching education and certification, and, second, later, professional development. Studies done over the last few years have shown this to be true. 
   In listening to our colleague speak, I was just trying to find out where his programs have been effective. 
   I yield at this time and then will come back to the issue. There are others who want to speak.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in order to try to inform the membership, we are attempting to establish a time situation so Members will know. We wanted to have a very brief comment on this second degree to the underlying amendment, and then to move ahead with an announcement which will be agreed to by leaders that would spell out how we would proceed from that time. That is in the process of being worked out, as I understand it. But we are reasonably hopeful that in a very short period of time we will either have a vote on this, or perhaps we could set it aside and start considering other amendments. We are prepared to do it. I will see what the mood is after I address the Senate for just a few minutes at this time. 
   Mr. President, I will speak briefly about the second-degree amendment that Senator MURRAY and I have offered. I think there has been a good debate and discussion about the importance of well-trained teachers, continuing and ongoing professional development, and also incentives for teachers who want to try to have a continued academic degree and who go through various certification processes. 
   Our amendment, as Senator WELLSTONE pointed out, seeks to do the merit program on a whole school level that rewards all teachers in the schools; improve achievement for all students, including the lowest achieving students; provide incentives and subsidies for helping teachers with advanced degrees; and implements a rigorous peer review evaluation recertification that takes in many considerations during the course of a year. It is a very rigorous program where teachers are evaluated by master teachers, where there is a video sample of their work evaluated. We believe that is consistent with other provisions of the Democratic alternative. 
   We are saying to the parents of this country that we are including in our educational program, recommendations that work--that have been tried and tested. 
   We differ with our Republican friends who say let's have a blank check and send it to the State capitals. Let's have block grants and let the Governors make the decisions and judgments about what they are going to do. 
   We differ with that. That is why we offered this second-degree amendment. 
   You could say: What is your evidence in terms of these particulars schoolwide? I want to correct the Record of my good friend from Georgia who said Secretary Riley tried merit pay in North Carolina. It is true. He did try it. It is also true he also decided that it failed after the State spent $100 million. They changed their program to the merit schools program, which is working, which is exactly what we are doing today. You now have probably the most successful school district in the country, which is in North Carolina, which is using just the kind of program that we are talking about. We are seeing the development of the same kind of program in the State of Kentucky. 
   In North Carolina, the State focuses on whole school achievement and overall student achievement for reward. The State doesn't believe that individual activities can be isolated to determine what produced the improvements in student achievement--it's a whole school effort. Therefore, the focus is rewarding the whole school. Rewards are given to the school, and all teachers and the principal benefit. 
   If any State wants to use their 93 cents out of any dollar for the objectives that the Senator from Michigan points out, they are free to do so. We don't prohibit it. If they want to do it, they can do it. We are saying with our 7 cents of the money that is going out in the local community, we are going to support tried and tested programs that have been successful. 
   I asked earlier in the day what States permit individual merit pay, and we still do not have an answer. What we know on our side, for example, is supported by a CRS Report dated June 3, 1999, ``Performance-Based Pay for Teachers.'' It states that many individual merit-pay plans were adopted as a means to increase teacher accountability and improve classroom performance. But, these plans not only failed to improve student achievement, but also destroyed teachers' collaboration with each other and teachers' trust in the administrators. 
   Instead, the more recent shift toward group-based, whole school incentive pay plans, allows teachers to focus on fostering overall student learning. These plans encourage teachers to work together within a school in a noncompetitive environment. 
   We support States that have merit pay with regard to whole school programs, merit pay for enhanced academic accomplishment, merit pay for evaluations and the recertifications. All of those are very worthy and are permitted and encouraged in our amendment. 
   We listened earlier about an excellent school in New Haven, CA, one of the poorer districts in California. Classroom teachers, while still working with children, have opportunities to have their knowledge and skills rewarded both financially and by returning something to the profession. 
   In New Haven, classroom teachers carry out internship programs, develop curriculum, design technological supports, and create student standards, assessments, and indicators of student learning. 
   Using a combination of release time, afterschool workshops, and extensive summer institutes, the district involved more than 100 teachers--nearly two-fifths of K through 4-- on the language arts and math standards committee during 1996-1997 year. 
   During the summer of 1997, nearly 500 teachers, approximately 65 percent of the certified teachers, participated in district-sponsored staff development activities. The district had 24 different workshops in technology alone, offering a wide variety of different areas, including math and science instruction, bilingual programs, and many others. 
   The district pays the teachers for the courses leading to the additional certification in the hard-to-staff areas, such as special education, math, science, and bilingual. If the district does not pay the teachers for their time directly, the work counts toward increments on their salary scale.  
   The district provides free courses that reap ongoing financial benefits for teachers. 
   The district is bringing the salary incentives for those who have successfully passed the National Board for Professional Training Standards. The NBPTS for teachers was instituted in 1987. Achieving the national board certification involves completing a year-long portfolio that illustrates teacher practices through the lesson plan, with samples of student work over time and analyses of teaching. 
   They found that this school district--one of the poorest and neediest in all of California, the New Haven Unified School District, in a low-wealth district--now has an excellent reputation in education. Twenty years ago, it was one of the poorest in education, as well as financially. Today, they have closed their doors to out-of-district transfers and moved up into one of the highest achieving schools in California. 
   This is how it was done with regard to the teachers. There are other elements necessary in terms of classrooms. 
   Finally, I mention in Charlotte, NC, Mecklenburg, they ran an annual achievement goals-bonus cycle. This is how they consider their school district. Based on the degree to which the schools attained a set of goals, including improvement in academic performance, advanced course enrollment, dropout rates, and student attendance, there were two levels of bonus awards--100 percent and 75 percent. Schools that earned 75 to 100 percent of the possible goal points were designated exemplary, and bonuses of $1,000 and $400 were awarded to teachers and classified staff. Schools earning 60 to 74 percent of the possible goal points were designated as outstanding, and the bonus amounts were $700 and $300 for teachers and staff, respectively. 
   We are for it. But we ought to do it in ways that work. That is what our amendment does. That is why it deserves to be accepted by this body.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, from our side we have had a good discussion of the Abraham amendment. We had a brief discussion, but I think a good exchange, on the second-degree amendment with regard to the best way to provide incentives that will have a direct result in enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment for students. We are under the strong impression, based upon the best experience and the record to date, that is the best way to go.  
   Of course, as we all know, the 93 cents out of every dollar spent locally is within the domain of the State. If the Governors want to go ahead with a program outlined by the Senator from Michigan, they will still be able to do it. While the legislation represents a small percentage of the dollars that will be expended, at least on our side, we feel very strongly we want included in the legislation, programs that are tried, true, and tested and have had a sound record of performance. That is expressed by our second-degree amendment. 
   We are prepared to move toward the consideration of the Murray amendment that dealt with the class size. I think it is appropriate following this discussion on teachers. As I mentioned earlier today, of the $2 billion from S. 2, the Republican teacher proposal, $1.3 billion of that comes from the class size program which they effectively eliminated. Mr. President, $300 million is from the Eisenhower math and science program which is in existence now, which I think is a pretty good program. They are ending that program. They are only adding some $300 million to do all of the things they talked about in terms of enhancement of academic achievement for teachers and teacher support. This is in contrast to the amount we are proposing on the Democrat side, $3.75 billion, that we have outlined in the debate and discussion yesterday. 
   We hoped we would be able to go ahead with the Murray class amendment. We are prepared after that to move to the Lieberman proposal. There aren't any real surprises in the Lieberman proposal. Senator LIEBERMAN and others have outlined that in considerable detail. The language has been passed over to the other side. We wanted to go on giving the Senate the option to be able to consider the alternatives in S. 2 just on the teacher programs, both the recruitment and mentoring, and the academic enhancement and achievement for teachers. We wanted also to have a good debate on the proposal of Senator HARKIN on modernization of our schools. We wanted to debate the afterschool programs. We wanted to debate the excellent proposal of Senator MIKULSKI on the digital divide. We wanted to debate our strong accountability proposal of Senator BINGAMAN. 
   There are no real mysteries about where we are. I imagine we will get an opportunity to talk about safety and security in schools. There is very little surprise about the programs and our amendments. 
   We understand we want to go back and forth, but we are quite prepared to move ahead. We have been virtually free of any quorum calls since this legislation was laid down. That is rare. On Monday, we had seven speakers from our side, seven speakers from the other side. We went until almost quarter to 7, starting debate at 1 o'clock, and free from any quorum calls. That was true Tuesday evening and yesterday as well and has been true up until now. We are getting close to 2 o'clock. We are not in tomorrow. On this side we are prepared to get into debates and discussions on these items. They are at the heart of education reform. They have been demonstrably effective in helping and assisting the schoolchildren of this country. 
   I listened to my colleagues before 1 o'clock talking about all of the challenges we are facing educating children in underserved areas--all of which is true. What I didn't hear is how they believe they felt their bill would solve it. That is the question. Everyone can come to the floor and talk about the challenges we are facing with children in underserved areas. We all understand that. But when I hear time after time, speech after speech, we have a problem out there and we have to do something about it, I think it is beginning to sound empty. 
   Generally speaking, we identify a problem and we try to identify the solution to the problem. That is not being done here. The reason it is not being done is because the Republican proposal is basically a blank check, a block grant to the Governors. 
   When we find out we don't have well-qualified teachers, what is the answer? Blank check to the Governor. We have trouble and difficulty in overcrowded classrooms and we have dilapidated schools. What is the answer? Blank check to the Governor. We have new technologies that are coming down the pipe, and we want to make sure we will have a balance, that we are not going to get into a digital divide using technologies that will separate the haves and the have-nots in our schools. What is their answer? Give it to the Governor. 
   We have tried that before and we have not gotten very satisfactory answers. We have not gotten satisfactory answers in the time from 1965 from 1970 when we had block grants. We found how the money was diverted for football uniforms and band uniforms and swimming pools, for a wide range of different kinds of activities that were distant and remote and unrelated to children who had very important needs. 
   We had the other side, with all due respect, that took the position, as we started off in the 1990s, that the best answer in solving these problems is to close down the Department of Education. That was their position: We do not want any Federal participation. We do not want any partnership. Close it down. That was their position in the early 1990s. That, and the rescission of funding that had been appropriated and signed into law by the President of the United States during that time. 
   I, for one, as I have said a number of times on the floor, I think most parents would agree, that at every single meeting the President of the United States has with his Cabinet, there is going to be someone there who is going to say to the President: What about education for the children of this country? When they are going to be meeting at the Cabinet table and deciding priorities in the expenditure of our $1.8 trillion, you want someone there who says: What about education, Mr. President? 
   The Republicans do not want that voice in the room because they do not want any Federal participation on that. That has been their historic position. 
   Now we have the time to have this debate. As others reminded us, we do not do it every year. We do it every 5 or every 6 years. We are having this debate now, just after the turn of the century. What is their answer? Instead of no more Department of Education, instead of cutting back even more in terms of the education budget, they say let's give it all to the States. Let's give it all to the States and let them make a judgment about it, virtually free from much accountability. All States have to do to get the money is to have an application and general outline of what the State intends to do to enhance educational quality. Then there is a long list of things that can be included in that effort. But also included are the words ``for any educational purpose.'' Who decides that? The Governor decides that. 
   This is their ``Uses of Funds Under the Agreement.''--Funds that may be available to a State under this part shall be used for educational purposes. 
   Every Governor can just make a decision that this is for educational purposes and then they are not accountable until after 5 years. Then there has to be a finding by the Secretary of Education that they have not made substantial progress in the area of education. 
   So their position is: Blank check, block grant, give it to the States, let the Governors do whatever they do. That in spite of the extraordinary record of the efforts of serious Governors, Republicans and Democrats alike, in the period of the 1980s and the 1990s, who said what we have a responsibility for is for the underserved schools in our States. There were eloquent calls for action by the Governors themselves. The National Governors' Conference, time in and time out, we found were asking for it, going back to 1986. 
   Governors Alexander and Clinton and Keene and Riley, urging they give greater focus and attention to underperforming schools and districts, and that States take over the academically bankrupt districts. Those were speeches being made in 1986. I am glad to hear they are being made by our Republican friends now. 
   Then, in 1987, 9 States had authority to take over, annex educationally deficient schools--only 9 out of 50. The call went out again in 1990, and again in 1998. The National Governors' Association policy: Support the State focus on schools, reiterating the position first  taken in 1988 in the National 
   Governors' policy: 
   The States should have the responsibility for enforcing accountability and including clear penalties in cases of sustained failure to improve student performance. 
   Now we find there are 20 States that provide assistance to low-performing schools; 18 States apply some type of schoolwide sanction out of those 20. Now we have 20 States. It will take another 50 years, if we were going to get all the States to do what 20 States are doing now. But that is not good enough. Our Republican friends say give the money to the States, in spite of the facts. You have the record about what the deficiency has been at the gubernatorial level. 
   There are some notable exceptions, Republicans and Democrats alike. We are glad to recognize it. We pointed some of those out during the debate. But that has been the record. They have not measured up, done the job; they have not taken that responsibility. 
   We are not prepared, with the scarce resources here, to try to turn that over to the Governors one more time and expect they are going to do the job. No. We are going to insist that there will be incentives and disincentives for performance. That is what we do. 
   As I mentioned, whether you are talking about dedicating resources to turning around schools--in our particular program we have the resources to be able to do that. We make sure we are going to allocate scarce funds that each year are going to be set aside that can be utilized and will be effective in turning around failing schools. The schools are going to have to show annual gains for student performance. 
   We are to the point where we are going to insist there will be a report card that is given to every parent in this country about how their child's school is doing, every year. I think parents would like to know how their child's school is doing. We are guaranteeing that. 
   We asked our good friends on the other side how their bill is going to solve the issue of accountability. They cannot do it. We have been challenging them since the beginning of the debate. They cannot do it. We can. We are glad to go through these various provisions we have outlined about the assurance of real accountability of failing schools. If they fail, there are real consequences. After a period of time they are closed down. There is a whole new leadership for those schools if they are going to be reopened. Otherwise there is support for the children to go to other schools. 
   We also have a strong commitment to try to reach out to those children who are so often left out and left behind. We are talking about the homeless children. We have over a million homeless children in this country. We have over 700,000 children who are migrant children, who travel through this Nation at the various harvest times. There is a similar number of immigrant children who eventually are going to be American citizens. It is in our interest that they get educated. It is in our interest that they get educated, not cast aside. 
   Now, what does this Republican bill do? What it does is eliminate all those kinds of protections which have been out there now, guaranteeing those needy students are going to have their interests addressed. It sends the money back to the States, which prior to 1987 had not given those populations their attention. 
   I see the majority leader on the floor. If he wishes to address the Senate, I will be glad to withhold.

   Mr. KENNEDY. At any time the majority leader wants to propound the consent request, I will be glad to yield. 
   I wanted to read the 1987 report. In March of 1987, the Center for Law and Education sent a questionnaire regarding State practices and policies for homeless students to the chief State offices in the 50 States and the District of Columbia, and received 23 responses. The majority of the respondents, however, had no statewide data, so out of the 50, you got 23, and out of the 23, the majority had no statewide data on the number of homeless children within their jurisdiction, or whether these children were able to obtain an education. 
   The majority of States had no uniform plan for ensuring homeless students received an education--the poorest of the poor. Can those who want to give this money directly to the States tell us about programs that had been developed by the States prior to 1987? I have searched. I have looked. I cannot find them. Why? Because they were not a priority because they did not vote. Children do not vote, and the parents did not vote. We know the reasons, and that has been true with migrant and immigrant students as well. 
   As for the homeless children, we made marginal increases in the enhancement of those programs annually during the appropriations process, but we maintain our commitment. I wish we could be out here in a bipartisan way trying to find ways to strengthen these programs, to help those kids, to find out how we can be more effective. But oh, no, do my colleagues know what we are going to do? We are going to take those three programs, which is millions of dollars, and instead of continuing to target the homeless and neediest children, we are going to send that money to the Governors, to the State capitals to let them decide whether they want to be bothered by this. 
   The record is very clear: They have not historically, and there is little indication that they will today. If one looks over what is being allocated at the State level versus what the Federal Government is doing with programs in these areas, one will find they are begrudging support for these programs. There are certain exceptions, and we are always glad for that. 
   We enable students in failing schools to transfer to higher-quality schools. We say you cannot use more than 10 percent of the title I money for transportation. We let the local communities make the judgment of what they will do. Under the Republican bill, there is absolutely no cap. They can use the whole title I program for transportation. 
   On accountability, we find there continues to be a deficiency. 
   I will take a couple of minutes to go through the merit pay issue again and our particular proposal. Since we knew this was coming up, we tried to find out what different States have done and what has been successful. 
   We were reminded by the Senator from Georgia about a merit pay program that Secretary Riley instituted. It cost the State of South Carolina $100 million, and it was abandoned. I am sure my friend from Georgia does not realize it was abandoned. Probably those last words or last couple of sentences were missing in his presentation. They have switched to more of a school-based program. 
   In looking over the use of merit pay incentives for teachers across the country, one of the most successful has been in Dallas, TX. In 1991-1992, they implemented one of the most sophisticated accountability systems in the Nation. The centerpiece of it was that all staff in schools which increased student achievement received monetary awards. A 1996 study found when the scores were evaluated against the comparable school districts, the Dallas program had a very positive impact on test results. That is our amendment--schoolwide, with regard to that aspect. 
   In North Carolina, a State in which great progress has been made in education--I do not know why, but when we find out that some things work, as in the State of North Carolina, we do not try to share that with other parts of the country. We have tried to do that in this legislation. 
   North Carolina, in 1997, implemented its incentive program for whole school merit programs, and the legislature recently budgeted $75 million for the awards. More schools met their performance goals than expected. The second year required $125 million rather than scale back the level of the award. The legislature increased the budget to increase this successful program. It is working. We have no problem with our friend from Michigan on this type of merit pay program, but let's get it correct.

   Mr. KENNEDY. There was a dramatic outcome in one of the poorest communities in California where they had schoolwide summer programs and they took all of the teachers--500 teachers--and gave bonuses to the whole school as the academic achievement went up. They also supported teachers if they wanted to obtain professional development or work towards advanced degrees. Finally, they gave encouragement for recertification, which is a very rigorous program of examination by senior teachers and review of the skills and talents of these teachers. But most of all, they gave support for the classes and the schools that were increasing academic achievement. It went from one of the poorest schools, in terms of academic achievement, to one of the best in California in a period of 7 years.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Quickly, my answer would be no. Secondly, I think that--perhaps the Senator would agree with me--if we are going to give some extra pay, perhaps those teachers who are working in these combat conditions in underserved areas, whether they are rural or urban areas, might seem to be ones who could be deserving of it. That could be a decision that is made by the State. 
   But what I want to mention to the Senator, is that the States can do what the Senator from Michigan is proposing today, out of their 93 cents.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 7 minutes of that 8 minutes at the present time. 
   Mr. President, just to review very quickly, there has been some suggestion about the fact that in so many different underserved communities teachers are unqualified. We recognize that. That is why we have a very vigorous program in terms of recruitment and training and enhanced professional development. Everyone ought to know that in the Murray amendment there are requirements to carry out effective approaches to reduce that through the use of fully qualified teachers who are certified or licensed within the States. The comments about the Murray amendment earlier about qualifications and being unqualified just are not relevant to this debate and discussion. 
   I will not take the time to review the obvious, but studies have been done. The Tennessee study of some 7,000 children in 80 different schools says it all. It was done recently. In grade 4, students who attended small classes K through 3 were 6 to 9 months ahead of the regular class students in math, reading, and science. By grade 8 these advantages grew to over 1 year. 
   In Wisconsin, a similar study called the Sage Study had similar kinds of results. Their report had the analysis that suggests the teachers in Sage classrooms have greater knowledge of each of their students, spend less time managing their classes, and have more time for individualized instruction, utilizing a primary teacher incentive approach. It is unquestioned. It is unchallenged. 
   We have been waiting to hear from the other side a challenge of the basic and fundamental results of the smaller class size with good teachers. That is out there. 
   We are strongly committed. Senator MURRAY, who has been fighting this fight for the past year, is committed to make sure we are going to have that availability to school districts across the country. 
   That is No. 1. 
   No. 2, I can understand the anguish that our Republican friends are having about teacher quality, and also about the expenditures. Under the Republican bill, there is $2 billion. They effectively wipe out the current class size. That is 30,000 teachers they take out of K through 6th grades. They take them out. Those are lost. They get pink slips in a program that is supposedly providing quality teachers. These are quality teachers. They get the pink slips because they are using $1.3 billion of the President's program. They wipe out the $350 million in current Eisenhower math and science. They only have $300 million new money. 
   I can understand their frustration as compared to our program which is $3.75 billion. 
   Finally, I would like to remind our Republican friends that when this amendment was first passed here, we had BILL GOODLING on this the first time we had the negotiations. Senator MURRAY was there during the early parts of the negotiation and was our leader. 
   This is what BILL GOODLING, who is the chairman of the House committee, said the first time we had the smaller class 
   size.  
   This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with Washington's mandate, red tape, and regulation.  
   GOODLING said:  
   We agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal does not include a big, new, Federal education program. Rather, our proposal will drive dollars directly to the classroom and give local educators options to spend Federal funds to help disadvantaged children.  
   Interesting. 
   Here is the Republican Policy Committee, a dictionary of major accomplishments during the 105th Congress. Here is the Republican Policy Committee. They list 14. 
   Number 9: Teacher quality, initiative--cleared, cleared for the President.  
   The omnibus FY99 funding bill provides $1.2 billion in additional education funds--funds controlled 100-percent at the local level--to school districts to recruit, hire, train and test teachers. This provision is a major step toward returning to local school officials the ability to make educational decisions for our children.  
   Here they are taking credit for the same proposal, the Murray proposal. Three years ago it was the Republican proposal. They are the ones issuing the press releases. They are the ones taking credit for it. All Senator MURRAY is  doing is continuing that program. It is the same program. The President is putting up the money. It is the same program. It was good enough at that time for Mr. GOODLING, and it was good enough for the Republican leadership to take credit. 
   Here is what former Speaker Newt Gingrich said about it at that time. He called it ``a victory for the American people. There will be more teachers, and that is good for all Americans.'' 
   Here is what DICK ARMEY said.  
   Well, I think, quite frankly, I'm very proud of what we did and the timeliness of it. We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the President's people were willing to work with us so that we could let the state and local communities take this money, make these decisions, manage the money, spend the money on teachers as they saw the need, whether it be for special education or for regular teaching, with a freedom of choice and management and control at the local level, we thought this was good for America and food for the schoolchildren.  
   The same program today, the same program that we are going to be voting on, the same one, endorsed by ARMEY and endorsed by Gingrich and GOODLING.  
   What is it with our Republican friends that they were so enthusiastic for this program 3 years ago, taking credit for it, putting it on the list of major achievements of the Congress? Now we hear out here: No, no; we can't; Oh, Lord, we cannot have this new program. We can't have it. It has all kinds of problems. Oh, Lord. It has problems. It has problems. 
   Come on. We have been making an attempt in this area. You ought not be out taking credit for it if that is what you are interested in. And I am sure Senator MURRAY would be glad to offer you cosponsorship on this program and go with you up to the gallery when we have the celebration. I will go with Senator HUTCHINSON, with Senator GORTON, and the rest of our friends. 
   This is something that is basic and fundamental and successful. We have heard more speeches around here about the problems that we are facing at the local level. This program is tried and tested with good results and excellent outcomes for children. Teachers themselves embrace it. It was endorsed by Republicans 3 years ago. It is the same program. It was good enough for them then; it ought to be good enough for them now because mostly all of it is good for the children of this country. 
   We hope this amendment will be successful.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our amendment focuses funds on what works. If the States want to use their 93 cents out of the dollar for purposes that Senator ABRAHAM has mentioned, they can do it. We are focused on what works: School-based merit programs for improving the achievement of all students in a school, incentives and subsidies for helping teachers earn advanced degrees, implementing and  funding vigorous peer review evaluation and recertification programs for teachers, and providing incentives to help the most fully qualified teachers to teach in the lowest achieving schools. 
   These are the programs that are tried, tested, and that work. That is the second degree to the proposal of the Senator from Michigan. I hope it will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Reserving the right to object, and I do not intend to object, we will be voting on Tuesday. On our side--and the leader can correct me--there are probably seven substantive amendments. As the leader knows, having talked with all of us, we are willing to enter into time agreements on this so we can move the process forward. We want to try to do that in the early part of the week. 
   I know the leader has other matters for consideration by the Senate. Tonight we cannot make that request, but I hope both Senator DASCHLE and the majority leader can, at least in the first part of the week, see if we can enter into a time sequence. 
   We had good discussions and debate today. I believe with the debate we had on the substitute, plus on S. 2, we have covered the ground pretty well. There are some areas we perhaps need to give additional focus. There was no time indicated by the majority leader for disposition of those two amendments. I am trying to find out the intention of the leader so we can at least tell our people when they can expect some followup.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator GRAMS and Senator LEAHY in offering this Senate resolution expressing our deep concern about the continuing plight of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitsky. 
   Mr. Babitsky, an accomplished journalist working for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, still faces serious charges in Russia after being held captive by Russian authorities, beaten, and kept in a ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators. 
   For 10 years, Mr. Babitsky has helped fulfill the mission of RFE/RL to provide Russian listeners with objective and uncensored reporting. But Russian authorities, displeased with Mr. Babitsky's courageous reporting on the war in Chechnya, accused him of assisting the Chechen forces and had him arrested in the battle zone last January. 
   After six weeks in captivity, Mr. Babitsky was released, and then jailed again by Russian officials for carrying false identity papers. He says the papers were forced upon him. After an international outcry arose over his case, he was again released. But he still is not allowed to leave Moscow, and he still faces charges for carrying false papers and aiding the Chechens. 
   In addition, Russian authorities have continued to condemn Radio Liberty's coverage of the Chechen conflict, and have suggested that Radio Liberty should be forced to abandon its facilities in Moscow and throughout the Russian Republic. The authorities have taken steps to censor Radio Liberty and to intimidate its correspondents and others. 
   The United States should respond vigorously to this harassment and intimidation of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The Russian government should drop its trumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my other colleagues, first of all, in thanking a very special friend and someone we admire and care so much about, our colleague, PAUL WELLSTONE, as TOM HARKIN has said, for bringing us together. I thank him for persuading our leaders who have responded positively that we take a few moments from the business of the Senate to give recognition to an individual who has given so much of his life to this institution and, really, to our country. 
   I am grateful to join with my colleagues in adding a word about this extraordinary individual because, in a very important way, his life has been the U.S. Senate. I was fortunate enough, along that pathway of his, to have the opportunity to work with him, as several of my colleagues did, those who are here now, such as Senator SARBANES, and some who are not with us, Phil Hart and Claiborne Pell, as well as Senator Byrd. So I welcome this chance to join with others in recognizing Mike Epstein's extraordinary service. 
   Mike Epstein came to the Senate Judiciary Committee after 9 years at the Department of Justice, where he served as a Federal prosecutor. He used those same skills that made him a top-notch prosecutor to investigate some of the most difficult issues before our country. If there was a lead, he pursued it. If there was a fact to be found, he would find it. He left no stone unturned. He served the committee well, and I am proud that he was a member of my staff. 
   It was during that period that Mike's love for this institution grew and matured. Though he left briefly in 1974, he couldn't stay away for very long. Within months, he was back working for the Senate Intelligence Committee, and later for three additional committees, and then for several of my colleagues. 
   It is a mark of the man that Mike worked for so many different committees and Senators. His career in the Senate reflects an extraordinary breadth of interests and a genuine love for this institution. He is well-versed on issues ranging from international affairs to education; from health care to drug treatment and prevention. In fact, the country owes Mike a debt of gratitude for his tireless work on the 1988 drug policy legislation. He was an articulate advocate for a more balanced and comprehensive approach to drug policy. 
   Because of his landmark work, the country began to enhance its enforcement efforts by also considering the importance of drug prevention and treatment, as well as a fairer approach to sentencing. 
   Mike's work on each of these issues was guided by a love for national policy and also for the Senate and its procedures. He understands so well the relationship between the rules and the outcome of a legislative debate, which is so key in being a useful and productive and effective Member of this body. 
   The rules form a framework that ensures the fairness of the debate and an outcome that can be respected. Mike knows that, and it is reflected in his work. In so many instances, his knowledge of the ways of the Senate was drawn upon by so many of our colleagues in ways to advance the cause of our common humanity and decency. 
   Mike Epstein's work in the Senate will be long remembered--the legislative battles he helped us win, and the losing battles he helped us fight so well. But his true legacy will be his commitment to public service, and his dedication to the institution. He is among the ranks of those who choose to give deeply of themselves to make a significant difference in the lives of so many people across this country. That achievement will stand as a shining example to everyone who works in the Senate--Senators and staffers alike. 
   I grew up in a family where members of the family were taught that they should and they could make a difference, and that each of them should try. 
   I remember listening to the members of our family who said you do not have to be a United States Senator to make a difference. All you have to do is give of yourself and work towards a purpose. 
   This country is a better country because of Mike Epstein. Today there are scores of people--there are children who are getting better opportunities, young people who are getting better educations, older people whose lives have been enhanced--who will never know the name of Mike Epstein. But because of Mike, their lives are more graceful and more useful and more productive, and their sense of hope is realized--all because of the extraordinary service of an extraordinary human being. 
   We love you, Mike, and we always will.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate what the Senator said. I think we can move more rapidly if we exchange the amendments. We have just received the Gorton amendment and we want to be responsive in a timely way. We would be glad to try to stay two amendments ahead so those who have the responsibility to inform their colleagues, as well as to speak on these issues on the floor, have an opportunity to be prepared to address those questions. 
   I hope, out of a spirit of comity, we could try to do that. It is generally done in areas of important policy. There is no reason not to. We know what these matters are. I indicated to the chairman of the committee 2 days ago what our amendments were going to be, and they are the ones we offered in committee. There are no surprises. I hope we could at least try to do that as a way of moving this process forward. 
   This is related not only to the Senator from Washington. We know he has spoken to other groups that he intended to offer an amendment, but we will try to work with the floor managers to exchange these amendments so we can move it forward in a way that will benefit all Members.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I wish to, if I may, ask my friend and colleague from Washington a question. If I understand this correctly, there are two essential provisions that he includes here. One is, in the 15-State block grant, the Senator prohibits the use of funds for vouchers to private schools; is this correct?

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, there are different provisions in the 50-State block grant than in the 15-State block grant. During the exchange in our committee, the principal proponent, Senator GREGG--and I am sure he will speak to it--indicated that he did not dismiss the use of those funds for private school vouchers. 
   Is the Senator from Washington saying--many of us have been critical of the overall program and the use of vouchers, that this is a block grant and voucher program--with this amendment, there would be the elimination of the language in the 15-State block grant that would have permitted the voucher program for private schools?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's response. I hope the Senator will stay with me because usually when the proponent of a particular measure, such as Senator GREGG, says that it does and then another Senator says he reads the language that it does not--generally speaking, the members of our committee believed that it did, whether we agree with it or not, for the very significant reasons that the Senator from New Hampshire pointed out--so we want to understand now, once and for all, whether you believe it did or did not before. 
   Your understanding is that it eliminates the use of vouchers for the private school partnerships as part of your amendment?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Whatever the exchange is that we are having here between the Senator from Washington and myself--I know he is reluctant to somehow say now this is the effect of the amendment. It certainly is my understanding, and I think the other members of our committee would agree, that when it was proposed, very clearly--you can go back into the RECORD and see--this was the intent of the Senator from New Hampshire. 
   I may stand corrected by the one who put that in, that it was to be an allowable use of these funds to be used under the block grant program. They were going to consolidate the programs and then turn the funds over to the States, and then some would go down into the local communities. But one of the purposes that would have been legitimized for the first time was a voucher program for private schools. 
   On our side, we support the use of title I funds in terms of public school choice. But this was a departure from that. That is exactly the way we read it. 
   Under the Senator's amendment, the option of private school vouchers will not be there. 
   Secondly, in the 15-State demonstration block grant, you add a provision. Could the Senator tell me what the effect of the language for the 15-State block grant is, on line 5, on the ``Achievement Gap Reductions''? What does the Senator intend to achieve by that language?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I am trying to understand. Exactly of what would the 10 percent reduction be? What is the Senator trying to drive at? As I understand it, the Senator is trying to deal with the provisions of the legislation that relates to accountability. 
   We have the overall State accountability. Then we have the 15-State block grant. The 15-State block grant is going to come under overall State accountability. The provisions of the overall legislation will apply. 
   Could the Senator please clarify? We can probably move to an early acceptance of the Senator's amendment, but I just want to understand exactly what it does and what it does not do. I have difficulty in seeing exactly what this really means in terms of the total accountability. 
   Does this change the overall State requirements that are spelled out on page 662, the ``Failure To Meet Terms.--If at the end of the 5-year term of the performance agreement a State has not substantially met the performance goals .....''? Does this in any way change that?

   Mr. KENNEDY. The reason I ask this is, I say to the Senator, he is not in any way changing the ``Failure To Meet Terms'' that a State must meet. As I understand it, the Senator is amending a different section, and that is the 15-State block grant. 
   What we find out further, on page 662, is, ``If a State has made no progress toward achieving,'' there will be certain reductions of funds. But that is when there is ``no progress.'' On page 662 it is: ``substantial progress''. I do not see how your 10-percent over the 5-year period of the performance agreements really does very much. 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-kennedy-ma-11-20000503</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator would explain to me where--this is the controlling law. It states very clearly, on page 662, what the test is going to be. It talks about ``agreement a State has not substantially met the performance. .....'' There is no definition of what ``substantially met the performance'' is. That has not changed by the Senator's addition. The penalty described on page 662 only applies when there is ``no progress.'' 
   I fail to see how that does very much in terms of accountability. It does not stop at the end of 2 years. 
   Does the Senator's program have the requirement of a reduction of funds administratively at the end of 3 years, as the Democratic program does? It does not. Does it have a further reduction after 4 years? No, it does not. Does it have requirements that the State has to intervene; and that, if not, there could be the closing of a particular school if it does not achieve those kinds of reductions? It does not. The Democratic program does. 
   It is basically feel-good language. 
   I would recommend, if it is going to make the Senator from Washington feel good--and evidently is going to make others on that side feel good--that we are not going to be able to use vouchers for private schools, we have been maintaining that block grants are blank checks for States. We have talked about, this Republican proposal is going to provide vouchers for private schools, and we have been told: Oh, no, that isn't so. We have some of our Republican friends saying: Oh, no, that was not even intended for part of it. We had the proponent of the amendment saying that was so. Now the Senator from Washington wants to eliminate that. Well, I certainly would urge our colleagues to support that.

   Mr. KENNEDY. He joins you. That is interesting. He gave me a different interpretation. I appreciate that. 
   Mr. President, I think it is basically very weak language. 
   On page 662 of the legislation, in relation to the States, it does not have any penalty. And, furthermore, you have to wait 5 years to find out whether there is going to be any progress made. 
   I think families in this country want progress now. They want accountability now. They want guarantees now. Under our bill, that process of accountability begins in the second year, third year, fourth year, fifth year; and it builds in terms of accountability, in terms of the requirements of the States to help those particular communities, which is not being done today. 
   Does the Senate understand that it is not being done today? We have the most recent surveys done by the Department of Education that polls underserved title I communities. According to the surveys, more than half of the Title I communities have said that when they have asked the States to help them, they have gotten virtually no response whatsoever. This is very weak accountability. I will be glad to recommend that we move ahead and accept this amendment and then get to the Democratic alternative so that the Members of the Senate and the American people will understand and be able to compare and contrast the accountability provisions because this is still woefully inadequate and woefully weak.

I am trying to understand whether we are addressing both of these concerns or just part of them.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I appreciate the Senator's attention to this matter because it shows something enormously interesting that is happening here. On one hand, this amendment addresses the issue of voucher programs for private schools under the 15-State block grant program. On the other, it doesn't affect private school vouchers that are permissible under the title I portability program. It seems to me that if you are going to fix it in one program, you ought to fix it in both. 
   If you look at the portability provisions on page 127, it 
   states:  
   ..... an eligible child, for which a per pupil amount shall be used for supplemental education services for the eligible child that are (A) subject to subparagraph (B)--  
   And this deals with the portability provisions--  
   provided by the school directly or through the provisions of supplemental education services with any governmental or nongovernmental agency, school, postsecondary educational institution, or other entity, including a private organization or business  
   So you are striking one section, but leaving the other section. Well, that will have to remain there until we address that in our alternative. I, for one, want to move ahead in the debate on this, and I would be glad to urge acceptance of this amendment.

I believe the language about academic achievement for all programs must be modified to prevent having diversion of Federal funds to private schools. 
   That is exactly our position. 
   The Senator from Washington can deny that is his understanding, and the Senator from New Hampshire said this isn't really a voucher debate. It isn't just on our side, it is on their side too. 
   I am glad the position of the Senator from Maine has prevailed on this issue.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a few moments to respond to these general comments that have been made over the period of the past few days by those who are opposed to our proposal in terms of education reform. The proposed bill basically gives a block grant, a blank check, to the Governors to make these decisions. 
   It is always interesting to me to hear my friends on the other side of the aisle when they say: We are interested in local control, local decisionmaking. 
   That isn't what this is about. This is about giving a blank check--a block grant--to the States. Read the legislation. The States are the ones that are accountable to the Secretary of Education at the end of the day, after 5 years. They get the block grant. They can go out and do whatever they want for another 5 years. Then they can come back and say, look, we have had substantial compliance in what we originally proposed. Then the Secretary is either going to say, no, you have not; or yes, you have. The idea that the Secretary is going to cut off the States on any program is preposterous--anyone who thinks that will happen has not been around for any period of time under Democratic or Republican administrations. 
   But let's get back to some of the facts. First of all, if we are going to provide this money, why allow this money to be taken by the States before the money gets down to the local level? 
   The fact is, various GAO reports indicate that school districts received anywhere from 95 to 100 percent of the federal funds appropriated. This was true in 1995, for the title I programs, the bilingual education programs, the emergency immigrant education program, the safe and drug-free schools program. Specifically, for the Goals 2000 program, 93 percent of federal funds went to the local level; for the Eisenhower program, 91 percent; for IDEA, 91 percent; for the preschool programs, 88 percent. Ninety-five percent to 100 percent of federal funds get to the local community. That is where it is happening at the present time. 
   So the other side of the aisle says: All right. What we need to do is to have more flexibility. The Federal Government and its mandates are denying local flexibility. 
   Let's look at the GAO report dated January 25, 2000: ``Elementary and Secondary Education, Flexibility Initiatives Do Not Address Districts' Key Concerns About Federal Requirements.'' 
   Do we hear that? We specifically asked the General Accounting Office to look into local communities to find out if we are effectively restricting them in their ability to use money effectively to enhance local decisions. The GAO report, on page 9, says, that what the local communities want, No. 1, are resources, funding. No. 2, they want to have management technology and techniques and training for the local schools. And third, they want information about what is working in other communities. 
   That isn't only the Democrats speaking. That is what the General Accounting Office reported. Local school districts have enough flexibility at the present time. 
   What does the other side say? They say: We do not want to do business as usual. We just want to send the money out there. 
   It is interesting when we look at what the situation is at the local level. Let's look at the IG's report from March 2000. It reviewed State education agency officials in 15 States. They received complete responses back from 10 States. Of the 10 States that responded, 6 States do not permit any combining of funds whatsoever--no combining of local, State, or Federal funds; that is, 6 of the States prohibit that. 
   When we provide flexibility, we say, if that decision is going to be made, it has to be done there at the State level. Two States, of the 10 States reporting, allow combining of Federal funds only. One State allows combining of State and local. Only one State out of the 15 States looked at by the IG of the Department of Education permits the combining of funds at the State, Federal, and local levels.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the problem isn't the Federal Government, the problem is the States. That is the contention. Let's hear the argument from the other side on that during this debate. You say those are interesting reports, Senator, but is this really the case? All you have to do is take the national assessment of title I that was done last year. In 1999, the national assessment of title I says:  
   Among the schools that reported in the 1998 survey that they had been identified as in need of improvement, less than half reported that they could receive additional professional development or technical assistance as a result of being identified for improvement from the States.  
   Here you have communities that are trying to ask for help, and only half are receiving any. States are not responding to half of those communities. What is the other side's answer? Send more money to the States. This is the wrong answer. States didn't care prior to the time we passed the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in 1965. They didn't care about ensuring that the most disadvantaged children were served. Then we gave them federal funds from 1965 to 1970 and they still didn't take care of disadvantaged children. We have learned that lesson. And now, we want to give States blank checks. Haven't we already learned from the past? States will allocate federal funds according to what the Governor wants to look out after, and there are no guarantees that it'll be targeted to the poorest or most disadvantaged children--the States aren't using their own dollars to do this now. 
   If Members on the other side could say: Senator KENNEDY, let me show you where we have 25, 35 States pinpointing as a matter of State priority in education what they are trying to do for the neediest kids and they are showing results, saying give us more help, they would have a strong argument. They can't do it. They don't answer that. You won't hear that. You will hear all the cliches such as, ``What has happened in the past isn't working,'' and ``They want more of the status quo.'' 
   Now, in contrast, let's look at what I have said is happening out there.  Needy children are the responsibility of the States. In 1986, the National Governors report said, ``It's Time For Results.'' The task force urged Governors to intervene in low-performing States and school districts and take over closed-down, academically bankrupt school districts. Let's see what happened. 
   In 1987, 9 States were authorized to take over--9 States out of the 50. In 1990, the NGA report on educating America outlined strategies for achieving the national education goals. The task force, cochaired by Governors Clinton and Campbell, recommended States provide rewards, sanctions, linked to school academic performance, including assistance and support for low-performing schools. Take over if those do not improve. 
   In 1990, eighteen States offered technical assistance or intervened in the management of low-performing schools. In 1998, NGA policy supported the State focus on schools. In 1999, 19 States complied. It will take another 50 years to get all the States to take care of poor children. Now the Republicans want to send all that money out there, with virtually no accountability, virtually none. Five years, and then unless the Secretary of Education can demonstrate that they haven't substantially complied with it, States can get another chance at it for five more years. 
   That is what this is all about. Are we going to just send the money out to the States, or are we going to have some real accountability? Now, let me take one area and present our side's alternative. 
   In regard to teacher quality, we maintain in our alternative that there are new, important, tried and tested, and demonstrably effective policies that can enhance academic achievement. As we 
   have pointed out, these policies are: smaller class size, afterschool programs, teacher quality, accountability, technology provisions, and others. These are virtually new. The other side may say that ``they just want to do business as usual,'' but we didn't have technology 10 years ago or 30 years ago. We didn't have the documentation of the importance of small class sizes. 
   We assumed that all States were focused on ensuring that all classrooms were going to have certified teachers. That hasn't been the case. We stand on this side of the aisle to guarantee a well-trained and fully qualified teacher in every classroom in America after 4 years of the date of enactment of this Act. That is our side. 
   Let's hear what the other side has. First of all, on the issue of teacher training, recruitment and empowerment, they have the Republican Teacher Empowerment Act, which gives so much flexibility, States really don't have to do anything to change their current practices. They can continue hiring uncertified teachers, continue to provide low-quality, ineffective professional development and mentoring. In States, they could use most of the funds for a large variety of purposes that dilute the focus and attention on improving the recruitment and mentoring and professional development of teachers. 
   The question is, Does the underlying bill guarantee substantial funds for professional development? No. All the underlying bill says is there will be ``a portion of the funds''; it doesn't say how much will be there. Our amendment guarantees professional development. The underlying bill doesn't guarantee funds for mentoring programs. It just allows the use of funds for those programs. Our amendment absolutely guarantees mentoring. 
   Thirdly, the underlying bill does not guarantee funds for recruitment programs. It just allows the use of funds for recruitment programs. Ours guarantees a recruitment program and gives priority for that. Their bill does not guarantee that teachers are trained to address the needs of children with disabilities or other students with special needs. It just allows the use of funds for such training. 
   Our amendment guarantees that teachers will learn how to teach these children. Their bill does not hold States accountable for having a qualified teacher in every classroom. It doesn't even require teachers to be certified. If you look carefully at the Republican program, it does not really guarantee much. In contrast, we clearly spell out what our bill accomplishes. 
   Their bill does not require a substantial priority for math and science training. 
   If you go and talk to any schoolteacher, any school superintendent, anyone that is involved in educating needy children in this country, and you ask them is: Do you have enough good math and science teachers? They will say that one of their top priorities is getting good math and science teachers in high-poverty areas. 
   Everyone says that. 
   I can give the various reports of what matters most in teaching for America's future. The report of the National Commission on Teaching on America's future was made up of Republicans and Democrats alike. One of their key findings was that if you are going to do anything about teaching, make sure you do something about math and science--there is no mention of a Republican block grant program. 
   Finally, their bill does not require accountability. Instead, it promotes ineffective professional development activities through Teacher Opportunity Payment Programs, what they call TOPS. TOPS supports individually selected strategies that aren't necessarily proven effective practices. Effectively, it says that if you are a teacher and you want professional development, you can go out and find any program, anywhere, and it will be paid for. Having the Federal Government reimburse for this untested and untried program as matter of local control makes no sense. 
   Our amendment contains tough and high standards of accountability. Our amendment says if you do not make progress in student achievement, which is the bottom line, with better teachers after 3 years, you cannot continue to receive funding for this program. 
   There it is. We are prepared to say this is the challenge and this the way we ought to go and this is the way it ought to be tried and tested. 
   We are effectively guaranteeing parents in this country good, fully qualified teachers. The other side can't say that because their program doesn't justify that. 
   In addition, I want to look at the existing programs and the proposal that is before us. This is what I consider the ``education report card.'' 
   They certainly get the F in terms of qualified teachers for the reasons that I have outlined. 
   We are talking about secure and gun-free schools and trying to make them safe. 
   We are talking about safe schools. 
   We are talking about small and orderly class sizes. 
   We are talking about afterschool programs. 
   We are talking about strong parental involvement. 
   And, we are talking about, most of all, accountability for better results. 
   This is the heart and soul of what we believe is necessary in order to enhance and strengthen the quality of education for children in this country. 
   These are the various areas of policy that we have to take action on. The existing bill grade is an F. 
   We have a program that we are prepared to debate and discuss, and to be challenged on. I hope we are going to escape the cliches and the slogans in this debate. We have heard the cliches. We have heard the slogans. We are prepared to deal with the real policy issues and the real policy questions because we believe this is a way that we can really respond to children's needs. 
   We need a guarantee. We don't need a blank check. We want to make sure the money is going to get to where it is needed and not go to the Governors' pet programs and pet projects in local communities in their States. That is what has been happening. That continues today. 
   You don't have to get a lot of reports to see what happens when we give Governors a blank check. What happened has been demonstrated in the tobacco bill. We sent money back to the States with the idea that money was going to be used for children in terms of smoking and children's health. We are finding out that it is instead being used to build sidewalks, and cut taxes. 
   We need to take responsibility for helping our neediest 
   children with our scarce federal resources. The democratic alternative allows us to make a difference for children in this country. 
   Finally, I want to mention what has been happening in recent times. I  heard, with great interest, my friend from Georgia talk about all the challenges we are facing. We understand that every child who goes to school in America today is facing additional complexities and problems than they were facing 2 or 3 years ago or 5 years ago. It is very challenging for a variety of different reasons that we can talk about. But the fact is that there has been some progress made. Primarily it has been made since 1994. 
   Let me mention the National Association of Educational Progress. Their reports show that there have been significant increases in math scores in the fourth through eighth grades, and reading and math performance among 9-year-olds in high-poverty public schools. Among the lowest achieving, the fourth graders have improved significantly. The achievement gap between blacks and Hispanics and white students has narrowed since 1982. The greatest gains in science were made by black and Hispanic students. Average SAT scores in math and verbal were higher in 1999 than the average for 1983 or 1989. 
   These improvements came at the same time that the proportion of test takers with native languages other than English have been increasing. 
   The dropout rates are lower today than in the 1970s and 1980s, and particularly lower for black youth. 
   In 1972, 21 percent of black youth dropped out of school. 
   In 1979, the rate was 13 percent. The dropout rate for Hispanics fell from 34 percent to 25 percent during that same period, and from 12 percent to 8 percent for whites. 
   In 1997, 89 percent of persons age 16 to 24 completed high school or attained a GED. 
   The number of students taking advanced courses has increased, especially those taking advanced placement courses. 
   No one is saying that we have this challenge solved. We are not saying that. But what we are saying is, we reject the statement made that our alternative is merely the status quo. 
   The programs we are talking about are dramatically different. They are innovative. They are responsive. They have a solid record of achievement. We are making some progress. 
   With this substitute, we believe we will be able to come back in 5 or 6 years and say we have made gains and that we made the right investment for the neediest children in America. 
   Finally, I want to put in a word for those children who are going to be wiped out under the Republican program--the migrant children, the immigrant children, and homeless children. 
   I read in the RECORD the other day the report that was given in 1987 when we were considering the McKinney Act. We asked States how many homeless children were being educated in their respective State. We had virtually no response to that particular question. 
   In March of 1987, the Center for Law and Education sent the questionnaire regarding State practices and policies for homeless students to the chief State school offices in the 50 States and Washington, DC, and received 23 responses. The majority of the respondents had no statewide data on the number of homeless children within their jurisdiction or whether the children were able to go to school. The majority of States had no plan for ensuring that homeless students received an education. 
   That was prior to the McKinney Act, prior to the time of identifying homeless children, migrant children, and immigrant children. 
   Now our friends on the other side are saying we don't have to deal with those populations anymore, the Governors will know best. 
   They didn't up until 1987. They don't today, without these kinds of program. We are going to be back here, if their program is passed, mourning the day that we have essentially abdicated our responsibility to those children in our country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the Senator from Washington, for her comments. I yield myself 8 minutes. We are going to have two votes in about 20 minutes. 
   In closing this debate, I want to ensure my colleagues in the Senate fully understand the amendment offered by the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON. I certainly understand it was written to ensure that the Straight A's provision cannot be used to divert funds for private school vouchers. The Office of General Counsel at the Department of Education has reviewed the language and informs me they are concerned that, because of the convoluted approach this language takes, it would be very difficult to sustain in court an interpretation that vouchers are prohibited by the amendment. 
   Quite frankly, a direct prohibition in this amendment could have resolved that concern. For that same reason, the author of the amendment chose not to do so. The underlying bill, through its child-centered program, also known as portability, clearly authorizes the use of funds for what are, in effect, private school vouchers. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from Washington does not purport to change that program at all. Therefore, notwithstanding any interpretation of the amendment on which we are about to vote, we would continue, according to the general counsel's belief, to have a private school voucher program. 
   I believe it is probably marginally better in terms of reducing the possibilities of a voucher than exists in the bill. I urge my colleagues, even with this hesitation, to support the amendment. 
   For the last few minutes, I will go back to the comparison of the accountability provisions of S. 2 and the Daschle bill. 
   I will mention seven different areas. I want the attention of those on the other side so they can address it, which they did not do over the course of this day. 
   Must States dedicate funds specifically for turning around failing schools? 
   Under S. 2, the answer is no. Under the Daschle proposal, the answer is yes. Under title I, they have to allocate 3 percent in the years 2001 and 2002 and 5 percent for every year after so there will be funds available in the States to turn around failing schools. Our answer is yes; their answer is no. 
   Must schools show annual gains in student performance? 
   The answer for S. 2 is no. In our legislation, the answer is yes, States have a period of time to reach proficiency in 10 years for all children, but they have to define how they are going to get there. We let them do it, but they must meet the benchmarks along the way. We define it and hold States accountable; they do not. 
   Is there any assurance of real accountability? Do failing schools face any real consequences? 
   As we have pointed out time and again, there is virtually no accountability for the first 5 years under S. 2. The answer to that is no. Under the Daschle bill, after 2 years, there has to be changes that the schools will take part in or otherwise, after the 4 years,  the whole governance of that school will be replaced. There are funds for that, and there is the commitment spelled out in our legislation to do it. 
   Is accountability based on the performance of all students, including poor children and limited-English-proficient children? The answer under S. 2 is no. The State can choose what children--this is the unbelievable part. I reviewed this in the RECORD yesterday. Under S. 2 requirements, they can select or choose which children they are going to put in the aggregation to report back to the Secretary of Education. It is a shell game. 
   Under the Daschle bill, there is a requirement for disaggregation not only in school districts but in schools on race and income, so we will know actually what school, not what school district, not just a general area, but we will know that every single year this legislation is in place. 
   Do schools and districts face consequences if they fail to help poor children, minority children, and limited-English-proficient children learn to high standards? 
   The answer under the Republican bill is no; under ours it is yes, for the reasons I have identified. 
   Is there a sensible requirement enabling students in failing schools to transfer to higher-quality schools? 
   The answer in the Republican bill is virtually no. They can use the whole amount of money for transportation. We challenge them. Show us where the limitation is. It is not there. We put the limitation cap at 10 percent. 
   Finally, must States help migrant children, delinquent or neglected children or homeless children reach high standards? 
   Under S. 2, no, they effectively abolish the homeless program, the immigrant program, and the migratory programs. We protect those. 
   If they are looking for accountability--and we have heard those words from the other side all day long today, ``We want accountability''--they have to answer those questions. They have not answered them. They did not answer them in their opening statements when they presented this issue, and they 
   refuse to respond to the challenges that Senator BINGAMAN and everyone on this side has posed to them. 
   Republicans want a blank check that is a stamp of approval on the status quo. It gives a blank check to the Governors and does not require anything to change. The Democrat's substitute cancels the blank check and instead provides parents a guarantee of better results for kids. It guarantees accountability for results, as I have spelled out--a qualified teacher in every classroom, as was pointed out earlier in the debate, smaller class size, as Senator MURRAY has pointed out, modern and safe schools, as Senator HARKIN and others have pointed out, and strong parental involvement, as Senator REED from Rhode Island has pointed out. All of this has been included in our alternative. That is a Marshall Plan for change, and I urge my colleagues to support it. I yield back the remainder of the time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. WARNER, as well as my colleagues on the committee, Senator LEVIN, our ranking member, and especially Senator SNOWE, for their efforts in doing the right thing for our Medicare-eligible military retirees. 
   Today, there was introduced in the Senate, on behalf of Senator WARNER, legislation that will have an extremely positive impact on our military retirees and their ability to acquire prescription drugs. This is enormously important for our retirees and will be strongly supported in this body. Hopefully, it will be a part of the defense authorization bill that will come to the floor in the next few weeks.  
   This initiative gives all military retirees over 65 the same pharmacy benefit that one-third of them already have under the Base Realignment and Closure pharmacy program, a mail order and a retail pharmacy benefit. It makes sense, and is only fair that all military retirees over 65 have one consistent pharmacy benefit. 
   This pharmacy benefit is a significant and affordable first step in healing the growing rift with the military retiree community caused by the Government's failure to deliver on the promise of health care for life. The pharmacy benefit is the number one issue and priority of military retirees, since pharmacy needs are the biggest drain on the pensions of military retirees. Expanding the BRAC pharmacy benefit to all Medicare-eligible military retirees is the right thing to do for service members who have dedicated their lives to protect and serve our country. 
   Approximately 450,000 of the 1.3 million Medicare-eligible military retirees already have access to a retail and mail order pharmacy benefit. This was the result of DOD base closures. When the Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommended the closure of several military bases, part of what was lost was access to pharmaceutical benefits for many retired military personnel who were receiving their prescription drugs benefits at those facilities. To address their needs, Congress created the BRAC pharmacy benefit which was a mail order, as well as a retail benefit, for needed prescriptions. 
   Unfortunately, that benefit only covered about a third of all of those who have retired, so we had a dual system where, by accident of where you had retired and by the results of the Base Closure Commission, some retirees received the benefit and others did not. This legislation would treat military retirees across the country the same. 
   Basically this bill makes prescription drugs accessible and available to military retirees over the age of 65, at a very reasonable cost--a 20 percent co-pay when they acquire the prescription drugs in retail pharmacy and an $8 co-pay if they buy them through mail order. There is no deductible and no enrollment fee. This is recognition that there are incredibly important and significant health needs for our retirees. This pharmacy benefit is one that our military retirees richly deserve. 
   The BRAC pharmacy benefit was initiated by the Congress in the Fiscal Year 1994 Defense Authorization Act to ensure that Medicare-eligible retirees, who depended on the base's medical treatment facilities for their pharmacy needs, would be taken care of after the base was closed. This benefit includes the mail order pharmacy program for the co-payment of $8 for up to a 90-day supply and use of the Tricare retail network pharmacies for a 20-percent co-pay for up to a 30-day supply. 
   We ask our armed forces to leave their families, risk their lives, fight our wars, help countries ravaged by disasters, and enforce peace all over the world. Americans who devote their lives to serving our country deserve this benefit. It is wrong for pharmacy benefits to be taken away for the sole reason that a retiree has reached the age of 65. 
   That is what happens at the present time. Once they turn 65, 
   they go under the Medicare system. Under the Medicare system, there are no prescription drug benefits, which they had otherwise been receiving, so they are left out in the cold. This initiative lets all military retirees know that we have not forgotten them. It lets all of the service members know that if they dedicate their lives to the service of our country, we will take care of their health care needs from the pharmaceutical point of view. 
   Again, I express great appreciation to Senator WARNER and the others--Senator THURMOND and a number of our colleagues on the committee--particularly Senator SNOWE, who has taken great interest in this prescription drug issue. I think all of us know that the issue of prescription drugs is something of enormous concern to the elderly in this country. It was a benefit that was basically excluded from the coverage of Medicare when Medicare was passed in 1965. 
   In 1965, the private companies were trying to make Medicare effectively the same kind of benefit package that existed in the private sector. At that time, very few in the private sector had a prescription drug benefit. Today, we see that progress has been made in the private sector. Now, more than 95 percent of the private sector plans provide prescription drug coverage, but Medicare doesn't. That is part of the great debate that, hopefully, we will have in this body before we adjourn; that is, are we going to provide prescription drug benefits for our senior citizens? 
   What the Armed Services Committee, under the leadership of Senator WARNER, has said is that eligible retirees are going to have those health care needs met, and they do it in a way that makes prescription drugs accessible to them through a mail order and a direct retail system through Tricare. This is basically a nationwide system with only a 20-percent co-payment, no enrollment fee, and no deductible, which will make these prescription drugs accessible and affordable for people who are living in retirement in the armed services community. 
   I think this is enormously important. I think it is a great step forward. It is in response to the health care needs of men and women who have served this country, and I think it bodes very well for Congress as we try to work together to try to find ways of meeting the needs of others who are retired and need these prescription drugs desperately. 
   Mr. President, again, I thank Senator WARNER and others for their leadership and for this extremely important and significant step. It bodes well for this institution, and it is an expression of great appreciation to the men and women who have served in the Armed Forces of our country. I hope that we can follow this precedent and come to grips with the challenges that exist for the elderly in our Nation, and that we are able to develop a prescription drug benefit for them, too, the way we have been able to do it for military retirees. I think that would be great work by this Congress, and there is very little reason that we cannot do it. We should do it. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make sure that it is done. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I express appreciation to the majority leader for calling up this legislation. 
   As has been mentioned by the majority leader, and now by the chairman of the committee, Senator JEFFORDS, I think this is a matter of very significant importance to families all over this country. Hopefully, the next several days will be a good opportunity for them to develop a better understanding and awareness as to exactly what we are trying to do to enhance academic achievement in our public schools across the Nation. 
   I pay tribute to the chairman of our committee, Senator JEFFORDS, who has had, over a long period of time, a distinguished career and who has placed the whole issue of quality education as one of his top priorities. We have areas of differences, but I think all of us, certainly on this side, have enormous respect for his continued leadership on the important areas of education. So it is always a pleasure to work with him. We have some important differences on this particular legislation, but all of us, at the start of this debate, acknowledge both the breadth of his understanding of this issue and his strong commitment. 
   We look forward to this debate. I know today we will have general debate and discussion. I think that is important. Hopefully, at the end of the day, Members of the Senate will have a much clearer idea and awareness as to the two very significant and dramatic differences of how we want to use scarce Federal resources, the $14 billion or $15 billion. It is a lot of money, but in a budget of $1.8 trillion it is still a rather small amount. But, nonetheless, it does represent about 7 cents out of every $1 that is spent at the local level. It is important that we try to appropriate it as well as we possibly can. 
   I think we have seen times in the past where we have had some important successes; we have also seen times in the past where we have not. But I think as a result of those times, those failures, today we are in a position to make recommendations to this body as to how best we can use the scarce resources. 
   There are two very dramatic differences in approach, which I think we will try to spell out in the time we have available to us this afternoon. 
   First of all, I will make a brief comment with regard to the majority leader. He does not engage himself often in the debate and discussion of policy issues. He expresses his viewpoints, but he is not as active, in most policy matters, as he is on education. We appreciate that. We have areas of difference, but, nonetheless, when we do debate the issues on education, he is engaged and involved. 
   It is important that his involvement in this be recognized at the outset. 
   I remind the Senate, however, of the two pieces of legislation he mentioned  in terms of the achievements of the Congress. One was the Ed-Flex legislation we passed over a year ago. We have had three States that have taken advantage of that particular provision--only one State until fairly recently; two more States have come in. The most notable State to take advantage of it was North Carolina. There have been 12 States that have effectively taken advantage of the 1994 Act, and there hasn't been a single State or an educational community that actually has been turned down under Ed-Flex. I am glad we passed the legislation. 
   Maybe during the course of the debate, we will find out that the principal hindrance, in terms of providing greater cooperation and the commingling of funds at the local level, is the fact that the States themselves have failed to match what we have done in providing Ed-Flex. It is important to recognize that that has been the situation. 
   In the GAO report about what local communities want at the local level, they name as No. 1, resources; No. 2, programs that have demonstrated effectiveness in local communities and enhance legislation; No. 3, additional training for administrative skills. They don't mention the flexibility issue. We are glad that there is flexibility, but in that report they also point out that the States themselves are the ones that have been extremely reluctant to deal with their own problems. 
   The GAO report reviewed 15 States and found only 1 State that had really taken action in order to knock down the hindrances for that State to be able to work most effectively with Federal funds in that local community. 
   Secondly, on the savings account legislation, that piece of legislation was bid up from $1.2 billion over 10 years to $23 billion when it finally left the Senate floor, in a period of 3 days, without any corresponding offsets--just $23 billion. Many of us have been trying to get a prescription drug benefit of some measure. Certainly that $23 billion for the senior citizens would have gone a lot further than the $23 billion which is mostly a tax break for wealthy individuals. The way that it is constructed, it will not guarantee a single additional pencil for a schoolhouse in this nation. It will not guarantee a new teacher for any classroom. It will not guarantee an hour of afterschool programs. 
   What it will do is provide some generous tax breaks for very wealthy people in order to, under the definitions, try to develop educational programs devised by themselves to enhance the academic achievement for either members of their family or develop a voucher program. 
   The Joint Tax Committee pointed out, during the course of the debate, that half of the money that would come under the education savings accounts would go to private schools. Half would go to public schools. We know 90 percent of the children go to public schools. I think those two pieces of legislation are very marginal--a generous word--in terms of dealing with the serious problems about which parents are the most concerned relative to the record of this Congress on education. 
   There is very little with which we might differ in terms of the majority leader's desire and the statement made by my friend from Vermont about enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment. The real question is how that best can be done. 
   It is my opinion--and, I think, the opinion of many of those on this side of the aisle--that the proposition before the Senate this afternoon is a step back from what we have at the present time. 
   We know we have made some progress since 1994, when we put in place some tough accountability standards at the local level and other kinds of requirements in the implementation and the 
   utilization of title I. Now, under the proposal of the majority, they are moving back, significantly eliminating and reducing the requirements which had been applicable at the local level, that ensured Title I funds were used effectively to enhance academic achievement. They have effectively wiped those out, even though they say there is a hold harmless provision on where the funds will go. The kinds of assurances for how these funds can be used, and used effectively, have been wiped out. In place, what they have done is given the prime responsibility to the Governors. This is the major change. 
   With this proposal that has been advanced by Republicans, we are saying that we are going to give the funds to the States and let the Governors make the judgment and decision about how those funds are going to be spent. 
   We hear a great deal about the importance of local control. We hear a great deal about parental involvement. We hear a great deal about what is important in local communities. That is great rhetoric, but what we have to do is look at what the legislation says. That ought to be the point of the debate. 
   Let us refer to the legislation. On page 618, Determination of State Participation:  
   The Governor of a State, in consultation with the individual or body responsible for the education programs of the State under State law, shall determine whether the State shall participate in the performance agreement. 
   Now let's say the State makes its judgment about what they are going to include in their application. Look on page 632, Uses of Funds Under Agreement: 
   Funds made available to a State under this part shall be used for educational purposes, including--(1) carrying out activities focused on improved student learning; (2) providing new books.......  
   We can ask ourselves, why not let them do that? The answer is very clear. We learned a lesson on why we should not do that. From 1965 to 1969, that is exactly what we did do--let the States use the funds for any educational purpose. 
   Referring to the excellent report on title I of ESEA, Is It Helping Poor Children, the Washington Research Project points out that funds were used for purchasing tape recorders (14 tape recorders in Milwaukee), purchasing three tubas in Alabama, purchasing football uniforms, band uniforms for $35,000, and the list goes on--in another State, 18 swimming pools in the summer shall be used for educational purposes without any limitation. 
   So the State moves ahead. They decide what they are going to use the funds for; it is going to be decided by the State. 
   What kind of a review will we have to find out what they are doing? All we have to do is look at page 637 to find out what the States are going to do, Performance Review:  
   At the end of the third year for which a performance partnership agreement is in effect for a State, the Secretary shall prepare a written performance review of the activities carried out under the agreement.  
   Isn't that wonderful? Doesn't that really have teeth in it? After 3 years, the State is going to have a review of the activities carried out under the agreement. Then if the Secretary determines in the performance review that it isn't complete or it doesn't meet the agreements, there is, on 639, the real kick-in, the real tough action. 
   This is what it says:  
   The Secretary shall prepare a second written performance review for the State of the activities [shall be developed].  
   This is the legislation, Mr. President. 
   Finally, on page 640, it says:  
   Renewal Requirements.--The Secretary shall renew the agreement for an additional 5-year term, if (1) at the end of the 5-year term described in subsection (a), or as soon after the term as is practical, the State submits the data required under the agreement; and (2) the Secretary determines, on the basis of the data, that the State that has made substantial progress--  
   What is substantial progress? If they have made, according to the Secretary of Education, substantial progress, there they go again for another 5 years. Where is local control in here? Where is parental involvement in here? Tell me where are we going to get the guarantee for teachers, smaller classes, or afterschool programs in there? 
   They say: Well, Senator, you have to understand that States know best. Well, there have been some notable exceptions, so let's take a look at what the States have done on this. First of all, the reason we have Title I is because we decided in 1965 that the needs of disadvantaged children were not being addressed. Then we took action in 1965 with a block grant to the States. That was a disaster. So we came back with more targeted programs, some of which have been successful, some of which, have not. What has happened along the way? We have seen an expansion of the title I program. We have reached out to take into  coverage the migratory children's programs, the homeless children, the immigrant programs. Why? Because the States failed to meet those priorities. 
   In March of 1987, the Center for Law and Education sent out a questionnaire regarding State practices of policies for homeless children to the chief State offices in the 50 States and the District of Columbia and received 23 responses. The majority of the respondents, however, had no statewide data on the number of homeless children within their jurisdiction, or whether those children were able to obtain an education. The majority of States had no uniform plan for ensuring that homeless students received an education. 
   The same was true with how States were serving the needs of migrant children. We weren't properly addressing the needs of homeless children, migrant children, or immigrant children, and so they became eligible for educational services in targeted programs because they were determined to be disadvantaged children. Are we going to continue addressing the critical needs of these special populations under this proposed legislation? Absolutely not. Absolutely not. This legislation eliminates those special programs. They aren't going to continue those programs in spite of the fact that States historically have done little to address the needs of children in those areas. That has been true regarding programs that would help all three of those groups. Nonetheless, we are going to wipe those out. 
   In 1986, let's look at what the States were going to do in terms of trying to intervene in failing schools. This is 1986. Listen to the national NGA report. It was chaired by Governors Alexander, Clinton, King, and Riley. All four Governors had solid records in terms of education. They spearheaded the efforts for the Governors' report. They recommended that each Governor intervene in low-performing schools and school districts --that is what title I is all about--and to take over or close down, academically bankrupt school districts. 
   Well, in 1987, nine States had the authority to take over and annex educationally deficient schools or school districts. In 1990, here go the Governors again. Educating America; State strategies for achieving national education goals. The task force was co-chaired by Governors Clinton and Campbell. Rewards, 
   sanctions, linkages to school, academic performance, including providing assistance and support to low-performing schools and State takeovers--these do not improve student achievement. In 1988, 18 States offered technical assistance or intervention. In 1998--12 years after the Governors quit caring about poor children as a top priority, we are about to send it all back to them. That is what this legislation does--sends it back to them. 
   In 1998, NGA policy supports the State focus on schools. Reiterating a position first taken in 1988, NGA policy says States should have the responsibility on accountability and clear penalties for sustained failure to improve student performance. In 1999, well, we have 19 States that have procedures for intervening. In the year 2000, 20 States provide some form of assistance to low-performing schools. Included in there are States applying some type of schoolwide sanctions to low-performing schools. 
   That is what the States have been doing in the last 12 years. Now we are having a recommendation by the Republicans--with that as a failed track record--let's send it all back to them. 
   That is absolutely crazy, Mr. President. It is absolutely crazy. We should have learned something from the various actions of the States. States report that school support teams are able to serve only half of the schools in need of improvement. 
   Now, in 1999, here is the final report on the assessment of title I. In this assessment, among the schools reported on in the 1998 survey that have been identified as a need of improvement, less than half reported that they had received additional professional development or technical assistance as a result of being identified for improvement from the States. I mean, this is a year ago, when the local communities' title I were asked--the ones that have been in the most troubled circumstances--what do the States provide, more than half of them said they never heard from the States. That is an indication of the States' interest. 
   We are turning all of this money over to the States and we naively think they will take care of all disadvantaged children. We are giving them a blank check, revenuesharing, a block grant when we are up against this kind of record. The list goes on. We could go through this, but I don't think we will be all that surprised with the results. 
   We went through this a short time ago--our block grant to States in terms of tobacco funds. Many of us are trying to identify those funds that ought to go to children, or children's health, or children's education. We were rolled on that particular thing. Now we find out they are laying more sidewalks in the State of California. That list goes on. What happens? What priority do these children get in terms of the States? They didn't get any priority when this bill was passed in 1965, and they are being shortchanged today, even with requirements that the funds go down to the local community. This legislation is going to effectively give it all to the States, as I mentioned. I think that is basically and fundamentally in error. As I mentioned, what are we trying to do? 
   Let me point out a couple of other items. If a State opts to participate in the Straight A's block grant, the accountability provisions, which, as indicated, are insignificant, apply only at the State level. Therefore, a State could demonstrate statewide overall progress based on progress being made by wealthier communities, while a lack of progress in disadvantaged communities remains statistically hidden. Do we understand that? 
   That means the State, in giving its progress requirement--which is a rather amorphous kind of definition--can use statewide figures and can also be selective with the particular school districts they are going to include in their report. You can say that can't be so, that just can't be so. It is so. 
   On pages 625 and 640, Straight A's contains general language supporting efforts to close achievement gaps, but there is no real requirement that the gaps are closed. The goals for student performance are set at the State level and there is little repercussion for failure. In addition, the proposal would free participants from current law requiring inclusion of all students in State assessments. That is one of the matters that is now going to be put aside. 
   Under the block grant proposal, ``all students'' is defined as ``all students attending public or charter schools that are participating in the State's assessment system.'' There are no provisions requiring States to include all students in that assessment system. Therefore, the States could exclude students from assessment without any accountability for their performance. 
   Talk about a shell game--they have general language about what the States have to do in order to get the next big chunk of money from Uncle Sam. 
   Take a look at what the States have to do in terms of giving their report where they can be selective about who is going to be in and who is going to be out to try to meet that requirement effectively. It is, as we have mentioned, an absolute blank check. 
   We have learned year in and year out that when you give a blank check on education, it isn't the neediest and the poorest children who are going to get it. That is why we have all of the various GAO studies showing that in targeting funds, Federal funds are targeted seven times more to poorer children than State funds expended on education. At the Federal level, with scarce resources, we decided those are going to be the priorities. They present an extraordinary challenge of what we can do and what we can achieve. I think that is a very legitimate debate. 
   But on our side, we have attempted to say we are going to provide to parents some guarantees in the area of education, some guarantees on smaller class size, some guarantees on teacher training, some guarantees on afterschool programs, some guarantees in terms of accountability, and hopefully to try to ensure that we were going to have safe schools and safe and drug-free schools. We are also going to do something about meeting the challenges which so many of our students face with buildings that are in a state of collapse, are antiquated, and should  not be used for purposes of educating children. Those are guarantees. 
   The Senate has a choice: Are we going to, on the one hand, give the blank check to the States, or, on the other hand, are we going to follow the tried and tested programs that have demonstrated results for children at the local level? 
   I want to mention what we have done on our side with regard to the issue of accountability. 
   First of all, our framework requires States to set goals for student performance progress on the local level and school districts to set goals for student progress for each school. 
   You will hear the rhetoric about how wonderfully we are doing with schools. Here it is. We will give the reference for the various pages. Let me go through them. 
   If the school or district fails to make progress within 2 years, districts and States must take action to assist the school or district, and supplemental resources are provided. Research-based school improvement strategies must be implemented. 
   If they are going to implement from a range of different options, they have to have demonstrated success in the past based upon solid research. Then they can be used in the local 
   communities. 
   If the school or district continues to fail, the district or State must impose sanctions. The governance structure of the district or school must be changed, intensive professional development must be provided to the school's faculty, and parents must be given the option to send their children to the higher performing public schools. 
   Effectively, if they are unable to be turned around at the end of the 5-year period, they will be on probation after the 3 years. If they are unable to do that, the school is effectively closed. The children will have to go to another school, or the States will come in and reverse that situation. 
   Quite frankly, that has worked. In the State of North Carolina, they have 14 schools which they have had to go into and close down. Of the 14 schools they have closed, 12 of them are now above the State average in terms of performance. 
   We are building on programs that have been tried and have demonstrated success. That is the way we are approaching the underserved schools and school districts. Our bill strengthens the current title I accountability system, and States are required to demonstrate progress and student achievement in each school and each district so that no community is left behind. 
   Our bill requires goals for student progress, not just in the aggregate, but also for economically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic groups, and limited-English-proficient students. This step is necessary to ensure that progress is made in narrowing existing achievement gaps. States are also required to submit a report identifying students excluded from assessments. If for some reason they are going to let students out of these assessments, they are going to have to be identified. This is to guarantee that the system is not being gamed. 
   That is what is happening. We sort of know it in some places where they have the various tests and the kids are being taught to take a particular test. There is a great deal of gaming going on in the system. We have to do everything we can to make sure that is not the case. This is to guarantee that the system is not being gamed by the practice of discarding the scores of certain students or outright excluding them from the assessment in order to improve the aggregate result. 
   It establishes significant consequences for failure--freezes administrative funds and requires the Secretary to withhold an increasing proportion of Federal funds for administrative expenses each successive year the States fails to meet the deadlines. 
   It requires accountability at the district and school level, not just the State level, by requiring LEAs to undertake corrective actions to reform specific failing schools and requiring States to undertake corrective actions to reform failing school districts. Under these provisions, the school district would be required to take action that would change the governance structure of failing schools; 
   It establishes report cards to inform parents about the quality of their schools and their progress in meeting student achievement goals. Our plan also requires notification to parents when either the district or school that their child is enrolled in is undergoing corrective actions. 
   This body doesn't see the difference between what is in the Republican proposal versus the kind of accountability we are talking about in our proposal. There are light years in difference. If we are going to be serious about these funds, we need to move ahead to make sure we are going to have support for programs that will make a difference for children. 
   With regard to the opening comments about accountability, I hope our friends on the other side of the aisle are going to spare us a lot of discussion about local control and parent involvement because it just isn't there, it just isn't there. It might be there in the minds of people, but it isn't there in terms of legislation. It just isn't there. We want to put it there. We know how to put it there. If we want to do that, that is all well and good. We welcome the opportunity. We tried to do that in the course of the program. 
   I will make a brief comment about some of the challenges that remain. We still have a long way to go. We are strongly committed to deal with those issues. Let me mention what happened in some areas and some communities. 
   In Connecticut, reading scores went up when the State had a major investment in attracting the Nation's best and brightest teachers. That has been recognized generally by all those in education. They have done the most effective job in ensuring a well trained teacher in every classroom. Experts are reaching the conclusion that is an indicator as to how much the children have moved up. Important research has supported that concept. 
   The bottom line is, with well trained teachers who are certified by the States--which is the case in our bill, not in their bill--in every classroom, the students' scores increase. Our legislation, that will be introduced by Senator DASCHLE in the form of a substitute to the underlying legislation, will have certification by the States within the 5-year period. 
   In Boston, MA, at the Harriet Baldwin School, there is a program that serves 283 students; 93 percent are minorities, and 80 percent are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. From 1996 to 1998, their math and reading improved substantially above the national median. In 1996, 66 percent of third graders scored at math levels I and II with little or partial mastery of basic skills; in 1998, 100 percent scored at levels III and IV with solid performance, superior performance, beyond grade level. In 1997, 75 percent of the fourth graders were at level I and II and with only 25 percent at high proficiency. In 1998, more than 50 percent were at higher levels of proficiency. 
   We find programs with tough accountability, good teachers, and smaller class, we are seeing superb results. 
   One of the underlying differences between the bill presented by our Republican friends and our proposal is with regard to the professional development. That is a key element. Hopefully, we will have an opportunity to address that issue independently as the debate goes on. It is of special importance as we consider the underlying legislation. 
   Our Republican colleagues argue that the block grants provide the needed flexibility to improve teacher quality. The Republican Teacher Empowerment Act gives so much flexibility that States do not have to do anything to change their current practices. They can continue hiring uncertified teachers and continue providing low-quality, ineffective professional development and mentoring. They can use most of the funds for a large variety of purposes that dilute the focus and attention on improving the recruitment and mentoring and professional development of teachers. 
   Why is this so? The proposed Teacher Empowerment Act does not guarantee any substantial funds for professional development. Page 210 says, for professional development activities:  
   Each local educational agency that receives a subgrant to carry out the subpart shall use a portion of the funds made available through the subgrant for professional development.......  
   They qualify with ``use a portion'' of the funds. We don't know what that  ``portion'' of the funds is. It does not guarantee funds for mentoring programs, one of the most effective teacher professional development activities. Studies show, without mentoring programs, half of all the new teachers in urban and poor areas drop out within the first 5 years. Put in effective mentoring programs, and 70 to 75 percent of the teachers are staying in the schools, according to studies. 
   Regarding mentoring, programs that provide mentoring to newly hired teachers, such as mentoring for master teachers, are merely allowed. Mentoring is only ``allowed,'' not required, even though virtually all of the major studies show that mentoring programs work. 
   It does not guarantee funds for recruitment programs, it just allows the use of the funds. It does not guarantee that teachers are trained to address the needs of children with disabilities. Our bill guarantees that teachers are trained to meet the needs of children with disabilities and limited English proficient children. 
   It does not hold States accountable for having a qualified teacher in every classroom. It does not even require teachers to be certified. Imagine that. I was listening to the majority leader talk about the importance of having good teachers in every classroom. Their proposal does not even require that teachers be certified in Mississippi. 
   It also does not require a substantial priority for math and science training. No one can look at the challenges that underserved children are facing in our schools in urban and rural areas and not understand that in math and science there are special needs. Talk to any educator who has dealt with the problems of urban education, and they will say you need someone who will be teaching math and science. We provide an allocation for the math and science teachers, giving them the first priority. They don't require any substantial priority for math and science training. 
   Their proposal does not require accountability. Instead, it promotes ineffective activities through the TOPS Program that are contrary to promising practices by supporting individually selected strategies for teachers. That means if you are a teacher in Chicopee and decide you would find a program you think is pretty good for elsewhere in Massachusetts, be my guest, you can take it. It gives them all the flexibility on this to be able to go out there and take it, instead of using what has been the recognized way of enhancing academic achievement and professional development; that is, having it school-related, tied to the curriculum, working with teachers, working with students. That is what all the studies, teachers, and scholars alike have said. 
   Not under the Republican program; it is business as usual. They have used the programs in various communities around the country. I hope those who are trying to defend the Republican program will be able to demonstrate how and where their effectiveness has been. It hasn't been there. It is not there. 
   But they have accepted that. That, I think, really fails to meet the basic thrust of the importance of a qualified teacher. 
   There are others who want to speak, but let me just spend a few minutes on what we have done on teachers. In our particular program with regard to recruitment and professional development, to help schools and districts States can keep up to 6 percent for State activities, including strategies to raise teacher salaries, improve alternate routes to State certification, and reduce the numbers of teachers placed out of field or who are emergency credentialed. It requires the first $300 million will be used for professional development, mentoring, and recruitment in math and science, and it requires 60 percent of State funds be used for high-quality professional development and mentoring activities. That is funds that would go by formula to districts on the basis of 80-percent poverty and 20-percent population. 
   It guarantees that 30 percent of the State funds go for State-run competitive local recruitment programs to high-need districts and to recruit and train high-need candidates. It guarantees teachers are trained to address the needs of children with disabilities, female students, and other students with special needs and bilingual programs. It holds States accountable for having a qualified teacher within 4 years of enactment of the law, otherwise their funds halt in this program. They are accountable for having a qualified teacher in every classroom within 4 years of enactment of the law. It holds local districts accountable for results. They may not hire any teachers who are not qualified using title II funds. 
   If we needed something to say we need to give a high priority to well-trained teachers, all we have to do is just look at the Wall Street Journal of about a month ago. It is dated February 29, ``Schools To Turn To Temp Agency For Substitute Teachers.''  
   Most school districts begin every day with a nerve-wracking hunt for substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With the tight labor market making the task especially tough, a few are starting to outsource the job. Kelly Temp Services unveiled the first nationwide substitute teacher program, and now handles screening and schedules for 120 schools in 10 States.  
   This is a national indictment of our failure to deal with the problems of development of qualified teachers for our schools. We have, I think, an effective program which really reflects the judgment on the major professional development programs. I will just mention what the various studies say they need to do. They say high-quality professional development must be connected with teachers' work with their students, linked to concrete tasks of teaching, organized around problem solving, be informed by research, and sustained over time by ongoing conversations and coaching. 
   There is a series of recommendations which we have worked on with regard to mentoring as well as the other aspects of it. 
   Let me just conclude with these observations. On the one hand, you have what we are attempting to do, and what we will attempt to do with our substitute amendment, which is to guarantee to parents tough, strong, effective, tried-and-tested programs that are going to result in enhanced academic achievement and accomplishment. There is a significant break with the past with our very tough-minded accountability standards. We owe a great deal to Senator BINGAMAN and others who have done yeoman work in that area of accountability, and have for a long period of time going back to the Governors' meetings. We have that. 
   On the other hand, we have the contributions, a blank check to the States. It is a blank check to the States for them to effectively use that money in a State program, virtually free from the requirements that are going to result in, first, the funding getting to where the needs are, and, second, the effective and tough-minded programs that can make a difference to those children 
   in the underserved areas. 
   ``It isn't there.'' You will hear the conversations, you will hear the speeches, you will hear the words, but ``it isn't there.'' You can't show it. We will take every section of the bill and go through it--I have--and show it does not give the accountability that is required. It fails the parents in this country, giving assurance to them for these programs. 
   I have not even gotten into the question of portability, the whole sense of block grants. What has happened historically when we have gone back to block granting is, on each and every occasion that we have block granted, we have found out those funds have been dramatically reduced over a period of years. We can go back into that. I will at another time. But just take that because the fact is the focus and purpose for which those funds are developed becomes blurred. That has been the record. That is what we are going to see with regard to the Federal participation, partnership. It ought to be a partnership with the State and local communities. 
   There are many in this body who do not think we ought to be in there at all. I understand that and respect it. It was not that long ago when they were advocating the elimination of the Department of Education. That was the Republican position. I understand it. I believe every one of us on our side believes when the President meets with his Cabinet there ought to be someone in there talking about education, education, education. That has been their position. 
   Second, they have tried to cut back funding on education over the period  since 1994. I understand that. They don't want Federal involvement. 
   This must be the new way. Now we are getting vouchers, block grants, and give it to the States and let them make the judgment without tough-minded accountability. 
   It is the wrong way to go. We should know better. I hope in this debate we will have the opportunity to demonstrate it further. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Friday, April 28, 2000, we remembered and honored the sacrifices of the men and women across the years who have lost their lives on the job. We also marked the 30th anniversary of the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which has done so much to reduce such casualties by improving conditions in the workplace for employees across the country. On this day, we renewed our commitment to fair and safe working conditions for every American. 
   The progress that we have made over the past 30 years is remarkable. In 1970, the year the Occupational Safety and Health Act was signed into law, 13,800 workers died on the job. Since then, workplace fatality rates have fallen by 74 percent. Over 200,000 lives have been saved. Injury rates have fallen by more than a third. 
   In observance of this important day, we must also remember the lives and the families that have been irrevocably changed by workplace injuries and illnesses. Despite the progress, 154 people still lose their lives on the job on the average day. Last year in Massachusetts, 91 workers died on the job--more than double the number in 1998. Currently, it is estimated that 1,000 deaths a year result from work-related illnesses, and 1,200 workers a year are diagnosed with cancer caused by their jobs. Clearly, those high numbers are unacceptable. 
   As the global economy continues to expand and change the new workplace, new challenges are created for ensuring adequate safety protections. The modern workplace is being restructured by downsizing staff, larger output quotas, mandatory overtime, and job consolidation. This restructuring creates new pressures on workers to be more productive in the name of efficiency and competitiveness. New technologies in the workplace make it easier to do jobs faster, but they pose new hazards as well. 
   For ten years, workers have been struggling to achieve a workplace free from ergonomic injuries and illnesses. Since 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole announced the Department  of Labor's commitment to issuing an ergonomics standard, more than 6 million workers have suffered serious job injuries from these hazards. Each year, 650,000 workers lose a day or more of work because of ergonomic injuries, costing businesses $15-20 billion per year. 
   Ursula Stafford, 24 years old, worked as a paraprofessional for the New York City school district. She was injured assisting a 250-pound wheelchair-bound student. She received no training on how to lift the student, nor did her employer provide any lifting equipment. After two days on the job, she suffered a herniated disc and spasms in her neck. As a result of her injuries, her doctor told her that she may not be able to have children, because her back may not be able to support the weight. 
   Charley Richardson, a shipfitter at General Dynamics in Quincy, Massachusetts, sustained a career-ending back injury when he was ordered to install a 75-pound piece of steel to reinforce a deck. Although he continued to try to work, he found that on many days, he could not endure the pain of lifting and using heavy tools. For years afterwards, his injury prevented him from participating in basic activities. The loss that hurt Charley the most was having to tell his grandchildren they could not sit on his lap for more than a couple of minutes, because it was too painful. To this day, he cannot sit for long without pain. 
   OSHA has proposed an ergonomics standard to protect workers from these debilitating injuries. Yet in spite of the costs to employers and to workers and their families, industry has launched an all-out, no-holds-barred effort to prevent OSHA from issuing this important standard. A stronger standard would go a long way to reducing this leading cause of injury. 
   Ergonomics programs have been shown to make a difference in reducing the number of injuries that occur on the job. Johns Hopkins University initiated a program which significantly reduced the rate of such injuries by 80 percent over seven years. A poultry processor's program lowered the incidence of workers' compensation claims by 20 percent. A program by Intel Corporation produced a savings of more than $10 million. 
   Hopefully, after this long battle, a national ergonomics standard will finally be put in place this year. If so, it will be the most significant workplace safety protection in the 30 years since OSHA became law. The ergonomic standard will be a landmark achievement in improving safety and health for all workers in America. May this Workers Memorial Day serve as a monument to the progress we are making, and as a constant reminder of our obligation to do more, much more, to achieve the great goal we share.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from Montana and commend the reasoning he has presented to this body. What he has pointed out is we could move ahead on this issue and reach a fair resolution of the injustice of the marriage tax penalty if we just had the opportunity to have a reasonable debate and discussion on these measures. We are effectively being denied, closed out from that opportunity. I just thank him for reiterating that. As a leader on the Finance Committee on this issue, I think he has made this case in a very powerful way.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on the issue of education, the elementary and secondary education legislation will be coming to the floor in the next several days, according to what the leader has announced. I wish to indicate, once again, the position of those of us on this side of the aisle and what we tried to do in the markup of the education proposal several weeks ago. 
   We attempted to follow some of the rather radical, but significant, changes we have seen as a result of enhanced and improved academic achievement at the local level. We want some guarantees because of the scarce resources available to us. 
   As my colleagues know, 7 cents out of every dollar for education comes from the Federal Government. We are strongly committed on this side of the aisle to building on tried and tested programs that are indicating enhanced achievement for the children of this country, rather than the alternative, which is a block grant program our Republican friends have supported. 
   We will have a chance to go through their legislation. It is S. 2. Instead of providing targeted resources to local communities for improving teacher quality, smaller class size, afterschool programs, the majority, in this lengthy legislation, says it should be ``......determination of State participation, the Governor of a State''--not the local parents, not the local school board, not the local community, but the Governor of a State--``in consultation with the individual body responsible for the education of the State shall determine.......'' We will go through the legislation next week, 
   Their legislation says 5 years later there is going to be an accounting. We, on this side, do not want to wait 5 years to find out if their particular block grant program has been effective. All one has to do is go back to 1965 to 1969. We provided block grants to the States under the title I program. We will go through some of this during the debate. The State of Tennessee--all States have indicated how they utilized the money--purchased 18 portable swimming pools in the summer of 1966 at $3,500 each. The justification was that funds originally approved for a summer remedial program would not be spent and the money would otherwise go unspent. There is the buying of football uniforms in some States, and the buying of musical instruments for groups not even affected by title I. We will go through what has happened historically with the block grant program. 
   Our programs are targeted to make sure we have a well-trained teacher in every classroom. We believe the overwhelming majority of American parents understand that and want that. We want to make sure we have smaller class sizes. We do not need more studies. We have had all the studies, and we have the results. We understand, as Senator MURRAY has pointed out so effectively, that smaller class sizes result in enhanced academic achievement. We believe, with the scarce resources available, we ought to invest in a guaranteed program with guaranteed results of having the smaller class sizes. We believe in afterschool programs which are so important. 
   Modern, safer schools: Our schools are too crowded, out-of-date, and dilapidated. We owe it to our children to modernize our schools--to have more classrooms, to provide modern teaching facilities, and to provide our children with a safe and orderly learning environment. 
   Accountability for results: We should hold schools accountable for results. We don't want to write a blank check to the states. We want federal education dollars to go to proven programs that will bring about real change. And we should require schools to use scarce federal dollars to bring about that change. 
   A greater role for parents: Children and schools need the support of parents. Senator REED will propose an amendment to give parents a stronger role in the education of their children and in the decision-making in their local schools. 
   Gun safety: We should give gun safety top priority when it comes to our children and our schools. Child safety locks on guns should be a requirement. And we should close the gun show loophole that has proven so deadly to our children and our schools. The Senate passed such legislation last year, but it languishes in conference. We should act again--this time in earnest--to protect our children and our schools from gun violence. 
   Republican colleagues will talk about change--they talk about having better teachers and safer schools. But if you read their bill, they just perpetuate the status quo. All they want to do is give more money to the governors and the states to use for their favorite programs. There is no guarantee under the Republican bill that your local school will spend the money on smaller classes, safer schools, or better teachers.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past few days, there has been a great deal of discussion on the rights of victims and the need for increased participation of victims in the criminal justice system. I believe that all of us support victims' rights, greater federal recognition of these rights. Clearly, they deserve enforceable rights that are guaranteed by law. But, just as clearly, these rights can be achieved without taking the extraordinary step of amending the Constitution of the United States. 
   The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy, and it reflects the enduring principles of our country. The framers deliberately made it difficult to amend the Constitution, because it was never intended to be used for normal legislative purposes. Chief Justice Rehnquist captures the essence of why this proposed amendment is misguided, when he states that a statute, rather than a constitutional amendment, ``would have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which appeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act of Congress.'' 
   The Constitution is not a billboard which to plaster amendments as if they were bumper sticker slogans. In this Congress alone, over a dozen constitutional amendments have been introduced. With every new proposed amendment of this kind, we undermine and trivialize the Constitution and threaten to weaken its enduring strength. 
   One of the guiding principles that has served the nation well for two hundred years is that if it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is necessary not to amend it. We have amended the Constitution only 17 times in the two centuries since the adoption of the Bill of Rights. We should consider such amendments only in rare instances, when the enactment of a statute is clearly inadequate. 
   We do have a responsibility to act to assure victims of crime that their rights in the criminal justice system will not be ignored. But amending the Constitution is not the appropriate remedy, and the debate over such a remedy in recent years has, as a practical matter, delayed the implementation of basic protections that are needed and that should be accomplished by statute. 
   For too long, our criminal justice system has neglected the hundreds of thousands of victims of crime whose lives are shattered by violence or threats of violence each year. I believe, along with every other member of the Senate, that the rights of victims deserve better from our criminal justice system. 
   Another irony is worth emphasizing in this debate. Many of the Senators who support the rights of victims and feel so strongly about this constitutional amendment are the same Senators who refuse to allow federal action, even by statute, to protect victims of hate crimes. For the past two years, the Senate has failed to send hate crimes legislation to the President's desk for signature. I hope that this debate will at least have the beneficial affect of encouraging Congress to take action to protect victims of hate crimes. Their needs too can no longer be ignored. 
   Too often, the legal system does not provide adequate relief for victims of crime. They are not given basic information about their case--such as the case status, scheduling changes of court proceedings, and notice of a defendant's arrest and bail status. Victims deserve to know about their case, They deserve to know about hearings and other proceedings. They deserve to know when their assailants are being considered for parole. And they certainly deserve to know when their attackers are released from prison. 
   Victims of crime and their families deserve legislation that will guarantee their basic rights and provide urgently needed support. However, particular provisions in the proposed constitutional amendment are of grave concern. It is no surprise that victims' rights groups and domestic violence groups oppose the constitutional amendment for a very practical reason. If a victim of domestic violence acts in self-defense, the batterer would be entitled to all of the constitutional rights created by S.J. Res. 3, including the right to attend court proceedings and the right to be heard. 
   Clearly, we can deal with this problem by statute, and I urge the Senate to do so. I would welcome the opportunity to work with my colleagues to enact bipartisan legislation to accomplish the goal we share of genuine protections for victims' rights. 
   Finally, I commend all of my colleagues who have so eloquently defended the Constitution and opposed this misguided amendment, especially Senator BYRD and Senator LEAHY. They have given Congress and the country an excellent lesson in the role of the Constitution in protecting our liberties. Rarely has there been a better example of Senators living up to our oath of office ``to support and defend the Constitution.'' 
   When we began this debate earlier this seek, the conventional wisdom was that the proposed constitutional amendment was within a vote or two in the Senate of obtaining the two-thirds majority needed for passage. The debate has so clearly demonstrated the fundamental flaws of this amendment that the amendment is likely to be withdrawn. It is a proud moment for the Senate, and I believe the founders who wrote the Constitution would be proud of us too.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to approve this resolution, which Senator HELMS, Senator LAUTENBERG and I submitted on the travel ban and other U.S. restrictions on contacts with Libya. The resolution was approved on April 13 by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
   At the end of March, a team of State Department officials visited Libya as part of a review of the ban that has been in effect since 1981 on U.S. travel to that nation. State Department officials were in Libya for 26 hours, visiting hotels and other sites. Based on the findings of this delegation, the State Department is preparing a recommendation for the Secretary of State to help her determine whether there is still ``imminent danger to ..... the physical safety of United States travelers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban. 
   Under the provisions of the travel ban, American citizens can travel to Libya only if they first obtain a license from the Department of the Treasury. In addition, the State Department must first validate a passport for travel to Libya. 
   The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, just as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in The Netherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed as a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi. 
   After the State Department announced that it would send this consular team to Libya, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan official as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. team was a ``step in the right direction.'' The official said the visit was a sign that ``the international community was convinced that Libya's foreign policy position was not wrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's relations with the world.'' 
   Libya's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said the visit demonstrated that the Administration ``has realized the importance of Libya'' and that Libya feels ``the negative chapter in our relations is over.'' 
   Libya's Secretary for African Unity told reporters that the visit to Libya by U.S. officials was a welcome step and that ''..... we welcome the normalization between the two countries.'' 
   The good will gesture was certainly not lost on Colonel Qadhafi, who said on April 4, when asked about a possible warming of relations with the United States: ``I think America has reviewed its policy toward Libya and discovered that it is wrong ..... it is a good time for America to change its policy toward Libya.'' 
   I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this decision. They are united in their belief that the U.S. delegation should not have been sent to Libya and that it would be a serious mistake to lift the travel ban before justice is served. The families want to know why the Secretary of State made this friendly overture to Colonel Qadhafi just six weeks before the trial in the Netherlands begins. They question how much information the State Department was able to obtain by spending only 26 hours in  Libya. They wonder why the State Department could not continue to use the same sources of information it has been using for many years to make a determination about the travel ban. 
   There is no reason to believe that the situation in Libya has changed since November 1999, when the travel ban was last extended on the basis of imminent danger to American citizens. Indeed, in January 2000, President Clinton cited Libya's support for terrorist activities and its non-compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 863 as actions and policies that ``pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy interest of the United States.'' 
   These American families have waited for justice for eleven long years. They felt betrayed by the decision to send the consular delegation to Libya. They have watched with dismay as our close ally, Great Britain, has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with Libya, before justice is served for the British citizens killed in the terrorist bombing. The State Department denies it, but the families are concerned that the visit signals a change in U.S. policy, undermines U.S. sanctions, and calls into question the Administration's commitment to vigorously enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. That Act requires the United States to impose sanctions on foreign companies which invest more than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until Libya complies with the conditions specified by the UN Security Council in its resolutions. 
   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, was one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. Other American citizens are waiting for justice in other cases against Libya as well. Libya is also accused in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing in Germany, which resulted in the deaths of two United States servicemen. The trial of five individuals implicated in that attack began in December 1997 and is ongoing. In March 1999, six Libyan intelligence agents, including Colonel Qadhafi's brother-in-law, were convicted in absentia by a French court for the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which resulted in the deaths of 171 people, including seven Americans. A civil suit against Colonel Qadhafi based on that bombing is pending in France. 
   The State Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now and it should not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The Department's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport requests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 
   The resolution the Senate is now considering states the Sense of the Senate that Libya's refusal to accept responsibility for its role in terrorist attacks against United States citizens suggests that the imminent danger to the physical safety of United States travelers continues. It calls on the Administration to consult fully with the U.S. Congress in considering policy toward Libya. It states that the travel ban and all other U.S. restrictions on Libya should not be eased until all cases of American victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved and the government of Libya has cooperated fully in bringing the perpetrators to justice. 
   I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we continue to wage our ongoing battle in Congress for a fair increase in the minimum wage for millions of workers across America, it is important to understand that low-income workers in all parts of the country are doing all they can themselves to obtain fair increases in pay from their employers. 
   One of the most important examples in recent weeks has been the strike by janitors in Los Angeles, who were seeking a long overdue reasonable increase in wages during this time of remarkable prosperity for most Americans. 
   At the beginning of last week, an excellent column by respected journalist David S. Broder appeared in The Washington Post and many other newspapers across the country, calling national attention to the strike, and emphasizing the issues of fundamental fairness at the heart of this dispute. Mr. Broder noted recent reports of the lavish salary and bonus packages totaling millions or even tens of millions of dollars a year available to the top executives of major firms across the country, and he compared these extraordinary benefits with the low salaries of the janitors in this dispute, whose lives ``are lived on the ragged edge of poverty.'' 
   I had the opportunity to meet with many of the striking workers and their union leaders on a visit to Los Angeles during the recess, and to express my support for them in their battle and to commend them for their courage. 
   Fortunately, a tentative agreement on the issues in the strike was reached over the weekend, and a settlement granting a significant pay increase and other benefits was overwhelmingly approved by a vote of the workers yesterday. The President of the local union called the agreement ``the beginning of a new era for organized labor.'' 
   Justice for these janitors means progress toward justice for all working men and women across America. Their cause was just, and because of timely and important articles like David Broder's, more and more people across America are becoming aware of these fundamental issues and their extraordinary importance for our society.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget resolution that Republicans put before the American people today proposes an unacceptable change of course, at a time when the Nation needs to stay the course of the investments that are driving our historic economic expansion. This is a budget that reverts to the days of trickle-down economics, despite all the evidence that it will only widen the unconscionable gap that already exists between rich and poor in our society. It fails to respond to the challenges the Nation so obviously faces in education, health care, prescription drugs for the elderly, youth violence, firearm safety, hunger, scientific research and development, and environmental protection. 
   The Senate improved the House budget resolution in important respects last week, but the House position prevailed on every issue during conference. The document before the Senate today is far less satisfactory than the budget the Senate sent to conference last Friday. The Senate resolution dedicated just $2.7 billion of the $150 billion Republican tax cut to Pell Grants that help low-income, high-achieving students attend college. But the House Republicans killed even this modest incentive for college education, preferring to keep every possible dollar for more tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   The Senate resolution included an $8.5 billion reserve fund to expand early learning opportunities, so that young children enter school ready to learn. This was a bipartisan amendment that Senator STEVENS, Senator JEFFORDS and I offered. But House Republicans blocked it. 
   The Senate resolution included a pledge that the minimum wage should be increased by $1, but the House Republicans rejected it.  
   The Senate minimum wage provision expressed our fundamental commitment that many of the hardest working Americans working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, ought not to have to continue to live in poverty, nor should their children. But it was rejected by the House conferees. 
   The Senate resolution even included a provision by Republican Senator ARLEN SPECTER to increase funding for medical research. But again, House Republicans rejected it. 
   Instead, the Republican budget resolution that emerged from conference is a shortsighted scheme to protect narrow special-interests instead of the national interest. I'm proud to join my Democratic colleagues in voting against it. We will continue the battle for a fair budget in weeks and months ahead. But the final battle may well be on election day, when the American people at long last will have the choice to elect the Congress that will make the right investments, not the wrong investments, for the Nation's future. 
   During last week's budget debate we heard many statistics that are misleading at best. When we cut through all the ``smoke and mirrors,'' what matters is that this unacceptable budget resolution supports a huge tax break for the wealthy that the Nation can't afford. 
   The independent Congressional Budget Office confirms that the Republican budget resolution reduces domestic discretionary spending by an average of 6.5%. It is impossible for this Congress to write honest appropriations bills with cuts that drastic. Our Republican colleagues couldn't make the numbers add up without massive accounting gimmicks last year, and they can't do it this year. 
   Our Republican friends say that they designed this budget resolution to curb the gimmicks used last year. But we all know there will be new ones used to pretend to meet the urgent needs our country faces. 
   This budget also prevents us from acting to reduce the number of low-income working families who have no health insurance--to rebuild our crumbling public schools, to reduce the hunger that still afflicts 3 out of every 100 American households--to make college affordable for low-income students --and to achieve the scientific advances that are so close. 
   Tax breaks for the wealthy are what this budget resolution is all about. No other subject is treated so often and so thoroughly. There are reconciliation instructions on tax cuts, reserve funds for tax cuts, and even provisions for more tax cuts if the surplus grows. The only things that this budget resolution requires committees to report are tax cuts. The only procedural protection under ``reconciliation'' provided by the resolution is for tax cuts. 
   Democrats support affordable, targeted tax cuts, and they should be enacted promptly. But the merit of a tax cut depends on its size and its distribution. It is obvious that these GOP tax cuts are excessive and irresponsible. They offer plums for the rich and crumbs for everyone else, and President Clinton will be right to give them the veto they obviously deserve. 
   The budgets we vote for say a great deal about our values. It is easy to pay lip service to meeting the Nation's unmet needs. But a budget clearly shows whether we are willing to allocate resources to address those needs effectively. 
   This budget does not pass the laugh test. It does not seriously address the range of important challenges facing America. It does not meet our national needs in education, in health care, in medical and other scientific research, in security for senior citizens, in environmental protection, and in public safety. On all these issues, it is a failed budget, because it fails America. It gives the most to those who already have the most. It pretends that the Nation has no unmet needs--and it deserves to be defeated. 
   Mr. President, one very important aspect of the budget that was altered and changed in the budget conference report concerns the issue of prescription drugs. This issue was before the Senate Finance Committee. We had debate on this measure on the floor during the budget consideration. We hoped to be able to have debate on this issue when we talked about the marriage tax penalty. Look at the contrast between the way the budget conference considered tax breaks and how the conference committee addressed prescription drugs--an issue that is calling out for action by this Congress, and calling out for action now. 
   We made some progress in the budget resolution that passed the Senate earlier, but look at what happened in that conference. Look at what happened on one of the most important issues in this country today. Providing America's seniors with the help they need in order to survive, through a responsible, comprehensive prescription drug benefit that will be affordable and that will include basic benefits, as well as catastrophic coverage must be a priority. 
   Look at the difference on what we call reconciliation of revenue reductions in the Senate. In other words, what did the budget resolution say in the conference with regard to tax cuts? It says that the Senate Committee on Finance shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill not later than July 14 of the year 2000, and not later than September 13, 2000, that consists of changes in laws within its jurisdiction sufficient to reduce the total level of revenues by $11.6 billion in 2001 and $150 billion for fiscal years 2001-2005. Not later than July 14 or September 13. This is what is in the conference report with regard to prescription drugs. 
   Whenever the Senate Committee on Finance reports a bill which improves access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget may revise to accommodate such legislation $20 billion over the period of fiscal years 2001 through 2005. Then the (b) section talks about Medicare reform. 
   We have changed some rather specific instructions on prescription drugs--improving access to prescription drugs. The seniors of this country know the difference between access to prescription drugs and a benefit package that includes prescription drugs. Access to prescription drugs may mean a bus ticket for a senior living in Maine or any of the border States to go over to Canada. That is access to prescription drugs. We are not talking about access. We are talking about a benefit package that is going to be meaningful to our senior citizens. 
   That is what this debate has been about. Our seniors understand which benefits they receive and they understand which benefits they don't receive. One benefit they do not receive is a prescription drug benefit. In addition, the $20 billion which may have access to prescription drugs at this time is half the amount the President has recommended. 
   This is a clear abdication of this body's responsibility to our seniors. We cannot go home without taking action on an effective prescription drug program. We on this side of the aisle feel strongly that one of the priorities that should have been attended to prior to a tax break is an effective prescription drug program; one that is universal, basic and catastrophic, and affordable--affordable to the individuals and affordable to our government. 
   But, no, we get lip service on the issue of prescription drugs in this particular proposal. That in and of itself should be enough reason to reject the proposal. If you vote for this budget, you are not serious about making sure our seniors are going to have prescription drugs. You cannot vote for this budget and say you are serious about prescription drugs because this budget does not provide the necessary assurance to our senior citizens. 
   I will take a final minute to talk about the drug crisis America's seniors are facing. Prescription drug coverage is going down at the same time drug costs are going up. I shared with the Senate the other day the reality our senior citizens across this country face. A third of all senior citizens don't have any prescription drug coverage at all; another third are losing coverage. These seniors have employer-based coverage, which is declining dramatically every single year. Then there are seniors with coverage through HMOs; their coverage is being squeezed out. The only group that has reliable coverage are the poorest of the poor who are covered under the Medicaid program. Prescription drug coverage is not just another benefit, it is life and death for our seniors. 
   This chart demonstrates what has been happening to drug costs. We are seeing double-digit increases in drug  costs. From 1995, going up; in 1997, up 14 percent; and in 1998, up 15 percent; in 1999, up 16 percent. These increases were at a time when we had an average of a 2-percent increase in the rate of inflation. 
   This issue affects Americans all across this country; it isn't an issue just in the Northeast. It is an issue in the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, the Northwest and the Southwest. It is a universal issue. Our senior citizens deserve better action by the Budget Committee in the conference. It is a tragedy. But we are strongly committed on this side of the aisle not to give up on this issue. We are going to take every opportunity to fight for prescription drugs. We believe our seniors are entitled to an effective drug program. We think a prescription drug program is absolutely essential. It has to be one of our top priorities. It should have been done right by the Budget Committee. 
   The prescription drug benefit is more deserving than the tax breaks which are included in this resolution. That was the issue that was before the Budget Committee. That is the issue that is before the Senate of the United States this afternoon. That is the most important reason I will vote ``no.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, April 24 marks the 85th anniversary of the beginning of one of the most tragic events in history, the Armenian Genocide. In 1915, the Ottoman Turkish Government embarked on a brutal policy of ethnic extermination. Over the next eight years, 1.5 million Armenians were killed, and more than half a million were forced from their homeland into exile. 
   In the years since then, the Armenian diaspora has thrived in the United States and in many other countries, bringing extraordinary vitality and achievement to communities across America and throughout the world. The Armenian Assembly of America, the Armenian National Committee of America, and other distinguished groups deserve great credit for their impressive work in maintaining the proud history and heritage of the Armenian people, and guaranteeing that the Armenian Genocide will never be forgotten. 
   One of the enduring achievements of the survivors of the Genocide and their descendants has been to keep its tragic memory alive, in spite of continuing efforts by those who refuse to acknowledge the atrocities that took place. In Massachusetts, the curriculum of every public school now includes human rights and genocide, and the Armenian Genocide is part of that curriculum. 
   As this new century unfolds, it is time for all governments, political leaders and peoples everywhere to recognize the Armenian Genocide. These annual commemorations are an effective way to pay tribute to the courage and suffering and triumph of the Armenian people, and to ensure that such atrocities will never happen again to any people on earth.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support greater recognition of the rights of victims of crime. Clearly, they deserve enforceable rights that are guaranteed by law. But, just as clearly, these rights can be achieved without amending the Constitution. The Constitution is the foundation of our democracy, and it reflects the enduring principles of our country. The framers deliberately made it difficult to amend because it was never intended to be used for normal legislative purposes. 
   We have a responsibility to assure victims of crime that their rights in the criminal justice system will not be ignored. That is why my colleagues and I are re-introducing the Crime Victims Assistance Act. 
   Our bill clearly defines the rights of victims, and it establishes an effective means to implement and enforce these rights. It does so without taking the drastic and unnecessary step of amending the Constitution. Acting through legislation allows us to act quickly to give victims the rights to which they are entitled. It also allows us to react quickly to changing circumstances. By contrast, the proponents of a constitutional amendment are asking victims to wait, possibly for years, before any of the provisions in the amendment are adopted, much less implemented. 
   Our bill provides enhanced protections to victims of federal crimes. It assures victims a greater voice in the prosecution of the criminals who injured them and their families. It gives victims the right to be notified and heard on detention and plea agreements, the right to be notified and heard at probation revocation hearings, the right to be notified of the escape or release of a criminal from prison, and the right to a speedy trial and prompt disposition, free from unreasonable delay. In addition, our bill enhances victims' rights to obtain restitution, to be notified and heard at sentencing, and to be present at trial. 
   The rights established by our bill will fill the existing gaps in federal criminal law and will be a major step toward ensuring that victims of crime receive appropriate and sensitive treatment. Our bill will achieve these goals in a way that does not interfere with the efforts of the States to protect victims in ways appropriate to each State's unique needs. 
   Our bill also contains measures to ensure that victims receive the counseling, information, and assistance they need in order to participate in the criminal justice process to the maximum extent possible. It creates and funds additional federal victim assistance personnel. It authorizes the use of funds to establish effective pilot programs. It provides funds for increased training of state and local law enforcement agencies and court personnel, to enable them to respond effectively to the needs of victims and to notify them of important dates and developments. Our bill also establishes ombudsman programs to ensure that victims are given unbiased information about navigating the criminal justice process. To make all of these improvements possible, the proposed statute also improves federal financial support for victim assistance and compensation. 
   There is no need to amend the constitution to achieve these important goals. In my view, when it is not necessary to amend the constitution to achieve a particular goal, it is necessary not to amend it. That is why I ask my colleagues to establish effective and enforceable rights for victims of crime by supporting the Crime Victims Assistance Act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since its enactment in 1938, the Fair Labor Standards Act has played a fundamental role in ensuring a fairer standard of living for all American workers. The act created basic rights for workers by establishing a federal minimum wage, a 40 hour work week and overtime pay for additional hours. It also protects children from abusive working conditions and helps ensure that women and men receive equal pay. Throughout its existence, the act has been indispensable in improving the standard of living for vast numbers of Americans. 
   The Department of Labor has effectively carried out its responsibility to interpret the law with this purpose in mind. Given the high value of the act in protecting workers' rights to a fair workplace, Congress must remain vigilant to ensure that any changes in this important law do not undermine the wage and hour protections guaranteed to workers under the act. 
   I support the current bill because it helps ensure that employers cannot misuse the act as an excuse to exclude rank and file workers from the stock option plans, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase plans they provide to higher paid employees. 
   I commend Senator DODD, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ENZI, and Senator MCCONNELL for developing this narrow, but important, clarification of the act. It is a needed modernization of the law, and it arose from unique circumstances. I am confident that the Secretary of Labor will promulgate regulations interpreting this bill in a way that protects the fundamental right of workers to receive overtime pay and not be forced to work overtime to participate in stock plans. It is of the utmost importance that any change in the act serves to strengthen the protections for workers, not weaken them.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support legislation which would provide  tax relief to the working families who are currently paying a marriage penalty. Such a penalty is unfair and should be eliminated. However, I do not support the proposal the Republicans have brought to the floor. 
   While its sponsors claim the purpose of the bill is to provide a marriage penalty relief, that is not its real purpose. In fact, only 42 percent of the tax benefits contained in the legislation go to couples currently subject to a marriage penalty. The majority of the tax benefits would actually go to couples who are already receiving a marriage bonus and to single taxpayers. As a result, the cost of the legislation is highly inflated. It would cost $248 billion over the next 10 years. 
   As with most Republican tax breaks, the overwhelming majority of the tax benefits would go to the wealthiest taxpayers. This bill is designed to give more than 78 percent of the total tax savings to the wealthiest 20 percent of the taxpayers. It is, in reality, the latest ploy in the Republican scheme to spend the entire surplus on tax cuts which would disproportionately benefit the richest taxpayers. That is not what the American people mean when they ask for relief from the marriage penalty. With this bill, the Republicans have deliberately distorted the legitimate concerns of married couples for tax fairness. 
   All married couples do not pay a marriage penalty. In fact, a larger percentage of couples receive a marriage bonus than pay a marriage penalty. The only couples who pay a penalty are those families in which both spouses work and have relatively equivalent incomes. They deserve relief from this inequity, and they deserve it now. 
   We can provide relief to the overwhelming majority of the couples simply and at a modest cost. That is what the Senate should do. Instead, the Republicans have insisted on greatly inflating the cost of the bill by adding extraneous tax breaks primarily benefiting the wealthiest taxpayers. 
   A plan that would eliminate the marriage penalty for the overwhelming majority of married couples could easily be designed and cost less than $100 billion over 10 years. The House Democrats offered such a plan when they debated this issue in February. The amendment which Senator BAYH intends to offer to this bill would also accomplish that goal. If the real purpose of the legislation is to eliminate the marriage penalty for those working families who actually pay a penalty under current law, it can be accomplished at a reasonable cost. 
   The problem we have consistently faced is that our Republican colleagues insist on using marriage penalty relief as a subterfuge to enact large tax breaks unrelated to relieving the marriage penalty and heavily weighted to the wealthiest taxpayers. The House Republicans put forward a bill which would cost $182 billion over 10 years and give less than half the tax benefits to people who pay a marriage penalty. That was not enough for the Senate Republicans. They raised the cost to $248 billion over 10 years. A substantial majority, 58 percent of the tax breaks in the Senate bill, would go to taxpayers who do not pay a marriage penalty. 
   Nor is this the only tax bill the Republicans have brought to the floor this year. They attached tax cuts to the minimum wage bill in the House of close to $123 billion and tax cuts to the bankruptcy bill in the Senate of almost $100 billion. They have sought to pass tax cuts of $23 billion to subsidize private school tuition and reduce the inheritance tax paid by multimillionaires. Not including the cost of this bill, the Republicans in the House and Senate have already passed tax cuts that would consume $443 billion over the next 10 years. The result of this tax cut frenzy is to crowd out necessary spending on the priorities which the American people care most about--education, prescription drugs for senior citizens, health care for uninsured families, strengthening Medicare and Social Security for future generations. 
   Finally, I want to bring another matter to the attention of the Senate. It is another marriage penalty, and that is, there are 13 States--which represent 22 percent of the American people--that have laws saying when one gets married, they lose the coverage under Medicaid they might otherwise have if they were single. For example, in the State of Maine, one is eligible as a single person for Medicaid up to $14,000, but if it is a couple, each earning $7,000 so the family income is $14,000, neither of them gets Medicaid coverage. That is true in 13 States. 
   If we are going to take a look at the marriage penalty for the wealthier individuals in this country, what about the marriage penalty for some of the working poor who are trying to make ends meet? That is an issue I hope to have an opportunity to debate when we get into a discussion of the proposal put forward by the Democratic leader.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join Senators JEFFORDS, HARKIN and ROCKEFELLER in calling on the Senate to strengthen our Nation's pension laws. This amendment reaffirms the value of defined benefit pension plans for workers, and our commitment to protecting workers from age discrimination in the provision of pension benefits. 
   Too many American workers have discovered that the pension promises made to them by their employers are virtually worthless. It is disturbing in this period of unprecedented economic prosperity and rising profits that major corporations are shortchanging their older and longer serving workers. These companies have changed the rules unfairly, by converting traditional defined benefit pension plans to so-called ``cash balance'' plans. 
   Companies have made these conversions quietly, without informing workers of the impact of the changes on their retirement security. When workers ask for an explanation, all too often they are given devious responses. Some employers have done the right thing and allowed older and longer service workers to remain covered under the original plan, but other employers have not. 
   In addition, many cash balance plans deny benefits to older workers for a period of time after the conversion, using  a discriminatory practice known as ``wear away.'' This practice prevents older and longer service workers from earning new benefits under the cash-balance plan until that benefit exceeds the original promised benefit. We must end the practice of wear away immediately. 
   Our amendment calls on Congress to enact legislation this year requiring, at a minimum, that employers provide workers with adequate notice of a change in their pension plan that reduces future benefits. It also prohibits the discriminatory practice of wear away. Our amendment makes clear that Congress will take whatever action is necessary to assure older workers that they will not be short-changed when it comes to their retirement security. It is long past time for Congress to act and protect our older and longer service workers. We value older workers in America--we don't ``wear them away.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators HELMS and  LAUTENBERG in submitting this resolution on the travel ban and other U.S. restrictions on Libya. 
   At the end of March, a team of State Department officials visited Libya as part of a review of the ban that has been in effect since 1981 on U.S. travel to Libya. State Department officials were in Libya for 26 hours, visiting hotels and other sites. Based on the findings of this delegation, the State Department is preparing a recommendation for the Secretary of State to help her determine whether there is still ``imminent danger to ..... the physical safety of United States travellers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban. 
   Because of the travel ban, American citizens can travel to Libya only if they obtain a license from the Department of the Treasury. In addition, the State Department must first validate a passport for travel to Libya. 
   The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, just as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in The Netherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed as a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi. 
   After State Department announced that it would send this consular team to Libya, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan official as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. team was a ``step in the right direction.'' The official said the visit was a sign that ``the international community was convinced that Libya's foreign policy position was not wrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's relations with the world.'' 
   Libya's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation said the visit demonstrated that the Administration ``has realized the importance of Libya'' and that Libya considers ``that the negative chapter in our relations is over.'' 
   Libya's Secretary for African Unity told reporters that the visit to Libya by U.S. officials was a welcome step and that `` ..... we welcome the normalization between the two countries.'' 
   The good will gesture was certainly not lost on Colonel Qadhafi, who said on April 4, when asked about a possible warming of relations with the 
   United States: ``I think America has reviewed its policy toward Libya and discovered that it is wrong ..... it is a good time for America to change its policy toward Libya.'' 
   I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this decision. They are united in their belief that the U.S. delegation should not have been sent to Libya and that it would be a serious mistake to lift the travel ban before justice is served. The families want to know why the Secretary of State made this friendly overture to Colonel Qadhafi now--just six weeks before the trial in the Netherlands begins. They question how much information the State Department was able to obtain by spending only 26 hours in Libya. They wonder why the State Department could not continue to use the same sources of information it has been using for many years to make a determination about the travel ban. 
   There is no reason to believe that the situation in Libya has changed since November 1999, when the travel ban was last extended on the basis of imminent danger to American citizens. Indeed, in January 2000 President Clinton cited Libya's support for terrorist activities and its non-compliance with UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 863 as actions and policies that ``pose a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and vital foreign policy interest of the United States.'' 
   These American families have waited for justice for eleven long years. They felt betrayed by the decision to send the consular delegation to Libya. They have watched with dismay as our close ally, Great Britain, has moved to reestablish diplomatic relations with Libya, before justice is served for the British citizens killed in the terrorist bombing. The State Department denies it, but the families are concerned that the visit signals a change in U.S. policy, undermines U.S. sanctions, and calls into question the Administration's commitment to vigorously enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. That Act requires the United States to impose sanctions on foreign companies which invest more than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until Libya complies with the conditions specified by the U.N. Security Council in its resolutions. 
   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, was one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. Other American citizens are waiting for justice in other cases against Libya as well. Libya is also accused in the 1986 La Belle discotheque bombing in Germany, which resulted in the deaths of two United States servicemen. The trial against five individuals implicated began in December of 1997 and is ongoing. In March 1999, six Libyan intelligence agents, including Colonel Qadhafi's brother-in-law, were convicted in absentia by a French court for the bombing of UTA Flight 772, which resulted in the deaths of 171 people, including seven Americans. A civil suit against Colonel Qadhafi based on that bombing is pending in France. 
   The State Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now and it should not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The State Department's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport requests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can continue to do so for the foreseeable future. 
   The resolution we are submitting today states the sense of the Senate that Libya's refusal to accept responsibility for its role in terrorist attacks against United States citizens suggests that the imminent danger to the physical safety of United States travelers continues. It calls on the Administration to consult fully with the U.S. Congress in considering policy toward Libya. It states that the travel ban and all other U.S. restrictions on Libya should not be eased until all cases of American victims of Libyan terrorism have been resolved and the government of Libya has cooperated fully in bringing the perpetrators to justice.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a few days ago, the president of the Kennedy Center, Lawrence J. Wilker, announced that he will resign his position at the Center at the end of this year. He plans to launch a new Internet entertainment company, and I know that he will bring the same ability, energy, and enthusiasm to that initiative as he brought to the Kennedy Center. 
   Larry Wilker has been a superb president for the Kennedy Center over the past decade. He has made outstanding improvements in the Center's facilities and its programming. He has led the Center effectively during a time of significant growth and expansion. One of his most impressive achievements has been the creation of the Millennium Stage, which offers free performances every afternoon at the Center. 
   I know that Larry Wilker will continue to be a leader in the national performing arts community and an enduring part of the Kennedy Center, and I wish him well in his important and pioneering new undertaking.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Teaching Hospital Preservation Act that we are introducing today will restore much-needed support for the nation's teaching hospitals by freezing the Medicare Indirect Medical Education adjustment at 6.5 percent. The so-called IME payments under Medicare go to teaching hospitals to help defray their added costs of caring for the sickest patients, training physicians, and providing an environment in which clinical research can flourish. Under current law, the IME payments will be reduced from their current level of 6.5 percent to 6.25 percent for fiscal year 2001 and 5.5 percent for fiscal year 2002 and future years. If these reductions take place, they will have a devastating impact on the nation's teaching hospitals. 
   Enactment of this relief is essential to complete the task we began last year in the Balanced Budget Restoration Act of 1999. Across the country, teaching hospitals continue to suffer severe financial losses. According to the Association of American Medical Colleges, even with enactment of last year's measure, the typical teaching hospital will still lose more that $40 million in Medicare payments between 1998 and 2002. At the most recent meeting of the Medicare Payment Advisory Committee, it was reported that the margins of major teaching hospitals dropped from 5.1 percent in 1997 to 2.3 percent in 1998. Notwithstanding major efforts by the leadership of this institutions to reduce their costs, there is every reason to believe this ominous trend is continuing. 
   In Boston, teaching hospitals lost $22 million just in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, and Boston is far from alone. The financial problems of the nation's pre-eminent teaching hospitals around the country are well-known. Cutbacks in care for patients, research, and teaching have already been implemented by many of these respected institutions, and are being considered by many others. These teaching hospitals are the backbone of our health care system, and Congress should not stand silent in the face of these distressing developments. 
   Teaching hospitals are facing substantially higher costs for drugs, labor, medical devices and new technologies. The tight labor market is pushing wages higher and higher. Despite these heavy financial pressures. Medicare is scheduled to impose serious cutbacks in its reimbursements to teaching hospitals. The result of this shortfall may well be disastrous for these indispensable institutions. 
   A significant part of the problem was caused by the excessive and unintended Medicare reductions required by the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. Last year's Balanced Budget Restoration Act delayed reductions in the IME adjustment. That relief was an important first step, but it was only a first step. The legislation we are introducing today will ensure that Medicare support for teaching hospitals remains at its current level. 
   The pre-eminence of American academic medicine is at stake. The nation's teaching hospitals provide the highest quality health care to the sickest patients. They ensure the highest quality physicians training, and an unparalleled research capability. In addition, teaching hospitals are the safety net for 44 percent of the uninsured, despite comprising only 6 percent of all hospitals. They perform a vast array of services to their communities, from neighborhood health programs to drug treatment programs to well baby clinics. All of these programs are in jeopardy if the currently scheduled cutbacks take place. We cannot afford to let teaching hospitals fail. I urge my colleagues to join us in enacting this important bill this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I offer this on behalf of myself, Senator FEINGOLD, our education committee, Senator SARBANES, and others; and Senator JEFFORDS, Senator COLLINS, and Senator CHAFEE. This is a bipartisan amendment. It is a very simple amendment. At the present time, we are providing $3,300 on the Pell grants. The Budget Committee has raised that up to $3,500. This amendment would make it $3,700. It costs $1.4 billion a year. This amendment applies for 5 years. 
   This chart indicates what the Pell grant has meant to education for children. Back in the 1970s it paid effectively 90 percent of the public education for children. It has gone down, now, to about 40 percent for public education--20 percent in private colleges. Ninety percent of the children who are getting Pell grants have incomes of $9,000 or less. 
   Finally, for families that have incomes of $74,000, 90 percent of their children are going on to higher education, whether public education or private education. For families with $25,000, it is 26 percent. Talk about a digital divide, this is growing and growing and growing. 
   The money in this amendment all goes to tuition; nothing for rooms, nothing for food, nothing for additional services.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment by Senator JEFFORDS and Senator DODD to increase funding for IDEA by $2 billion a year for the next five years.  
   For 22 years, IDEA has brought hope to young persons with disabilities that they too can learn, and that their learning will enable them to become independent and productive citizens and live fulfilling lives. For millions of children with disabilities, IDEA has meant the difference between dependence and independence, between lost potential and productive careers. 
   In 1975, 4 million handicapped children did not receive the help they needed to be successful in school. Few disabled preschoolers received services, and 1 million children with disabilities were excluded from public school. Now, IDEA serves 5.4 million children with disabilities from birth through age 21. Every state in the nation offers public education and early intervention services for children with disabilities. 
   Today, fewer than 6,000 disabled children are living in institutional settings away from their families, compared to 95,000 children in 1969. We are keeping families together, and reducing the cost to the taxpayers of paying for institutional care, which averages $50,00 a child each year. 
   The number of disabled students completing high school with a diploma or certificates has increased by 10% in the last decade. The number of students with disabilities entering higher education has more than tripled since the implementation of IDEA. 
   Most important, 57% of disabled youth are competitively employed within five years of leaving school today, compared to an employment rate of only 25% for disabled adults who have not benefited from IDEA. 
   These accomplishments do not come without financial costs. It is time for Congress to meet its commitment to help schools provide the services and support that give children with special needs the educational opportunities to pursue their dreams. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senators STEVENS, DODD, JEFFORDS, BOND, KERRY, COCHRAN, MURRAY, GORDON SMITH, LAUTENBERG, CHAFEE, DURBIN, REED, WARNER, MURKOWSKI, and BINGAMAN for their leadership on this amendment to ensure that children begin school ready to learn. 
   The amendment establishes a reserve fund of $8.5 billion over the next five years to support local investment in early learning and school readiness initiatives for children from birth through age six. Over the past decade medical research has confirmed that stimulation is essential for proper brain development in infants and toddlers. The building blocks for later learning begin to develop during these early years. Stimulation through reading, visual and vocal interaction with adults, and group activities with other children is essential to develop the connection within the brain that result in effective educational, social, and motor skills for each child. 
   It is long past time to put these medical discoveries into practice. Many parents are well aware of the stimulation needed by their infants and toddlers, and they amply provide it. But many working parents face barriers, including their own lack of education and their inability to obtain quality child care for their children. As a result, millions of children never get the chance to reach their full potential. This is a tragedy for the child, and an unacceptable price for the nation to pay, since many of society's most complex and costly long-run problems can be avoided by paying greater attention to children early in their lives. 
   To deal with these problems more effectively, Senators STEVENS, JEFFORDS, DODD, and I have taken a number of steps to improve early learning. First, we need to fill in the gaps in existing programs, and make activities such as childhood literacy training, parenting support, and parenting education more widely available to all parents who seek these services. Second, we need to support local councils that can assess early learning needs of communities and allocate resources to meet those needs. These councils are already formed in some states. In Massachusetts, it is known as the Massachusetts Community Partnerships for Children. Our amendment brings us closer to enabling such councils to direct resources where they are needed most. 
   Finally, we need to expand access to effective programs like Head Start. More parents are satisfied with Heard Start than any other government program, but only two in five eligible children have access to Head Start today. 
   Today's Senate action is a significant step forward for the nation on this fundamental issue. It shows what can be accomplished when we reach across party lines and work together for educational goals that are clearly in the country's best interest. Early learning should be a high priority for this Congress. It is pro-family and pro-work, and it is one of the best long-term investments we can make in the country's future security and prosperity. 
   The $8.5 billion in additional resources proposed by today's budget amendment will make it much easier to enable more children to obtain the services they need in the years ahead. I look forward to the day when every child begins school ready to learn, and I will continue working to pass legislation that makes this day come as soon as possible.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have tried for over the last 2 years to get an increase in the minimum wage for those Americans who are at the lowest rung of the economic ladder and who have not had any pay increase. This chart shows what has happened to the minimum wage since the 1960s. As the minimum wage has been going down, the poverty line has been going up. There are more Americans working harder today who are living in poverty than at any time in the history of the country. 
   Why is this an important issue? Close to 60 percent of the minimum-wage workers are women. One-third of those workers have children, so it is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue because over one-third of minimum-wage workers are men and women of color. It is fundamentally an issue of fairness. 
   I think in this country individuals who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year should not live in poverty. We are asking for the opportunity to have a vote on an increase in the minimum wage. Since the minimum wage was last increased, those workers have lost the equivalent of $500 in purchasing power. It is time that the Senate go on record in support of increasing the minimum wage.

According to CBO, it is $100 billion in unpaid tax cuts. We are prepared to work with our friends on the other side for a reasonable proposal to offset any potential kinds of challenges for small business. This is $100 billion in tax cuts over 10 years.

   I have every intention of continuing to offer these amendments until we get a vote on the amendment. I think we are entitled to that. This has been an issue we have been raising for over 2 years. We have effectively been denied that opportunity. 
   During that period of time, those at the lowest end of the economic ladder have been falling further and further behind. Six months ago was the last increase we have had on the minimum wage. Since that time, the purchasing power of these men and women has fallen $500. It will continue to do so unless we take action. 
   Who are the minimum-wage workers? They are workers working in nursing homes; they are working in childcare centers; they are working with teachers. Those are hard-working people. They are entitled to this body going on record.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, disadvantaged communities need more help to ensure that all public schools give children a good education. Increased funding for Title I sends a strong signal that we will increase support for low-achieving children attending schools with high concentrations of poor students. 
   Nationwide, Title I reaches more than 50,000 schools in over 13,000 school districts. It serves over 11 million students. Approximately 99% of Title I dollars go to local school districts. In addition, Title I is much more targeted to high-poverty districts than state and local funds. 
   Title I is working effectively in schools. It has contributed to the rapid development of challenging state standards that apply to all students in Title I schools. Teachers are using these standards to guide instruction. States that have implemented high standards and assessments consistent with Title I show increased achievement levels in high-poverty schools. It is clear that Title I is driving higher standards in poor districts and schools. 
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress has shown significant increases in math scores in the 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. Reading and math performance among nine-year-olds in high-poverty public schools and among the lowest-achieving fourth-graders has improved significantly. 
   The achievement gap between minority students and white students has narrowed since 1982, one of the greatest gains in science were made by black and Hispanic students. 
   Average SAT scores--math and verbal--were higher in 1999 than the averages for either 1983 or 1989. These improvements have come at the same time that the proportion of test-takers with a native language other than English has been increasing (to 8 percent in 1999). Test results are continuing a 10-year trend of stable or increasing scores. At the same time, record numbers of students are taking the tests. 
   More than 80 percent of poor school districts, and almost half of all districts nationwide, report that Title I is ``driving standards-based reform in the district as a whole.'' In addition, Title I funds, as well as all federal education funds, are more targeted to high-poverty districts than state and local funds. Title I now supports 95% of the highest-poverty schools and is helping these schools to dramatically improve student performance. 
   In Atlanta, Georgia, Burgess Elementary School is a Title I school that serves 430 students. 99% of them are black, and more than 80% are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. In 1998, 64% of students performed above the national norm in reading, an increase of 35% over 1995. 72% scored above the national norm in math, an increase of 38% over 1995. 
   In Baltimore County, Maryland, all but one of the 19 Title I schools showed increased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The success has come from Title I support for extended year programs, implementation of effective programs in reading, and intensive professional development for teachers. 
   In Boston, the Harriet A. Baldwin School is a Title I program that serves 283 students. 93 percent of them are minorities, and 80 percent are eligible for free or reduced-price lunches. From 1996 to 1998, math and reading scores improved substantially, and are currently well above the national median and are much higher than district scores. 
   In spite of this progress, there is still a substantial achievement gap between students in the highest poverty schools and students in low-poverty schools. The time is now to build on these successes and make them available to more schools in more communities. We should increase support for Title I to show the nation that we are committed to a level playing field to help all children achieve high standards. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in 1997, as a result of a bipartisan effort, the Senate and Congress went on record to provide $24 billion, over 5 years, in a program called CHIP; that is, to try to provide health insurance for poor children. Those are above the Medicaid level. We are making progress on that. 
   This amendment says we are going to now try to provide the health insurance for the parents of those children to try to keep the families together. It amounts to $11 billion off the tax break over a 5-year period. 
   This is a family values issue to try to keep needy families together. It permits the States to make the judgment as to how it is going to be implemented. Every single State now has a CHIP program. This builds on the CHIP program. It is accepted by the States. It is virtually free from bureaucracy. It will make a major difference to 7 million parents in this country.

No man, woman, or child in America should have the quality of their health measured by the quantity of their wealth.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This year, the nation has set a new record for elementary and secondary student enrollment. The figure has reached an all-time high of 53 million students--500,000 more students than last year. 
   Serious teacher shortages are being caused by this rising student enrollment. The nation's public schools will need to hire 2.2 million teachers over the next ten years just to maintain current student teacher ratios which are already viewed as too high. The teacher shortage is being worsened by the growing number of teacher retirements, and by the fact that too many new teachers leave within the first three years of teaching, including 30-50% of teachers in urban areas. 
   The Troops to Teachers program was established in 1993 by Congress to encourage military personnel who leave the service to become public school teachers. Since its inception, over 3,000 service men and women have made the transition under this program, filling teaching positions in 48 states. This highly successful program is providing teachers in areas where educators face the greatest shortages. 
   The program has worked and has been highly successful in recruiting and retaining high quality teachers, especially in high-need subject areas and disadvantaged neighborhoods. Studies show that these service men and women who become teachers are likely to fill the most urgent current needs:  
   --29% of them are math teachers, compared to 13% of all public school teachers. 
   --29% of them are minorities, compared to 10% of all public school teachers. 
   --The overwhelming majority--90%--are male, compared to 23% of all public school teachers. 
   --24% of them are teaching in inner-city schools, compared to 16% of all public school teachers.  
   They are also highly committed, with very high retention rates. 82% of them continue in teaching beyond the first year. 
   Troops to Teachers is a program that works. California has hired nearly 300 teachers through the program, including a former Navy pilot who used to hunt submarines, but now faces almost two dozen kindergarten students. He says, ``It doesn't pay as much, but the job satisfaction is incredible.'' 
   Florida hired more than 200 teachers through the program, including a former Navy instructor who now teaches honors algebra to high school students. The students say, ``He gets all excited about this stuff. He definitely knows what he's talking about.'' Though the teacher had to take a pay cut, he said, ``I enjoy the kids, and I enjoy the school.'' 
   We need to do much more to help communities recruit qualified teachers, but Troops to Teachers is a strong step in the right direction. 
   Senator DEWINE's Sense of the Senate Amendment makes the authorization and funding of the successful Troops to Teachers program within the Department of Education a priority, and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, several weeks ago, the Treasury Department and HUD made a significant announcement on Smith and Wesson's willingness to make guns safer and keep them out of the hands of criminals. 
   Momentum is building for Congress to break the stranglehold of the National Rifle Association. It is appalling that this Republican Congress refuses to respond to the urgent need for responsible gun control. Our Republican colleagues should stop listening to the National Rifle Association and start listening to the American people. The American people and America's children are calling on Congress to move  forward on commonsense gun provisions. 
   The National Rifle Association continues to talk about Second Amendment rights. But we say what about the right to live of the 12 children a day, every day, who die because of firearms in this country? What about the right of citizens to be free from crime, when criminals can go to gun shows and purchase weapons without a background check? What about the right of law-abiding citizens to live peaceably in their neighborhoods? It is time for Congress to stop kowtowing to the NRA. It is long past time for Congress to act responsibly, and adopt sensible measures to close the loopholes in our current gun laws. 
   That means--closing the gun show loophole--requiring the sale of child safety locks with firearms--prohibiting juveniles from possessing semiautomatic assault weapons--banning imports of large capacity ammunition clips--expanding the number of cities that participate in gun tracing--giving ATF and other federal law enforcement agencies the resources they need for more effective enforcement of our gun laws. 
   Nothing we do will interfere with the rights of responsible gun owners. But, it has everything to do with the rights of men, women, and children to live peacefully in their communities. 
   Ninety percent of the American people support background checks at gun shows; 88% favor child-proofing guns. But every attempt we make to act is met by a stonewall of resistance from our Republican colleagues. And every day, we learn of more tragedies of families who lose loved ones to senseless gun violence because we fail to act. 
   Congress must end its obstruction and enact critical reforms that have been pending for too long. If this Congress won't act, the American people will elect a Congress in November that will act. 
   It has been almost a year since the tragic shooting at Columbine High School. In literally dozens of cases since then, children have brought guns to schools, and there have been at least seven school shootings since Columbine. 
   According to the Department of Education, over 6,000 students were expelled in the 1996-1997 school year for bringing guns to public schools. According to a study by the Centers for Disease Control, 8% of all students reported bringing a gun to school in a 30-day period. 
   It is time for Congress to finish the job we began last year and pass the gun control provisions in the juvenile justice legislation. Students, parents and teachers across America are waiting for our answer. 
   We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early warning signals and act before violence occurs. 
   We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from criminals and children. 
   We need to close the gun show loophole. 
   Above all, we need to require child safety locks on firearms, so that we can do all we can to prevent senseless shocking shootings like the first grade gun killing that occurred a few weeks ago in an elementary school in Michigan. 
   The Senate passed this needed legislation last year. It is time for House and Senate conferees to write the final bill and send it to the President, so that effective legislation is in place as soon as possible. 
   The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. Each new tragedy is a fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly. 
   We have a national crisis, and commonsense approaches are urgently needed. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time to act is now. There is no reason why this Congress cannot enact this needed legislation now. The citizens of this country deserve better than what this kow-tow-to-the-NRA Congress has given them so far.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, seven months have elapsed since the House of Representatives passed the bi-partisan Norwood-Dingell bill to end insurance company and HMO abuses, and more than six months have passed since House and Senate conferees were appointed to prepare the final version of this important measure. 
   Today, I am releasing a new study by the Minority Staff of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee that documents how devastating this long delay has been for millions of Americans and their families, and how urgent it is for the House-Senate conference to complete its work as soon as possible. 
   Drawing on data gathered by the University of California School of Public Health and the Harvard School of Public Health, the report documents unacceptably high numbers of patients who are denied needed care, who suffer increased pain, or whose health has seriously declined because too many HMOs and insurance companies put profits ahead of patients. 
   According to the study, 59,000 patients each day--22 million patients a year--report added pain and suffering as the result of the actions of their health plans. Large numbers of patients have specialty referrals delayed or denied. Others are forced to change doctors. Still others are forced to take prescription drugs that are different from the drugs their doctor prescribed. 
   In addition to patients' reports of significant problems as the result of actions of their health plans, thousands of physicians report seeing patients every day whose health has seriously declined as the result of abuses  such as the failure to cover recommended prescription drugs, denial of needed diagnostic tests and procedures, and unwillingness to allow referrals for specialty care. 
   This study provides powerful new evidence of the need for Congress to move promptly to pass a strong Patient's Bill of Rights. Millions of families are suffering because of the failure of Congress to act. Families across America deserve protection, and it is time for Congress to fulfill its responsibility and see that they get it.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this month marks the 16th annual observance of Tuftonia's Week by Tufts University in Medford, Massachusetts. As part of this impressive celebration, large numbers of the 80,000-plus Tufts alumni from around the world return to honor their outstanding university. We are fortunate to have many distinguished Tufts alumni working on Capitol Hill, so many of us are well aware of the high quality of these graduates. 
   This celebration always has special meaning for me. My daughter, Kara, is a graduate of Tufts, and I've also worked closely with many Tufts scholars on a wide range of public policy  issues. I am proud to count myself as a member of the Tufts family, and to add my congratulations to the official proclamations by Governors and Mayors across the country. 
   For the past 148 years, Tufts has trained many of our nation's outstanding scholars and distinguished political leaders. Tufts has provided outstanding leadership in medicine, engineering, nutrition and education. In addition to Tufts' strong academic tradition, it is a national leader in emphasizing service learning and providing opportunities for students to combine community service with their academic life. This program called ``TuftServe'' was highlighted when President Clifton held his Summit for America' Future in 1997, and it continues to be a model for the country. Campus Compact, housed at Tufts, has assisted Massachusetts colleges in participating in America Reads and America Counts, two initiatives that continue to improve the lives and futures of children in public schools. 
   I commend Tufts for the wide range of opportunities that it continues to offer to its students and alumni, and I also commend Tufts' President, John DiBiaggio, and all the members of the Tufts community for their impressive accomplishments in enhancing education and contributing so effectively to Massachusetts, the nation, and the world.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator DANIEL AKAKA, Senator DANIEL INOUYE, Senator TED STEVENS, and I, along with 24 other Senators, are introducing a Senate Joint Resolution to designate May 25, 2000, as a national Day of Honor for minority veterans of World War II. Representative SHEILA JACKSON-LEE of Texas is introducing an identical resolution in the House of Representatives. 
   Forty-five years ago, the bloodiest war in our history came to an end and millions of American service men and women returned to the United States to rebuild their lives after fighting so courageously and successfully to defend our country. 
   These brave veterans included large numbers of minorities. More than 1.2 million African Americans, more than 300,000 Hispanic Americans, more than 50,000 Asian Americans, more than 20,000 Native Americans, more than 6,000 Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, and more than 3,000 Native Alaskans risked their lives to preserve our democracy. 
   On land, sea and air, far from their homes, they fought brilliantly to defeat fascism and protect our freedom. And large numbers of them did so in spite of the racism and injustice they had suffered in our society, and even in their military service. 
   Too often, when they returned to America and raised the question of freedom and equal justice here at home, the answer came back, ``no.'' Too often, when fundamental issues of equality and respect of their service in the war arose, Jim Crow and racial discrimination replied with a resounding ``no.'' 
   Even during the war itself, these brave men and women in uniform had faced racial discrimination and violent and cruel treatment from their fellow citizens--and often from their fellow American service men and women. Even here on American soil during the war, German prisoners of war were allowed to go to places in the United States where black Americans were not allowed to go. 
   Last December, President Clinton dealt at long last with one example of these injustices when he pardoned Freddie Meeks, one of 50 African-American sailors who were convicted of mutiny and sentenced to prison and hard labor in 1944 for refusing to continue loading ammunition after a deadly explosion at the Port Chicago naval facility new San Francisco. That explosion of 10,000 tons of ammunition at the loading dock resulted in the deaths of 320 persons, two-thirds of whom were black. 
   As President Clinton noted, Meeks had participated in the ``extraordinarily difficult job of picking up human remains'' following the blast. White sailors were given 30-day leaves after the blast, but black sailors were ordered back to work. Meeks and 257 others were court-martialed after they refused to continue loading the ammunitions, because the order was so blatantly racist and the danger was so great. The pardon, granted by the President, was eminently justified. The Navy had agreed in a 1994 review of the case that the sailors had been victims of racial discrimination, but it had not overturned their convictions. 
   Historians feel that the Port Chicago case was a major factor in convincing President Harry Truman to issue his famous Executive order in 1948, banning segregation in the armed forces. 
   Japanese Americans were also subjected to shameful discrimination during the war. The Supreme Court upheld the internment of tens of thousands of U.S. citizens of Japanese ancestry during the war, because the government was fearful that their allegiance might to be to Japan. In recent years, reparations have been paid as amends for these shameful deeds against Japanese Americans, but no reparations can ever fully compensate for such gross violations of human liberties. 
   As a nation, we have long since recognized the unfair treatment of minorities as a travesty of justice. The landmark decisions of the Supreme Court and the enactment of fundamental civil rights laws by Congress over the past half century have remedied the worst of these injustices and made our nation a freer and fairer land. But we have yet to give adequate recognition to the service, struggles and sacrifices of these brave Americans who fought so valiantly in World War II for our future. 
   Veterans of that war are now dying at a rate of more than 1,000 a day. It is especially important, therefore, for Congress and the Administration to do their part now to pay tribute to these men and women who served so valiantly in that conflict. This Day of Honor Resolution is part of The Day of Honor Celebration being planned for communities across the country, which is being organized by the Massachusetts-based Day of Honor 2000 Project. Our goal is that the nation will have an opportunity to pause on that day to express our gratitude to the veterans of all minority groups who served the nation so well. 
   Included in that group of honored veterans are two of our outstanding colleagues in the Senate, Senator AKAKA of Hawaii and Senator INOUYE of Hawaii, and my former colleague from  Massachusetts, Senator Edward W. Brooke. Senator INOUYE and Senator Brooke both speak eloquently and passionately of their World War II experiences in the film, ``The Invisible Soldiers: Unheard Voices,'' which is a part of the Day of Honor events in local communities. 
   By recognizing May 25th as a national Day of Honor in tribute to these extraordinary men and women, we can help to remedy the many wrongs inflicted on them in years gone by, and we can take another step toward true justice in this country. These men and women are part of what has been called America's greatest generation. In a very real sense, we owe them our liberty today and we shall never ever forget them. 
   I urge all members of the Senate to join in sponsoring this resolution.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express appreciation to Senator ROBB for his leadership in bringing the Senate to where we are this morning with an opportunity to vote at 11 o'clock on whether we will put the seniors in this country ahead of an unwise tax cut at this time. 
   A budget is about national priorities. This amendment says to the American people that prescription drug coverage under Medicare is as high a priority for the Senate as it is for the American people. This amendment says health care for the elderly is more important than tax cuts for the wealthy. 
   Without this amendment, this Republican budget resolution has its priorities backwards. It says the first priority is tax cuts. 
   Yesterday, my friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and I engaged in a discussion of this point. I asked the chairman if there was any guarantee in the budget instructions that we will have prescription drugs on the floor by September 31, which is effectively the last week of Congress. This is what my honorable friend said: No, there is no guarantee. 
   He went on to say that under the resolution a prescription drug bill could be brought to the floor without a budget point of order being lodged against it after September 1. 
   That is an empty promise. Such a bill would still be subject to a filibuster. It would still require 60 votes to even get to the floor if any Senator objected to its consideration. It would still have to be called up by the majority leader or offered as an amendment if there was a suitable vehicle. If by some miracle it did get to the floor, an unlimited number of amendments could be offered, and it would still be subject to a number of restrictions that I will discuss in a moment. 
   Compare that to the tax bill. It is required to be reported by the Senate Finance Committee no later than September 22--not permitted, required. 
   It cannot be filibustered under Senate rules. Debate is limited, in terms of the total hours, to 50 hours. It requires only 50 votes to pass. 
   Of course, we know the majority party is absolutely committed to pass a tax bill, but this budget resolution makes it abundantly clear there is no similar commitment to Medicare drug coverage. It is that plain and simple. There are two different standards, make no mistake about it--one standard for the tax, and an entirely different one for prescription drugs. I daresay the one on the prescription drugs is illustrated by the language of the resolution itself. It says that, in the Senate, the budgetary limits may be adjusted and allocated and may be revised by legislation reported by the Committee on Finance to provide a prescription drug benefit. ``May be'' is optional. That is different from where it says the Senate Finance Committee shall report to the Senate on the tax bill. 
   So we have not only the requirements that it ``may be'' rather than ``shall'' with regard to prescription drugs, but we have the whole procedure in the Senate that will permit filibusters in bringing it up, in debating it on the floor of the Senate. It will require 60 votes to be able to get to a final resolution as compared to 50 votes for the tax bill. That is dramatically different. 
   What we are saying with the Robb amendment is let us pass the prescription drug bill first and then consider the tax cut afterwards. 
   In the remaining time, I want to mention one additional item. This particular prescription drug proposal, as I mentioned, is a 3-year proposal, even if they are able to jump through the hoops that I have mentioned. Let's say we are able to consider the bill; let's say we are able to get the majority leader to call it up. It is very difficult to get any measure that we can amend, as we have seen over the course of this time, but let's say we get the majority leader to call it up. And let's say we have the 60 votes to get cloture. It is only for 3 years. Beyond that, you only get a continuation of that program if we find the solvency of the Medicare fund, and there is going to be a complete revamping of the Medicare program without using any general funds in order to stabilize the Medicare system. Here we find, again, the conditions that have to be realized before we are able to extend it. 
   The tax cut is permanent. Do we understand? The tax cut is permanent. It is virtually automatic. Once this bill passes, there will be a requirement that the tax bill be on the floor of the Senate in September. But this prescription drug proposal has to jump through all the hoops for the first 3 years, and even if we jump through the hoops for the first 3 years, we have to go back through the hoops over the remaining 2 years. It is not permanent as is the tax bill. 
   Finally, I want to once again review about whom we are talking and what the costs are in terms of the prescription drugs. Yesterday I tried to point out, as has been mentioned here, a third of American seniors do not have any coverage and another third are losing it dramatically. In the last 3 years, we have seen a 25-percent drop in coverage. If you take the drops in 1998 and 1999, it shows it is going right on down, and the costs of Medigap are going through the ceiling. The HMOs are setting limits that make it 
   difficult if not virtually impossible for senior citizens to get the protections they earned. 
   Who are these senior citizens? Look at this chart here and we see what the income is for senior citizens, the retirees, the men and women who fought in the World Wars, brought this country out of the Depression, and have made it the great Nation it is. Mr. President, 57 percent of them have incomes below $15,000; 21 percent below $25,000. That is almost 80 percent of our senior citizens, those with incomes below $25,000. Then it continues on with only 7 percent at $50,000 or over. Many would say that is just middle income. Certainly, if you have some children at school, $50,000 is considered to be middle income. We are talking about individuals who are hard pressed. These are men and women who made the country and now are dependent upon these prescription drugs in order to be able to survive. 
   Finally, we see in this chart what it is costing these elderly citizens. For so many of the moderate-income beneficiaries, typical drug costs versus their income--when you look at about 150 percent of poverty, that is almost the median income for senior citizens in this country. Look at this chart of what it costs for these routine illnesses and sicknesses of our elderly people. Every elderly person either is in danger of, or fears, or has osteoporosis and heart trouble, high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat----

   Mr. KENNEDY. High blood pressure, heart disease. This is the typical cost in 1 year. This is the percent of their income they are paying: 20 percent, 26 percent, 31 percent, 40 percent, 240 percent of their income. 
   This is just for prescription drugs. This is not for any other medical expenses. That is more than they are spending, in many instances, for their rent, their food, their clothing, and their other necessities. 
   As we see this issue, there is nothing more important--preserving our Social Security and preserving Medicare--than prescription drug protection for senior citizens. I believe we ought to be able to shape a program that will be universal, that will have the catastrophic as well as the basic, and that will be affordable for individuals as well as the Federal Government. 
   What we are saying is let's debate that issue. Let's have an opportunity for the Senate to take action on that issue prior to the time we go to these massive tax breaks. That is what this Robb amendment is all about, putting our seniors first. I hope our colleagues will join in supporting it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to get back to the Bingaman amendment, I will take a few moments of the Senate's time to spell out where we are today in the area of education. I think most Americans believe there ought to be a partnership between the Federal Government, the States, and local communities. Most parents want to make sure their children are advanced in terms of academic achievement and accomplishment. Most Americans want to see opportunities for continued education available to their children. Most Americans understand and support programs that will assist gifted and talented needy children who want to continue their education by getting some help to further their education. 
   It is important, as we are considering the budget amendment of Senator BINGAMAN, that we look over exactly where we are and examine what has been the record of the Republican leadership on the help and assistance to education in recent years.  
   The 2001 GOP budget resolution, I believe, deserves a failing grade on education. It is anti-education, it is anti-children, and it is anti-family. The Republicans claim their budget makes a substantial investment in education, but, as we have had to do every year since the GOP took the majority in Congress in 1995, we must be equally vigilant of Republicans when it comes to education funding. Over and over, we have heard their rhetoric, but the reality is just the opposite. They say they want to invest in education, but their record shows they won't and don't. Year after year it is the same story. 
   If we look back at the contrast between 1980 and 1999, the Federal share of education funding has declined. This demonstrates what percent of the Federal budget was going for elementary and secondary education: 11.9 percent in 1980; 7.7 percent in 1999. In higher education, it was 15.4 percent, and now we are down to 10.7 percent. This is what we have had over the last few years: a major withdrawal of Federal participation in the area of aid to both elementary-secondary as well as higher education. 
   Having seen the percentage of our budget allocated to education, look at what has happened to the enrollment in K through 12. In 1990, 46.4 million students were enrolled in school. We are up to 54.4 million and continuing to rise. We have seen this incredible expansion of the number of children attending K through 12, increasing pressures on local communities, increasing pressures on the State, and increasing pressures, obviously, if we are going to meet our responsibility. The total number of enrollment has been growing steadily--every community in this country can tell us that. Talk to the school boards, talk to the parents, talk to the teachers. However, our percent of GNP is decreasing in education. 
   Look what is happening in higher education, the millions of Americans who are attending colleges and universities across this country. It has gone from 12.2 million in 1985 up to an estimated 15.6 million in 2005. An increase in the total number of K through 12 students, an increase in the number of students attending higher education, and what has been the corresponding Federal response? A decline in terms of helping and assisting families across the country. 
   Let's look at the record of the Republican history of cutting education funding in appropriations bills. 
   In 1995, when the Republican leadership took control of the House and the Senate, we had a rescission. The money had already been appropriated. The President signed it. We had a request to cut back, but of all the different areas of the Federal Government, we only cut funding in the area of education. This is about the same time the Republican leadership wanted to abolish the Department of Education. Their 1996 budget would have reduced the Federal investment in education by one-third over 7 years, forcing deep cuts in Head Start and aid to elementary and secondary education, freezing funding for Pell grants, and slashing $10 billion from student loans. 
   Their 1997 budget would have slashed education by 20 percent over six years, causing 1.3 million students to lose Pell grants, and 344,000 children to lose Title I support. 
   Their 1999 and 2000 budgets were no different. They claimed to invent in education, but the numbers always added up to a loss for students, families, schools, and colleges across the country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Thank you. Family income should not determine whether a child goes to college--their academic achievement should be the only factor to consider. Let's promise kids a level playing field for college. Let's make sure that if a student is qualified to attend college, the money will be there so that they have the credentials that they need to more fully participate in our economy than their parents were able to participate. 
   That is a family value, Mr. President. We hear many around here talk about family values. Minimum wage is a family value--about respect for work and people having an opportunity to live with dignity. A family value is the quality to be able to succeed and continue their education at a time when it is essential if they are going to have any economic opportunities. Every year, we cut back on that opportunity and reduce and fly-specking this particular budget, and we diminish this country and the promise it has for the children of this Nation. That is what this amendment is about. The Democrats believe we ought to invest in the young people of this country. We believe that is a higher priority than tax breaks for the wealthy individuals. 
   We will have an opportunity to call the roll on that. We hope we are not going to be denied that chance by our good Republican friends. Let's have a vote on this particular measure. I stand with those who say if you deny us an opportunity with a second-degree amendment, we are coming back again and again on this budget resolution until we get a vote. 
   What are they going to be frightened of in terms of this particular amendment? We are either going to stand for working families, the children of working families, and for talented young people to be able to have their dream and be part of the American dream, or we want to nickel and dime them in order to have a tax break for wealthy individuals in this society. You couldn't have a clearer opportunity on the issue of priorities: Who is going to stand with the young people in this country today, and who is going to stand for a tax cut? 
   I hope when the time comes, this body will support the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 1/2 minutes of the 4 minutes. 
   I think this chart really tells what is happening in the area of the Federal share of education funding. It demonstrates the very significant decline from 1980 to 1999. 
   The blue on the chart indicates what was being spent in elementary and secondary education in 1980. Here we see it was 11.9 percent in elementary and secondary education and 15.4 percent in higher education. Now we are at 7.7 percent in elementary and secondary education and 10.7 percent in the area of higher education. There has been a significant decline in terms of the money that is being spent in education. 
   Look at what has happened in the area of higher education, where you see a continuing expansion of enrollment in terms of higher education. And it is going to continue. There is an important need in the area of higher education, as there is in K through 12. This chart shows the enormous rise in the total enrollment in schools all across this country. Every parent, every school board, every local group can tell you that. 
   It is against that background that we find in the President's budget there would be $6.9 billion. This increases $2.2 billion. That reflects the difference in the Bingaman amendment. We say allocate that money before we are going to have a tax break. 
   There was a question raised earlier about whether this was an accurate portrayal. I will put in the RECORD the CBO figures, as prepared by OMB, that give the whole function that lists education, training, and the Head Start programs. The bottom line shows there is $4.7 billion less, according to CBO, than the President's budget. Those are the figures. Those are the figures in the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. We believe we ought to accept the Bingaman amendment if we believe education is the first priority. This is supported by every single parent group. It is supported by all of the student associations across the country, the NEA, the AFT, the national school boards, the Council of Great City Schools, and the American Council on Education that represents all of the various universities in this country. 
   This makes sense. Which is important for the American people? Putting education ahead of tax breaks. That is what the Bingaman amendment does. We need that in order to meet our responsibility to the children in this country. I hope the Senate will accept the amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I say to my friend and colleague, who is chairman of the Budget Committee, money may not be the answer to all of the problems. Just throwing money at a particular problem isn't going to be all of the answer. But we do know that in the budget, this allocation is a clear indication of what a nation's priorities are going to be. That is the decision we are making. We say we ought to give a higher priority in the area of education than we should in tax cuts. That is what the Bingaman amendment is doing, and that is why I believe we should support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator ROBB's amendment which encourages the Senate to make school modernization a top priority by providing $1.3 billion in discretionary spending for grants and loans for the urgent repair and renovation of public elementary and secondary schools in high-need areas, and to leverage $25 billion in interest-free bonds in FY2001. 
   I also commend Senator ROBB and Senator HARKIN for their leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that is necessary to help the nation meet the critical need to modernize and rebuild crumbling and overcrowded schools.  
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school buildings are not the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in almost every community--urban, rural, or suburban. 
   In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And 36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, communities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollment has reached an all-time high this year of 53.4 million students, and will continue to grow. The number will rise by 324,000 in 2000, by 282,000 in 2001, and by 250,000 in 2002. It will continue on this upward trend in the following years. 
   For example, in Fitchburg, Massachusetts, enrollments are rising by 200 students a year. Educators there would like to reduce class size, extend special education and bilingual education programs, and hire new teachers, but the school system does not have the facilities or resources to accomplish these important goals. Instead, Fitchburg has been forced to construct four portable facilities--and a fifth is under construction--to deal with overcrowding. 
   According to a report this year, total unmet school modernization needs, including technology and infrastructure, totals $307 billion--almost three times the amount estimated in 1995. Massachusetts has $9.9 billion in unmet technology and infrastructure needs. 
   The time is now to do all we can to help rebuild and modernize public schools, so that all children can succeed in safe, technologically-equipped schools. I urge my colleagues to support Senator ROBB's amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the budget process is our chance to set  clear priorities for America's future. The budget which the Senate adopts this week will say a great deal about the values of those who vote for it. Our vote on this budget will emphasize what each of us supports. It is easy to pay lip service to meeting the Nation's unmet needs, but are we willing to allocate resources in a manner that will effectively address those needs? 
   This is a time of unparalleled prosperity. Both the CBO and OMB project budget surpluses far into the future. We will never have a greater opportunity to meet America's unmet needs than we have today--to improve the quality of education for all children; to strengthen Social Security and Medicare in a way that will provide a secure and healthy retirement for future generations, as well as a prescription drug benefit; to provide access to good health care for millions of uninsured families; to make communities safer by keeping guns out of the wrong hands, and by increasing the number of police officers on our streets; and to expand scientific research to keep America on the cutting edge of progress. 
   These are the great challenges of our time. Unfortunately, the budget presented by the Republican majority does not meet those challenges. It would actually cut spending on domestic discretionary programs by more than 6 percent, by well over $100 billion over the next 5 years. 
   These cuts are far from necessary to curb uncontrolled Federal spending or to reduce inflationary pressure on the economy. In fact, even according to the Senate Budget Committee, and its Republican staff, the amount provided for nondefense discretionary spending as a percentage of GNP is the 
   lowest share for this category since such statistics have been compiled. 
   We are already spending less on domestic discretionary programs as a percent of GNP than we ever have before. So why do our Republican friends propose more drastic reductions? The answer is, so they can provide more tax cuts for the wealthy. 
   The Republican budget would use up essentially the entire surplus with extravagant tax cuts, primarily benefiting the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society. 
   CBO projects an on-budget surplus over the next 5 years of $171 billion. The proposed GOP budget would use all but $3 billion of that total amount to finance ill-conceived tax cut schemes. They propose a minimum of $150 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years. Because those tax cuts will delay repayment of the national debt, they will cost an additional $18 billion in higher interest payments on the debt, as well. 
   Also, according to this GOP budget, if the projected surplus increases, the additional amount must be used for even larger tax cuts. The extra amount cannot be used to restore any portion of the serious cuts in domestic programs. 
   But this is only the tip of the tax-cut iceberg. 
   Last year, Republicans proposed a ten-year budget to the Congress. They did so because using 10-year numbers enabled them to emphasize how large their proposed tax cut was--$792 billion. It demonstrated how rapidly the size of their tax cut would grow--from $156 billion in the first 5 years, to $635 billion in the second 5 years--or more than four times as much revenue. 
   But the Republicans badly miscalculated the reaction of the American people. By large margins, the public agreed that the tax cut was far too large, because it would harm the economy and make it impossible for us to achieve the priority national investments needed to keep our economy and the country strong for the future. 
   The American people consistently said that Congress should use the surplus to put Social Security and Medicare on a sound financial footing, before acting on large tax cuts. In fact, the American people displayed a great deal more common sense than the Republican leadership. 
   This year, Congressional Republicans have responded to these concerns by using a 5-year projection instead of a 10-year projection. By considering only the first 5 years, they hope to conceal the true magnitude of their tax cut scheme. Rather than reducing the size of their tax cut, they are simply attempting to change the terms of the debate from 10 years to 5 years. But this Republican accounting gimmick won't work. The GOP tax cuts being proposed this year are just as large, if not larger, than last year. The Republican strategy is now to enact a stealth tax cut, concealing its true long-term cost from the public. 
   How do we know their intent, since the budget is silent beyond fiscal year 2005? Consider the tax cut plans which the Republicans have already brought to the floor this year. The House version of marriage penalty relief would cost $51 billion over the first 5 years--but rises sharply to $182 billion over 10 years. The plan produced by Senate Republicans would cost $70 billion over 5 years, and dramatically increases to $248 billion over 10 years. 
   The Senate tax package attached to the minimum wage legislation costs $18 billion over the first 5 years--but grows to $76 billion over 10 years. The annual cost by the 10th year would be nearly as large as the cost over the entire first 5 years. Similarly, the House tax package tied to the minimum wage costs $46 billion from fiscal year 2000 to 2005--but $123 billion over the full 10-year period. 
   Clearly, Republicans have not abandoned their plan for tax breaks costing far more than the country can afford. They are now spending the tax cuts over several bills, rather than combining them in one massive measure, and they're attempting to limit discussion of the budgetary impact to the first 5 years. All of these GOP tax breaks are steeply backloaded. They mushroom in cost after the first 5 years. It is a stealth tax break strategy, and it cannot stand the light of public debate. 
   Defenders of the budget resolution contend that it does not mandate the form which the tax cut will take, and it is wrong to claim that the tax cuts will disproportionately benefit the wealthiest taxpayers. That argument is truly disingenuous. It asks us to ignore the abundant evidence provided by the recent history of Republican tax cut proposals. Let us look at the record. 
   Last year, Republicans passed their ill-fated $800 billion tax cut. Under that legislation, 81 percent of the tax benefits would have gone to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers. The richest 1 percent of taxpayers--those with incomes averaging $800,000 a year--would have received 41 percent of the total tax benefits, a tax saving of as much as $46,000 a year. In stark contrast, working families comprising 60 percent of taxpayers would have shared less than 8.5 percent of the tax savings, an average tax cut of only $138 a year. 
   The Republican Presidential nominee, Governor George W. Bush, tells us his tax cut is designed to ``take down the toll booth on the road to the middle class.'' However, 73 percent of the overall tax benefits in his massive tax cut proposal--$1,8 trillion over 10 years--would go to the wealthiest 20 percent of taxpayers--37 percent of the tax breaks would go to the richest 1 percent of taxpayers. That ``toll booth'' Governor Bush loves to talk about is on a highway most Americans never travel. Just 11 percent of the tax benefits under the Bush plan would go to the less affluent 60 percent of working men and women. 
   This year, congressional Republicans have rushed to pass tax cut proposals before the budget is even adopted. These tax cuts have already consumed $115 billion of the surplus over the next 5 years and $443 billion over 10 years. The Marriage Penalty Relief Act passed by the House would cost $182 billion over 10 years, and 77.8 percent of the tax benefits would go to the most affluent 20 percent of taxpayers. The Senate version reported out of the Finance Committee last week would cost even more, $248 billion over 10 years, and gives an even larger share of the tax savaings--78.3 percent--to the wealthiest taxpayers. In both bills, the majority of the tax benefits actually go to couples who are not even paying a marriage penalty. 
   In addition, as the Republican leadership's price for allowing a modest increase in the minimum wages the House recently passed a $123 billion/10-year package of tax cuts. Eighty-nine percent of the tax breaks in that bill would go to the richest 5 percent of taxpayers, while 90 percent of taxpayers would share less than 8.5 percent of the tax benefits. 
   In light of this history, there is no doubt that the benefits of any tax cut passed by this Republican Congress will be distributed in a blatantly unfair  way, and will be designed to benefit the richest individuals and corporations in our society. 
   I support reasonable, targeted tax cuts that benefit low- and middle-income working families. But by enacting tax cuts of 
   the magnitude proposed by the Republicans, we will lose the best opportunity in decades to meet America's unmet needs. We will also forfeit the opportunity to strengthen Social Security and Medicare for future generations of retirees. Our shortsightedness will be justifiably condemned by future generations as they struggle to deal with the national needs we are so irresponsibly ignoring. 
   The larger the tax cut, the less is available for debt reduction and investments in national priorities, such as education, prescription drugs for senior citizens, and research on energy and health. 
   The Republican budget shortchanges all of these priorities. Alongside their massive tax cuts, Republicans make reductions in domestic investments that are historically unprecedented. They want to reduce discretionary spending on domestic priorities, as I mentioned, by more than 6 percent in real dollars over the next 5 years, even though our population is growing and even though present funding for many programs is already inadequate. 
   We are not talking about creating new programs or expanding existing programs. By reducing the Government's ability to maintain even the current level of services, Republicans forfeit any hope of addressing the Nation's unmet priorities. Even in this time of prosperity, we are not meeting the basic needs of large numbers of our people. 
   One in five of the Nation's children lives in poverty. Three out of four third graders read below grade level. Hunger in low-income working families has become a national crisis, with food pantries and soup kitchens unable to meet the daily needs for their services. Forty-three million people have no health insurance. That number is increasing by a million a 
   year. The number of low-income renters who pay more than half of their income for housing or who live in dilapidated housing has reached an all-time high--a searing problem in many different parts of the country. 
   One of the darker sides of this extraordinary economic boom has been the explosion of the cost of housing, the cost of rent for working families. The need for decent, affordable housing for working families is prohibitive in so many parts of America. There is very little in this budget that would address that particular need. 
   Low-income families are forced to place thousands of children in poor-quality child care while they meet their work responsibilities under the welfare reform. Every State in this country has long lines of working parents who desire to have child care for their children while they continue to work--and work hard--to provide for them. 
   This Republican budget would eliminate our ability to respond to these grave concerns. Make no mistake about it, the spending cuts that would be required to pay for these Republican tax breaks would have very real consequences for the Nation. 
   Compared to the President's budget, Republicans would force the following cuts in the next year alone: 
   20 million fewer meals delivered to ill and disabled seniors; 
   2 million fewer uninsured people with access to health care; 
   1.6 million fewer children in quality afterschool programs; 
   750,000 fewer infants receiving nutrition supplements; 
   644,000 fewer at-risk students helped with college preparation; 
   400,000 fewer families assisted with heating costs; 
   152,000 fewer State and Federal law enforcement officers; 
   120,000 fewer housing vouchers for families in poverty; 
   118,000 fewer dislocated workers helped to reenter the workforce; 
   88,000 fewer job opportunities for youth; 
   71,000 fewer college students assisted with Pell grants; 
   62,000 fewer children in Head Start; 
   30,000 fewer children immunized; 
   20,000 fewer elementary school teachers hired to reduce class sizes; and 
   11,000 fewer public schools prepared and ready for the 21st century. 
   That is what happens. We talk about a percentage of cuts in existing programs. When you apply those cuts to programs that are targeted for these needy groups, these figures that I have related indicate what the results will be. 
   These are only a small part of the opportunities that will be lost if the Republicans' risky tax cut becomes law. All nondefense discretionary programs will be cut by an average exceeding the 6 percent under the Republican plan. These cuts include meat and poultry inspection, Superfund toxic waste cleanups, National Science Foundation research, the Coast Guard, antidrug efforts, NASA, National Parks, and HIV/AIDS treatment and prevention. 
   Republicans have had a long history of cutting needed programs. They tried to abolish the Department of Education and the Department of Energy, both of which are essential for addressing today's urgent problems. Last year's GOP resolution also called for a massive cut in 
   non-defense discretionary spending. After months of fighting Democrats and further threats of government shutdowns, the Republicans gave up their attempt to slash Head Start, education, worker protection, environment, and energy programs. In the end, Democrats succeeded in protecting non-defense discretionary programs from real cuts last year. I want to put my Republican friends on notice that, just like last year, we will stay here as long as it takes this year to ensure that the reckless and heartless cuts in this budget resolution do not become law. 
   This is not the first, but the fourth, time that Republicans have tried and failed to sacrifice domestic investments for tax breaks for the wealthy. So we can anticipate how they'll attempt to avoid the consequences of their actions this time. They'll begin by promising to increase funding for a few programs. They will emphasize only these increases, while neglecting to mention the hundreds of other programs that will be drastically cut. OMB estimates that if Republicans keep their promises to increase or hold harmless programs in elementary and secondary education, the National Institutes of Health, and veterans' health, all other non-defense discretionary programs will have to be cut by 10 percent. 
   Another Republican gimmick used to conceal their harsh spending cuts is to compare spending levels without accounting for inflation. Even George W. Bush does not use this tactic. When candidate Bush claimed that spending only increased 2.5 percent during his years as Texas Governor, he accounted not only for inflation, but also for population growth over this time. If Republicans followed this reasonable accounting method, the average domestic discretionary spending cuts required by Republicans under this budget resolution would far exceed 6 percent. 
   After Republicans finish trying to convince us that their spending cuts will be painless, we can expect them once again to oppose waste, fraud, and abuse. All of us support eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse--in defense and non-defense programs alike. But the proponents of this GOP budget resolution are living in a fantasy world if they believe that preventing waste fraud, and abuse is going to make up for anything more than a small fraction of the massive cuts in their budget resolution. 
   Thanks in large part to Vice President GORE's leadership in his Reinventing Government Initiative, the federal government is leaner, more efficient, and more citizen-friendly than ever. If Republicans think they can find $105 billion over 5 years in waste, fraud, and abuse, then they should condition their tax cut on finding it. They should not condition the education or health or other priorities on abstract, unproved, and never-before-realized savings in waste, fraud, and abuse. 
   The party that gives us this budget resolution is the same party that last year brought us ``smoke and mirrors,'' and untold numbers of accounting gimmicks. The Republican bag of tricks is doubtless full again this year, and we need only stay tuned to see how they can make their numbers add up to protect their tax breaks for the rich. 
   Our Democratic alternative budget is in sharp contrast to the Republican budget 
   resolution. These two alternatives provide Americans with a clear  picture of the opposite directions that the two parties want to take the nation. 
   Rather than squandering the surplus on tax breaks for the rich, Democrats continue to strengthen the basic priorities to ensure that all Americans can reach their full potential. Not only is this the right way to treat our fellow citizens, it is the only sound policy for strengthening the nation's future and maintaining its world leadership. On investments in the nation's future, the differences between Republicans and Democrats are like night and day. 
   I believe that the American people will support our Democratic alternative, and will reject the wholesale ravaging of domestic programs proposed by the Republican budget. The Democratic alternative sets forth a more balanced and fiscally prudent way to allocate our resources. It provides more for debt reduction than the Republican budget. It does not endanger the Social Security surplus, by making unrealistic budget assumptions which cannot be met. 
   It provides substantial support to assist senior citizens with the cost of prescription drugs, and it sets a firm date for the Finance Committee to act on a prescription drug proposal. The Republican prescription drug proposal underfunded, and it is subject to so many contingencies that it is unlikely to ever materialize. 
   The Democratic budget also makes a concrete commitment to strengthening Medicare by reserving a portion of the surplus expressly for Medicare each year. The Republican budget does not. The Democratic budget fully funds the President's requests for education, health care, and other domestic priorities, and contains his proposed increase in defense spending. It does not shortchange investment in the vital domestic programs which improve the lives of millions of Americans. While accomplishing all of these goals, our Democratic plan still is able to offer $59 billion in tax cuts over the next 5 years, targeted to working families. 
   There is no reason to threaten the well-being of the American people by enacting tax cuts far larger than we can afford. The magnitude of the Republican tax cut would deprive us of the flexibility we will need, if revenues do not meet projections due to a slowing in the economy, or if emergency spending is required to address domestic and international crises. 
   The precarious balance achieved by the Republican budget depends on a reduction in the rate of spending on domestic programs which would be unprecedented. Congress will not and should not cut domestic priorities that deeply. By setting unrealistically low spending levels, the Republicans actually undermine compliance with the budget process. Just as they did last year, members on both sides of the aisle will refuse to make the deep domestic cuts called for by the Republican budget. If the surplus has already been used for excessive tax cuts, revenues will not be there to restore funding for these urgent domestic programs. 
   This type of irresponsible budget also jeopardizes the Social Security surplus. Both parties have pledged to use the Social Security surplus solely to meet Social Security's future needs. That is the right thing to do. But, as the events of last year amply demonstrate, the Social Security surplus is threatened when we fail to reserve sufficient funds to adequately support domestic priorities and cover emergency needs. In fact, CBO determined last fall that the lock box protecting the Social Security surplus was in danger of being broken. The threat was not eliminated until January, when revenue estimates increased beyond earlier projections. If we are serious about protecting the Social Security surplus, we should not consume the entire on-budget surplus in tax cuts. These massive tax cuts are irresponsible. They do not deserve to pass. 
   Mr. President, if we are serious about protecting the Social Security surplus, we should not consume the entire projected on-budget surplus, and these massive tax cuts are irresponsible. They do not deserve to pass. The Democratic alternative does. 
   Mr. President, the point I was making was that virtually every economist who has come before the Budget Committee or the Finance Committee has told us our highest priority in this budget ought to be to pay down the debt. Not only have the economists told us that, but Chairman Greenspan, head of the Federal Reserve, has told us that clearly and unequivocally. 
   This is from the January 27, 2000, Washington Post, Business Section. The headline is: ``Pay Down the Debt First, Greenspan Urges.'' It reads, ``He says the best use of the surplus is to reduce red ink.'' 
   I think the Federal Reserve Chairman has it exactly right. In this budget the Democrats will be proposing, we save every penny of Social Security for Social Security. We put an emphasis and priority on paying down the debt. We also have sufficient resources to protect Medicare, to provide prescription drugs, and to make an investment in education, which I think all of us believe is our future. Also, we provide for a tax cut for working families. 
   In the Democratic budget proposal, debt reduction is the highest priority. This may come as a surprise to many. Debt reduction is the priority of the Democratic budget because this is what will most assure our financial security into the future. Over the 10 years of the Democratic budget plan, 82 percent of all the projected surpluses are dedicated to debt reduction; debt service is 3 percent; 14 percent is for health initiatives, tax cuts, and other high-priority domestic needs. 
   Mr. President, in looking at the non-Social Security surplus, our priorities are as follows: Again, the top priority is given to debt reduction--36 percent of the non-Social Security surplus to debt reduction; 29 percent to tax cuts; 23 percent to prescription drugs and other initiatives; 11 percent to interest costs. We think those are the appropriate priorities for the country, the appropriate priorities for the Senate, and the appropriate priorities for the Congress. We very much hope that people will give close consideration to that alternative when it is voted on. 
   Let me conclude by again publicly commending the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. It is not easy to bring a budget resolution to the floor. I think there is perhaps no more difficult job in the Senate than bringing a budget resolution. Once again, Senator DOMENICI has done it and he has done it under challenging circumstances. It is always challenging to bring a budget resolution to the floor. I commend him for his leadership. I also thank our ranking member, Senator LAUTENBERG, who has given extraordinary leadership to those of us on the Democratic side. 
   I am proud of the budget alternative we will offer. It is a budget that is in line with the priorities of the American people, which puts debt reduction first, focuses on securing Social Security, extending the solvency of Medicare, and providing for high-priority domestic needs such as defense and education and agriculture, 
   and that also has room for tax cuts targeted to working families with an emphasis on incentives for savings. That is one area where we are not doing so well in the national economy. We are not doing a good job with savings as a society. We should provide the incentive for people to save more. 
   I yield the floor. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleagues for their courtesy.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. I don't believe I will need all of that time. But I appreciate leadership yielding the time. 
   Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from Virginia, Mr. ROBB, for offering this amendment. I welcome the chance to join with him and my colleague and friend, Senator WYDEN of the State of Oregon. I commend him for the way this amendment has been fashioned and for the excellent presentation and compelling case he made in favor of this amendment. 
   When you get right down to it, as he said so well, this is really a question about priorities. As the Senator from Virginia pointed out, if we reject this amendment, we are putting tax breaks before our senior citizens. If the Senate accepts this amendment, it is putting our senior citizens, their health and their well-being, ahead of tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   As we start this debate on the budget, we have an issue that makes a great difference to millions of senior citizens and their families--because so often elderly people need assistance from their family members in order to purchase their necessary prescription drugs. This is a significant drain on both the senior citizen and their family's income. 
   I again commend the Senator from Oregon, Mr. WYDEN, for the superb presentation he made in the Budget Committee, and for his outreach to Members on the other side of the aisle. I admire their strong willingness to support the Wyden proposal because I think it will make a difference in the lives of many of our seniors. 
   As I mentioned, a budget is a statement of our national priorities. There is no more important priority than Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. Our amendment puts the Senate on record that quality health care for senior citizens is more important than new tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   The need for action on prescription drugs is as clear as it is urgent. Too many elderly Americans today must choose between food on the table and the medicines they need to treat their illnesses. Too many senior citizens can  only take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or must forego needed prescriptions, because they cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs. Too many senior citizens are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need because they are forced to pay full price when almost everyone with private insurance coverage has the benefit of negotiated discounts. Too many senior citizens end up hospitalized, at an immense cost to Medicare, because they cannot afford the drugs they need or can't afford to take them correctly. 
   As numerous discoveries in recent years have made clear, pharmaceutical products increasingly offer cures for many dreaded diseases. Far too many senior citizens are being left out and left behind because Congress has failed to act. 
   I strongly believe this century is going to be the life-sciences century. We know about the extraordinary possibilities for breakthrough prescription drugs. We know, for example, if we were to have a breakthrough drug for delaying the onset of Alzheimer's disease, half the nursing home beds in my State of Massachusetts would be empty. The impact on quality of life would be significant. At the same time, we could save the Medicare system money. 
   I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to review why this amendment is so important. 
   There is a drug crisis for senior citizens: Coverage is going down, and costs are going up. 
   I want to take a few moments to review for the Senate exactly what is happening across America. 
   We have 36 million American seniors, as this chart indicates. We are finding that 12 million of them have no coverage whatsoever; 11 million have employer-sponsored coverage. I will come back to that. Three million have Medicare HMOs. Four million have Medigap 
   coverage. Four million have Medicaid coverage. This is the only group, the poorest of the poor, in America that have reliable prescription drug coverage. Three million have coverage as veterans or through other programs. 
   This is what is happening in America today. We know a third of all seniors have no coverage whatsoever. Let's take a look at seniors with employer-sponsored; they represent about one-third of all seniors. 
   Look at this chart. From 1994 to 1997, we see a precipitous drop in employer-sponsored coverage. We see a drop of 25 percent over the 3 years from 1994 to 1997. 
   If 1997 and 1998, coverage is dropping like a stone. A third of all the elderly people have no coverage; another third have employer-sponsored coverage, but that number is dropping rapidly. 
   What is happening in Medicare HMOs? This is what is happening to Medicare HMO drug coverage: It's inadequate and unreliable. First of all, the drug benefit is only offered at the option of the HMO. More than 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this year--325,000 have been dropped. 
   The Medicare HMOs are also reducing the level of drug coverage. Seventy-five percent of all the Medicare HMOs will limit prescription drug coverage to less than $1,000 this year, an increase of 100 percent since 1998. In 1997, 37 percent of Medicare HMOs had caps of less than $1,000; in 1998, this number increased to 75 percent. Thirty-two percent of Medicare HMOs have now imposed caps of less than $500 for prescription drugs. 
   Twelve million seniors with no coverage, 11 million and dropping with employer-sponsored coverage, and 3 million with coverage through Medicare HMOs, and we find that the HMOs are setting caps of $500 or less. This suggests very poor, unreliable prescription drug coverage for our senior citizens. 
   Four million seniors have prescription drug coverage through Medigap. Look at what is happening to the cost of Medigap plans with drug coverage--$2,600 for someone who is 75 years old; $2,600 a year in Delaware; New York, almost $2,000; Iowa, almost $2,000; Maine, almost $2,500; and almost to $2,500 in Mississippi--and many seniors are not even eligible for Medigap drug coverage. You can only purchase the Medigap plans that include prescription drug coverage at the time you first become eligible for Medicare. These plans are incredibly expensive. The cost of Medigap which includes prescription drugs is unaffordable and unavailable for most senior citizens. 
   Again, the level of Medicare HMO drug coverage is dropping drastically. We see the collapse of coverage for seniors with employer-sponsored plans, for seniors in Medicare HMOs, and for seniors with Medigap. This effectively leaves persons with Medicaid as the only seniors with reliable drug. 
   At the same time coverage is collapsing, drug costs are growing at double-digit rates: a 9.7 percent increase in 1995; 10 percent in 1996; 14 percent in 1997; 15 percent in 1998; 16 percent in 1999. 
   What about the rates of inflation? Inflation was 2.5 percent in 1995; 3.3 percent in 1996; 1.7 percent in 1997; 1.6 percent in 1998, and 2.7 percent in 1999. In other words, drug costs are going up significantly faster than the rate of inflation. Coverage is collapsing, and costs are going through the roof. We are not meeting the needs of our elderly people. 
   That is why we on this side of the aisle believe, unlike the other side of the aisle, we should have agreement on the principles for a quality Medicare prescription drug benefit. There should be coverage for all seniors, coverage must be basic and catastrophic, and it should be affordable both to the Federal Government and to the individual. These principles were not recognized by the Budget Committee. 
   These two charts demonstrate what the budget resolution has done for taxes and what it has done for prescription drugs. Section 104: ``Not later than September 22, 2000, the Senate Committee on Finance shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill proposing changes''--that would be tax cuts for the next 5 years. 
   Note the words, ``shall report.'' 
   Regarding the reserve fund for prescription drugs: ``The Senate spending aggregate and other appropriate budgetary levels and limits may be adjusted and allocations may be revised for the legislation reported by the committee on ..... to provide a prescription drug benefit for fiscal year 2001, 2000, and 2003.'' 
   See the difference? That is why we are offering this amendment. We are treating tax breaks the same as prescription drugs--the other side of the aisle is not. That is why the Robb amendment is before the Senate. There is one criteria for tax breaks for wealthy individuals and another criteria for our elderly Americans. That is the issue we are addressing. 
   The tax measure is a permanent measure. Can we say that about the prescription drug measure? No, no, no, it only goes on for 3 years. After 3 years, it only continues ``if legislation is reported by the Senate Committee on Finance that extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund.'' 
   It says, ``that extends the solvency of the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund without the use of transfers .....'' 
   Why is the Budget Committee saying we cannot use any of the surplus? That is what this provision says. You are not able to use any surplus to extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund. This says ``that extends the solvency'' ``without the use of transfers of new subsidies''--that is the surplus ``from the general fund.'' 
   They are saying after the first 3 years you cannot have funds for the fourth or the fifth year unless you have a complete revamping of Medicare. And you cannot use any surplus money to extend solvency. 
   How does that translate? To the senior citizens it means there will be a cut in Medicare benefits. If you are going to have prescription drug coverage, you will have to cut your Medicare benefits or raise the payroll tax. Those are the options the Budget Committee is leaving for prescription drug coverage. 
   They don't set that criteria for the tax breaks. They say you ``shall.'' It is permanent. It will go on ad infinitum. But not for prescription drugs. We may provide coverage for 3 years, but we will not extend coverage beyond that unless there is a complete revamping of the Medicare system. And we can't use any surplus funds--as President Clinton and AL GORE suggest, and as every Member on this side believes can and should be used. 
   They are saying no, no, you cannot use any of the surplus for Medicare solvency. And you will only be able to get  a prescription drug benefit if you either cut Medicare benefits or increase the payroll tax. 
   What does this mean for senior citizens? This means they have a very poor deal on prescription drug coverage. It is a better deal than we had last year and we are encouraged that we have made some progress. But this does not give the assurances that our elderly people need that they are going to have affordable, reliable prescription drug coverage. 
   No matter how many times they say it, the language is very clear. The Robb amendment is very clear. It says we want a prescription drug benefit that is worthy of its name, that covers all seniors, that is affordable to both beneficiaries and the Government, and we will do that before we cut taxes. 
   This $20 billion for years 4 and 5 will not be adequate because we are seeing a phasing in of the coverage over a period of time. The money for the fourth and fifth years is completely inadequate. The cost of the President's plan is up to $31 billion, 50 percent higher, and that was without catastrophic coverage. The cost of the President's program is about $200 billion over 10 years. That is a sizable amount, but it is a good program. It will make a major difference in the lives of our seniors. It will relieve many of our elderly citizens from the anxiety they currently face. 
   This amendment is of enormous importance and consequence. I cannot express my appreciation enough to the Senator from Virginia. Everyone in the State of Virginia, every elderly citizen and their family, will be affected by this effort that the Senator has put forward. It will affect the seniors not only in his State but in my State of Massachusetts and all across this country. 
   This is the first opportunity we have had--since the President of the United States identified prescription drugs in his State of the Union a year and a half ago--to have this debate and to have a rollcall on a measure that can make such a difference in so many lives. The Senator from Virginia is offering this opportunity. Tomorrow at 11 o'clock this Senate will have the chance to say whether it wants to put the interests of our elderly people first, or if we want tax breaks for wealthy people to come before them. 
   It is very clear from the presentation that has been made by the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Oregon where they stand. I am proud to stand with them. I hope the Senate will stand with them tomorrow also. 
   I yield back my remaining time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, soon the Senate will have an opportunity to consider legislation to lower the Federal gasoline tax. The amendment I submit intends to at least consider on that particular measure an increase in the minimum wage in two phases--50 cents this year and 50 cents next year. 
   If the idea of repealing the gasoline tax is to provide some relief for hard-working Americans, it seems to me the best way we can provide some relief to the 11 million Americans who are earning the minimum wage is to provide a modest increase--50 cents this year and 50 cents next year--so they have less of an adverse impact, whether they are paying for gas to go to work at the present time or otherwise dealing with increased costs with which they are faced every single day. 
   I am mindful of some of the recent reports about whether this gasoline reduction will have much of an impact, in any event, for consumers and working families in this country. All one has to do is read what a Republican leader in the House of Representatives said about this particular issue when he pointed out in the New York Times--this is J.C. Watts:  
   If that were not chilling enough to Republicans eager to maintain their tenuous control of the House this fall, other party leaders voiced skepticism over the repeal's impact on consumers. 
   ``I don't know if the tax has any effect on fuel costs,'' says Rep. J.C. Watts. ``Supply and demand is driving prices right now.''  
   That is an interesting and, I think, a pretty accurate statement. As a matter of fact, included in the fundamental legislation is a study as to whether lowering the cost of gasoline will have any positive impact on consumers. 
   On Wednesday, March 15, in the New York Times, there was a very interesting article by Paul Krugman of MIT talking about ``Gasoline Tax Follies.'' I will reference part of the article.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. Krugman writes:  
   Anyway, in the short run--and what we have right now is a short-run gasoline shortage--cutting gas taxes probably won't even temporarily reduce prices at the pump. The quantity of oil available for U.S. consumption over the near future is pretty much a fixed number; the inventories on hand plus the supplies en route from the Middle East. Even if OPEC increases its output next month--  
   Which they did, as we heard from the announcements in the last couple of days--  
   supplies are likely to be limited for a couple more months. The rising price of gasoline to consumers is in effect the market's way of rationing that limited supply of oil. 
   Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the pump, inclusive of the lower tax, would quickly be bid right back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that any cut in taxes would show up not in lower price at the pump, but in a higher price paid to distributors. In other words, the benefits of the tax cut would flow not to consumers but to the other parties, mainly the domestic oil refining industry.  
   There is a very substantial body of opinion that agrees with that. If we are talking about enhancements of profits of the domestic oil refining industry--and that is going to be the result of legislation--we ought to give consideration to men and women in this country making the minimum wage, trying to make ends meet, playing by the rules, working hard 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year trying to keep their families together. 
   There is a more compelling public interest for a modest increase in the minimum wage than in lowering the gas tax. If we are talking about providing some relief to the American consumers, it seems to me among the American consumers, the ones who are the most hard-pressed in our society, are those who are earning the minimum wage. If we are interested in providing such relief, we ought to at least address their particular needs. 
   That is what this amendment will do, and that is the reason I have filed it. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I had the privilege of meeting today with a wonderful group of courageous and dedicated young people who are members of Mayor Thomas Menino's Youth Council in Boston. This diverse group of junior and senior high school students is in town for their annual trip to Washington to discuss issues that affect today's youth. The group presented a letter signed by hundreds of Boston's young people, asking Congress to provide funding for youth summer jobs programs. 
   Mayor Menino's Youth Council was established in 1994 to give young people the opportunity to take an active role as advocates on issues that directly affect their lives. These dedicated volunteers from each of the neighborhoods in Boston have reached out to their community. They work closely with other organizations to hold monthly meetings and workshops, and they sponsor forums where young people can express their concerns and recommend solutions to elected officials. 
   This week these high school students are here to emphasize their support for increased funding for summer job programs. These programs provide valuable job experience for youths who otherwise might not have them. It helps them support their families and save money for college. Last summer, 500,000 young people were able to give back to their community, serving in such worthwhile summer programs as day camps, child care, care for the elderly, and cleaning city parks and recreation areas. 
   Studies show that early work experience raises lifetime earnings by ten percent. Clearly, our investment in these programs opens doors for the future by providing experience, connections in the community, and an increased prospects for their lifelong earning potential. 
   I commend the efforts of these young people to create jobs, and to prepare students for worthwhile careers and the important choices that lie ahead. I look forward to working with them to build on this effort and make it even more effective. I also look forward to seeing these young activists become the leaders who will make a difference whatever challenge they face. I hope that they will continue to inspire their peers and their representatives through their energy, dedication and passion on the issues that can make a difference in the lives of our nation's youth. I congratulate these future leaders, for they are truly shining examples to us all.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate Finance Committee is today holding the second in a series of hearings on prescription drugs. It is the 14th hearing on Medicare reform and how we will deal with the challenges facing the Medicare system. 
   I had an opportunity to testify before the Finance Committee as did several of my colleagues. Both Republicans and Democrats are urging the Senate Finance Committee to take steps to provide important our senior citizens relief from the cost of prescription drugs. It is a national crisis. It affects seniors in New England, it affects seniors in the Southwest, it affects seniors all across this Nation. We have a responsibility to our seniors to address the issue this year. It would be inexcusable for us to have an adjournment without addressing the prescription drug crisis that is affecting the health, well-being, and livelihood of millions of senior citizens all across this Nation. 
   I want to take just a few moments of time to review exactly where we are in this challenge that is facing the Senate of the United States as an institution. The Budget Committee is meeting today to make recommendations on the issue of prescription drugs, and the Finance Committee has responsibility in examining why action is so important now. 
   The drug crisis for seniors is reflected in two important ways: 
   One, coverage is going down. 
   Those seniors who currently have drug coverage are seeing it evaporate. The costs being paid by those senior citizens with coverage are going through the roof. 
   This chart is a clear indication of the situation facing our senior citizens. There are approximately 35 million senior citizens receiving Medicare. Twelve million of these seniors have no prescription drug coverage whatsoever. This is almost one third of all senior citizens. 
   Almost another third--11 million--have employer-sponsored coverage through their former employers. They have coverage. 
   Then we have Medicare HMOs, which cover 3 million seniors; 4 million seniors purchase Medigap coverage that includes a limited drug benefit; 4 million seniors have coverage through Medicaid; and 3 million have coverage through the VA and other means. 
   This chart really tells the story. We have 12 million seniors on Medicare with no prescription drug coverage. 
   What about those seniors with employer-sponsored coverage? How reliable is that coverage for our senior citizens? 
   Look at this chart. There has been a 25% drop in firms offering retiree health coverage between 1994 and 1997, a 3-year period. A quarter of all persons receiving employer-sponsored retiree coverage have been dropped. 
   The rather ominous fact is that current coverage is declining in an even more dramatic way. More and more firms are unilaterally dropping prescription drug coverage from their retiree programs. The number of seniors who are in these employer-sponsored programs is going down dramatically. 
   Let's look at the 3 million who have coverage through Medicare HMOs. This year alone, more than 325,000 Medicare beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage. That is true in the western part of my State. It is true in Connecticut, it is true in many parts of New England and it is true in many other areas of the country. 
   We know the drug coverage is only an option under HMOs; Medicare HMOs are not required to provide drug coverage. Medicare HMOs are leaving the market, and those remaining are drastically reducing the level of drug coverage. Seventy-five percent of all seniors covered through Medicare HMOs have limited coverage--capped at less than $1,000 this year. The number of plans with such limited coverage has doubled since 1998. Thirty-two percent have imposed caps of less than $500, an increase of 50 percent since 1998. 
   On the one hand, many HMOs are dropping coverage. Those maintaining coverage are putting limitations on the dollar amounts they actually cover. In the last 2 years, 75 percent have unilaterally declared that they won't provide any coverage in excess of $1,000, and 32 percent have limited coverage to $500. 
   Here we have no coverage. 
   Here we have falling coverage. 
   Here we have collapsing coverage. 
   And now we look at the question of the Medigap. 
   Look at the situation with Medigap. To qualify for Medigap coverage that includes a drug benefit, one must get that coverage at the time they first enroll in Medicare. 
   This chart shows that drug coverage through Medigap is unaffordable. This is the sample premium for a 75-year-old: In Delaware, $2,600; New York, $1,900; in Iowa, $2,000; in Maine, $2,400; Mississippi, $2,400. 
   Individuals have to apply for Medigap plans with drug coverage at the time they first qualify for Medicare; they  are effectively closed out from purchasing a Medigap plan that includes drug coverage later. 
   What we are seeing here is an explosion of the Medigap premiums. As a result, protection against the cost of prescription drugs through Medigap is also in free fall. The only seniors with reliable drug coverage are the 4 million covered through Medicaid. 
   At the same time we are seeing this very significant decline in coverage, drug costs are growing at double-digit rates. We go from 1995, 9.7 percent; 10.1 percent in 1996; 14.2 percent in 1997; 15.7 percent in 1998; and 16.0 percent in 1999. This is against a background of a virtual flat rate of inflation. The inflation rate in 1995 was 2.5 percent; 1996, 3.3; 1997, 1.7; 1998, 1.6 and in 1999, 2.7. The inflation rate is virtually flat, yet we have seen dramatic increases in costs and reduction in coverage for drug benefits. 
   We have a situation where Congress is going to act. We need coverage for all, universal coverage. We must include both basic and catastrophic coverage. We should try to take care of those senior citizens represented in this group here: the 57 percent with incomes under $15,000 plus the 21 percent with incomes between $15,000 and $25,000--a total of close to 80 percent of all senior citizens have incomes below $25,000. We have to take care of these seniors. I believe coverage ought to be universal. This is what we currently do in both Medicare and Social Security. 
   Close to 80 percent of our senior citizens have incomes below $25,000 a year. This is extraordinary. Almost 60 percent have incomes below $15,000. Overall, their incomes are very modest indeed. 
   So coverage is collapsing at the same time costs are exploding. And who is it impacting? It is impacting close to 80 percent of the elderly people in this country with incomes below $25,000. 
   This chart gives an idea of typical patient profiles. These are the types of ailments that typically affect so many of our seniors: Osteoporosis, heart trouble, high blood pressure, enlarged prostate, arthritis, ulcers, high blood pressure, heart disease and anemia. 
   Look at the typical cost per year. If 150 percent of poverty is $11,985, and we saw on the last chart about 60 percent of our seniors have incomes in that range, look at the outlays these seniors have: 20 percent of their entire income, just to cover the of essential drugs needed to treat osteoporosis and heart trouble. The costs only increase for other typical conditions. These are their out-of-pocket expenditures for drugs; this does not even deal with other health-related needs they might have. It is an extraordinary burden they have. 
   This is why we believe that Medicare drug coverage needs to be universal. It should cover all of our senior citizens. It should provide basic coverage. It should also reach those with higher drug costs through catastrophic coverage. We know only about 10 percent of the seniors need catastrophic coverage today. But many of our seniors are very concerned that they may face catastrophic needs in the future. 
   I am a strong believer that the next century is going to be the life science century, with major breakthroughs in medical treatment. For example, in my State of Massachusetts, if we had a breakthrough in Alzheimer's disease, we would empty half of all the nursing home beds. The savings would be astronomical. The cost of the prescription drugs might be large, but the savings through 
   keeping Medicare beneficiaries out of hospitals and nursing homes can be dramatic, significant. That is why I think we need both basic and catastrophic coverage. 
   We must be guided by these principles. We want coverage that is affordable for the individual senior citizen. It should also be affordable to the Federal Government. That is why Senator ROCKEFELLER and I have advanced a Medicare drug program. A number of our colleagues have advanced other programs. What is important is that we take action and take it now. 
   I have here before me what we call the chairman's mark. The Budget Committee of the Senate of the United States is meeting even as I speak. They have in their chairman's mark what they call a reserve fund for Medicare. They are talking about reserving $20 billion for Medicare. In the chairman's mark they describe a reserve fund for Medicare:  
   Whenever the Committee on Ways and Means of the House or the Finance Committee reports a bill or an amendment or a conference report that implements the structural Medicare reform--  
   In other words, nothing is available for prescription drugs without comprehensive Medicare reform. I am all for Medicare reform. But I do not know why we ought to hold a good, effective prescription drug benefit program hostage until we get comprehensive Medicare reform. This is what the program requires. 
   Then it says:  
   and improves the solvency of the Medicare Program without the use of transfers or new subsidies from the general fund.  
   Therefore it prohibits any use of any of the surplus at a time where we have an important and significant surplus projection. The surplus should be used to assist the Medicare program in a modest way. They prohibit any use of that surplus. It also requires and ensures additional reimbursement for Medicare providers. So we have to have a comprehensive reform of the Medicare system and we have to also have the major changes for Medicare providers before we can ever come to consider the $20 billion that is going to be recommended as possible funds that could be used for a prescription drug program. This is half of what the President of the United States has asked for, half of his $40 million request. 
   This is what it says. Under the budget:  
   Prescription drug benefit. The adjustments made pursuant to the prescription drug benefit may be made to address the cost of prescription drugs.  
   It is optional. It is optional. I do not think that is what the seniors or the American people--not just seniors, but all Americans are really interested in. They want us to take action and they want us to take action now. They do not want to set up an arbitrary barricade for us before we can take action. 
   I do not understand why our Budget Committee is effectively binding the Senate of the United States and prohibiting it from being able to take action on a prescription drug benefit this year unless it goes through the hoops which they have established in the committee. Even if you were able to get through all those hoops, it provides woefully inadequate funding over the next 5 years. 
   Last year the Budget Committee had $100 billion over 10 years for Medicare, although in reality that money was not dedicated solely to Medicare and Medicare prescription drug coverage. Yet this year they are talking about $20 billion over 5 years. The problem has gotten worse, not better. As we have seen, even though they had their program last year and said they are really all for prescription drug coverage, they do not have any program. 
   That is a very unsatisfactory way to proceed when we are talking about one of the central concerns for not only seniors but also for their families. Seniors do the best they can. So often, when the parents are unable to pay, the burden falls on other family members to chip in and help pay for mom or dad's necessary prescription drugs. 
   The fact is, when the Medicare system was adopted in 1965, it was to be universal in nature and have the confidence of the American people. It was a pledge to the American people--if they worked hard and played by the rules, when they retired these seniors who fought in this country's wars would be free from the dangers of absolute financial ruin due solely to their health. 
   We passed Social Security to provide for them to live with some sense of dignity, and Medicare was passed to give assurance that they would be able to live their golden years in with the peace, security, and dignity in knowing their health care would be covered. 
   At that time, only 3 percent of all private health insurance programs had a prescription benefit, so the Medicare system did not put in a prescription drug benefit. Now almost every private employer-based health plan--99 percent of them--have a prescription drug benefit. But not Medicare. This is a serious coverage gap that exists, and every senior citizen has to be concerned about this gap in coverage. It demands action. 
   We can develop a program this year with our current circumstances, with the economic benefits under the existing surplus. We can enact a benefit  package now that can benefit seniors. We ought to pass it this year. Sure, we can phase it in, we can build it up, but we want it now. Not like the Budget Committee saying maybe sometime off in the future and giving us absolutely no assurance. That is a mistake. That is flawed policy. That is, I think, a completely inadequate response to the challenges our seniors face. 
   Next week, when we debate the budget, we will have the opportunity to address this issue. I hope the overwhelming majority of the Members will support an effort that will come from our side, from our leaders to commit this body to take action and take it now. We will have a chance to vote on that. It ought to be something to which every senior citizen in this country pays attention. We will make every effort to fashion a program to provide assistance to our seniors. We are committed to that. We will not be discouraged from that opportunity by these budget recommendations.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my concern about Andrei Babitsky, the accomplished Russian journalist who still faces serious charges in Russia after being held captive first by Russian authorities, then by Chechens, and now again by Russian authorities.  
   Mr. Babitsky has worked for the last 10 years for the U.S. government-funded broadcasting service, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. He is well-known as one of the most courageous reporters who has covered the conflict in Chechnya. The skill and courage he demonstrated in his coverage of the conflict are clearly the major reasons for his continuing plight. 
   Russian authorities repeatedly expressed displeasure with Mr. Babitsky's reporting of Russian troop casualties and Russian human rights violations against Chechen civilians in the weeks leading up to his arrest. On January 8, his Moscow apartment was ransacked by members of the Federal Security Service, the FSB, which is the successor organization to the KGB. They confiscated film alleged to contain photos of dead Russian soldiers in Chechnya. 
   On January 16, Mr. Babitsky was seized by Russian police in the Chechen battle zone. After first denying that he was in their custody, Russian authorities claimed that Mr. Babitsky had been assisting the Chechen forces and was to stand trial in Moscow. 
   On February 3, the Russian government announced that Mr. Babitsky had been handed over to Chechen units in exchange for Russian prisoners, a violation of the Geneva Convention to which Russia is a party. Subsequently, Russian authorities claimed to have no knowledge of Mr. Babitsky's whereabouts. As it turns out, he was taken to a so-called ``filtration camp'' for suspected Chechen collaborators, then held at an undisclosed location by Chechen forces loyal to Moscow. 
   On February 25, Mr. Babitsky was taken to the Republic of Dagestan and told he was about to be freed. But authorities said he was carrying false identity papers, and they arrested and jailed him. Mr. Babitsky says the papers were forced on him by his captors in Chechnya and used to smuggle him over the border. 
   Facing international pressure to account for Mr. Babitsky's whereabouts since his disappearance, Russian authorities flew Mr. Babitsky to Moscow and released him on his own recognizance. 
   The allegations of assisting Chechen forces and carrying forged identity papers still stand against Mr. Babitsky. If convicted, he faces at least two years in prison on the identity papers charges alone. The State Department would like to see this case resolved. Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty is seeking to have all charges against Mr. Babitsky dropped, and I strongly support this effort. 
   Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guarantees the right to seek and to impart information through the media, regardless of frontiers. Taking into custody any reporter, and transferring him to the custody of hostile forces, is a serious human rights violation and behavior unbefitting a democracy. 
   I urge the newly-elected Russian President, Vladimir Putin, to demonstrate his commitment to the principles of democracy and respect for human rights and freedom of the press by seeing to it that the trumped-up charges against Mr. Babitsky are dropped.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, at a recent event at the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston, the Chairman of the Library Foundation, Paul G. Kirk, Jr., and the new Director of the Peace Corps, Mark Schneider, spoke of the importance of the Peace Corps as it launched its year-long, 40th anniversary celebration. Mr. Schneider announced a new initiative to expand the role of Peace Corps volunteers in bringing information technology to the task of reducing poverty in developing countries. He also outlined a plan to expand the Peace Corps' efforts to raise global awareness about HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. 
   It is fitting that this occasion was held at President Kennedy's library. In March 1961, President Kennedy launched the Peace Corps as a new idea to demonstrate that a new generation of Americans was moving into positions of leadership in the United States, and they intended to serve the cause of peace around the world. 
   The Peace Corps today continues its vital and thriving mission, with 7,400 volunteers serving in 77 countries, including recent missions in South Africa, Jordan, Mozambique and Bangladesh. In the past four decades, more than 150,000 Americans have served as Peace Corps volunteers in 134 countries, promoting peace, education, economic development and international cooperation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senators JEFFORDS, FRIST, DODD, HATCH, BINGAMAN, and WELLSTONE in introducing the Ryan White CARE Reauthorization Act. I commend Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership and commitment in making this legislation a top priority of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for enactment this year. I commend Senator FRIST for his medical knowledge and expertise in drafting this legislation. Senator DODD has been strongly committed to this issue for many years and I am pleased that he continues his commitment this year. Senator HATCH joined me more than a decade ago when we first introduced this legislation, and he has remained committed and involved ever since, and I commend his leadership. Senators BINGAMAN and WELLSTONE are members of our Senate Committee, and they have shown a great deal of interest in making sure that these resources reach rural Americans and other emerging populations. 
   Over the past twenty years, the nation has made extraordinary progress in responding to the AIDS epidemic. Medical advances, new and effective treatments, and the development of an HIV care infrastructure in every state have dramatically improved the access to care for individuals and families with HIV who would otherwise not be able to afford such care. By providing life-sustaining health and related support services, we have reduced the spread of AIDS. 
   The CARE Act has contributed to the significant drop in new AIDS cases. AIDS-related deaths have decreased significantly, dropping 42% from 1996 to 1997, and 20% from 1997 to 1998. Persons with HIV/AIDS are living longer and healthier lives because of the CARE Act. 
   Perinatal HIV transmission from mother to child has been reduced by 75% from 1992 to 1997. We are closing the gap in health care disparities in vulnerable populations such as communities of color, women, and persons with HIV who are uninsured and underinsured. 
   Medications have made a difference too. Highly active anti-retroviral  therapies have given a second lease on life to many Americans with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 80% of persons in treatment have used one or more of these new and effective drugs. 
   HIV health care and supportive services have also made a difference. An estimated 600,000 persons have received HIV services through the Ryan White CARE Act, including primary care, substance abuse treatment, dental care, hospice care, and other specialized HIV health care services, and the availability of these services has enabled them to lead productive lives. 
   In Massachusetts, for example, we have seen an overall 77% decline in AIDS and HIV-related deaths since 1995. At the same time, however, like many other states, we are concerned about the changing HIV/AIDS trends and profiles. AIDS and HIV cases increased in women by 11% from 1997 to 1998, and 55% of persons living with AIDS in the state are persons of color. 
   Clearly, we have had significant successes in fighting AIDS. We have come a long way from the days when ideology dictated care for people with AIDS and not sound public health policy. Fortunately, with the leadership of Senator HATCH and Senator JEFFORDS and our bipartisan coalition, we were able to enact the Ryan White CARE Act in memory of Ryan White. He was a young man with hemophilia who contracted AIDS through blood transfusions, and touched the world's heart through his valiant efforts to speak out against the ignorance and discrimination faced by many persons living with AIDS. His mother, Jeanne White carried on her son's message after Ryan's death in 1990. She was instrumental in the passage of the Care Act in 1990 and then again in 1996 and now in 2000. 
   The enactment of the Ryan White CARE Act in 1900 provided an emergency response to the devastating effects of HIV on individuals, families, communities, and state and local governments. The CARE Act signaled a comprehensive approach by targeting funds to respond to the specific needs of communities. Title I targets the hardest hit metropolitan areas in the country. Local planning and priority setting requirements under Title I assure that each of the Eligible Metropolitan Areas respond to the local HIV/AIDS demographics. 
   Title II of the Act funds emergency relief to the states. It helps them to develop an HIV care infrastructure and provide effective and life-sustaining HIV/AIDS drug therapies through the AIDS Drug Assistance Program to over 61,000 persons each month. 
   Title III funds community health centers and other primary health care providers that serve communities with a significant and disproportionate need for HIV care. Many of these community health centers are located in the hardest hit areas, serving low income communities. 
   Finally, Title IV of the CARE Act is designed to meet the specific needs of women, children and families. 
   While the CARE Act has benefited large numbers of Americans in need, a number of critical areas remain where improvements are essential if we are to meet the growing needs in our communities. We know that of the estimated 750,000 persons living with HIV/AIDS in the United States, over 215,000 know their HIV status, yet are not in care. New health care access points are needed to bring these persons into care. At the same time, the CARE Act programs currently serving an estimated 600,000 persons annually are challenged more than ever in meeting the growing need and demand for services. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the need will continue to grow since we have an estimated 40,000 new cases of HIV/AIDS annually in the United States. 
   Also, not everyone is benefiting from the advances in the development of new and effective drug treatments. The skyrocketing costs of expensive AIDS drugs, estimated at $15,000 
   annually per person, has led 26% of the CARE Act's AIDS Drug Assistance Programs to cap enrollment, establish waiting lists, or limit eligibility. Guaranteeing that effective drug treatments are available and affordable to all persons with HIV/AIDS has always been a priority for the CARE Act. Reducing barriers to access in communities of color and other vulnerable populations is a priority for this reauthorization. 
   We are fortunate in Massachusetts to have a state budget that has also been able to provide funding for primary care, prevention, and outreach efforts, but no state by itself can provide the significant financial resources to help persons living with HIV to obtain needed medical and support access. 
   We still find serious disparities in access to HIV health care in communities of color, women, the uninsured and underinsured. The demographics of the epidemic have been steadily changing. The majority of new AIDS cases reported are among racial and ethnic minority populations and groups that traditionally have faced heavy barriers in obtaining adequate health care services. While African Americans make up 12% of the general population, they account for 45% of new AIDS cases. 80% of new AIDS cases are occurring in women of color. As many as half of all new infections are occurring in people under the age of 25, and one quarter of all new infections are occurring in persons under the age of 22. The CARE Act must be able to adjust to meet these changing trends in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Geographic shifts in the epidemic as well as the availability of new sources of financing for HIV/AIDS care must be taken into account to assure equity in how the federal government and states respond to the epidemic. 
   The CARE Act must continue to provide resources to help local communities to plan and to set priorities for CARE dollars. We must develop better ways to measure the severity of need and the health disparities, and assure that these improvements are taken into account in HIV planning, in establishing priorities, and in allocating funds. 
   This bill addresses these new challenges in ensuring access to HIV drug treatments for all, reducing health disparities in vulnerable communities, and improving the distribution and quality of services under the CARE Act. Proposed changes will ensure greater access to care in low income, historically underserved urban and rural communities, by increasing targeted funding to areas where the HIV care infrastructure may not exist. This bill also focuses on quality and accountability of HIV service delivery by requiring effective quality management activities that ensure their consistency with Public Health Service guidelines, and by making changes to ensure that CARE Act dollars are used for their intended purposes. 
   These improvements are intended to close the gap in health care disparities and improve inequities in services and funding among states. They will build capacity in underserved rural and urban areas, and focus state and local program priorities on underserved populations and persons not in care. They will develop new points of entry relationships to improve coordination of care. They will increase early access to care, in order to begin HIV treatment earlier and improve the quality of care that patients receive. 
   We know that the CARE Act has made a difference not only in the lives of persons with HIV/AIDS, but also in the lives of countless loved ones who have seen despair turned to hope through support of CARE Act services. The story of Lory in Massachusetts is a compelling example of young woman living with HIV, unable to work full-time, and unable to afford anti-retroviral medications without Ryan White CARE Act assistance. The support she has received from the caring staff at Fenway Clinic in Boston is impressive. As Lory told us at our committee hearing on March 2nd on the reauthorization of the Act ``It is not an exaggeration when I tell you that without Fenway I would be dead. They have saved my life.'' 
   I'm sure that Lory's eloquent testimony is true of countless others across the country who are living with this tragic disease. The Ryan White CARE Act has made an enormous difference in their lives. I look forward to early action by Congress on this important legislation, so that we can continue to help as many people as possible.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, once again we are debating whether to amend the Constitution to prohibit flag burning. Flag burning is a vile and contemptuous act, but it is also a form of expression protected by the first amendment. Surely we are not so insecure in our commitment to freedom of speech and the first amendment that we are willing to start carving loopholes now in that majestic language. 
   I strongly oppose the constitutional amendment we are debating today. The first amendment is one of the great pillars of our freedom and democracy. It has never been amended in over 200 years of our history, and now is no time to start. There is not even a plausible factual basis for carving a hole in the heart of the first amendment. There is no significant problem. 
   Flag burning is exceedingly rare. Published reports indicate that fewer than 10 flag burning incidents have occurred a year since the Supreme Court's decision in Texas v. Johnson in 1989 on the first amendment. Over the last 5 years, there was only one such incident in Massachusetts. This is hardly the kind of serious and widespread problem in American life that warrants an assault on the first amendment. Surely there is no clear and present danger that warrants such a change. 
   This proposal fails the reality test. 
   The Constitution is not a billboard on which to plaster amendments as if they were bumper sticker slogans. In this Congress alone, over a dozen constitutional amendments have been introduced. With every new proposed amendment, we undermine and trivialize the Constitution and threaten to weaken its enduring strength. 
   I remember listening to a speech given by Justice Douglas, one of the great Supreme Court Justices of this century. Students asked him: What was the most important export of the United States? He said, without hesitation: The first amendment because it is the defining amendment for the preservation of free speech as the basic and fundamental right in shaping our Nation. 
   Clearly, it would be a mistake of historic proportions for this Congress to make the first alteration to the first amendment in more than two centuries. The first amendment breathes light into the very concept of our democracy. It protects the freedoms of all Americans, including the fundamental freedom of citizens to criticize their government and the country itself, including the flag. 
   As the Supreme Court explained in Texas v. Johnson, it is a bedrock principle underlying the first amendment that the Government may not prohibit the expression of an idea simply because the society finds the idea itself offensive and disagreeable. 
   No one in the Senate condones the act of flag burning. We all condemn it. The flag is a symbol that embodies all that is great and good about America. It symbolizes our patriotism, our achievements, and, above all, our respect for our freedoms and our democracy. We do not honor the flag by dishonoring the first amendment. 
   Gen. Colin Powell agrees with our opposition to this proposed amendment. He has told us in reaching this decision he was inspired by the words of James Warner, a former marine aviator, who was a prisoner in North Vietnam between 1967 and 1973. As James Warner wrote in 1989: It hurts to see the flag being burned, but I part company with those who want to punish the flag burners. In one interrogation, I was shown a photograph of American protesters burning a flag. There, the officer said: People in your country protest against your cause. That proves you are wrong. No, I said, that proves that I am right. In my country we are not afraid of freedom, even if it means that people disagree with us. 
   The officer was on his feet in an instant, his face purple with rage. He smashed his fist onto the table and screamed at me to shut up. While he was ranting, I was astonished to see pain, compounded by fear, in his eyes. I have never forgotten that look, nor have I forgotten the satisfaction I felt in using his tool, the picture of the burning flag, against him. 
   That says it all. We respect the flag the most, we protect it the best, and the flag itself flies the highest when we honor the freedom for which it stands. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this misguided constitutional amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the good Senator from Minnesota, for an excellent presentation and for reminding us about the needs of our veterans, particularly those who are having some service-connected disability. The problems he has talked about that have affected his region are duplicated in my region of the country as well. 
   I received a call just 2 days ago from a very good friend, a person who worked here in the Senate, about his uncle who is 86 years old and who was at Pearl Harbor. He was one of those wounded at Pearl Harbor, survived, and went on. He was wounded in the Second World War and is now destitute and trying to get into a service home just outside of Boston. The waiting line there is 2 1/2 years. 
   I remember very well speaking to those who came back from the war. At that time, they all believed they were fortunate to make it back, and they weren't asking very much of this country. We responded in a way in which all of us have been enormously appreciative with the GI bill. Many of these men and women took 4 or 5 years out of their lives to serve their country and risked life and death. We provided the GI bill to them so they could get an education. They got an education and went on to contribute to their country. As the Senator knows, for every $1 invested in that education program, $8 was returned to the Treasury. 
   But there was not a member of the Armed Forces in any of the services who didn't believe in committing this Nation to taking care of those who served this country, who suffered and were wounded in the line of battle. They believed they should live in peace, respect, and dignity during their golden years. They are not, and it is a national disgrace. 
   We tried to join with others in this body. And I tell my good friend I will work with him closely, not on those relevant committees, but I think we have been here long enough to know we can make some difference in this area. I look forward to working with him. This is a problem that faces us in New England. 
   I see my colleague from Rhode Island chairing the Senate this afternoon. I am sure he and his colleague, Senator REID, have these kinds of cases as well. It is a matter of priority. We will join with him at a later time.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator MIKULSKI recently returned from a visit to Northern Ireland, where she held productive discussions with both Catholics and Protestants who are working together for community and economic development. As columnist Thomas Oliphant wrote in a perceptive column on March 19 in the Boston Globe, Senator MIKULSKI'S trip, and her work for grassroots development and cooperation in these communities, are important both symbolically and practically.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Does the Senator agree with me that here we are on Thursday afternoon, early afternoon, 2:45, most Americans are out working. The Senate, as I understand the schedule, will not be voting until next week on Tuesday. It is Thursday afternoon. Does the Senator agree that we have an opportunity to debate this this afternoon, and, if there were additional questions, we could debate it on Friday where, again, most Americans are working? We could stay here, doing our business, and then vote sometime on Friday or Friday afternoon, 
   that we could dispose of this issue in a timely way? Will the Senator not agree with me that someone who bears a responsibility--as well as the majority leader, in terms of a schedule--that this particular issue could be easily disposed of this afternoon, or on tomorrow, without interrupting the Senate schedule?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, this is an issue on which I believe every Member of this body has voted at one time or another. It is not an extraordinary, complex issue, as issues go that we deal with. This is a rather basic issue and a rather fundamental issue. As the leader pointed out, it is basically a question of whether we are going to respect the dignity of those who want to work and can work, who are willing to work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year. 
   Institutionally, we have voted, if my memory serves me correctly, over the history of this, probably 10 to 14 times. It is not a new issue. Members know what the dimensions of this particular question are really about. 
   The Senator, as I understand it, would agree with me that it wouldn't take a very long period of time to permit the Senate to express its will on whether they believe there should be an increase in the minimum wage. 
   As I understand the leader's position, he introduced this legislation. It is 50 cents this year; it is 50 cents next year. If we don't see this increase, we will see that the increase we provided in the 1996-1997 period will effectively be 
   wiped out. It will be about the lowest period in the history of the country in terms of the purchasing power of the minimum wage at a time perhaps of greatest prosperity. 
   Does the Senator find that is something that is difficult to explain to people back in his own State of South Dakota, as I do in Massachusetts, and who wonder why we aren't willing to take some action?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see others who wish to address the Senate. 
   On this issue of the scope of what we are talking about and increasing the minimum wage 50 cents and 50 cents, as I understand it, all Americans combined earn about $4.2 trillion per year. The impact of a $1 wage increase over 2 years would be one-fifth of 1 percent of the national payroll. This is effectively what we are talking about. 
   If the leader has given up the floor, I ask for recognition on my own right.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see others who desire to be recognized. But  I want to at this time join with our leader, Senator DASCHLE, in the introduction of this measure. He has pointed out that it is 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year. That is a very modest increase. 
   We have been debating this issue for the last 2 1/2 years. We have been denied the opportunity to bring this up to the Senate. We have been told by Republican leadership, day in and day out, that we haven't the time to debate this issue, that this is a complex issue that will impact inflation, that it will impact employment. 
   These are very important macroeconomic issues. We need time to debate. 
   Let the record show that our Democratic leader and others introduced this measure this afternoon. We are prepared this afternoon, on a Thursday in late March, to consider this legislation and deal with amendments, as we have done day in and day out over the period of the last 2 and a half years since we introduced minimum wage legislation. But we are prepared to deal with those arguments and finally take action. 
   We are being denied the opportunity as elected officials of our respective States to be able to have a vote on the increase in the minimum wage because of process, because of procedures, and because of the rules of the Senate. That is so today. But it isn't always going to be that way. As the leader pointed out, we are strongly committed to getting a vote on this measure as soon as we possibly can. We would like to do it in an orderly way so Members can participate in the debate and offer amendments. We can reach a final resolution. But if we are denied that opportunity, we are going to find a way or means to insist that the Senate address this particular issue. 
   I will just take a few moments to review exactly where we are in terms of the people about whom we are talking and those who would be the beneficiaries of this particular action. 
   We have taken action at other times in our history in order to provide for and to say to those who are working at different levels of our economy 40 hours a week for 52 weeks of the year that they are not going to have to live in poverty. 
   That is what this is all about. 
   Are we going to say in the United States of America that men and women who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, who play by the rules, are not going to have to live in poverty in the year 2000 and 2001, when we have this extraordinary prosperity? We say yes; the other side says no. That is a principal difference between our two parties on this issue. The American people ought to understand it. 
   If TOM DASCHLE were the majority leader, we would be debating and acting on this issue this afternoon in the Senate. But we are not. We are denied it because of the Republican position. Our leader has pointed out, all Members, Republicans and Democrats, were quite willing, without delay, without any kind of prolonged debate, to take the cost-of-living index increase of $4,600 without delay, which is what our Republican friends want us to do, delay the increase of the $1 minimum wage over 3 years. We didn't hear any of them say during the debate on the increase in the cost of living of $4,600: Spread that out. 
   No, no, no, we took that quickly. 
   We want for those working, who are needy and who are poor and who are struggling, we are saying we will spread out your increase of $1 over 3 years. How does anyone dignify that position? 
   We can see what has happened. The bottom fifth of families have fallen behind some 6 percent. This is from 1979 through 1999, over the last 20 years. Middle-income families are working harder. Generally, additional members of the family are going into the workforce. These middle-income families have seen a 5 percent increase in income. But most of them are working longer. 
   The United States of America today has workers working over 50 hours more a year than any other industrial society in the world. They are working harder and barely hanging on. Look what has happened to the top 5 percent of income families, those earning $246,000 versus the bottom 20 percent earning $12,500. Of the bottom 20 percent, many are minimum wage earners, with incomes of $10,000 or less. 
   Look what has been happening in the workforce during this period. People have always said the real issue in question for wage increase is productivity. There must be an increase in productivity for a wage increase. Look what has happened regarding productivity and the American worker. The real value of the minimum wage drops as productivity grows. We have had one of the greatest spurts in American productivity in the history of this Nation by American workers in recent years. At the same time, the real value of the minimum wage has collapsed. We have a dramatic increase in productivity, with more goods being produced by these workers, and they are still getting paid less and less. 
   What is the possible justification for that? Every indicator we have--the size of employment, the impact on inflation, the issues of productivity--all come to the same conclusion, that this Nation at this time as never before can afford an increase in the minimum wage. That is what this is about. 
   Finally, as the leader has pointed out, we have found now in order to get some action in the House of Representatives in the Senate of the United States, our Republican leader said we are going to ``piddle'' out an increase in the minimum wage over 3 years. We will take 3 years. However, we will provide $75 billion in unpaid for tax expenditures. 
   I hope we don't hear from the other side about being responsible economically. Mr. President, that is $75 billion for 3 years. 
   That wasn't good enough for the House of Representatives. Do you know what they said? We will give you 2 years, but we have $122 billion in unpaid-for tax cuts where 94 percent of the benefits go to the top fifth. Is that not interesting? We have to take care of the small little mom-and-pop stores; we have to help them out. We are interested in doing that. We would work with our 
   Republican friends in terms of the mom-and-pop stores. Our Democratic leader indicated a willingness to do that. We did it in the last minimum wage increase. We are glad to take modest steps in order to be able to do that. We heard we are going to have some tax expenditures in order to protect the mom-and-pop stores. Except under this tax cut, mom-and-pop stores aren't helped; 94 percent goes to the top fifth. 
   Maybe that goes over in some areas of the country, but we want our friends on the other side to know this issue will not go away. 
   When we have that kind of action that has been taken previously, a delayed minimum wage increase spread out over 3 years, added to a $75 billion in unpaid-for tax expenditures, it makes me wonder. How many times have we come on the floor of the Senate saying: Let's do something about Head Start; let's do something about immunization, or on mental health. How much will it cost? Is it paid for? Is it paid for? Is it paid for? Well, you are not getting that, Senator. 
   I don't know what happened to that particular position where we have now $75 billion and $122 billion in play, holding that minimum wage hostage to benefit the wealthiest individuals in this country. 
   Can we justify that? Is it a position that is defensible? I don't believe so. It is wrong. Fundamentally, it is wrong. 
   This issue is basically a women's issue because the majority of those who receive the minimum wage are women. It is a children's issue because many women who are receiving the minimum wage have children. This is about the quality of life. As the Council of Economic Advisers has pointed out, the children in minimum-wage families spend 22 hours a week less with their parents than they did 20 years ago. 
   When we talk about the minimum wage, it is a family issue. It is a civil rights issue because many of the people who earn the minimum wage are people of color. And it is a fairness issue because it says in the United States we stand for men and women who work hard, play by the rules, and they ought not to live in poverty. We believe the overwhelming majority of Americans support it. 
   I thank our leader for bringing this matter to the Senate again and for all of the leadership he has provided. I am proud to stand with some of my colleagues on this side who have stood for  that kind of increase and for the brave few on the other side who have joined. As the leader has pointed out, we will have this issue up one way or the other. It will come back again and again and again until we get fairness in our society for working men and women.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Wednesday of this week, a team of State Department officials departed for Libya as part of a review of the travel ban that has been in effect since 1981. 
   State Department officials will be in Libya for 26 hours in the next few days, visiting hotels and other sites. They will then prepare a recommendation for the Secretary to help her determine if there is still ``Imminent danger to ..... the physical safety of United States travellers,'' as the law requires in order to maintain the ban. 
   Because of the travel ban, American citizens can only travel to Libya if they obtain a license from the Department of the Treasury. In addition, the State Department must first validate a passport for travel to Libya. 
   The travel ban was imposed originally for safety reasons and predates the terrorist bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. But lifting the ban now, just as the two Libyan suspects are about to go on trial in the Netherlands for their role in that atrocity, will undoubtedly be viewed as a gesture of good will to Colonel Qadhafi. 
   Indeed, just after the State Department announced that it would send this consular team, a Saudi-owned daily paper quoted a senior Libyan official as saying the one-day visit by the U.S. Team was a ``step in the right direction.'' 
   The official said the visit was a sign that ``the international community was convinced that Libya's foreign policy position was not wrong and there is a noticeable improvement in Libya's relations with the world.'' 
   I have been in contact with many of the families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103, and they are extremely upset by the timing of this decision. The families want to know why the Secretary of State is making this friendly overture to Qadhafi now--just six weeks before the trial in the Netherlands begins. They question how much information the State Department will be able to obtain by spending only 26 hours in Libya. They wonder why the Department cannot continue to use the same sources of information it has been using for many years to make a determination about the travel ban. 
   These courageous Americans have waited for justice for eleven long years. They feel betrayed by this decision. They have watched with dismay as our close ally, Great Britain, has rushed to reestablish diplomatic relations with Libya, before justice is served for the British citizens killed in the terrorist bombing. The State Department denies it, but the families are concerned that the visit signals a change in U.S. policy, undermines U.S. sanctions, and calls into question the Administration's commitment to vigorously enforce the Iran Libya Sanctions Act. That Act requires the U.S. to impose sanctions on foreign companies which  invest more than $40 million in the Libyan petroleum industry, until Libya complies with the four conditions specified by the UN Security Council. 
   The bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, in which 188 Americans were killed, was one of the worst terrorist atrocities in American history. The State Department should not have sent a delegation to Libya now and it should not lift the travel ban on Libya at this time. The State Department's long-standing case-by-case consideration of passport requests for visits to Libya by U.S. citizens has worked well. It can continue to do so for the foreseeable future.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the majority leader. 
   Mr. President, I think Senator DASCHLE outlined what was a reasonable way of proceeding. I am under the impression that perhaps the majority leader has not had an opportunity to get into the kind of detail the Democratic leader talked about. 
   Although I still need persuasion on the bankruptcy bill, I know what the will of the Senate is on that issue. On the issue of the minimum wage, there wouldn't have been a blue slip on just the increase on the minimum wage. The blue slip was on the approximately $73 billion in tax breaks that were added to the minimum wage. 
   The point our leader was attempting to work out was consistent with what the majority leader has outlined, and that is that at least there would be a way in which the Senate would be able to address the minimum wage. Some colleagues may object to that process, but I would not. 
   As I understood Senator DASCHLE's proposal and the majority leader, by  substituting the Domenici bill for the House bill, there are 3 years. That would go to conference. What he was asking for was not really any unusual procedure, just asking that we follow the Senate rules that would permit a motion to instruct the conferees that, instead of being 3 years, it would be 2 years. Given the fact it has been 6 months since the Senate acted on the minimum wage and given the overwhelming support for 2 years, which was bipartisan in the House, there might be support for that. I believe there would be, if we had that opportunity to do so. 
   I hope the leader will consider what Senator DASCHLE proposed because it addresses the concerns of the leader and does it in a way in which, at least for those who are the most concerned about the 11 million Americans who have not had a pay increase while we in the Senate have enjoyed a $4,600 pay increase in 1 year, they would have some degree of protection. 
   Others have objected, and I join those and object with the hope that perhaps the leaders can get together and find value in what Senator DASCHLE offered as being a way to achieve the objectives of the majority leader and the Senate and still protect the interests of the minimum-wage workers in this country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take a moment at this time to review where we are on the question of the increase in the minimum wage. We have been trying to get, over the period of the last 2 years, a vote on a 2-year increase in the minimum wage--50 cents this year and 50 cents next year--for the 1 million Americans who are at the lowest level of the economic ladder. 
   These men and women are the ones working as aides for schoolteachers in our schools. They are working in nursing homes taking care of millions of our senior citizens in those conditions. These are the people who clean out the buildings at night so American businesses can continue to function effectively over the course of this extraordinary expansion. But as we see this extraordinary expansion in terms of our American economy, the group that has not benefited is the one at the lowest end of the economic ladder. These are men and women playing by the rules and working hard. They have not been able to see the appropriate kind of increases in the minimum wage. 
   If the minimum wage today were to have the same purchasing power it had in 1968, it would be $7.50 an hour. This whole group of Americans have not only not participated in the expansion of the American economy, they have fallen further and further behind. 
   That is why we believe we ought to have an opportunity to address this issue on the floor of the Senate, and do it in a timely way. 
   There are questions about what the Senate is doing and how busy the Senate is. We are prepared to have a very short time limit. Every Member of this body knows what this issue is about. I think every Member of this body has voted effectively on the question of the minimum wage over a period of time. It is a rather simple, basic, and fundamental issue. It is an issue of fairness to millions of Americans. It is an issue involving women because close to 70 percent of all of the minimum-wage workers are women. It is an issue of civil rights because the majority of the workers who get the minimum wage are men and women of color. It is a children's issue because the majority of women who are receiving the minimum wage have children. 
   This has enormous implications in terms of how these children are going to grow up, what kind of home they are going to be in, and how much time their parents are going to have in terms of spending quality time with these children when they are working one or two, and in some instances three different minimum-wage jobs. 
   It is ultimately and finally a fairness issue where the overwhelming majority of Americans believe, and believe very strongly, I think, that men and women who work 40 hours a week for 52 weeks a year ought not live in poverty in the United States of America. 
   That is what this issue is basically all about, and we in the Senate are being denied the opportunity to vote on that issue. That is what is offensive. 
   This body was prepared to vote on a pay increase of $4,600 to be implemented immediately. They were prepared to go ahead on that. They are not prepared to delay that. But when you talk about a $150 increase in the minimum wage, they want to spread it over 3 years. 
   This is an issue of fairness. People ought to have accountability. When Members go to the polls, people in their congressional and senatorial districts ought to know how they stand on this issue of fairness. We are being denied that opportunity by a majority in the Senate. That is wrong. 
   Anyone who believes we are not going to continue after this issue doesn't understand the rules of the Senate. We are going to be voting on a 2-year increase in the minimum wage. We are going to be voting on it soon, and we are going to be voting on 
   it again and again and again. So get used to it because you are going to vote on it. You will be able to go back and say: Oh, yes. I voted one time to increase it for 3 years. Yes; I voted against it 15 times for 2 years. And for all those in small business, I voted for a $73 billion tax break, unpaid for. 
   The House bill was $123 billion. We don't want to hear from that side of the aisle about fiscal responsibility anymore--$73 billion at the drop of a hat and $123 billion over in the House of Representatives and 90 percent of it goes to the top 5 percent of the American taxpayers. Isn't that interesting? 
   We are trying to get a 50-cent increase for the lowest paid Americans--tax break; 90 percent of it goes to the highest paid. We are not going to permit Members of the Senate to vote. We have a majority. We are not going to permit a majority of the Senate to vote on whether we are going to have a very simple concept of 50 cents this year--50 cents. No; we are going to take our $4,600 and put it in our pockets and walk out of here. For every single year of that, an increase in the minimum wage is being delayed. 
   Do you think they are going to forget that? The other side thinks it is going to go away. It isn't going to go away. No matter how many times these little proposals are going to come up in terms of consent agreements, no matter how many times you are going to try to close out opportunities to bring this up, no matter how many times you go through the parliamentary gymnastics on this kind of issue, it is coming back again and again and again. So get used to it because you are going to get it. You are going to vote on it. Americans are going to know who is going to stand for fairness and decency and who is opposed to it and blocked it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this legislation. The crop insurance bill before us today provides $1.5 billion over each of the next 4 years to support the Nation's farmers, and they clearly deserve this assistance. Hard-working farmers across the Nation deserve to live with dignity. Federal assistance is justified to protect them when the harsh weather destroys their crops or volatile markets undervalue their produce. 
   I hope in the coming weeks the Senate will also have an opportunity to address a related urgent need. I am talking about hunger and the inadequacy of the current Food Stamp Program. The problem is that the program's reach in curbing hunger among working families has weakened over time. It is unacceptable for children and working families to go hungry in America today. The latest research is clear, and it calls for our urgent action. 
   The General Accounting Office reports that ``children's participation in the Food Stamp Program has dropped more sharply than the number of children living in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and assistance.'' 
   Census and state food stamp data show that between 1995 and 1998, while the number of poor people fell by almost 2 million, the number of food stamp beneficiaries fell by over 7 million, leaving millions more poor people without food stamps. 
   The Department of Agriculture reports that 10.5 million U.S. households experienced some degree of food insecurity in 1998, and 1 or more people went hungry in 3.7 million of these households. 
   The Tufts University Center on Hunger and Poverty in Massachusetts reports that a third of children living in immigrant households with food stamp cuts were experiencing moderate to severe hunger. 
   With Project Bread in Massachusetts, the Center on Hunger and Poverty also coauthored an extraordinary study of Child Hunger in Massachusetts about a year ago. It was cosponsored by Ralph Martin, who was a Republican district attorney in Suffolk County, and Congressman Joseph Kennedy. They did extensive studies in Massachusetts in a wide variety of communities--some of our older cities, some of our more prosperous cities with pockets of extraordinary poverty, and then in a number of the rural areas. It is an absolutely superb report. Rather than putting the whole report in the RECORD, I will raise it throughout the discussions of hunger to come. Dr. Larry Brown directs the Center on Hunger and Poverty, and as I think most of us who have worked on the hunger issue over the years know, he has had an extraordinary career, been an invaluable resource for this Nation in terms of finding hunger and being constructive and positive in helping us deal with that issue in a constructive way. 
   One in five American children is poor in today's America. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that while the total number of children who are poor has declined, the intensity of poverty among those children who are left behind has increased, and one of the reasons poor children are poorer is that their access to food stamps is diminishing.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments and for his energy in visiting these distribution centers himself. 
   I will put in the RECORD some of the findings in a number of the distribution places in Massachusetts, with the increasing escalation of families who are receiving the benefits of these foods and increasing numbers of children, and that the total ages have gone down extensively as well. It is a very powerful and moving commentary about what is happening. 
   I agree with the Senator, at a time when we all remind ourselves every day about how strong this economy is and the significant economic progress we have made, all of that is very true, but there are a number of people in our country who are facing significant deprivation in the area of food. We want to see what can be done to try to provide some relief. We will work closely with the committee and with the chairman. I am grateful to him.

   Mr. KENNEDY. My good friend from Pennsylvania makes an excellent point about investigating hunger in his state. He has shown impressive leadership throughout our deliberations on hunger during this Congress, and helped hone our proposal to target the most urgent needs. From my many discussions with Senator SPECTER, I know that he has carefully investigated the hardships faced by his constituents in Pennsylvania. I urge every Senator in this Chamber to follow his example. In Massachusetts: 
   An eleven-year-old child in Brighton reported to investigators last year that ``Sometimes I'm really hungry. Sometimes I have nothing to eat but Cheerios and milk....... I wake up and I can't go back to sleep because I have stomach pain. Then I wake up in the morning and I feel sick. I wish that every time we need food, we just had it in the fridge.'' 
   A mother in Springfield worried, ``Should my kids sit in the dark or should they go hungry? One of my kids has multiple handicaps, so I have to pay the utility bills to have heat and light. But, then we have no food.'' 
   A 12-year-old youngster in Dorchester reports, ``When I'm hungry I feel like I'm dying. I eat ice because it fills me up with water....... When I don't eat, in school I get sleepy and bored.'' 
   When I looked at studies conducted throughout the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I found that 35 percent of Massachusetts food bank and soup kitchen clients are under 18 years old. Moreover, 63 percent of Massachusetts community food providers have reported an increase in demand for food aid in the last year, with 49 percent of programs noting an increase in demand among families with children. This evidence of ongoing urgent needs is inconsistent with the fact that 118,000 people  in Massachusetts left food stamp roles in the three years preceding September 1998 even though during this time the number of people living in poverty increased by 50,000. I think that if any Senator conducts a similar review of the data, unfortunately a similar picture will emerge.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on Saturday, March 11, an editorial in the New York Times emphasized the significant concerns about the Republican education block grant proposal which was recently approved by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. As this editorial points out, education block grants to states would not be the most effective use of public tax dollars. Block grants do nothing to ensure change and reform through proven effective methods such as a: well-qualified teacher in every classroom; reduced class sizes to give children the individual attention they need and allow teachers to maintain order and discipline; helping all children to meet high standards; and holding schools accountable for improving student achievement and giving the neediest children the extra help they need. Education is a high priority for states, communities, teachers, parents, and students throughout the country, and it is important that we listen to them as we consider the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in the full Senate in the weeks ahead.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues Senators GRASSLEY, JEFFORDS, and HARKIN in introducing the Family Opportunity Act of 2000. Our goal is to help children with disabilities by removing the health care barriers that so often prevent families from staying together and staying employed. 
   Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is enjoying today, families of disabled children and special needs children continue to struggle to keep their families together, live independently and become fully contributing members of their communities. 
   More than 8% of children in this country have significant disabilities. Yet many of them do not have access to the health services they need to maintain and prevent deterioration of their health. Too often, to obtain needed health services for their children under Medicaid, families are forced to become poor, stay poor, put their children in institutions, or give up custody of their children entirely. No parent should be faced with that unacceptable choice. 
   In a recent survey of 20 states, 64% families of special needs children report they are turning down jobs, turning down raises, turning down overtime, and are unable to save money for the future of their children and family--so that their children can stay eligible for Medicaid through SSI, the Social Security Income Program. 
   Today we are introducing legislation to close the health care gap for vulnerable families, and enable them to obtain the health care their disabled children deserve. 
   The Family Opportunity Act of 2000 will remove the unfair barriers that deny needed health care to so many disabled children and special needs children. 
   It will make health insurance coverage more widely available for children with significant current disabilities, by enabling parents to buy-in to Medicaid at an affordable rate. 
   It will enable states to develop a demonstration program to provide a Medicaid buy-in for children with potentially significant disabilities--those who will become severely disabled if they do not receive health services. 
   It will establish Family to Family Information Centers in each state to help families with special needs children. 
   The passage of the Work Incentives Improvement Act last year demonstrated the nation's commitment to help adults with disabilities obtain the health services they need, in order to lead independent and productive lives. The legislation we are introducing today makes a similar commitment to children with disabilities and their families. 
   I look forward to working with all members of Congress to enact this legislation. Disabled children and their families across the country deserve this help in achieving their dreams and participating fully in the social and economic mainstream of our nation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is making an important reform in Social Security which will benefit hundreds of thousands of senior citizens each year. Because of the action we are taking today, those between the ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work will no longer have a portion of their Social Security benefits withheld. The ``earnings test'' in current law reduces the Social Security benefits of those in the 65 to 69 age group by $1 for every $3 they earn annually over $17,000. It affects nearly eight hundred thousand men and women each year. It unfairly denies them a portion of the Social Security benefits which they have earned by a lifetime of hard work. Once this bill is signed into law, these seniors will receive the full benefits to which they are entitled whether or not they choose to remain in the workforce after age 65. President Clinton has urged Congress to repeal the earnings limit, and he will sign the bill as soon as it reaches his desk. Repeal of the earnings limit is the right thing for us to do, and now is the time for us to do it. 
   The concept of an earnings limit goes back to the Depression era when Social Security was first enacted. At that time, unemployment was high and it was hoped that the creation of Social Security would encourage older workers to retire and create openings for younger men and women who desperately needed jobs. The employment picture today is dramatically different. We face a shortage of skilled workers and our economy can benefit from the continued participation of older workers in the workforce. Their experience and sound judgment is a national resource. Men and women in their late sixties are healthier than in generations past and the majority of jobs no longer involve physical exertion. Those who choose to work beyond age 65 should not have financial barriers erected in their paths. The earnings limit in current law is such a barrier and it should be removed without further delay. 
   The most important aspect of repealing the earnings limit is that it will increase the freedom of senior citizens to work or retire as they choose. When to retire is an intensely personal decision--influenced by the individual's health, the financial needs of their family, their career interests, and the nature of the work that is available to them. The rules of Social Security should not restrict a senior's range of choice. Those who decide to continue working after age 65 and those who decide to retire should be treated equitably. Both groups should be eligible to receive the full Social Security benefits they have earned. 
   In 1996, I was pleased to join with my Senate colleagues in voting to raise the earnings limit gradually over the succeeding five years. Because of that amendment, the financial burden on thousands of senior citizens has already been reduced. With enactment of this legislation, which I wholeheartedly support, the burden of the earnings limit will be completely eliminated, so that all seniors receive full Social Security benefits, whether or not they remain in the workforce after age 65. They have earned it.  
   Several of my colleagues have used this legislation as an opportunity to voice their perspective on the future of Social Security, and they have painted a bleak picture. I strongly disagree with their characterizations. 
   Social Security is fundamentally sound. It has sufficient resources to fully fund current benefits for 35 years. Due to the gradual aging of the American population, Social Security will begin to experience a revenue shortfall after 2035. However, if we plan for the future by addressing this problem in the near term, that revenue shortfall can be eliminated with relatively minor adjustments to the system. The benefit expectations of future recipients can be preserved, and the solvency of Social Security insured for future generations. 
   We need to preserve the program as an inflation adjusted guaranteed benefit for those who depend on it to pay for the basic necessities of life. For two-thirds of America's senior citizens, Social Security retirement benefits provide more than half their annual income. For 42 percent of them, it constitutes more than three-quarters of their income. Social Security enables millions of elderly to spend their retirement years in security and dignity. Without Social Security, half the nation's elderly would be living in poverty. Converting a portion of Social Security into private investment accounts, as some have suggested, would be much too risky for elderly men and women who have no other source of financial security. 
   The major proposals which would direct a portion of each worker's payroll taxes into private accounts would all reduce the level of guaranteed Social Security benefits substantially. Whether or not a retiree made up those lost dollars would depend on factors largely beyond his or her control. Workers who reach retirement age during an economic downturn cannot simply delay their retirement indefinitely until the market goes up. Private accounts, subject to the ups and downs of the stock market, are fine as a supplement to Social Security. But, they are no substitute for Social Security. 
   President Clinton's budget proposal would use the debt service savings which will result from paying down the national debt over the next fifteen years to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund. Since the current Social Security surplus is being used to pay down the debt, it is appropriate for the Social Security Trust Fund to receive the resulting savings. More than half of the projected shortfall in the Trust Fund over the next 75 years could be eliminated by adopting this policy. If we dedicated all of the savings in debt service costs to the Social Security Trust Fund, the solvency of the system would be extended to beyond 2050, fully providing for the retirement of the baby boom generation. 
   We need to address the long term financial problems of Social Security in a way which keeps faith with the historic mission of the program--to provide senior citizens with a guaranteed, inflation adjusted benefit which will enable them to live in security and dignity. 
   I urge all my colleagues to support the Senior Citizens Freedom to Work Act. Repeal of the earnings limit will enable those who remain in the workforce beyond age 65 to receive the full Social Security benefits they have earned. It will greatly help these working seniors and it will strengthen our overall economy. It is the right thing to do.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator BOXER, for bringing this important treaty before the Senate. I am proud to be a sponsor of Senate Resolution 237, which expresses the sense of the Senate that hearings should be held by the Foreign Relations Committee on the Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. 
   The treaty establishes international standards and definitions to protect women against discrimination. The treaty also calls for action in the areas of education, health care, and domestic relations, and creates a process to monitor the status of women and their progress toward equity. The standards are fully consistent with existing U.S. protections against discrimination. In countries that do not have such protections, this treaty is an effective tool to combat violence against women, reform unfair inheritance and property rights, and strengthen women's access to fair employment and economic opportunity.  
   165 countries have not ratified the treaty. As the country that consistently leads the way in the battle for human rights and human dignity, and that took an active role in drafting the treaty, it is past time for the United States to ratify it as well. 
   U.S. support for women's equality at home and abroad requires that we promptly consider and ratify this treaty. I urge the Senate to pass this resolution and to do all we can to expedite the ratification of this important treaty. 
   To move our country in that direction, the Foreign Relations Committee should hold a hearing.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes. 
   I ask my friend and colleague from California, there was reference made on the Senate floor a few moments ago about a Los Angeles Daily Journal article that reviewed a variety of Judge Paez's rulings, which I think is fair to point out. 
   I wonder whether the Senator could confirm that in that Daily Journal review, seven cases were selected by the Los Angeles Daily Journal that would most effectively test the ability of Judge Paez to serve on the Ninth Circuit. The Journal asked 15 experts, including a fair balance of liberal and conservative law professors and attorneys, to evaluate Judge Paez's legal rulings. The Journal concluded:  
   The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased, even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, only to be trapped into a seemingly never-ending and bitterly polarized nomination process....... Of the 15 legal experts who examined Paez's ruling for the Daily Journal, 13 praised them, using descriptions such as ``clear, concise, and straightforward,'' ``clearly written and carefully reasoned,'' and ``scholarly and thorough.''  
   This is the import of the Los Angeles Daily Journal, as I understand. One could draw, perhaps, a different conclusion from the earlier references. 
   Would the Senator agree my characterization was a more accurate characterization than referenced earlier?

   Mr. KENNEDY. It was a reference to an objective evaluation. In that evaluation, the reviewers came to the same conclusion that the Bar Association arrived at, which was that the cause of justice in the Ninth Circuit would be well served and the people highly served with his confirmation. 
   I join with my friend and colleague from California, as well as others, in urging the favorable consideration of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. They are exceptional nominees who have waited far too long for action. 
   The delay in reviewing the nominations is a case study in the failure of the Senate to deal effectively with judicial nominations. That failure has left the courts with 29 judicial emergencies, and is the result of the Senate's adbication of its constitutional responsibility to act on judicial nominees. 
   Marsha Berzon, as the Senator has pointed out, is an outstanding attorney. She is a graduate of Harvard/Radcliffe College and the University of California Law School. She clerked for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court--rare commendations for a young lawyer. 
   Nationally known as an appellate litigator in a highly regarded San Francisco law firm, she has written more than 100 briefs and petitions. She received strong recommendations from a bipartisan list of supporters, from major law enforcement organizations, and from those who have opposed her in court. 
   As our chairman, Senator HATCH, commented last June, Marsha Berzon ``is one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.'' 
   It reflects poorly on the Senate that such a gifted lawyer was denied a vote on the Senate for so long. 
   The Senate's shabby and insulting treatment of Richard Paez is worse. He has almost two decades of judicial experience and received the highest rating from the American Bar Association. He was first nominated more than 4 years ago to serve in the Ninth Circuit. Judge Paez graduated from Brigham Young University and 
   Boalt Hall Law School. Early in his career, he represented low-income clients. He later served in the Los Angeles Municipal Court, and the Los Angeles Superior Court, the California Court of Appeals, and 5 years ago he was nominated and appointed to the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. 
   Clearly, Judge Paez has the experience and the ability to serve with great distinction on the Ninth Circuit. He has the support of former California state judge and Republican Congressman JIM ROGAN, as well as the Sheriff, the District Attorney, and the Police Officers Association of Los Angeles. 
   We rarely have two nominees who are as well qualified with the breadth of support these nominees have. We are fortunate to have these two nominees who are willing to serve in the judiciary. What they have been put through in terms of the failure of this body to act, I think, is indeed unfortunate. 
   Now we do have that opportunity. I join with all of my colleagues to urge the approval of both of these nominees. Since his nomination in January 1996, 4 years ago, Judge Paez has been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee twice. Surely he deserves an affirmative vote by the full Senate. It is  time for the Senate to stop abusing its power. 
   Over 200 years ago, the Framers of the Constitution created a system of checks and balances to ensure that excessive power is not concentrated in any branch of government. The President was given the authority to nominate federal judges with the advise and consent the Senate. The clear intent was for the Senate to work with the President, not against him, in this process. 
   In recent years, however, by refusing to take timely action on so many of the President's nominees, the Senate has abdicated its responsibility. 
   Both of these nominees are uniquely well qualified. Both have demonstrated outstanding qualities and abilities to serve in the courts of this country and serve the cause of justice in this nation. I hope both of them will be speedily approved by the Senate. 
   At long last the Senate is considering the nominations of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez for the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. They are both exceptional nominees who have waited far too long for action by the Senate. Indeed, the delay in reviewing these nominations is a case study in the failure of the Senate to deal effectively with judicial nominations. That failure has left the courts with 29 judicial emergencies, and is the result of the Senate's abdication of its constitutional responsibility to act on judicial nominees. 
   Marsha Berzon is an outstanding attorney with an impressive record. She is a graduate of Harvard/Radcliffe College and the Boalt Hall Law School at the University of California, Berkeley. She clerked for both the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   She is currently a nationally known appellate litigator with a highly regarded San Francisco law firm. She has written more than 100 briefs and petitions in the Supreme Court, and has argued four cases there. She has received strong recommendations from a bipartisan list of supporters, from major law enforcement organizations, and from those who have opposed her in court. She has argued in many U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeals, U.S. District Courts, and at all levels of the California state court system. She has represented numerous private clients, as well as the governments of the States of California and Hawaii, and the City of Oakland, California. Senator HATCH commented last June that Marsha Berzon, ``is one of the best lawyers I've ever seen.'' She was first nominated by President Clinton on January 27, 1998--over two years ago--and it reflects poorly on the Senate that such a gifted lawyer was denied a vote by the full Senate for so long. 
   The Senate's shabby and insulting treatment of Judge Richard Paez is even worse. He has almost two decades of judicial experience. He received the highest rating from the American Bar Association, and was first nominated more than four years ago--more than four years ago--to serve on the Ninth Circuit. 
   Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and Boalt Hall Law School. Early in his career, he represented low income clients. He later served on the Los Angeles Municipal Court, the Los Angeles Superior Court, and the California Court of Appeals. Five years ago, Judge Paez was appointed to the United States District Court for the Central District of California. 
   Clearly, Judge Paez has the experience and the ability to serve with great distinction on the Ninth Circuit. He has the support of former California state judge and Republican Congressman JIM ROGAN, as well as the Sheriff, the District Attorney, and the Police Chiefs' Association of Los Angeles County. 
   Since 1991, Judge Paez has been appointed twice by the chief justice of the California Supreme Court to serve as a member of the California Judicial Council, the policy-making body for the California judiciary. 
   Last month, the Los Angeles Daily Journal reviewed a variety of Judge Paez's rulings, and selected seven cases that would most effectively test his ability to serve on the Ninth Circuit. The Journal then asked fifteen experts, including a fair balance of conservative and liberal law professors and attorneys--to evaluate Judge Paez's legal rulings. As the Journal concluded,  
   The portrait that emerged is of a thoughtful, unbiased and even-tempered judge, propelled into the political spotlight, only to be trapped in a seemingly never-ending and bitterly polarized nomination process....... Of the 15 legal experts who examined Paez's rulings for the Daily Journal, 13 praised them, using descriptions such as ``clear, concise and straightforward,'' ``clearly written and carefully reasoned,'' and ``scholarly and thorough.'' 
   Even the ruling subjected to the greatest scrutiny was complimented by other prominent legal experts. 
   In its evaluation of Judge Paez, The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary notes that attorneys have praised him highly in the following terms. They say he is one of the smartest judges on the bench; he rates a 12 or 13 on a scale of one to 10; he is highly competent; he's very professional; and he's always fair. Despite what some contend, he is not anti-business, he is not anti-religion. He is a well-respected and right-minded judge. 
   Since his nomination in January 1996--over four years ago--Judge Paez has been approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee twice. Surely, he deserves an affirmative vote by the full Senate. 
   It is time for the Senate to stop abusing its power over nominations. Over 200 years ago, the Framers of the Constitution created a system of checks and balances to ensure that excessive power was not concentrated in any branch of government. The President was given the authority to nominate federal judges with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
   The clear intent was for the Senate to work with the President--not against him--in this process. In recent years, however, by refusing to take timely action on so many of the President's nominees, the Senate has abdicated its responsibility. By doing so, the Senate has seriously undermined the judicial branch of our government. 
   This kind of partisan stonewalling is irresponsible and unacceptable. It's hurting the courts, and it's hurting the country. Chief Justice William Rehnquist felt so strongly about the long delays in acting on nominees that he sharply criticized the Senate in his 1997 Year-End Report,  
   Judicial vacancies can contribute to a backlog of cases, undue delays in civil cases, and stopgap measures to shift judicial personnel where they are most needed. Vacancies cannot remain at such high levels indefinitely without eroding the quality of justice that traditionally has been associated with the federal judiciary . . . Whatever the size of the federal judiciary, the president should nominate candidates with reasonable promptness, and the Senate should act within a reasonable time to confirm or reject them . . . The Senate is, of course, very much a part of the appointment process for any Article III judge. One nominated by the President is not ``appointed'' until confirmed by the Senate. The Senate is surely under no obligation to confirm any particular nominee, but after the necessary time for inquiry it should vote him up or vote him down.  
   Little has changed since Chief Justice Rehnquist made that statement in 1997. For decades, the average time from nomination to a final vote on a judicial nominee was 91 days. But in 1998, the delay more than doubled--to 232 days. Of the 65 judges confirmed in 1998, only 12 were confirmed in 91 days or fewer. 
   The trend continued in 1999. As of February 24, 2000, the average time between nomination and confirmation in the current Congress is 152 days. 
   In addition, it is women and minorities who have suffered the most during the impasse over judicial nominations. According to one study, it took an average of 60 days longer for non-whites than whites and 65 days longer for women than men to be considered by the Senate in the last Congress. Minorities have failed to win confirmation at a 35% higher rate than white candidates. In 1999, six out of the ten nominees who waited the longest were women and minorities. 
   While the Senate plays political games with the judiciary, the backlog of cases continues to pile up in the courts and undermines our judicial system. There are currently 76 vacant federal judgeships. Several more are likely to become vacant in the coming months, as more and more judges retire from the federal bench. Of the current vacancies, 29 have been classified as ``judicial emergencies'' by the Judicial Conference of the United States. That means that they have been vacant for 18 months or longer. Thirty-  four nominees are currently waiting for Senate action. Three nominees are pending on the Senate floor, 3 are waiting for a vote in Committee, and all the others are waiting for a Judiciary Committee hearing. Only four judges have been confirmed by the Senate so far this year. 
   The effect of Senate inaction is clear. At the circuit court level in Texas, the court's workload has increased 65% over the past nine years, with no increase in judges and three vacancies. In California in 1997, 600 hearings had to be canceled because of the large number of vacancies. This slowdown in judicial confirmations is jeopardizing the integrity and viability of our judicial system. 
   The Senate has a constitutional duty to work with the President to confirm judicial nominees--particularly at a time when Congress is shifting more responsibility to the courts. Members should not use the excuse of an election year to stall this process. In 1988 the Democratic-controlled Congress confirmed 42 judicial nominees, and in 1992, they confirmed 66. 
   Opponents of Berzon and Paez argue that the high reversal rates of the 9th Circuit by the Supreme Court are proof that the Ninth Circuit is too liberal. This argument is false and a poor excuse for Republican stonewalling. In fact, from 1998 to 1999, five circuits had reversal rates higher than or equal to the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit reversal rate was lower than the combined reversal rate of the state appellate courts. And from 1996 to 1997--the year that critics point to--the Ninth Circuit had lower reversal rates than the Second, Fifth, Seventh, D.C., and Federal Circuits. As Chief Judge of the Ninth Circuit, Procter Hug, Jr., has written,  
   ..... the reversal rate has little to do with the effectiveness of any circuit court of appeals. For example, the 13, 14, or 20 cases reversed in a term were out of 4,500 cases decided on the merits in the Ninth Circuit. The reversal rate in any circuit should also have little to do with the nomination or confirmation of judges to fill vacancies on a court.  
   The Senate has a constitutional obligation to fill the existing judicial vacancies. After such long delays, a vote in favor of Marsha Berzon and Richard Paez would be a significant step in the right direction. I urge my colleagues to support both of these highly qualified nominees.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senate action on Timothy Dyk's nomination to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit is long overdue. He has waited almost two years for this vote. Yet he is a nationally known and exceptionally well-regarded attorney who received a ``Qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association and was well received by the Senate Judiciary Committee. He deserves a favorable vote by the Senate here today. 
   Mr. Dyk is an honors graduate of both Harvard College and Harvard Law School. After graduation he served as a law clerk for Chief Justice Earl Warren, and for Justices Stanley Reed and Harold Burton. He served in the Justice Department for a year in the early 1960's and has spent the last 37 years as a distinguished and highly respected attorney in private practice in Washington, DC. He has argued cases before the Supreme Court and in numerous Federal courts of appeals, including five cases before the Federal Circuit. He clearly has the qualifications and ability to serve on the Federal Circuit with great distinction. 
   Mr. Dyk's nomination is supported by a variety of corporations and organizations, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers, the National Association of Broadcasters, the Labor Policy Association, the American Trucking Association, Kodak, and IBM. 
   Timothy Dyk is highly qualified to serve on the Federal Circuit. He should have been confirmed long ago, and I urge my colleagues to approve his nomination today.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   The Teacher Quality amendment would strike the underlying Coverdell K-through-12 tax breaks and authorize $2 billion for the Qualified Teacher in Every Classroom Act. The amendment would direct the $1.2 billion from the Coverdell bill to the teacher quality program, and the other would consist of an authorization for appropriations at a later time. 
   We have had a debate about the Coverdell tax bill over the last few days. One of the things we are asking the Senate to consider is whether we ought to be putting the $1.2 billion equally between the public and private schools, even though 90 percent of the children in this country go to public schools, or whether we can use those resources more effectively. 
   I believe they can be used more effectively. That is what this amendment is about. As an alternative to the Coverdell tax bill, I offer this amendment on behalf of my colleagues to say let us move our Nation forward to insist that we are going to have a well-qualified teacher in every classroom--that the key to enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment is not going to be subject to just any one single or simple solution but certainly among a handful of solutions. I suggest perhaps the most important one is to make sure that a teacher, who is before the 50 million children who are going through K through 12, is going to be well qualified to teach effectively with regard to the academic subject in which the teacher teaches. That is the purpose of this amendment. 
   It is reasonable to ask, where did you come up with these various proposals that you have in this qualified teacher amendment? I refer my colleagues to a very important study from 1996, the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future in Education. The board itself is made up of some of the most distinguished educators and is bipartisan in nature. 
   We have effectively incorporated in our amendment the series of recommendations this panel virtually unanimously recommended including: how to recruit individuals who will be the best for the students in this country; how we will maintain them by the development of mentoring programs; how we will ensure professional development and; how to utilize and expand some of the imaginative and creative efforts to develop teachers, including hometown teachers, which are developed within various constituencies, and expanding Troops to Teachers, which currently has 3,600 teachers nationwide. 
   What did this panel, made up of some of our best educators and most thoughtful teachers in the country, conclude virtually unanimously? This commission starts with three simple premises: First, what teachers know and can do is the most important influence on what students learn; second, recruiting, preparing and retaining good teachers is the central strategy for improving our schools; and, third, school reform cannot succeed unless it focuses on creating the conditions in which teachers can teach--and teach well. 
   Those are the principles. I wonder how anyone in this body could question those rather basic, common sense principles, a well-qualified teacher in every classroom. This study has indicated how that best can be done, and we have followed these various recommendations. 
   First of all, they talk about some problems. They are talking about education generally. Some problems are national in scope and require special attention. Critical areas such as math and science have long had shortages of qualified teachers that were only temporarily solved by Federal recruitment centers during the 
   post-Sputnik years. Currently, more than 40 percent of math teachers and 30 percent of science teachers are not fully qualified. They recognize there has to be a particular focus on math and science teachers, and we incorporate that in our legislation. 
   Secondly, it talks about, how we distributed the funds, basically the same formula that was used by our Republican colleagues when they had a proposal to try to deal with the teacher shortage. That falls short for many different reasons. We had hoped to be able to get into that if we had continued our markup in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee yesterday. Nonetheless, what we are basically doing is saying we will have a program in terms of recruitment, we will have a program in terms of mentoring. 
   We find there is a very important and significant contrast with the results of maintaining teachers with a mentoring program; we have 23% of teachers leave within their first three years of teaching, and 30-50% leave within the first three to five years. Yet 93% of teachers taking part in mentoring programs stayed on the job--far above the rate for new teachers. 
   Let's take what we know works. Let's make sure that when we are going out and recruiting the teachers, they are going to be recruited in the areas of most critical need; that is, in math and science. Let's make sure that when they go into the classroom, they are going to be well prepared in their courses. 
   This amendment will insist that these teachers are going to qualify according to the State requirements in the course they have selected. No other legislation is going to do that. It is going to make sure they have a mentoring program. We will also make sure that there is going to be professional development, that very important third factor this study has pointed out. They mention in this study that most U.S. teachers have no regular time to consult together or learn about new teaching strategies, unlike their peers in many of the European nation countries, which teach at a substantial time plan and at a higher level. 
   What this amendment is about is very simple and fundamental. We are saying it is a wiser use of taxpayer funds to move us to an effective program in terms of ensuring we will have a well-trained teacher in every classroom, rather than having the tax credits, only half of which will even be available to parents whose children will be going to public schools, the other half to the parents of children who will be going to the private schools. 
   Having well-qualified teachers is absolutely essential. Now, we can argue--and we have colleagues on our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee who say this really isn't a role for the Federal Government. We know we provide only 7 cents out of every dollar that comes from the Federal Government and goes into the local communities. It comes through the States--about 98 cents of the dollars that come through the Federal Government actually go into the classrooms themselves, according to the General Accounting Office. 
   What we are saying is, with a very limited amount of resources, we ought to target areas where there are very important needs and where there is a very sound and compelling case to be made in support of it. Certainly, I think that of all of the areas we are talking about in terms of classrooms today, we are all reminded by recent tragedies about the importance of safety and security in the classroom--we are reminded constantly about that issue. 
   Secondly, we are reminded that there is nothing more important than having  well-trained teachers. That is why we think this amendment is so important and so compelling.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, let me review specifically exactly how this amendment works. Our amendment provides the States with $1.7 billion by a formula--50 percent poverty, 50 percent population--to improve the teacher quality. States can keep up to 10 percent for State activities, including strategies to raise teacher salaries, reduce the number of teachers placed out of field, and reduce the number of emergency certified teachers. 
   Second, this guarantees that 56 percent of the funds that go to the States--$960 million--is for professional development and mentoring, which provides for 200,000 new teachers a year. We know we need 2 million teachers over the next 10 years, or 200,000 a year. This will provide the mentoring for those 200,000 teachers each year. Funds go by formula to the districts on the basis of 75 percent poverty, 25 percent population. That allocation, in terms of poverty population, is basically noncontroversial. It is basically the formula we have used in the past and is the formula being used even under the current legislation being considered. 
   This guarantees that 30 percent of the funds that would go to the States for competitive local recruitment programs in high-need districts, to recruit and train highly qualified candidates. 
   Next, it guarantees that teachers are trained to address the needs of children with disabilities. None of the other teacher programs or teacher training programs ensures that we are going to have teachers who will be able to teach children with disabilities--it is enormously important. 
   It holds the States accountable for having a qualified teacher in every classroom within 4 years of enactment of the law. 
   It requires that the first $300 million of the State grants go toward professional development, the mentoring and recruitment in the math and science area. There is an incredible need there. Ninety-five percent of urban districts report a critical need for math teachers; 98 percent report the need in science; 97 percent report a need for special education teachers. That is what the current reports are. That is why we have given focus in terms of the recruitment in math and science. 
   It also holds districts accountable for results. They must show progress in: improved student performance; increased participation in sustained professional development and mentoring; reduced beginning teacher attrition rate for the district and; reduced number of teachers who aren't certified or licensed and the number who are out-of-field teachers for the district. 
   Listen to what the Wall Street Journal reported on February 29:  
   Schools turn to temp agencies for substitute teachers. Most school districts begin each day with a nerve-racking hunt for substitutes to fill in for absent teachers. With the tight labor market making the task especially tough, a few are starting to outsource the job. Kelly Services, Inc. unveiled the first nationwide substitute teacher program four months ago and now handles screening and scheduling for 20 schools in 10 States. 
   A school official in Edinburg, Indiana, says the contract the system signed this month with Kelly simply acknowledges ``they're more proficient than we are'' in the temporary help arena. Temp outfits generally charge schools a premium while paying subs at the same rate as before. 
   That is what is happening in the United States of America. That is what is happening. Last year, 50,000 unqualified teachers were hired across the country and are appearing before classrooms of children today--50,000 hired last year appearing before them today. We ought to be able to say, OK, we only have a limited amount of resources; how are we going to be able to expend those resources effectively? 
   I believe the case has been made about having a well-qualified teacher in every classroom, having smaller class sizes, having afterschool programs that do so much in terms of helping and assisting children in doing homework and keeping the children out of trouble--a program, I might point out, that still has a broad opportunity to reach hundreds of thousands more children. 
   It is important to make sure we have the new technology, so children are able to learn with new computers. Various studies show that it takes time for teachers to get up to speed--not just in using the computers, but in training the teachers to use computers in ways that are going to be consistent with the curriculum they are trained to teach. We are not doing that. 
   And then we know there is obviously the pathway in continuing in higher education. These are the components and the elements that are being offered out here. The bottom line on the issue of accountability has been to make sure the scarce resources that we have are actually going to be utilized in an effective way with effective results. 
   I recognize that starting in 1965 when we started the ESEA program, we expended a good deal of resources and we didn't have the kind of accountability we should have had. But what we have seen is that over the period, particularly since the last reauthorization, where we are beginning to make some progress--measurable progress--we will hear speeches that, oh, no, we are not making progress, we are falling further behind. Certainly, there are some schools where progress still hasn't been made. But if you are looking across the board, we are making measurable progress. I think we should find out what is happening, and what is best to continue that measured progress. 
   When we look over the range of different activities that are out there today, how can we measure the activities? One of the important ways we measure it is by the various programs such as Project STAR in the State of Tennessee, where students in smaller class sizes performed better than student in large classes in each grade from kindergarten throughout third grade. 
   The second one, which I think should be self-evident and obvious, is having teachers in front of classes who are qualified to teach in the subject matter. 
   The third is the afterschool programs that assist children with their homework, and offer availability and accessibility of computers to make sure they are going to keep up to speed with technology. 
   When we have limited resources and have an opportunity to focus some of these scarce resources on a needed national problem, we ought to be willing to consider what the overwhelming majority of thoughtful educators, Presidents, practitioners, and individuals who have studied education over the course of a lifetime have virtually unanimously recommended: Increasing teachers' knowledge of academic content and effective teaching skills through sustained, intensive professional development; mentoring programs to keep new teachers in the job; and recruitment programs to draw talented individuals into the teaching profession. That is really what our proposal does. 
   I see my colleague and friend, the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN. I have stated many times, with the progress made in the various programs, that Senator BINGAMAN has been the leader in the Senate in making sure that whatever resources are going to be accounted for, are accounted for effectively in every one of these educational programs. He has done that in other programs as well but particularly in the education. We have incorporated his recommendations into this legislation. We know that at the end of the day we are going to have improved school performance, we are going to have teachers who are going to be able to teach and pass the State exams, and we know we are going to hold the States and local communities accountable.  
   I see him now. I would be glad to yield. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his statement. He has, as I mentioned, enormously contributed in terms of these accountability provisions. 
   Professional development, mentoring, and the recruitment have been found to be important and significant in communities across the country. Let me mention some of the examples. 
   Since the late 1980s, New York City's District 2 has invested in sustained, intensive, professional development and made it the central component for improving schools. The district believes student learning will increase as the knowledge of educators grows--and it is working. The investment has contributed to steady increases in student achievement and in 1996, student math scores were second in the city. 
   According to a recent study, the longer California math teachers engaged in ongoing, curriculum-centered and professional development, that supported a reform-oriented teaching practice, the better their students did on the State math assessments. 
   This demonstrates what is happening out there. It is happening in too few districts. Let's make sure we are going to do it in other places across the country. 
   In the area of mentoring and recruitment, in Illinois, the Golden Apple Scholars Program recruits promising young men and women for teaching professions by selecting them during their junior year in high school, then mentoring them through the rest of high school, college, and 5 years of actual teaching. Sixty of the Golden Apple scholars enter the teaching field each year; 90 percent of them are staying in the classroom compared to 50 percent of others dropping out within their first five years. 
   These are young people, recruited locally, involved through high school, attending various kinds of meetings and conferences on education, furthering their efforts through college, coming back to their communities. 
   I have visited programs similar to this in Dade County, FL. They have had extraordinary success locally. That is what we are talking about. 
   Project Promise at Colorado State University recruits prospective teachers from fields such as law, geology, chemistry, stock trading, and medicine. Current teachers mentor these new recruits in the first 2 years of teaching. More than 90 percent of the recruits enter the field and 80 percent stay in the teaching for at least 5 years. 
   There are some very creative ways of recruiting. A North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program recruits talented high school students in the teaching profession with a minimum 1,100 SAT score, higher that 3.6 GPA, and in the top 10 percent of the class. The program provides $5,000 per year for 4 years to 400 outstanding North Carolina high school seniors who agree to teach for 4 years, following graduation in one of the North Carolina public schools or U.S. Government schools. They find they are retaining some 90 percent of these teachers. 
   There is a similar program called Teach Boston, a collaborative effort between Boston Public Schools, Boston Private Industry Council, and Boston Teachers Union. They created model future teacher academies in two Boston high schools. 
   There are different ways of doing this. We give local communities the flexibility in the development of the programs. We say to those who want to do this kind of a program in their local community that there will be some resources that will be available to them. 
   The Hometown Program provides $25 million to support the efforts of high-poverty school districts to recruit teachers as early as the high school to meet long-term teacher shortages. Currently, 20 districts--including Wichita, Milwaukee, Wayne County, North Carolina, and States, including South Carolina, Ohio, and Washington--have pipeline systems for long-term programs for teacher recruitment. 
   In South Carolina, between 35 and 40 percent of students who complete the State Teacher Cadet Corps either become or plan to become teachers. Currently, there are approximately 5,000 graduates of the Teacher Cadet Corps serving as teachers in South Carolina. Independent evaluators of the South Carolina program have found one former cadet entered college with a jump-start on the teacher education program, and two reported a higher rating than other teachers. They have raised standards for classmates in college.  
   In Wichita, KS, 70 participate in the Grow Your Own Teacher projects and completed their college education; 58 are currently employed as teachers in the Wichita public schools. 
   These programs are around the country but in too few places. We are saying we will provide some $25 million to support those programs that have worked. 
   Finally, the success of the Troops to Teachers. They have 
   hired over 3,600 teachers nationwide. These teachers are likely to be in math and science, and more likely to be minorities than the general recruitment of high school teachers. There are more than 85 percent male, compared to 25 percent nationally--from the Troops to Teachers program. They are teaching in over 900 rural counties, 25 percent; 40 percent are in suburban areas; 40 percent in urban. They have an 82-percent retention rate, returning each year to teaching. 
   We have a significant expansion of that program. The opportunities are out there. California has hired nearly 300 teachers from the Troops to Teachers, including a former Navy pilot who used to hunt submarines and now faces two dozen kindergarten students. He says it does not pay as much but the job satisfaction is incredible. Florida hired 200 Troops to Teachers, including a former Navy instructor who now teachers honors algebra to high school students. The students say he gets excited and he definitely knows what he is talking about. The teacher took a pay cut but he enjoys the kids and enjoys the school. 
   Today, we are talking about Kelly Girls--or Kelly Men--as substitute teachers advertised in the Wall Street Journal this week. We are talking about limited resources. 
   We have recommended smaller class sizes, which are key and have demonstrated effectiveness; well-trained teachers, with the support of mentoring; professional development; afterschool programs; computer programs so children will not be left out or left behind; and strong accountability measures. We believe these are the ways we can make important difference in terms of enhancing the academic opportunities for children in this country. 
   My friend and colleague from the State of Washington has been our leader in moving this Nation toward smaller class sizes. Having visited a number of the schools in my own State of Massachusetts, it is making a major difference. We want to make sure that effort is going to be continued. 
   I yield such time as the Senator desires.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been almost a year since the tragic shooting at Columbine High School. In literally dozens of cases since then, youths have brought guns to schools, and there have been at least four school shootings since Columbine. Yet in spit of wake-up call after wake-up call after wake-up call, Congress has failed to act. 
   It is time for Congress to finish the job we began last year and pass the gun control provisions in the juvenile justice legislation. Students, parents, and teachers across America are waiting for our answer. 
   We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early warning signals and act before violence occurs. 
   We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from criminals and children. 
   We need to close the gun show loophole. 
   Above all, we need to require child safety locks on firearms, so that we can do all we can to prevent the senseless shocking first grade shooting that occurred two days ago in an elementary school in Michigan. 
   The Senate passed such legislation with overwhelming support last year. The House of Representatives also passed its own version of this legislation. It is time for House and Senate conferees to write the final bill and send it to the President, so that effective legislation is in place as soon as possible. 
   Every day we delay, this critical problem of gun violence affecting schools and children continues to fester. This is not a new problem, but as this week's events have shown, it is an increasingly serious problem, and Congress cannot look the other way and continue to ignore it. 
   The public overwhelmingly supports more effective steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and juveniles. We cannot accept ``NO'' for an answer from the National Rifle Association. It is long past time for Congress to face up to this challenge. The continuing  school shootings are an urgent call to action to every Member of Congress. Will we finally do what it takes to keep children safe? Or will we continue to sleepwalk through this worsening crisis of gun violence in our schools and our society? 
   The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. Each new tragedy is a fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly. 
   We have a national crisis, and common sense approaches are urgently needed. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time to act is now. There is no reason why this Congress cannot enact this needed legislation now. This month the citizens of this country deserve better than what this do-nothing Congress has given them so far.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we all know, there are scarce education resources. The Federal Government only  provides 7 cents out of every dollar. The question is: How are we going to use those scarce resources? 
   This amendment is basic and fundamental. It says we need a well-trained, qualified teacher in front of every classroom in America. That is what this amendment provides. We know we need 2 million teachers over the next 10 years. We are training 200,000. This last year, we employed 50,000 unqualified teachers. 
   The situation has become so desperate that the Wall Street Journal now shows the ad of Kelly Services which unveiled for the first time nationwide substitute teachers. 
   This amendment is simple. It provides assistance to local communities to recruit qualified teachers, provides current teachers with professional development, and it provides 200,000 new teachers a year with trained mentors. My amendment also holds States and schools accountable for the results. 
   This seems to be a wiser way to expend scarce resources than the underlying bill, and I hope it will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I desire to speak for 1 minute on the Bingaman-Kennedy amendment. 
   This amendment Senator BINGAMAN and I offer is a very simple amendment. It basically takes the amount that is being appropriated, identified here under the Coverdell amendment, and rather than using it in creating the Coverdell approach on the education, it uses it to help and assist the Pell grants. It effectively increases the Pell grant by some $250. The Pell grants, then, would be available to those who are eligible under the Pell Grant Program.  
   It seems to me that program is targeted toward well-qualified, needy students attempting to continue their education. I think that is a preferable way of allocating the resources that are included in the Coverdell amendment.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is especially appropriate that the Senate is debating education reform today, because today is Read Across America Day. The National Education Association deserves great credit for bringing together the nation's leading education, literacy, and community organizations to help children in communities across the Nation experience the joy of reading. 
   Reading is the foundation of learning and the golden door to opportunity. But too many children fail to read at an acceptable level. For students who don't learn to read well in the early years of elementary school, it is virtually impossible to keep up in the later years. That's why literacy programs are so important. They give young children practical opportunities to learn to read and practice reading. We also need to do all we can to encourage children and parents to read together. That's why Read Across America Day is so important. 
   I am also proud of other programs that take place throughout the year to encourage reading. In October 1998, Congress passed the Reading Excellence Act to provide competitive reading and literacy grants to states. The purpose of the program is to help high-need schools teach children to read in their early childhood years. In addition to classroom instruction, the program helps teachers to improve their teaching. It also expands the number of high-quality family literacy programs, works with local and national organizations to ensure that children have access to books, and provides early literacy assistance for children with reading difficulties. 
   Last August, Massachusetts was one of only 17 states to receive funds under this competitive grant. The Massachusetts Department of Education distributed these funds to local school districts throughout the State. The program builds on the America Reads initiative. In 1996, President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton designed a new effort to call national attention to child literacy by proposing the ``America Reads Challenge,'' which encourages colleges and universities to earmark a portion of their Work-Study funds for college students willing to serve as literacy tutors. Institutions of higher education across Massachusetts are already creating strong ties with surrounding communities, and participation in the initiative enhances those relationships. Today, over 1,000 colleges and universities across the country are committed to the President's ``America Reads Work Study Program,'' and 73 of these institutions are in Massachusetts. I'm proud of the strong national commitment that we are making to help every child read well. By working together, we can make a significant difference for children across the country. 
   Last year I celebrated ``Read Across America Day'' with students from Squantum Elementary School in Massachusetts. The students and teachers have an excellent slogan--``Drop Everything and Read.'' For at least 15 minutes a day, the school does just that. But if we truly want to help all children learn to read early and well, every day should be Read Across America Day.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support of Senator ROBB's amendment to provide funding for rebuilding and modernizing the nation's schools. The Coverdell bill does nothing for crumbling schools. 
   Schools, communities, and governments at every level have to do more to improve student achievement. Schools need smaller classes, particularly in the early grades. They need stronger parent involvement. They need well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep up with current developments in their field and the best teaching practices. They need after-school instruction for students who need extra help, and after-school programs to engage students in constructive activities. They need safe, modern facilities with up-to-date technology. 
   But, all of these reforms will be undermined if facilities are inadequate. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded facilities sends a message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can to ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings. 
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school buildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in almost every community, urban, rural, or suburban. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, large numbers of communities across the country need to build new schools, in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollments have reached an all-time high again this year of 53.2 million students, and will continue to rise over the next ten years. The number will increase by 324,000 in 2000, by another 282,000 in 2001, by still another 250,000 in 2002, and continue on an upward trend in the following years. 
   Last year, the Senate heard testimony from a student in Clifton, Virginia whose high school is so overcrowded that fights often break out in the overflowing halls. The problem is called ``Hall Rage,'' and it's analogous to ``Road Rage'' on crowded highways. The violence in the hallways is bad enough. But it's even worse, because it's difficult for teachers to teach when students are distracted by the chaos in the hallways and outside the classrooms. 
   The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools will be needed by 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments. The General Accounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion to repair and modernize the nation's schools. Congress should lend a helping hand and do all we can to help schools and communities across the country meet this challenge. 
   In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of schools report at lest one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And 36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems. 
   In Detroit, over half--150 of the 263--school buildings were built before 1930. Their average age is 61 years old, and some date to the 1800's. Detroit estimates that the city has $5 billion in unmet repair and new construction needs. Detroit voters recently approved a $1.5 billion, 15-year school construction program, but it's not enough. 
   In an elementary school in Montgomery, Alabama, a ceiling which had been damaged by leaking water collapsed only 40 minutes after the children had left for the day. 
   At Cresthaven Elementary School in Silver Spring, Maryland, a second-grade reading class has to squeeze through a narrow corridor with a sink on one side into a space about 14 ft. wide by 15 ft. long. The area used to be a janitor's office, and the teacher has no place to sit. 
   Schools across the country are struggling to meet needs such as these, but they can't do it alone. The federal government should join with state and local governments and community organizations to guarantee that all children have the opportunity for a good education in safe and up-to-date school buildings. The Robb amendment is an excellent start on this high priorities, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator BINGAMAN's amendment  to ensure greater accountability by Title I schools that are low-performing. The Coverdell bill does nothing to help improve public schools that need assistance. Instead it diverts scarce resources to wealthy families in private schools, when 90 percent of the nation's students attend public schools. 
   Stronger accountability in the nation's education system is essential. Effective accountability measures--what business leaders call quality control--can make sure that investments in schools are used wisely and produce better results for children. Accountability is especially important in schools with high concentrations of disadvantaged students, so that all students will have the opportunity to meet high standards of achievement. 
   Despite concerted efforts by states, school districts, and schools, accountability provisions in title I have not been adequately implemented due to insufficient resources. In 1998, only 8 states reported that school support teams have been able to serve the majority of schools that need improvement. Less than half of the schools identified as in need of improvement in 1997-98 reported that they received additional professional development assistance or technical assistance. 
   We cannot afford to let low-performing public schools slip through the cracks. Schools and school districts need additional support and resources to remedy weaknesses as soon as they are identified. We should act now to make our schools more accountable for the benefit of the nation's disadvantaged students. These students have already spent too much time in low-performing schools, and they deserve better, much better. The time is now to take action to fix these schools. The nation's children deserve no less. I urge the Senate to support the Bingaman amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator MURRAY's amendment to provide $1.2 billion dollars to help reduce class size in the early grades by hiring 100,000 new teachers. The Coverdell bill does nothing to help improve public schools that need assistance. Instead it diverts scare resources to wealthy families in private schools, when 90% of the nation's students attend public schools. 
   Research has documented what parents and teachers have always known intuitively--smaller classes improve student achievement. In small classes, students receive more individual attention and instruction. Students with learning disabilities are identified earlier, and their needs can be met without placing them in costly special education. In small classes, teachers are better able to maintain discipline. Parents and teachers can work together more effectively to support children's education. We also know that overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. 
   Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. Students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. Follow-up studies show that the gains lasted through at least eighth grade, and the gains were larger for minority students. 
   STAR students were less likely to drop out of high school, and more likely to graduate in the top 25% of their classes. Research also shows that STAR students in smaller classes in grades K-3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of their regular-class peers in math, reading, and science in grades 4, 6, and 8. Michigan, California, Nevada, Florida, Texas, Utah, Illinois, Indiana, New York, Oklahoma, Iowa, Minnesota, Massachusetts, South Carolina, and Wisconsin have initiated or considered STAR-like class size reduction efforts. 
   In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program is helping to reduce class size in grades K-3 in low-income communities. A study found that students in the smaller classes had significantly greater improvements in reading, math, and language tests than students in bigger classes. The largest achievement gains were among African-American boys. 
   In Flint, Michigan, efforts over the last three years to reduce class size in grades K-3 have produced a 44% increase in reading scores and an 18% increase in math scores. 
   Because of the Class Size Reduction Act, 1.7 million children are benefitting from smaller classes this year. 29,000 were hired with fiscal year 1999 funds. 1,247 are teaching in the first grade, reducing class sizes from 23 to 17. 6,670 are teaching in the second grade, reducing class size from 23 to 18. 6,960 are teaching in the third grade, reducing class size from 24 to 18. 2,900 are in grades 4-12. 290 special education teachers have been hired. And, on average, 7% of the funds are being used for professional development for these new teachers. 
   The Boston School District received $3.5 million this year to reduce class size. As a result, Boston was able to hire 40 new teachers, reducing class size from 28 students to 25 in the first and second grades. 
   In Mississippi, Jackson Public Schools used its $1.3 million federal grant to hire 20 new teachers to reduce class size in 1st grade classrooms from 21 to 15, and in 2nd and 3rd grade classrooms from 21 to 18. 
   In New Hampshire, the Manchester School District received $634,000 and was able to hire 19 new teachers in grades 1-3, particularly in its English as a Second Language and special education programs, reducing the average class size from 28 students to 18. 
   In Ohio, the Columbus Public School District has hired 58 fully certified teachers with funds from the class size reduction program, and placed these teachers in 14 high-poverty, low-performing schools, reducing class size in grades 1 to 3 from 25 to 15. Along with proven-effective reading programs such as Success for All, class size reduction is a central part of efforts by the City of Columbus to improve low-performing schools. 
   Senator MURRAY's amendment is an important amendment which deserves the Senate's consideration, and I urge the Senate to approve it. The nation's children and the nation's future deserve no less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia for yielding. I, like others, have differences with the Senator, but I admire his persistence in this idea and his strong commitment to this proposal. Many of us welcome the opportunity to debate issues on education policy at this point in the session. We have been in session for a number of weeks, and we have dealt with the issues of the Marianas, bankruptcy, and one or two judges. As we come into the first of March, we are very slow and reluctant in addressing concerns of families. This is one of the issues of education. 
   There always seems to be some interruption. All of us are looking forward to visiting with our Governors. I am looking forward to visiting with mine. Nonetheless, sometime we ought to be about the Nation's business, and the Nation's business is the whole role of how the Federal, State, and local governments are going to provide assistance to make sure we have the best educational system. 
   We have a responsibility in the area of health care to ensure a full Patients' Bill of Rights so families know the information they get from the doctor is the doctor's recommendation and not an insurance agent's recommendation who is more interested in the bottom line. 
   We have a responsibility to debate and act on the question of prescription drugs. There is not a group of seniors in my State of Massachusetts who do not place prescription drugs as their foremost concern, and it is a legitimate concern. 
   We ought to be about the business of addressing those issues. These are some things on the minds of people. 
   We have started this debate on education policy, and we will be following up tomorrow in our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. 
   The American people ought to understand that we provide very little out of the Federal budget to education. As my friend and colleague from Nevada has pointed out, it is about 2 percent. Most American families say: Out of $1.7 trillion, we ought to be providing more than 2 percent. 
   Most would want us to do it, most believe we should do it, but we have not done it. It has been resisted. I imagine we will see further resistance in the Senate debate, finding there are other priorities. 
   As we know, 7 to 7.5 cents of every Federal dollar goes to the local communities. We are talking about scarce resources. We have to understand we either appropriate the money or we provide tax breaks or tax incentives. It all basically comes from the budget. 
   What we are talking about today is $1.2 billion over the next 5 years and how it will be used. The Dodd amendment says there are public policy issues related to education that have a higher priority. He will insist the Senate vote to decide whether we are going to provide the $1.2 billion to assist local communities to offset the additional costs that are necessary for needy children, or whether the $1.2 billion will go to 7 percent of families with children in private schools. 
   Half the money in the Coverdell proposal, which is represented by one of these little figures on this chart, will go to benefit one of these figures and the other half will go to benefit those who go to private schools. That is not something we have admitted or stated. That is even according to Mr. COVERDELL, as he said on February 23:  
   The division of the money is 50-50.  
   At the start of this debate, we have to ask: Where do we want the limited resources to go? Do we want to strengthen the public school systems, or do we want to divert scarce resources to the 
   private schools? Private schools play an enormously important role in our society, but we are talking about scarce resources. 
   What does the Dodd amendment do? It says if we have $1.2 billion, we ought to use that $1.2 billion to help all the families in communities across the country who are burdened, in one sense, but also given an opportunity in another sense, to provide some decent education for children who have special needs. That opportunity developed in the 1970s as a result of Supreme Court cases decisions that said the guarantee by the States of educating their children also applies to special-needs children. 
   Our friend, Governor Weicker of the State of Connecticut, introduced legislation to help offset those additional needs for those schools. Over time, we have been trying to increase funding for special-needs children. 
   I take my hat off to our good friend from the State of New Hampshire, Mr. GREGG, who insists we put this as the first priority for all Government funding. Many of us believe we should increase funding for special-needs children. Senator DODD's amendment, which is so compelling, says: Look, if we have $1.2 billion, let's take that $1.2 billion and help all the communities across the country that are providing assistance to special-needs children. That is more important than taking half of that money and giving it to the private school students. I think a pretty good case can be made for that. 
   Senator DODD has offered an amendment in the past to do exactly that. On April 23, 1998, he offered that amendment, and it failed by a narrow margin. He was able to marshal almost half of the Senate. We are very hopeful the Dodd amendment will be successful today. 
   I offered a similar amendment in March of 1999 at the time the Senate was considering the $792 billion tax break bill. The tax break bill--remember that? 
   We listened to many of our colleagues talking about the importance of having special education and funding special education. I offered an amendment that said: All right, let's adopt what would have been part of the tax break bill to fund special education needs for the next 10 years. Do you know what that would have meant in terms of a reduction in the tax break bill? It would have reduced the total tax break for fortunate individuals and corporations by only a fifth. Four-fifths would have still gone through the Senate. 
   That was a pretty good opportunity to say: If we are really serious about trying to do something for special-needs children, let's go ahead and take the opportunity with real money--not authorizations, not on appropriations that may be rejected or vetoed because they have other kinds of proposals; no gimmicks--let's do something that is actually going to go to the President of the United States, something that is going to go on through and at least be considered. Not a single vote--not one vote, not five votes, not four votes, not three votes, not two votes--not a single one came from that side of the aisle. 
   You can imagine why many of us, when we hear these statements on the other side about the importance of special education and special needs, why we take that with a good deal of doubt. 
   The fact of the matter is, many of these proposals that we will have an opportunity to debate later on have some important impact on special education. In smaller classes, teachers can help identify those children with some special needs and can be separated out to be given the extra help and assistance they need, instead of the children being thrown into the situation where it makes it much more complicated and expensive. 
   Early involvement, through the expansion of the Head Start Program, most importantly, can get some help and assistance to those students; and, secondly, save a good deal of resources in funding.  
   We do not believe you ought to place one group of children against another, but some do. Those of us who have been in support of the President's program, Vice President GORE's excellent program, with an emphasis on early intervention, do not believe in pitting one child against another. 
   We will have the opportunity to follow Senator DODD's leadership and say: Let's just take this funding--half of the money goes to about 10 percent of the children, and half of it goes to 90 percent of the children--let's say: We find that this is sufficiently important that we are going to provide the funds for all of the special needs. 
   I do not want to take much time of the Senate, but I do want to review a little bit about education policy in recent times because I believe this is a matter of enormous importance and consequence. We ought to understand whether this is just a policy difference between us or whether this is something that is much more basic and fundamental. 
   I have here statistics going back for the last 6 years under Republican leadership, showing where the Republican leadership has been on the issue of cuts in education funding. 
   In the 1995 House rescissions bill, we have $1.7 billion enacted. It had been appropriated, and the President signed it. The new leadership said: We are going to go right back there under 
   rescissions and take $1.7 billion. That was done just after the election. 
   In 1996, House Appropriations cut $3.9 billion below the previous year. In 1997, it was $3.1 billion below the President; in 1998, it was $200 million below the President; in 1999, $2 billion below the President; for the fiscal year 2000 House bill, $2.8 billion below the President. 
   You cannot say: Well, you can do anything with figures around here. That is a pretty consistent record of where the Republican leadership has been over the last 6 or 7 years on the priorities of education. 
   Those of us who believe in investing in children, who believe we need a partnership at the Federal, State, and local level, are not saying that money, in and of itself, is going to provide all the answers. But what we are saying is: Investing in resources is a pretty clear indication of a nation's priorities and a pretty clear indication of what is believed to be important. 
   Where you had 3 or 4 years ago the cutting of billions and billions of dollars, and abolishing the Department of Education, now we come out with $1.2 billion--some $300 million a year--as their first priority in the areas of education. 
   I have some difficulty in believing that is really what the American people want. I think the American people want us to say: Let's get the best ideas among Democrats and Republicans to get the best trained teachers and put them in every classroom in America. And let's find out how to make sure that teacher is going to stay there. Let's find out how we are going to be able to cut back on the size of larger schools so we can get students into smaller classes, which has been demonstrated to show a higher degree of academic performance. 
   Let's talk about afterschool programs and how they are being tied to performance in universities and how they are being tied to the private sector, where there are job opportunities with help and assistance from tutorials. 
   Let's talk about programs such as the one I saw just yesterday in my home city of Boston. Intel, one of the great American companies, is doing workshops to try to provide help and assistance to inner-city kids. They are going to open up programs around the country. Let's talk about what they are doing. If those programs are so good, we ought to be able to replicate them. Let's talk about how we are going to provide greater opportunities for kids to continue on into higher education. 
   It seems to me the American people want this debate and want it out here on the floor of the Senate. But, oh, no, we have this particular proposal. 
   That is why I think it is so important that we have the opportunity to vote on the Dodd proposal. What we are basically saying is: All right, $1.2 billion; let's put this in the areas of special needs. Let's go ahead and help them. That is an important area. Let's go on and provide that kind of help and assistance. 
   Senator DODD knows so well, as others, that before we had the IDEA, we had about 5.5 million children locked in closets who never went to school. 
   Now we find that children who are going to complete high school, 57 percent of the disabled youth are competitively employed within 5 years after leaving high school, compared to an employment rate of 25 percent for disabled adults who have never benefited from IDEA. When we invest in these children, we get results. The Dodd amendment is what is going to get results for some of the neediest causes for families in this country. 
   In my own State of Massachusetts, there are small towns where families have these kinds of challenges with regard to a particular individual. The schools have to provide those services. It provides a very significant increased burden on the taxes of those local communities. Let's say, look, wherever they are, if they are in Georgia, if they are in Illinois, if they are in Massachusetts, they are going to get some help and assistance from this particular program. 
   There is a priority. That has a higher priority than just providing this kind of money that is going to be scattered the way it has been indicated. That is the essence. 
   I see the good Senator from Connecticut, our leader on this fight time and again. We commend him for staking out, in the first real order of business, the first real order of debate, the importance and significance of this amendment and helping to provide for families who have special needs children. 
   I yield to the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now Wednesday, the 23rd of February. It is just about a week after the President of the United States sent his budget to the Congress where he outlined his request of the Congress for a very extensive education priority--more than $4.5 billion measured just in financial terms over the previous years--specifying in great detail, the priorities he placed in strengthening our education system. 
   I think any American who listened to the President's State of the Union Address would have to conclude that the President spoke for all Americans when he said the primary priority for all Americans was in the area of education and also that we ought to try to find partnerships where the Federal Government can work with the States and local communities in order to strengthen our K through 12 education system. Both the President and all of us in this Congress understand that we have some very important pieces of legislation before the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. We will reauthorize the ESEA, a composite of different pieces of legislation, that is primarily targeted in terms of the most disadvantaged children and children in greatest need. 
   I, as ranking minority member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, want to take this time now to commend our chairman, Senator JEFFORDS, for the time he has taken to try to examine and bring that legislation as a priority item to the floor of the Senate so we can take action. Even though we are in the Senate for a relatively short period of time, we are going to have the opportunity to debate that legislation, which primarily is $8 billion, which is focused on the neediest schools and poorest children. 
   There are other funds in terms of school construction. There are other funds in terms of math and science programs. There are additional funds in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That has really been the vehicle on which I think most of us thought we would begin the debate in this Congress on the issue of central importance to the American people--on education. 
   I can say, as someone who has served on the education committee now for 38 years, that we have had a remarkable sense of bipartisanship in working through education. It has only been in the last 10 years we have even voted in the committee. We had votes on the floor of the Senate. But by and large, under the leadership of Bob Stafford, a Republican from the State of Vermont, under the leadership of Claiborne Pell, a Democrat from Rhode Island, and even back to the period of Lister Hill in the early 1960s when many of these pieces of legislation were initially passed, we didn't really have a great deal of partisanship. It was understood that education was something on which we freed ourselves from involving partisan disputes. It has only been in the most recent times we have had that. 
   That doesn't mean a good debate and discussion on education policy is not helpful in terms of trying to find out the most sensible and responsible ways we would proceed. But it does come as some surprise to the members of our committee, quite frankly, that we have had some 20 days of hearings and we are in the process of attempting to mark up this major piece of legislation and bring it to the floor so we can have a full debate and discussion on the measure. 
   Just to put this tax legislation in some perspective, the President's budget in terms of education will be about $40 billion this year, $4.5 billion over last year. The measure which is being offered on the floor of the Senate as the principal Republican measure comes to approximately $225 million per year--$1.2 billion over 5 years. 
   Not that you can't do a good deal with $1.2 billion over 5 years, but when we are talking about the magnitude of our involvement in terms of what the parents of this country have said they want to have happen in their local schools and local 
   communities across this country, I am somewhat amazed. I am amazed that the Republican leadership would recommend--as they did and as is their power to do--that we are now considering this legislation of $1.2 billion over 5 years, $225 million a year, that will provide an average benefit of $7 per family, according to the Joint Tax Committee, which is neither Republican nor Democrat. 
   We are now 4 weeks into the session, I can't believe we have any more important priority for the Senate than the issue of education. We should be debating real solutions to real problems, such as overcrowded classrooms, crumbling facilities and unsafe school buildings, and the lack of qualified teachers  in classrooms, accountability for results, and adequate after-school opportunities. 
   We certainly have been waiting to debate the issue of health care. I look forward to our meetings as a member of the conference committee on the Patients' Bill of Rights for next week. But that was long past in the Senate last year. We were just about getting to it. 
   We still have not been willing to address a minimum wage increase for the hardest working members. We always hear from the Republican leadership that we haven't the time to debate a 50-cent-per-hour increase for minimum wage this year and 50 cents next year. We haven't the time to debate that, although we are committed this afternoon to no votes. We are not able to debate an increase in the minimum wage for the 12 million Americans--mostly women benefit, mostly children benefit, mostly men and women whose skin is not white benefit. We don't have time to debate that. No. We haven't the time in the Senate to do it the fourth week into the session. No. We are going to debate this issue which is valid at $225 million--which we ought to be about debating as well. 
   I want to review this very quickly. As I say, if we ask parents back home what they are most concerned about, what comes out on every single review about things that the parents are most concerned about, it is discipline and safety in the schools. 
   It is no surprise that under the most recent studies in 1999, the top concerns of parents are safety and discipline in the schools--safety and discipline in the schools. 
   With the relatively small amount of resources we provide to local communities, 7 or 8 cents out of every dollar, what can we do in the Senate to help local communities have greater safety and discipline in the schools? That is what parents are concerned about. That is what we want to debate. It is on that which we want to call the roll. But no, we will debate whether there will be tax provisions that benefit some, to the tune of $225 million, an average of $7 per family. 
   It is a shame to mention the polls because it is self-evident what parents want is a well-trained teacher in every classroom for their children. We don't need a poll for that. They want teachers who know how to teach, who know the importance of support, and teacher mentors who help in the classrooms. They want smaller class sizes. That is the way to deal with discipline. That is the way for academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   We can debate what the records are with the STAR programs in Tennessee and other States that show significant academic achievement. Why are we not supporting those? Why do we not take programs that benefit children and replicate them? No, no, we have to debate this other piece of legislation, the $1.2 billion over 5 years. We cannot debate class size, we cannot debate improving the quality of education, we cannot debate afterschool programs, we cannot debate modernizing schools, we cannot debate how to assist special needs children. No, we cannot do that. 
   What do the various important bipartisan studies show? On the priorities for parents, No. 7 is creating educational savings accounts to help parents pay for educational expenses for children. That is what we are debating. 
   No. 6, modernizing and rebuilding schools and wiring all classrooms for computers and Internet. That is a priority--the digital divide. Make sure every public school will be included on the Internet; make sure all the curriculum will be adequate in order to be able to teach these children; and to make sure the teachers know how to use that technology. 
   No. 5, establish national academic standards and tests for students. More and more of the States are doing so. Almost all of the States have done it in certain classes, even this year. 
   No. 4, reduce class size to 18 students in grades 1 through 3. 
   No. 3, increasing the salaries of teachers. Are we debating that this afternoon? No, we are talking about the IRAs for parents that will be valued at $7 per family. We are not allowed to have any of these amendments or vote on them this afternoon. 
   No. 2, train teachers in technologies, computers, and Internet. 
   No. 1, establish national certification standards for teachers, meaning we will have good teachers in every classroom. 
   That is what American parents want. That is what the Democratic Party wants. That is what we ought to be debating on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. It is on that which we ought to call the roll. 
   But no, no, we are working on priority No. 7, to create educational savings accounts to help parents cover those expenses for the children. 
   I think this is a great tragedy this afternoon. If we accept the Coverdell bill this afternoon, I will not vote for it. I believe if we are going to have the $1.2 billion, it can be better spent getting more qualified teachers, smaller class sizes, afterschool programs, computers, special needs children. 
   If we pass the $1.2 billion program, it will not mean a single better trained teacher in any classroom in this country. None. It will not mean a single smaller class. It will not be an afterschool program. It will not provide help and assistance to special education needs children. It does not help any of the older schools that are crumbling. It does not provide a new computer in a classroom. It does not make a school safer. It does not stop overcrowding. It does not move children out of some of the trailers and into the classroom. It does not respond to what the General Accounting Office pointed out is the $112 billion needed to make the basic schools livable in our society. We do not add a nickel to any of those priorities. It does very little in terms of providing help and assistance to the children in the public schools. 
   What are the various groups saying? Not that we ought to be dictated to by the various groups; we do not find real support from the primary groups interested in working with the Congress. We can find some support if this were to be used in terms of higher education, as an add on, but we do not find support from teachers; we do not find support in terms of the Chief State Schools Officers, or the Council of the Great Schools; we do not find support in terms of any of the special education programs; we do not find support with the parents; we do not find support with the school boards; we do not find support with a number of groups--I have a list of over 75. 
   My regret is that we are being denied the opportunity to get into the more substantive matters that are of central importance to parents whose children are going to the public schools. 
   We ought to have a good, sound debate about what we are going to do to have better trained teachers. With scarce resources, who wants to put funding into teachers, including the recruitment of teachers, the training of teachers, the holding of teachers, teacher mentoring and support for upgrading the skill of teachers--the whole range of different suggestions that have been made primarily by those who are in the teaching profession? We ought to be listening to those who entered the profession. We ought to be debating those issues. 
   Smaller class size, we had good debate on that. We had some division within the body on that--the first time the Murray amendment was actually accepted. Republicans were falling over themselves trying to accept credit for it, and then fought it the next year. I do not know where they will be this year. But it makes a good deal of sense, and the more evidence we get the more that is demonstrated. 
   We need to do more to help schools and communities develop constructive afterschool activities to keep students off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. These programs have been endorsed from an education point of view and a law enforcement point of view. Funding has been significantly increased in the President's proposal. That is a legitimate proposal and we ought to debate whether we want scarce resources focused that way. 
   What are we going to do to make sure the neediest children in our country, those who come from the poorest areas of our country, have access to computers? That is a matter of national technology. Are we going to take new technology, and at the end of 10 years, those who went to schools that had the best in technology and teachers are going to be light-years ahead of another group of students, whose skin is probably not white, who are from underserved areas? We ought  to be debating that. Is that before us on the floor of the Senate? 
   There are Republicans and Democrats who have good views on this. We ought to be working together to find out the solutions to these problems. But, oh, no, we are just going to be debating this afternoon. We are just going to be debating what is No. 7 in all of the polls, creating educational accounts, something that is valued at $225 million. 
   I know probably our colleagues say: That may not be a lot to you, Senator. We don't want to bother with that answer. We know we are spending $40 billion this year in a Federal budget and now we are engaged in our first education debate, which is how we are going to spend $225 million of it. 
   Does that say something about what the leadership wants for debate and discussion on issues of education? I think it does. 
   We are prepared to meet with the chairman of our committee and follow the committee process and come to the floor of the Senate with responsible recommendations and to debate those until we are able to have a resolution of those. But that process has been short-circuited, evidently, by the leadership of the Republican Party. They are basically saying no to its chairman, the chairman of the education committee--no, we are not going to do it that way; we are going to do it some other way. 
   We are going to have to deal with what we are faced with, and I think there are many more important educational proposals we ought to be debating. We ought to be debating them this afternoon. We ought to be taking rollcalls on these issues. They are of central concern. 
   Then we ought to move on to many of these other issues that have been effectively side-tracked. We cannot get a bankruptcy conference appointed because I have every intention to try to instruct the Members, when they go to the conference on bankruptcy, they are to change the provisions that have been included in the bankruptcy bill to make sure the neediest American workers are going to get a fair increase in the minimum wage. The majority leader will not call that up. We cannot deal with that. 
   We are putting off the Patients' Bill of Rights. We cannot begin the debate and discussions on the prescription drug bill. 
   We have been watching these debates that have been taking place, Democrats and Republicans. Many even in this Chamber have been in States where seniors have been gathering together, talking about the importance of a prescription drug benefit. We are not even able to get a good debate and discussion on these measures in the Senate. 
   Four weeks into the session and this is our record so far: we have the Marianas immigration bill which was passed overwhelmingly; we have a nuclear waste bill, which is legislation that is going to be vetoed; and we have a conference report on bankruptcy. We have had 11 votes, including 3 nominations. It is already the end of February. 
   You cannot get away from where responsibility lies to address America's agenda. On this side of the aisle we want to address the issues of education. We want to address the issues of health care. We want to address the issues of prescription drugs for our senior citizens. We want to address the issues that are of central concern to working families. We are being denied that opportunity now, and we are going to continue to point out as we go through this legislative process each and every time that we are being denied. We are going to work feverishly to try to do the Nation's business and not be denied bringing these matters up on the floor of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to respond to my good friend from New Hampshire, when we came back to the whole question of special education, I listened carefully to his remarks. And his remarks have a certain hollow echo, as well. 
   I remember when the Republicans offered their $780 billion tax break a year ago. I offered an amendment that would have funded every special education program for 10 years. It would have reduced the $780 Republican tax reduction by a fifth. Every Member of the body on the other side of the aisle voted against it. 
   So with all due respect, that proposal made a good deal of sense. Every Member on the Democratic side of the aisle said: It is more important to fund the special education needs of every special education program across this country, over the next 10 years, than to have a tax break. Every Republican voted against that. So with all due respect, we ought to at least begin to remember our history on this particular provision. 
   I listened to my friend from Delaware talk about the two different provisions. He talked about the educational IRAs, which my remarks were directed at, and then he talked about the section 127 provisions which provide the education assistance for undergraduate and graduate studies, and also about the prepaid tuition plans. Those are in the administration's budget. 
   I see both my friend from Georgia as well as Senator WELLSTONE waiting to speak. But if there had been more time, I was going to review what has been done with regard to President Clinton and this Congress over the last 7 years in terms of offering educational opportunities. There has not been an administration in the last 30 years that has done a better job in terms of opening up and being responsive to the needs of students. It is a very proud record. 
   So those particular provisions of what they call the extenders of various tax provisions are going to be worthwhile to work out in a bipartisan way. Certainly there will be credit for all those who are going to be involved in it later on. But the principal proposal which has been advanced, the education IRAs, which was discussed earlier as a vehicle for strengthening and improving public education, it does seem to me that the American people want a debate and discussion, in a comprehensive way, about how we are going to strengthen public education, and what the Federal Government is going to do, and what the States are going to do, and what the local communities are going to do. 
   Whatever we do in the Congress, I think there are certain priorities which the public has. They want to know how we are going to ensure that there will be a well-trained teacher in every classroom? They want smaller class sizes, particularly in the earlier grades. They want to make sure we have afterschool programs. They want to make sure we are going to have mentors and supporters for those teachers, particularly those who serve in underserved areas. They want to make sure we have the technology, and the curriculum with that technology, and well-trained teachers to use that technology. 
   They want us to be sensitive to the digital divide so we do not use technology to open up a whole new spread between the haves and have-nots. They want to make sure there is parental involvement. They want to make sure there is access to continuing education through college and that there is continuing training programs which will be necessary for the new jobs of the new century. 
   I believe they want us to give emphasis and focus in terms of early education, including the expansion of the Head Start Program for children up to 3 years of age, on which this administration has placed emphasis, along with a number of Senators, in a bipartisan way, including Senators STEVENS and DODD. 
   They want us, at the end of the day when we pass the legislation, to be able to answer the question: What did this legislation mean in terms of my son or my daughter? Whether it is a question of security in the classroom or whether it is access to guns getting into the classrooms. They want to have a comprehensive way of being able to say, look, there is some legislation. It isn't going to answer all of the problems. It isn't going to do everything, but at least it is something. We stand in support of those individuals who want to use scarce resources at the national level to pump into this priority. Those are the people we want to see successful and we want to support. That is very reasonable. 
   With a budget of some $40 billion and a $225 million program dealing with what will mean $7 per family to go to school, the idea that we are doing anything meaningful for families in this country who are interested and concerned about educating their kids is a disservice to the American people and a disservice to this process. That is why I have risen. 
   I see my colleague and friend from Georgia and Senator WELLSTONE. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In my earlier address, I was using figures provided by the committee. I will refer to them and include them now, the Affordable Education Act of 1999. I look over at the estimated budget effects of the Affordable Education Act of 1999, as approved by the Senate Committee on Finance, May 19, 1999. I read it out to the year 2004, and it is $1.156 billion. That is what we are basically talking about in terms of the IRAs. 
   As I indicated earlier, you have some extenders with regard to graduate education which are in the President's program and undergraduate. If you want to add all of those programs in to get up closer to your $4 billion figure, that is fine. My point is, you have your $1.5 billion which comes to $225 million for the IRA, which comes to what I have talked about as $7 per family. I do think there is a better way of using the $1.5 billion than providing that kind of benefit to families that, according to the Joint Tax Committee, is $7 a family. 
   The other provisions about which I should have been more precise are included in the broad scope mentioned by Senator ROTH, which basically are a continuation of what they call tax extenders about which there is really no debate. This debate, primarily on 
   COVERDELL, has been about the creation of $1.2 billion, $230 million a year, effectively, for families, which would amount to $7 per family, whether we think that is the best way in terms of education policy. That is what I was getting at. 
   The pages are not numbered, but I will be glad to share those with my colleague.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we begin a new effort to keep our promise of good health care for the nation's military retirees. We have an obligation to provide comprehensive health benefits to the men and women who put their lives on the line for our country. This bill is a solid start. The Military Health Care Improvement Act of 2000 will make a significant difference in the lives of our military retirees. Too often, today, those who have served our country with honor are left struggling to obtain and pay for health care in their retirement. That's not right. 
   The Act will extend existing medical demonstration programs to military retirees who are over the age of 65. It will also extend the Federal Employees Health Benefit Program Demonstration for Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, and it will enable the Secretary of Defense to expand the number of TRICARE Senior Prime sites. 
   The expansion of the National Mail Order Pharmacy Program will bring welcome relief to eligible beneficiaries, and the Pharmacy Pilot Program will reduce pharmacy enrollment fees and implement monthly or quarterly deductible payments. I hope that in addition, we will be able to expand this provision to include retail pharmacies as well. 
   The provisions for active duty family members are also an important aspect of this bill. Expanding the availability of TRICARE Prime Remote to military families will eliminate their co-payments and make the program more accessible and affordable to many more. Improvement of the health care services provided through TRICARE will  help address the concerns of many retirees regarding access, availability and scheduling of appointments, claims filing, processing and payment, and national enrollment. 
   This bill is an important first step toward achieving the goal we share, and I look forward to working closely with my colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee and in the Senate to enact it.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, recently, Tufts University's Center on Hunger and Poverty released a far-reaching report, ``Paradox of Our Times: Hunger in a Strong Economy.'' The report emphasizes that numerous studies on hunger in America have concluded that low-income working families do not have access to adequate food, despite the nation's economic prosperity. The report's conclusion is supported by research from the General Accounting Office, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, numerous state agencies, academic researchers, and policy analysts, including the Urban Institute and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Tufts study will be of interest to all of us in Congress who care about this issue, and I ask that the attached Parts I and II of the report be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, HIV/AIDS in Africa has become a global emergency unlike anything that public health has seen in this century. According to Archbishop Desmond Tutu of South Africa, ``AIDS in Africa is a plague of biblical proportions. It is a holy war that we must win.'' 
   The number of HIV-infected individuals in Africa has now reached 22.5 million. As a nation, America is all too familiar with the devastation that AIDS causes. Nearly 10 years ago, Senator HATCH and I sponsored the Ryan White CARE act, the legislation that helped begin the long battle to deal with the AIDS epidemic in this country. The situation has steadily improved in the United States, because extensive efforts have been made and needed systems of care have been put in place. The CARE Act has helped us make great progress. 
   We began our fight against AIDS in the United States with the advantage of having the world's most advanced health care infrastructure, but the situation in the developing world is much different. Resources are scarce, infrastructure is limited, and the people of Africa face a situation that is not improving but is steadily growing worse. 
   Officials at UNICEF have described the situation that many nations in sub-Saharan Africa face as a ``tripod of deprivation'' that involves poverty, debt and AIDS. Any of these three crises would be severe on its own. Taken together they are devastating. The result for the African continent is enormous pain, suffering, and death. Decades of progress on economic growth, infant mortality, and life expectancy are all threatened. The AIDS virus is infecting every aspect of life for the people of Africa, from work and family to education and even national stability. 
   The effect on the African workforce is especially ominous. African nations have worked hard for the economic development that is emerging. But HIV is striking vast numbers of individuals during their most productive years, and all of this recent progress is being placed in jeopardy. AIDS directly undermines productivity by increasing absenteeism. It raises the cost of business through increased need for benefits. Costs of recruiting and training employees are rising, as current employees die or become disabled. Higher costs also threaten international investment in Africa, which is essential for future economic development. 
   Over 8 million children have already been orphaned by AIDS in Africa. In the next decade, that number will reach 40 million, a number equal to the total number of children in the United States who live east of the Mississippi River. Children are forced to leave their schools in order to care for dying parents and put food on the table for themselves and their family. Many of these children are already suffering emotionally from the loss of one or both of their parents, and now they are losing the vital educational opportunities they need and deserve. 
   HIV infection rates are as high as 80 percent in some African military forces, and the disease is threatening the security and stability of these nations. Forces that have been weakened by disease 
   are less capable of defending their nations, maintaining order, or protecting citizens. The concern is immediate. A 1998 UNAIDS study reported that in both Zimbabwe and Cameroon, HIV infection rates were three to four times higher in the military than in the civilian population. 
   While new therapies have begun to offer hope in the fight against AIDS in the United States, the cost of these treatments has put them out of reach for developing countries, where the epidemic is raging out of control. During the past six years, there has been a 300 percent increase in annual cases of HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet until this year, U.S. funding for AIDS programs overseas had remained level-funded at $125 million. When inflation is taken into account, level funding means a 25 percent decrease between 1993 and 1999. 
   Last year, many of us in Congress and the administration worked hard to obtain an additional $100 million to fight the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Africa. This funding was a vital first step towards turning the tide, but it is not nearly enough. This money will be used for prevention efforts, counseling and testing, direct medical services, and also to assist the millions of children orphaned by AIDS in the region. The additional $100 million that President Clinton has included in his FY2001 budget will enable us to reach an even greater proportion of people infected with HIV in Africa. 
   Yesterday I cosponsored the bipartisan legislation introduced by Senator BARBARA BOXER and Senator GORDON SMITH that extends the U.S. commitment to sub-Saharan Africa through 2005. We know that increased U.S. aid for Africa is essential. In partnership with other donors, the U.S. invested $46 million in HIV prevention and care in Uganda, and helped cut the HIV rates by more than half. 
   Prevention is effective, but it costs money. Treatment and care also cost money. Yet the nations of sub-Saharan Africa are among the poorest in the world, and they cannot and should not bear this burden alone. The U.S. is the leading donor of development assistance for HIV/AIDS prevention and control in the developing world, but our response to this crisis has so far been inadequate. The United States currently ranks ninth in terms of the percentage of GNP devoted to international AIDS programs. This is not the leadership that this country has shown in the past, when nations have been torn apart by tragedy. 
   I recently learned about a couple in Senegal who were both stricken by HIV. They have a small shop that sells newspapers, candy and other goods,  and are economically well-off in comparison to many of their fellow citizens. Their financial situation allowed them to afford some AIDS drugs, but the cost of basic treatment for one person takes thirty percent of their monthly income. They have been forced to choose which one of them will take these life-saving medications. That is a decision that no couple should have to make. 
   The rate at which AIDS has spread in developing countries should alarm all nations and peoples. The world is too small for us to think that a virus which has infected 34 million people and killed 14 million is under control and will not continue to infect our own country. 
   This global epidemic has already taken more lives than all but one of the major conflicts of this century. Only World War II surpasses AIDS in terms of human devastation in this century. We cannot stand by and let this level of suffering continue. 
   We can and must do more as a nation to fight this growing global epidemic. It is estimated that by the year 2005 more than 100 million people worldwide will have become infected with HIV--100 million people. The magnitude of the emergency is immense. What will we tell our children and our grandchildren about how we faced the largest human tragedy of our time? I hope that we can tell them that we reached across the aisle and then across the ocean to help those caught in this relentless epidemic. This is not about Democrats or Republicans. 
   This is about America, and what we stand for as a nation and as a world leader. I urge my colleagues to do all we can to save lives and ease this tragic suffering.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senate completes its work on the bankruptcy bill, we are more aware than ever of the potential impact of this legislation on American citizens and businesses. 
   This legislation purports to reform the bankruptcy system and eliminate debtor abuses, and the banking and credit card industries have been urging action on it for the past two years. They argue that during this time of economic expansion, Congress should deal with the increase in bankruptcy filings by curtailing pervasive debtor fraud. If Congress doesn't act, they say, the economy will suffer. 
   But the industry's cure is worse than the disease. First, they fail to acknowledge a key fact--the steady decline in bankruptcy filings. Without any action by Congress, the number of bankruptcy filings is going down. Filings have dropped in 42 states. Overall, there were 112,000 fewer personal bankruptcies in 1999 than in 1998--the largest one-year drop on record. 
   Leading economists believe that the bankruptcy crisis is self-correcting. The significant drop in filing is ample indication that a harsh bankruptcy bill is not needed. 
   It is abundantly clear that the bill before us is unnecessarily harsh. As House Judiciary Committee Chairman HENRY HYDE acknowledged, it contains dozens of provisions that favor creditors, and it fails to address the serious problems that often force citizens into bankruptcy. 
   The bill will make it more difficult for thousands of debtors who file for bankruptcy because of the layoffs and corporate downsizing that take place after mergers, and that are ordered by businesses to improve profits. 
   This bill also makes it more difficult for families already torn apart by divorce--particularly divorced women, who are four times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. 
   The bill would also have a devastating effect on the millions of Americans who have no health insurance or substandard coverage. For almost 20 percent of those filing for bankruptcy protection, a health-related problem led to their economic problems. 
   Earlier in the debate we took the time of the Senate to go through each of those categories, the numbers of people who went into bankruptcy as a result of the mergers and downsizing of major companies and corporations. These are American men and women who have worked hard all of their lives and through no fault of their own were put in very difficult economic straits and run into bankruptcy. 
   Because of the escalation of divorce, large numbers of single women are particularly vulnerable, because of their credit situation, to run into problems with bankruptcy. We have seen with the decline of health care coverage, particularly among older workers in their fifties, before they are eligible for Medicare, they have been the increasing targets of bankruptcy. These are groups of Americans who have been hard-working all of their lives and now are going to be caught up in this particular legislation which I think is particularly harsh on these individuals, and needlessly so. 
   In addition, this bill fails to significantly address the serious problems created by the credit card industry. In an average month, 7 percent of all households in the country receive a credit card solicitation. In recent years, the credit card industry has also begun to offer new lines of credit targeted at people with low incomes--people they know cannot afford to pile up credit card debt. 
   Facts such as these have reduced the economic stability of millions of families, and have led many of them to file for bankruptcy. Two out of every three bankruptcy filers have an employment problem. One out of every five has a health-care problem. Divorced or separated people are three times more likely than married couples to file for bankruptcy. Working men and women in economic free fall often have no choice except bankruptcy. 
   Although the Senate spent two weeks debating and amending the bankruptcy  bill last year and several additional days this year, this bill still does not acknowledge the problems that force so many Americans into bankruptcy. It remains heavily tilted toward the financial services industry, and many needed amendments were defeated. 
   Simultaneously, amendments were adopted that should be an embarrassment to the Senate. By a one-vote margin, the Senate adopted an amendment that provides for school vouchers, as well as harmful changes in the nation's anti-drug policy. 
   The Republican leadership offered a watered-down minimum wage increase, tied to a poison pill that cuts overtime pay, and an enormous $71 billion in tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the wealthiest Americans. Those provisions are now part of this bankruptcy bill--making a bad bill even worse. 
   By failing to increase the minimum wage last year, Congress failed the American people. It is time--long past time--to raise the minimum wage. 
   Our proposal is modest--a one dollar increase in two installments--50 cents now, and 50 cents a year from now. Over 10 million American workers will benefit. Our position is clear, it's ``50-50 or fight!'' 
   Our Democratic proposal to increase the minimum wage by a dollar over the next year will make a significant difference in the lives of all workers who earn the minimum wage and their families. 
   Unlike the Republican proposal, our Democratic proposal will give minimum wage workers the pay raise they need and deserve, so that they can care more effectively for their families and pay for the food and clothing and housing they need. 
   We shouldn't delay an increase. We shouldn't stretch it out. We shouldn't use it to slash overtime pay. We shouldn't use it as an excuse to give tax breaks to the wealthy. 
   Raising the minimum wage is an issue of fairness and dignity. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. 
   Before casting our final votes on this legislation, we have the opportunity to adopt several very important amendments that deserve our support. Yesterday, we started debate on the Levin-Durbin gun amendment, which would prevent gun manufacturers from abusing the bankruptcy system. 
   Today, Senator SCHUMER offered an amendment that eliminates a loop-hole currently being exploited by perpetrators of clinic violence. 
   Senator SCHUMER's proposed amendment is neither a prochoice amendment nor an anti-choice amendment. At its heart, it is not about abortion at all. Rather, it is about accountability for violent, illegal acts. It is about preventing those who use tactics of violence and intimidation against reproductive health clinics from using the bankruptcy laws as a shield from financial liability for their unlawful acts. 
   In response to a wave of violence which included murder, arson, bombing and harassment, Congress enacted the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act in 1994. That Act established criminal penalties and financial penalties for violence and intimidation directed against reproductive health service patients and providers. 
   I'm proud to be the Senate author of that legislation because since its passage, incidents of clinic violence have declined significantly. In addition, under the act and other federal and state laws, victims of clinic violence have been able to obtain remedies, and perpetrators of unlawful clinic violence have paid substantial fines and civil penalties. 
   Unfortunately, some of these offenders are attempting to evade their liability by exploiting the bankruptcy system. 
   For example, last year a federal judge ordered two anti-abortion groups and twelve individuals to pay in excess of $107 million for anti-choice activities and threats. However, within the last few months, five of those defendants, who collectively owe more than $45.5 million in clinic-violence debts, filed for bankruptcy to avoid the judgments. 
   For over 100 years, our bankruptcy system has enabled honest debtors to receive a fresh start--but, the bankruptcy laws were never intended to be a safe haven for the deliberate disregard of Federal or State laws. 
   The Schumer amendment preserves the integrity of the bankruptcy laws, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   The Schumer amendment, the Levin amendment, and others are critical in the needed effort to salvage this bill. Our goal is to enact responsible bankruptcy reform, not a sweetheart deal for the credit card industry. 
   Mr. President, at the appropriate time, I intend to offer a motion to instruct the conferees on the bankruptcy bill to fix the deeply flawed minimum wage proposal contained in the bill. The watered-down wage proposal in this bill is an insult to the hard-working men and women earning the minimum wage. In this time of plenty, we must not shortchange these workers. We should provide a 50-cent raise now and 50 cents a year from now. 
   Finally, it is fair to ask when we look at any piece of legislation we do who is going to benefit and who is going to lose. As has been demonstrated during the hearings and during the debate, just about every thoughtful person who has studied the bankruptcy bills remarks about how Congress, over the history of our Nation, has proposed bankruptcy bills which have been balanced between the debtor and the creditor, with the understanding that there are so many millions of Americans who may fall onto hard times briefly but are hard-working, decent people.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been remarkably balanced, with the exception of this legislation. 
   Finally, when you come down to it, one has to ask who benefits and who loses. It is very clear the winners in this are the credit card companies and the losers are the hard-working men and women who have fallen on difficult times, in most instances due to no fault of their own. They are men and women who have been downsized as a result of mergers. They are men and women who have fallen into serious economic times because of the failure of their health insurance to cover those individuals. They are primarily women who, as a result of their personal relationships, have been divorced and find it difficult to maintain a system of credit. 
   One can look back over all of these and find they are the victims of this legislation and they are the ones who are going to suffer the harsh penalties of it. It is fundamentally wrong. We have not had the opportunity in this debate to see protections for children and mothers. The reason for the Dodd amendment is to give special protections which historically have been a part of our bankruptcy laws. That has been defeated, as well as the amendments to remedy some of the harsh provisions of the means test. 
   This legislation is not the legislation that passed the Congress a little over a year ago in which I joined others in supporting. This is not balanced legislation. 
   For those reasons, plus the fact we have $73 billion of tax breaks for wealthy individuals in here and a denial to the hardest working Americans for fairness in treating them with a minimum wage, it ought to be voted down. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator LEVIN for taking the initiative to close a gaping loophole that allows gun manufacturers, distributors, and dealers to use the Bankruptcy Code to avoid judgments against them based on fraud, recklessness, negligence or product liability. Firearms manufacturers and dealers should not be able to use bankruptcy to escape liability. 
   Under current law, many types of debt are dischargeable under the Bankruptcy Code. However, the Code makes certain debts nondischargeable, due to public policy concerns, such as debts incurred by the operation of a motor vehicle while legally intoxicated. 
   Recently, private citizens and local governments have sued the gun industry to hold it accountable for deaths and injuries caused by firearms. The current litigation can be an effective way of assessing responsibility and providing remedies for obvious harm, in accord with the long-standing traditions of the law. 
   Many of these lawsuits have been brought by federal and state governments against firearms manufacturers. Opponents of these lawsuits argue that the industry cannot afford them, and that the suits may well force some firms into bankruptcy. 
   The entire focus of the current lawsuits is the wrongdoing of the defendant corporations. The authority of the court to award damages against these defendants requires a judicial finding that the company engaged in misconduct in the manufacturing or marketing of its product. In the absence of such a finding, there is no liability. 
   At long last, the American people are getting their day in court against the gun industry, and the gun manufacturers and the NRA fear that justice will be done. 
   Everyday, 13 more children across the country die from gunshot wounds. Yet, the national response to this death toll continues to be grossly inadequate. The gun industry has fought against reasonable gun control legislation. It has failed to use technology to make guns safer. It has attempted to insulate itself from its distributors and dealers, once the guns leave the factory door. 
   Studies estimating the total public cost of firearm-related injuries put the cost at over one million dollars for each shooting victim. According to the Centers for Disease Control, cities, counties and states incur billions of dollars in costs each year as a result of gun violence--including the costs of medical care, law enforcement, and other public services. 
   Communities across the country are attempting to deal with the epidemic of gun violence that claims the lives of so many people each year. Law enforcement officials, community leaders, parents and youth are struggling to deal with this continuing epidemic of gun violence. But the gun industry, and Congress, and most state legislatures have persistently ignored these concerns. 
   Now, when the courts are likely to hold them accountable, some gun manufacturers are attempting to avoid their responsibility by filing for bankruptcy. One example is Lorcin Industries. During its heyday, Lorcin was one of the largest manufacturers of ``affordable'' guns. Law enforcement and gun-control advocates call them ``Saturday night specials''--the inexpensive, easily concealed handguns often used in crimes. 
   Lorcin is one of several companies that sprang up after a 1968 law banned imports of ``Saturday night specials'' but permitted domestic manufacturing. Studies have found that these products are characterized by short ``time to crime''--the brief period between sale and the time when the guns are used in criminal acts. 
   Lorcin Engineering Co. has been named as a defendant in 27 lawsuits. The suits charge that Lorcin and other firearm manufacturers do not provide adequate safety devices, and that they negligently market their products, so that their weapons are too easily accessible to criminals and juveniles. Lorcin was also the subject of at least 35 wrongful-death or injury claims involving people killed or wounded when their Lorcin pistols accidentally discharged. Lorcin settled at least two dozen of the 35 claims, ranging from a few thousand dollars to $495,000. 
   Lorcin sought refuge from these product liability lawsuits by filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in October 1996. In bankruptcy, Lorcin was able to settle its lawsuits for pennies on the dollar, when tens of millions of dollars in damages were at stake. One of the major issues raised by creditors in the Lorcin bankruptcy case was whether the company was using the ability to reorganize its operations under the bankruptcy code as a way to avoid paying large sums to plaintiffs if it lost the suits. 
   Last January, Lorcin was released from a lawsuit filed by the City of New Orleans. It petitioned the court to be removed from another lawsuit filed by the City of Chicago, because the company was reorganizing itself under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code when the cities filed their lawsuits. 
   The litigation has prompted two other gun manufacturers to seek refuge in bankruptcy. Sundance Industries of Valencia, California filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. The owner said he has been worn down by the legal assault on the gun industry. In addition, Davis Industries of Mira Loma, California sought Chapter 11 protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court on May 27, 1999. 
   According to a lawyer who represented creditors in the 1996 bankruptcy of Lorcin, ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool and predictably the more suits that are filed, the more these gun companies are going to file for bankruptcy.'' 
   A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun-makers said that bankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain,'' because it will require much more time and expense for the cities, limit the amount of damages they can collect, and, perhaps most important, put the litigation in federal bankruptcy court. 
   Litigation may well be the only means to hold gun manufacturers accountable for the harm caused by their products. As we have seen with litigation against the tobacco industry, manufacturing secrets and marketing secrets often come to light in a courtroom. Public interest lawsuits have changed the balance of power between the public and the mammoth industries long thought to be invincible. The Levin amendment supports the citizens harmed by these powerful industries. It deserves to be supported by the Senate, and I urge the Senate to approve it. 
   Mr. President, in summation, I congratulate my friend, the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, for the development of this particular amendment, and I join with others to recommend it strongly to the Senate. I am hopeful that it will be successful. 
   The Levin amendment, as has been pointed out, takes the initiative to close a gaping loophole that allows the gun manufacturers and distributors and dealers to use the bankruptcy code to avoid judgments against them based on fraud, recklessness, and negligence, or product liability. Firearm manufacturers and dealers should not be able to abuse the bankruptcy laws to escape liability. 
   We can ask ourselves, is this a problem? The answer is yes. Do the gun manufacturers intend to utilize bankruptcy to basically avoid responsibility to families across the country and because of the basis of negligence, recklessness, or fraud? The answer is yes to that, too, which undermines the importance of this particular amendment.  
   America has a gun problem and it is massive. The crisis is especially serious for children. Every day, 13 more children across the country die from gunshot wounds. For every child killed with a gun, four are wounded. Yet the national response to this death toll continues to be grossly inadequate. 
   The gun industry has fought against reasonable gun control 
   legislation. It has failed to use the technology to make guns safer. All we have to do is remember the debates we had on the violence against youth legislation at the end of last year. We saw the efforts to try to provide common sense solutions to those who make these weapons available to individuals in our society who should not have these weapons, and how that was frustrated in important ways by the gun manufacturers. They were able to keep that piece of legislation that was passed with regard to gun show loopholes tied up in conference. How many weeks and how many months have passed when we have been unable to address this issue either in conference or back on the floor of the U.S. Senate? Those efforts continue to go on even today. 
   Here we find in the bankruptcy legislation another attempt by the gun manufacturers to exercise their muscle by giving them a special consideration at a time when the problems they foist on the American families are so significant. 
   The gun industry has attempted to insulate itself from its distributors and dealers once the guns leave the factory door. Guns are the only consumer product exempt from safety regulations. 
   Cities, counties, and States incur billions of dollars in costs each year as a result of gun violence, including the costs of medical care, law enforcement, and other public services. Studies estimating the total public cost of firearm-related injuries put the cost at over $1 million for each shooting victim. 
   Communities across the country are attempting to deal with the epidemic of gun violence that claims the lives of so many people each year. Law enforcement officials, community leaders, parents, and youth are struggling to deal with this continuing epidemic of gun violence. But the gun industry, Congress, and most State legislatures have persistently ignored these concerns. 
   At long last, the American people are getting their day in court against the gun industry. Individuals, organizations, and municipalities are making progress in their effort to hold the industry liable for its failure to incorporate reasonable safety designs in the guns they sell, including features that would prevent gun use by children and other unauthorized users. Personalizing or childproofing guns would dramatically reduce the number of unintentional shootings, teenage suicides, and criminal offenses using stolen weapons. 
   One such lawsuit was filed in Massachusetts on behalf of the parents of Ross Mathieu, a 12-year-old boy who was killed in 1996 when a friend the same age unintentionally shot him with a Beretta pistol, believing that the gun was unloaded. In 1997, a suit was filed against Beretta in Federal court in Boston alleging that Beretta caused the death by failing to include with the pistol either a magazine disconnect safety device, a chamber-loaded indicator, or a locking device that would have ``personalized'' the gun. 
   Last summer, the city of Boston filed a suit against gun manufacturers, distributors, and trade associations whose manufacturing decisions, marketing schemes, and distribution patterns have injured the city and its citizens. Boston is one of 30 cities and counties to have filed groundbreaking lawsuits to reform the gun industry. 
   When the courts seem likely to hold the industry accountable, some gun manufacturers are attempting to avoid their responsibility by filing for bankruptcy. We have heard 
   the example that the Senator from Illinois pointed out, Lorcin Industries, one of the largest manufacturers of the Saturday night specials. We heard how they have attempted to use the bankruptcy laws to their financial advantage and to the disadvantage of the families who have legitimate interests in pursuing their rights in a court of law. 
   As a result, Lorcin was able to settle its lawsuit for pennies on the dollar when tens of millions of dollars in damages were at stake. One of the major issues raised by creditors in the bankruptcy case was whether the company was using the ability to reorganize its operations under the bankruptcy code as a way of avoiding paying large sums to plaintiffs if it lost the suits. 
   That has been replicated by Sundance Industries of Valencia, CA, who filed for chapter 7 bankruptcy. The owner said he had been worn down by the legal assault on the gun industry. In addition, last May, Davis Industries of Mira Loma, CA, sought protection in the U.S. bankruptcy court. 
   According to a lawyer who represented creditors in the 1996 bankruptcy of Lorcin, ``Bankruptcy is a very useful negotiating tool, and predictably the more suits that are filed, the more these gun companies are going to file for bankruptcy.'' 
   A lawyer for one of the cities suing the gun manufacturers said that bankruptcy ``is going to be a huge pain'' because it will require much more time and expense for the cities. 
   Litigation may well be the only means to hold the gun manufacturers accountable for the harm caused by their products. Public interest lawsuits have changed the balance of power between the public and the mammoth industries long thought to be invincible. 
   At long last, the American people are getting their day in court against the gun industry. The gun manufacturers and the NRA should not be allowed to hide behind the bankruptcy laws to prevent liability. The Levin amendment supports the citizens and cities harmed by this powerful industry. It deserves to be supported by the Senate, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the record, I want to ensure that congressional intent on the Secretary of Health and Human Services' organ transplantation rule is clear. The provision in the tax extender bill, which provides for a 90 day delay with a required 60 day comment period, does not reflect the views of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Rather, congressional intent is expressed by the provision in the Consolidated Appropriations bill, which simply delays the effective date of the regulation by 42 days. This compromise assures that the transplant community and affected patients will have one final chance to discuss this issue, and that the Secretary shall then proceed with the regulation. Therefore, the provision in the Consolidated Appropriations bill should have legal effect, notwithstanding the provision in the tax extender bill.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator ROTH in commending our colleagues on the Finance Committee for their strong work in helping bring us to where we are today. I thank them for their leadership. 
   I would especially like to acknowledge Senator JEFFORDS, who has been instrumental in the development of the legislation. And I, all of us on this side and throughout the Senate and across the country always recognize the real leader on all of the disability issues, our friend from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, who has had a lifetime of commitment on the issues of promoting the interests of disabled Americans. The Senate will welcome his comments this afternoon. 
   Today, Congress will complete action on the Ticket to Work and the Work Incentives Improvement Act, and this important legislation will go at long last to the White House. When President Clinton signs this bill into law, he will truly be signing a modern Declaration of Independence for millions of men and women with disabilities in communities across the country who will have a priceless new opportunity to fulfill their hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives. 
   We know how far we have come in the ongoing battle over many decades to ensure that people with disabilities have the independence they need to be participating members of their communities. 
   Mr. President, 67 years ago this month we elected a disabled American to the highest office in the land. He became one of the greatest Presidents, but Franklin Roosevelt was compelled by the prevailing attitudes of his time to conceal his disability as much as possible. The World War II Generation began to change all that. The 1950s showed the Nation a new class of people--people with disabilities--as veterans returned from the war to an inaccessible society. Each decade since then has brought significant progress. 
   In the 1960s, Congress responded with new architectural standards so we could build a society of which everyone could be a part. 
   The 1970s convinced us that full participation in society was needed, not only for disabled veterans but for disabled children and family members and for those injured in everyday accidents. Congress responded with a range of federally funded programs which improved the lives of people with mental retardation, supported the rights of children with disabilities to go to school, ensured the right of people with disabilities to vote, and gave people with disabilities greater access to health care. 
   The 1980s brought a new realization that when we are talking about assisting people with disabilities, we must not look only to Federal programs, but to the private sector as well. Congress again responded by guaranteeing fair housing opportunities for people with disabilities, by ensuring access to air travel, and making telecommunication advances available for people who are hard of hearing or deaf. 
   The 1990s brought us the Americans with Disabilities Act, which promised every disabled citizen a new and better life, in which disability would no longer put an end to the American dream. 
   But too often, for too many Americans, the promise of the ADA has been unfulfilled. Now, with this legislation, we will finally link civil rights clearly with health care. It isn't civil and it isn't right to send a person to work without the health care they need and deserve. 
   As Bob Dole stated in his eloquent testimony to the Finance Committee earlier this year, this issue is about people going to work--``it is about dignity and opportunity and all the things we talk about, when we talk about being an American.'' 
   Millions of disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But they have been denied the opportunity to work because they lack access to needed health care. As result, the Nation has been denied their talents and their contributions to our communities. 
   Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern technology make it easier than ever before for disabled persons to have productive lives and careers. Current laws are often a greater obstacle to that goal than their disability itself. It's ridiculous that we punish disabled persons who dare to take a job by penalizing them financially, by taking away their health insurance lifeline, and by placing other unfair obstacles in their path. 
   Currently, there are approximately 9 million working-age adults who receive disability benefits, many of whom could take jobs if they could keep their governmentally financed health benefits. A national survey earlier this year showed that, while 76 percent of people with disabilities wanted to work, nearly 75 percent are unemployed. Of those receiving benefits, only 1/2 of 1% leave the disability roles to return to work. 
   Disability groups have estimated that about 2 million of the 8 million would consider forgoing disability payments and take jobs as a result of this legislation. 
   The estimated cost of this new program would be recouped if only 70,000 people leave the disability benefit roles. If 210,000 of them take jobs, the government would actually save $1 billion annually in disability payments. 
   That 210,000 constitutes only 10% of the number of people who the disability community believe will avail themselves of this program. If their estimates are even close to accurate, the savings to the Federal Government could eventually approach $10 billion per year. Far more important that the savings is the impact on people's lives. It is about dignity. It is about opportunity that is by far the most important charge. 
   Today is a new beginning for persons with disabilities in their pursuit of the American dream. This bill corrects the injustice they have unfairly suffered. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to work that face so many Americans with disabilities: 
   In makes health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work, or develops a significant disability while working. 
   It gives people with disabilities greater access to the services they need to become successfully employed. 
   It phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that workers with disabilities face today. 
   It places work incentive planners in communities, rather than in bureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities learn how to obtain the employment services and support they need. 
   Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long and hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, family members, citizens, and advocates. They showed us how current job programs for people with disabilities are failing them and forcing them into poverty. 
   In all the time I have been in the Senate, I doubt if there has really been a single piece of legislation that has so coherently reflected the common concerns of a constituency and all of that constituency worked so effectively on recommendations to the Congress of the United States. 
   We have worked together for many months to develop effective ways to right these wrongs. And to all of them I say, thank you for helping us to achieve this needed legislation. It truly represents legislation of the people, by the people and for the people. It is all of you who have been the fearless, tireless warriors for justice. 
   When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think of men and women and children who are disabled from birth. But fewer than 15% of all people with disabilities are born with their disabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness can suddenly disable the healthiest and most physically able person. 
   In the long run, this legislation may be more important than any other action we have taken in this Congress. 
   I say that very sincerely. In the long run, this legislation may be the most important piece of legislation we have passed in this Congress. Its offers a new and better life to large numbers of our fellow citizens. Disability need no longer end the American dream. That was the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act a decade ago, and this legislation dramatically strengthens our fulfillment of that promise. 
   This bill has a human face. It is for Alice in Oklahoma, who was disabled because of multiple sclerosis and receives SSDI benefits. She will now be able to get personal assistance to work  and live in here community. No longer will she have to use all of her savings and half of her wages to pay for personal assistance and prescription drugs. No longer will she be left in poverty. 
   This bill is for Tammy in Indiana, who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair and works part-time at Wal-Mart. No longer will she be forced to restrict her hours of work. Her goals of becoming a productive citizen will no longer be denied--because now she will have access to the health care she needs. 
   This bill is for Abby in Massachusetts, who is six years old and has mental retardation. Her parents are very concerned about her future. Already, she has been denied coverage by two health insurance firms because of the diagnosis is of mental retardation. Without Medicaid, her parents would be bankrupted by her current medical bills. 
   Now when Abby enters the work force, she will not have to live in poverty or lose her Medicaid coverage. All that will change, and she will have a fair opportunity to work and prosper. 
   This bill is for many other citizens whose stories are told in this diary, called ``A Day in the Life of a Person with a Disability.'' 
   Disabled people are not unable. Our goal in this legislation is to banish the stereotypes, to reform and improve existing disability programs, so that they genuinely encourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live independently, and be a productive and contributing member of their community. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and with this legislation, we are taking a giant step toward that goal. 
   A story from the debate on the Americans with Disabilities Act illustrates the point. A postmaster in a town was told that he must make his post office accessible. The building had 20 steep steps leading up to a revolving door at the only entrance. The postmaster questioned the need to make such costly repairs. He said, ``I've been here for thirty-five years, and in all that time, I've yet to see a single customer come in here in a wheelchair.'' As the Americans with Disabilities Act has proved so well, if you build the ramp, they will come, and they will find their field of dreams. This bill builds new ramps, and vast numbers of the disabled will now come--to work. 
   The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must be more accessible to all Americans--no matter how many steps stand in the way. That is our goal in this legislation. It is the right thing to do, and it is the cost effective thing to do. And now we are finally doing it. 
   Eliminating these barriers to work will help disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer country when we open the door of opportunity to all Americans, and enable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of Americans with disabilities, this bill is a declaration of independence that can make the American dream come true. Now, when we say ``equal opportunity for all,'' it will be clear that we mean all. 
   No one in America should lose their medial coverage--which can mean the difference between life and death--if they go to work. No one in this country should have to choose between buying a decent meal and buying the medication they need. 
   Nearly a year ago, President Clinton signed an executive order to increase employment and health care coverage for people with disabilities. Today, with strong bipartisan support, Congress is demonstrating its commitment to our fellow disabled citizens. But our work is far from done. 
   This bill is only the first step in the major reform of the Social Security disability programs that will enable individuals with disabilities to have the rights and privileges that all other Americans enjoy; 54 million Americans with disabilities are waiting for our action. We will not stop today, we will not stop tomorrow, we will not ever stop until America works for all Americans. 
   Mr. President, in these final moments, I especially commend President Clinton, Vice President Gore, and Secretary Shalala. President Clinton made this one of his top priorities over this year and during these final negotiations. He understands the importance of this legislation, and this was a matter of central importance to him and his Presidency. 
   I also thank John Podesta and Chris Jennings who saw this through to the very end. 
   I commend the many Senate staff members whose skilled assistance contributed so much to the achievement: Jennifer Baxendale, Alec Vachon, and Frank Polk of Senator ROTH's staff; Kristin Testa, John Resnick, Edwin Park, and David Podoff of Senator MOYNIHAN's staff; Pat Morrissey, Lu Zeph, Chris Crowley, Jim Downing, and Mark Powden of Senator JEFFORDS' staff; Connie Garner--a special thanks to Connie Garner--Jim Manley, Jonathan Press, Jeffrey Teitz, and Michael Myers of my own staff; and the many other staff members of the Health Committee and the Finance Committee. 
   No longer will disabled Americans be left out and left behind. The Ticket to Work and the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 is an act of courage, an act of community, and, above all, an act of hope for the future. I urge its passage, and I reserve the remainder of the time of the Senator from New York. 
   Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my strong support for the Northeast Dairy Compact. Since taking effect in October 1997, the Compact has stabilized milk prices for both farmers and consumers in New England. 
   Farmers across the country are unable to make ends meet. The number of farmers in New England has declined significantly in recent years. In 1992, Massachusetts had 365 dairy farms. Today, that number has declined to 290 dairy farms. Farmers in New England are losing a priceless heritage, that their families have owned for generations--some since the 1600s. The Northeast Dairy Compact helps ensure that in the face of these difficult times for their industry, our farmers will have a consistent income to preserve their way of life. 
   There are many misconceptions about the Dairy Compact. One of the most serious misconceptions is that taxpayers pick up the cost of the Compact. Taxpayers do not pay for this program--it is run at no cost to the federal government. 
   In addition, with respect to competition a Congressional a condition imposed on the Compact specifically provides that: ``The Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact Commission shall not prohibit or in any way limit the marketing in the compact region of any milk or milk product produced in any other production area in the United States.'' 
   Another misconception is that the Dairy Compact hurts the poor. This program does not hurt poor people. WIC and the school lunch program are exempt. In fact, in New England, the Compact overpaid these programs for two years in a row. 
   When approved in 1996, the purpose of the Dairy Compact was to ensure the viability of dairy farming in the Northeast and to ensure an adequate supply of local milk to consumers. The Compact is a price support, and was never intended to make anyone rich. It was intended to preserve small family farms and provide safeguards against excessive production. 
   The Compact has been a great success. The price of milk has actually dropped by an average of 5 cents a gallon across New England, and for many months at a time, prices have remained so stable that no compact money has been paid to farmers. 
   The Dairy Compact is good for our farmers, preserving their way of life. It is good for the environment, preserving farms and green space that Western Massachusetts is known for. And it is good for consumers, stabilizing prices and ensuring a fresh and local supply of milk. 
   We stand for free competition, but we also stand for fair competition. In many areas of current law, there are long-standing provisions designed to produce competition that is both free and fair. The New England Dairy Compact deserves the support it has received from the Senate in recent years, and I hope that it will continue to receive that support.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this legislation is necessary to resolve the confusion in current law over whether firefighters who are also trained as paramedics are covered by the exemption in section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
   This bill defines ``employee engaged in fire protection activities'' to make clear that fire fighters who perform fire fighting duties are covered by the exemption, regardless of the number of hours they spend in responding to Emergency Medical Services calls. This legislation restores the original intent of the 1986 law that created the section exemption. 
   Significantly, the legislation also states that in order to qualify for the exemption, an employee must have the ``legal authority and responsibility to engage in fire suppression.'' This phrase was added for the express purpose of assuring that single-role emergency medical personnel are not covered by the exemption. Simply sending paramedics to the fire academy will not automatically bring them under the exemption. Fire suppression must be an integral part of the responsibilities for all employees covered by the exemption.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, biomedical research is making great strides in providing new treatments for a wide range of diseases. Thousands of talented scientists across the country are making new discoveries about the fundamental mechanisms of health and disease. Yet the talents of these researchers are often undermined by a lack of adequate facilities and equipment to conduct their crucial work. 
   Numerous authoritative studies have demonstrated that medical research laboratories are critically in need of reconstruction and repair. The National Science Foundation found that  over half the institutions conducting biomedical research in this country suffer from inadequate space for medical research. The Foundation also reported that medical research institutions have had to postpone nearly $11 billion in renovation and construction projects due to lack of adequate funding. As a result, over a quarter of medical research facilities in the nation are in urgent need of renovation or reconstruction. 
   The need to revitalize the infrastructure of our research enterprise is recognized throughout the medical community. The Association of American Medical Colleges and the Federation of Societies for Experimental Biology have both issued statements calling on the federal government to provide increased resources for reconstruction and renovation of medical research facilities. 
   The bill before the Senate today significantly increases our commitment by authorizing a substantial increase in the funds available to the National Institute of Health to provide peer-reviewed grants for laboratory construction and renovation. 
   Not only have medical research facilities fallen into disrepair, but laboratories frequently lack needed research equipment. Modern medical instruments are increasingly sophisticated. Scientists are gaining new insights into such basic processes as the workings of the brain and the genetic basis of disease. With this increase in sophistication has come an increase in cost. The rising price of medical technology means that scientists must often curtail research programs, because they lack access to sensitive instruments such as MRI scanners or high resolution microscopes. 
   To address the acute need for sophisticated scientific instruments, the bill before us also provides needed funds for medical researchers to purchase major pieces of scientific equipment. Only by giving medical researchers the equipment they need to use their talents fully can we achieve the scientific breakthroughs necessary to meet our most pressing health needs. 
   We should not enter the twenty-first century with medical laboratories that lack adequate space, adequate facilities and adequate equipment. We must provide the funding that is urgently needed to construct modern laboratories and give researchers the equipment necessary for their cutting-edge research. I urge my colleagues to join with me in supporting this legislation that is so vital to the health care needs of our nation and I commend my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, for his leadership on this and many other critical health care issues.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, biomedical research continues to produce great advances in our ability to combat deadly diseases, and its promise for the future is vast. For that promise to be fully realized in improvements in people's health, we need a stronger commitment to bring medical discoveries from the laboratory to the bedside. Increased support for clinical research is vital for developing cures and better treatments for disease. Clinical research brings insight into the most effective ways to care for patients. It offers effective ways to reduce both the human and financial costs of disease. 
   Despite these clear benefits, clinical research faces a worsening crisis. The Institute of Medicine, the National Academy of Sciences and the National Institutes of Health have all concluded that the nation's ability to conduct clinical research has declined significantly in recent years. Passing the bill currently before the Senate will reverse this dangerous decline, by addressing the major factors that have led to the weakening of our nation's ability to conduct clinical research. 
   One of these factors is the steep financial barrier than health care professionals encounter when considering a career in clinical research. Burdened with debt from their professional training, clinicians must often forego a research career in order to earn the money necessary to pay back their loans. Our bill will lower the economic barriers to careers in clinical research by providing financial incentives for doctors to conduct patient-research. The bill authorizes the National Institutes of Health to establish a loan repayment program to lessen the debt they must carry if they pursue careers in clinical research. The bill also provides for peer-reviewed grants to support clinical researchers at all stages of their careers. 
   While the current state of clinical research is cause for great concern, the future of this vital health care field is even more worrying. Many of today's young clinical investigators have inadequate training in the methods of clinical research. Dr. Harold Varmus, Director of the National Institutes of Health, has emphasized the need for clinicians to have access to specialized training in patient-oriented research. This bill will provide grant support for young medical professionals to receive graduate training in such research. 
   To meet the nation's need for clinical research, it is not enough to increase the number of doctors conducting such research. Clinical researchers must also have the facilities necessary to conduct their lifesaving work. In these days when hospitals are squeezed more and more tightly by financial pressures, there is little room for them to devote scarce resources to clinical research. To address this problem, the bill provides grants to General Clinical Research Centers, now established in 27 states, where health professionals can have access to the vital hospital resources necessary to conduct high quality patient-oriented research. 
   This measure is supported by more than 70 biomedical associations. I commend the Chairman of our Health Committee, Senator JEFFORDS, for his effective leadership on this legislation. It is vital to the quality of health care in the nation in years ahead, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, advances in biomedical science and technology in this century have given us many tools to improve our understanding of the causes of disease, and to develop better strategies to prevent and treat human illness. The recent explosion of knowledge in genetics offers us the newest and most powerful weapons in the war against disease and suffering. 
   The legislation I am introducing, the Genetics and Public Health Services Act, will increase the federal, state and local public health resources needed to translate genetic information and technology into strategies to improve public health. 
   Our national investment in science, and in particular in the National Institutes of Health, is reaping important dividends for the entire country. As a result of the Human Genome Project and other public and private sector research, we soon may have access to the entire human genetic code. From work accomplished so far, scientists have begun to develop a greater understanding of how genes contribute to the development of common diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, hypertension, depression, heart disease and many other illnesses. Genetic information and technology have enormous potential for improving our efforts to promote health and combat disease. 
   Based on current understanding of genes and human disease, we know that at least 65 percent of Americans have or will have a health problem for which there is a clear genetic contribution. Some have rare, but serious, conditions--such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease or phenylketonuria. Many more have common disorders--asthma, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, stroke and depression--in which genetic predisposition plays an important role. 
   Genetic information can help us to understand and identify those at risk for serious diseases and conditions, and help doctors monitor their health in order to diagnose and treat the diseases before they cause irreversible injury or death. 
   Advancing our understand of genetics will revolutionize the treatment of disease. For example, understanding the genetic factors that contribute to Alzheimer's disease will help us to understand why some patients seem to respond to a new treatment, while others do not. Genetic information may soon be able to predict the types of individuals who have intolerable side effects from certain therapies. Doctors will be able to use genetic information to choose safer and more effective treatments that are tailored to each individual. 
   Medical scientists are now beginning to think about genetic-based strategies to prevent illness, too. Understanding how genes contribute to the development of disease will give us new ways to intervene before disease develops. We will be able to use new therapies to prevent stroke, heart disease and many other conditions that cause disability and premature death. 
   We have an unprecedented opportunity to use the expanding knowledge in genetics to improve health care. Scientific discoveries based on genetic information will change the face of health care in the future. But we lack the resources and systems needed today to translate that information into effective steps to diagnose, treat, and ultimately prevented disease. 
   In order to realize the potential benefits of genetic information and technology, we must invest the resources needed to translate this knowledge into practical approaches to health care. We must do this quickly, to keep pace with the explosion of knowledge coming from public and private sector scientists. 
   This legislation accomplishes these goals by creating two new grant programs in the Department of Health and Human Services. The first provides grants to states to develop and maintain ways to safely and effectively use genetic information in their state and local public health programs. The second grant program focuses on the translation of new genetic information and technologies to practical public health strategies that can be used in public and private health care. 
   The grant program for states will support methods to incorporate genetics at every level of state and local public health systems. Each state and territory has a unique population and a unique public health program. This proposal provides states with the support and flexibility to design approaches tailored to their specific needs and existing resources. States may use funds to establish and maintain essential resources, such as information systems, service programs, and other fundamental elements. States  will be required to monitor, evaluate and report on the impact of programs and systems funded by the Act. 
   Responsible use of genetic information must be based on scientific data. The second grant program created by this legislation addresses the need for ongoing development and evaluation of public health strategies that use genetic information and technology. The bill creates a demonstration program for public and private non-profit organizations to test innovative approaches for using genetic information to improve people's health, and to evaluate the suitability of such approaches for incorporation into state and local public health programs. 
   Broad input from all parties is a key ingredient for successful and safe use of genetic information to improve public health. Individuals must not be coerced to participate in genetic testing. It is important to involve the public in local, state and federal decisions about how to use genetic information in developing public health policy. 
   Evidence suggests that many people are afraid to take advantage of available genetic tests because they fear discrimination in the workplace or in the health insurance market. Until we pass legislation to stop such discrimination, those fears are grounded in reality. We know that steps can be taken to protect the confidentiality of genetic information and to better educate the public about the issues surrounding genetic testing. This legislation requires each state to show how it plans to involve the public in the design and implementation of its proposal. The 
   legislation also establishes a federal advisory committee to assist the Secretary of Health and Human Services in the implementation and oversight of programs under this Act. 
   Public participation is essential. Our system has failed if we offer population-wide testing for predisposition to stroke, but fail to educate individuals who must decide whether to be tested. Our system has failed if we implement population-wide testing for predisposition to breast cancer, but fail to provide access to the care that is needed to reduce the risk of developing disease. 
   Effective integration of genetics into public health systems must build on current efforts of the private and the public sector, including the work of many federal agencies. These include the achievements of the Human Genome Project at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration's oversight of certain aspects of genetic testing, the ongoing work of the Secretary's Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing, and the contributions of the project on the Ethical Legal and Social Implications of the Human Genome Project at the Department of Energy. Our new Federal commitment to safe and effective use of new genetic information and technology in the public health system will also draw significantly upon the expertise of the Health Resources and Services Administration. Translating genetic information and technology into practice will benefit as well from the expertise of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in disease surveillance and in developing and testing new public health strategies. 
   This legislation emphasizes the need to educate both health care providers and the general public. It also provides the structure and resources to include genetics in all aspects of public health--from the development of policy to the delivery of services. We must ensure that our entire public health system is ready and able to respond to the challenge of using genetic information for improving health. 
   The Genetics and Public Health Services Act is supported by leading public health and genetics organizations, including the American Public Health Association, the American College of Medical Genetics, the National, Society of Genetic Counselors, and the American Society of Human Genetics. The Alliance of Genetic Support Groups--representing those who live with genetic diseases--has written eloquently about the need to improve the resources dedicated to integrating genetics into public health. I am confident this support will grow in the coming months.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from Tennessee in proposing legislation to amend the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program. 
   This program is an important part of the nation's public health strategy. In order to encourage the development and use of effective vaccines, the program guarantees compensation to the few children who are injured by routine immunization. 
   Recent evidence suggests that some children may suffer vaccine-related injuries that are not covered under the current criteria used to determine eligibility for compensation. To continue the program's success, Congress must assure that the system is responsive to new developments in medical science. We need to be certain that any child who suffers a severe injury as a result of routine vaccination is eligible for compensation under the program. 
   My colleague from Vermont has concisely summarized the current status of the program and the importance of amending the statute. Families and physicians need to know that public health procedures are capable of a rapid and appropriate response to scientific developments. It is a privilege to join my colleagues in offering this legislation to improve the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program.

I particularly commend my colleague from Washington, Senator GORTON, for his leadership on this issue. Promoting the use of defibrillators is good public policy. The substitute amendment is supported by the American Heart Association, the American Red Cross and the American Red Cross. I am hopeful that the recommendations to be developed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services will encourage decision makers at the federal, state and local levels to make the most effective use of automated external defibrillators. I believe that this legislation will save lives. The ``Good Samaritan'' provisions contained in the legislation are targeted, and there is no need for additional categories. I urge the Senate to approve it now, and the House to pass it in the next session. It is a solid proposal, and it deserves prompt enactment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, the House of Representatives will take up one of the most important bills to come before this Congress, now labeled the Ticket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, which is intended to move us closer to opening the workplace doors for the disabled in communities across the country. 
   It is a sad day when the U.S. Congress finds it necessary to attach a controversial provision to the legislation that could jeopardize the opportunity for large numbers of people with disabilities to fulfill their hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives. 
   A decade ago, when Congress enacted the Americans With Disabilities Act, we promised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life in which disability would no longer put an end to the American dream. Too often, for too many Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The Ticket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act is basically the legislation that Senator JEFFORDS of Vermont and I, Senator ROTH, and Senator MOYNIHAN urged the Senate to accept and had been accepted by the Senate by a 99-0 vote. Now the title is the Ticket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act, and it will dramatically strengthen the fulfillment of that promise. 
   We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity, primarily because they lack the continued access to needed health care. As a result, the Nation is denied their talents and contributions to our community. 
   Eliminating the health care barriers to work will help large numbers of disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency and enable them to become equal partners in the American dream. The Ticket To Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to work that face so many Americans with disabilities. It makes health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work, or develops a significant disability while working; it gives people greater access to the services they need to become successfully employed; it phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, instead of the unfair sudden cutoff that workers with disabilities face today; it places work incentives in communities, rather than bureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities to learn how to obtain the employment services and support they need. 
   For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left behind. It is time for us to take the long overdue action needed to correct the injustices that have unfairly been placed upon those with disabilities. We should not have this legislation brought down by a controversial provision that does not belong in this bill--a provision that is effectively what they call around here a ``poison pill.'' A provision that endangers the legislation. 
   I want to say that for a time it looked as if we were going to see a successful achievement for this legislation, and I want to commend my colleague and friend, the Senator from Vermont, Mr. JEFFORDS, for his strong leadership, as chairman of our Human Resource Committee. He has worked long and hard for this legislation. If we are able to achieve it, his role in support of it and also in its development is enormously important. 
   On the unacceptable amendment that I had mentioned, it is the amendment which would effectively undermine the proposal of the Secretary of HHS on Final Rule for organ transplantation. There is an excellent editorial in the Washington Post, dated 11-17-99. It puts this issue in perspective. It says:  
   Congress has not quite given up the year-long attempt to block rules that would make the Nation's organ transplant network more equitable. House leaders are maneuvering to undo a deal reached by conferees allowing the rules to go into effect, even threatening to block an unrelated authorization for research and training at children's hospitals if the organ rules are not further delayed.  
   This was written at a time when they were threatening to hold up the help and assistance that pediatric hospitals need to train pediatricians, to make sure that pediatric hospitals were going to be treated fairly and equitably, as other teaching hospitals. 
   There is broad and wide bipartisan support for the proposal to support teaching in pediatric hospitals. But that was going to be the messenger, and the poison pill was going to be the language which, as I understand, would be a part of the legislation that we will see later on in the day. 
   Let me continue with the Post editorial:  
   The rules issuance last year touched off furious counter-lobbying by the supporters of the small local transplant centers who feared that a new system based more on finding the patients with the most urgent need, and less on keeping organs near home, would force small centers to close. Never mind if it also would save lives. Currently, when an organ becomes available, it is offered locally first and then regionally. That leads to situations in which people languish on long waiting lists in some places, while the wait in other regions is much shorter. The wealthy can get on multiple waiting lists and fly to wherever a liver or kidney becomes available. Since some 4,000 people a year die while waiting for an organ, you would think a proposal to purge the distribution system of some of its inefficiencies would have been welcome. Instead, local transplant centers turn to Congress, which twice attached riders to appropriations bills delaying the regulations' effective date. They also turned to State governments, many of which passed laws that bar and prevent organs from being transferred out of State. Finally, conferees reached a compromise that would delay the rules 6 more weeks, then let them go into effect.  
   Mr. President, that agreement was broken with the language that has been included on the disability legislation. By breaking that agreement, the lives of tens of thousands of desperately ill people are put at risk. Every year, thousands of people die while waiting for transplantation--and at least one person every day dies because the transplantation system is not equitable. The language included on the disability legislation violates fundamental fairness--the fairness of the bargaining process in which an agreement was reached between the  Secretary and the appropriators, and the fairness of the organ allocation system. 
   Mr. President, I will take only a moment or two more--because the time is moving on--to refer to the Institute of Medicine report, which really is the authoritative report on this whole issue. I will mention relevant parts of the institute report, and focus on the conclusion that the Institute of Medicine had on the whole question of developing rules on fairness for organ transplantation--the question of how to best address the moral issues and the ability of people to be able to be treated fairly under a system of organ distribution. 
   The Institute of Medicine's analysis shows that patients who have a less urgent need for a transplant sometimes receive transplants before more severely ill patients who are served by different OPOs. There is no credible evidence that implementing the HHS's recommendation would result in closure of smaller transplant centers. 
   Mr. President, that fear about the fate of small centers is the heart of the argument of those that have put on this rider. A rider that has no business being put on this legislation. 
   The Institute of Medicine analysis further found that there is no reason to conclude that minority and low-income patients would be less likely to obtain organ transplants as a result. Likewise, data does not support the assertion that potential donors and their families would decline to make donations because an organ might be used outside the donor's immediate geographical area. 
   The Institute of Medicine recommended that HHS--and this is on page 12 of the report--should exercise the legitimate oversight responsibilities assigned to it by the National Organ Transplant Act, and articulated in the Final Rule, to manage the system of organ procurement and transplantation in the public interest. 
   Federal oversight is needed to ensure that high standards of equity and quality are met. Those high standards of equity and quality were included in the Secretary's excellent recommendation. By tampering with those, we are undermining enormously powerful and important health policy issues. And this extremely controversial rider is added onto underlying legislation which is so important to millions of disabled individuals in our country. Individuals who thought--when this legislation moved through with very strong bipartisan support in the Senate, and then through the final months, has moved through the House of Representatives, and has the strong support of President Clinton, and has had the bipartisan support here in the Congress--thought that there was going to be a new day for those who have physical or mental challenges and disabilities to have the ability to participate in the workforce and become more productive, useful, active, and independent citizens in this country, and also to be able to contribute to the Nation in a more significant way. 
   I certainly hope we can work through this process because the legislation, which as I mentioned, has been completed and supported in a bipartisan way, is a lifeline to millions of Americans and deserves passage. 
   I see my friend and colleague, Senator JEFFORDS, who has been instrumental in having this legislation advanced. I am glad to see him on the floor at this time. I hope he will address the Senate on this issue.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is important that we remember how vital our nuclear nonproliferation programs with Russia are to our national security. That's why I was pleased, in recent weeks, to see two articles by Brett Wagner in the San Francisco chronicle and in the Wall Street Journal, which I would like to submit for the RECORD. 
   Mr. Wagner is the president of the California Center for Strategic Studies, and his articles bring much needed attention to an essential aspect of our nuclear nonproliferation policy--to ensure that Russian weapons-grade, highly-enriched uranium does not fall into the wrong hands. We need to live up to our agreement with Russia and strengthen our nuclear, chemical and biological nonproliferation program with that nation. Our future could well depend on it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a rather simple amendment. The amendment I have offered will protect a debtor's Social Security benefits during bankruptcy. This amendment is very important to older Americans. I hope my colleagues will support it as our House colleagues supported it last year. 
   As currently written, the means test in the pending bill will require debtors to use their Social Security benefits to repay creditors. My amendment excludes Social Security benefits from the definition of ``current monthly income'' and ensures that those benefits will never be used to repay credit card debt and other debt. 
   This amendment is particularly important to seniors. Between 1991 and 1999 the numbers of people over 65 who filed bankruptcy grew by 120 percent. If we look over the figures from 1991 to 1999 by age of petitioner, we see the growth of those that are going through bankruptcy primarily have increased in the older citizen age group. This is primarily a result of the downsizing, dismissing older workers and because of health care costs--primarily they have been dropped from health insurance. As the various statistics show, increasing numbers of individuals have been impacted because of the prescription drugs. 
   Debtors filing a medical reason for bankruptcy, as the chart shows, reflects the fact we have gotten a significant increase in the number of older people who have gone into bankruptcy. The debtors who file as medical reasons for bankruptcy, we find, increases dramatically for older workers primarily because of health care costs more than any other factor. 
   We believe very strongly those individuals, most of whom are dependent upon Social Security as virtually their only income ought to have those funds protected so they will be able to live in peace with some degree of security and some degree of dignity. 
   This is sufficiently important. One can ask, why are we doing this now rather than before? The reason it was not necessary before is because the Social Security effectively was protected with a series of protections that were included in the existing bankruptcy law which have not been included in this legislation. Therefore, without this kind of an amendment, they would be eligible for creditors. We think protecting our senior citizens, those on Social Security, as a matter of both public policy and the fact of the importance of their contributions, obviously, in terms of society, should be protected during their senior years. 
   Today, many Americans work long and hard into the senior years. A growing percentage of the population is over the age of 85 and predominantly female. We see over the period of the next 10 years our elderly population will double and the increase in the percentage of women is going to increase significantly, as well. Others may be able to find alternative employment but at substantially lower wages or without health and other benefits that become increasingly important with age. 
   In spite of all of the efforts to slow down the discrimination against elderly, in too many circumstances in our country today, the elderly are discriminated against in terms of employment. 
   Older Americans sometimes resort to short-term, high-interest credit when faced with unemployment because they assume their unemployment will be temporary. They hope their use of credit or credit card debt will serve as a bridge to cover the necessities until they start receiving paychecks again. 
   Due to their age, however, many of these individuals never earn a salary comparable to the pay they lost. They find themselves unable to deal with the new debt they have incurred. When they have nowhere else to turn, they sometimes turn to the safety value of bankruptcy. 
   Older Americans are also more frequent victims of predatory lending practices. Sometimes, bankruptcy is the most viable avenue for an elderly person to address the financial consequences of being victimized by unscrupulous lenders. It is unfortunate that Senator DURBIN's amendment to address that problem was defeated last week. 
   Studies of the problems facing older Americans tell us the same sad story. In one study, one in ten older Americans reported that they filed for bankruptcy after unsuccessfully attempting to negotiate with their creditors. In some cases, their creditors threatened them with seizure of property, or placed harassing collection calls. Some of these senior citizens explained that they have been the victims of credit scams, and they were seeking relief in the bankruptcy courts. 
   For example, a 70-year-old woman filed for bankruptcy after her son discovered that she has allowed herself to become involved in a number of dubious financial transactions, including buying more than six different expensive and duplicative life insurance policies and spending several thousand dollars on sweepstakes contests. At the time of her bankruptcy, she had mortgaged her previously mortgage-free home for more than $74,000 to try and pay off her debts. She was in danger of losing the home she shared with her husband who was in failing health. 
   The bottom line is that bankruptcy shouldn't be made more difficult for those who are depending on Social Security for their livelihood. 
   Social Security was developed to ensure that seniors can live their golden years in dignity. If we allow Social Security income to be considered while determining whether someone is eligible for bankruptcy, a portion of those benefits could be used in a manner inconsistent with Congress' intent. 
   Some of my colleagues oppose this amendment because they argue that wealthy seniors would be the beneficiaries. But, practically speaking, wealthy debtors rarely use Chapter 7--they've more likely to file under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code. 
   For very high income individuals, like Ross Perot, social security represents a very small percentage of their total income. Indeed, the maximum social security retirement benefit for a new 65-year-old retiree in 1997 was $16,000. For the Ross Perot in this country, $16,000 is a rounding error. His income is so high that including or excluding $6,000 changes his income by only a tiny percentage. But for the poor widow who gets 90 percent of her income from social security it makes a big difference. 
   Rich debtors who file in Chapter 7 would be caught by the means test, whether or not the courts include Social Security income as part of the debtor's ``current monthly income.'' 
   It is important to realize that even though we do tax individuals on higher Social Security, 75 percent of our seniors pay no tax on Social Security because they are below $25,000 in income.  this is the group about which we are talking. 
   For two-thirds of American seniors, Social Security income represents more than 50 percent of the their total income, and for 42 percent of seniors, it represents three-quarters of their total income. That is basically what we are talking about. We will hear: We can't accept this because it will create some loophole for our seniors. 
   We have to realize that for 42 percent of all seniors, Social Security represents three-quarters of their total income. Furthermore, 95 percent of all workers never reach the maximum Social Security benefit. That means only 5 percent of workers earn more than $72,000, and the average person is well below that income level. The myth of the wealthy senior using this amendment to avoid their obligations is just that--it is a myth. 
   The purpose of Social Security is to guarantee there is a financial foundation provided for all senior citizens to ensure their basic needs--food, shelter, clothing, and medicines--are met. For two-thirds of senior citizens, Social Security provides more than half of their income, and Social Security benefits are hardly enough, in many cases, to meet these basic needs of seniors. Certainly, they cannot survive on less. 
   If we are serious about providing financial security and personal dignity for the elderly, we must protect their Social Security benefits from claims in bankruptcy. Otherwise, we run the risk of vulnerable senior citizens being left with virtually nothing. In many cases, these are the people who are not healthy enough to return to work, who certainly lack the physical stamina to work the extra hours or get a second job. Social Security benefits are all they have--all they ever will have--and these few dollars are essential to their financial survival. There is a higher concern here than recovering every last dollar for creditors. It is guaranteeing the elderly some measure of financial security in their declining years. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us in Massachusetts know that Pedro Martinez, the great pitcher for the Boston Red Sox, is the class of the American League. Yesterday, the Baseball Writers' Association of America confirmed that judgment by unanimously selecting Pedro Martinez as the winner of the Cy Young Award for the American League for 1999. 
   Pedro's record this year was brilliant. His 23 victories, his earned run average of 2.07, and his 313 strikeouts led the league in all three of those categories, and his dramatic victory over the New York Yankees in the third game of the American League Championship Series last month was the crowning achievement in his extraordinary season.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to take this opportunity to recognize a leader who has given so much to the people of Cambridge, Massachusetts. Mayor Francis H. Duehay has been an elected official in the City of Cambridge for thirty-six consecutive years. Under his leadership, the city has made great progress in housing, welfare, youth employment, and many other important issues for the people. This year, Frank is retiring, and his loss will be felt deeply by all those whose lives he has touched. 
   Frank's commitment to public service is extraordinary. Throughout his years as Mayor, City Councilor, and on the School Committee he has taken pride in his commitment to work directly with the people he represents, in order to learn their concerns firsthand. Frank's work with city officials and numerous other organizations to open new lines of communication between the city government and the people of Cambridge has created a local government at its best--responsive to the needs of the people, accountable for its actions, and always open to new ideas. 
   Frank worked tirelessly to improve the quality of life for Cambridge families. He served as the chairperson for the Cambridge Kids' Council, where he's worked to create greater opportunities in the community, giving hope to children and families and providing a model for cities throughout the state. The Mayor's Summer Youth Employment Program has been extremely successful in giving young men and women the opportunity to serve their city during the summer months, enabling them to explore their interests and enhance their lives. Frank has fought hard for the families of Cambridge, and his legacy will live on through their success. 
   In all of these and many other ways, Frank Duehay has served the people of Cambridge with great distinction. I am honored to pay tribute to this remarkable leader. His public service and generosity are shining examples to us all. I know that I speak for all of the people of Cambridge when I say thank you, Frank, for your commitment and dedication to public service. You will be deeply missed.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, families across the country know that a college education is essential for their children. A college graduate earns twice what a high school graduate earns in a year, and close to three  times what a high school dropout earns. More and more students are applying for college each year--over 2 million freshmen began college last year. The result is increasingly heavy pressures on schools, families, and colleges. 
   No one understands these pressures more than prospective college students and their families who are now filling out applications, visiting college campuses, and preparing to make the all-important choices for their futures.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to have this opportunity to congratulate Henri Termeer on receiving the Golden Door Award from the International Institute of Boston. I also congratulate Henri for recently being sworn in as a United States citizen during a ceremony on October 29. 
   As chairman, chief executive officer and president of Genzyme Corporation, one of the largest biotechnology companies in the world, Henri is renowned as a pioneer in the industry. He serves on the board of directors of both the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the industry's national trade association, and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a national pharmaceutical trade organization. 
   It is very fitting, indeed, that Henri was honored with the Golden Door Award, which is presented to US citizens of foreign birth who have made outstanding contributions to American society. Henri is a native of the Netherlands, and in recent years he has received numerous honors such as the Anti-Defamation League's Torch of Liberty Award and the Governor's New American Appreciation Award. He was also recently inducted as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. 
   Throughout his career in biotechnology, Henri has been a strong advocate for the responsibility of industry and government to make life-saving drug treatments available to all people in need, regardless of their economic status or geographic location. Under Henri's leadership, Genzyme has worked diligently over the years to make this vision a reality. 
   In addition to his commitment to patients, Henri is also a leader in promoting educational opportunities for minorities. Since 1995, he has been a director of the Biomedical Science Careers Project, which provides corporate scholarships to academically outstanding minority high school students. In May 1999, the group presented Henri with highest honor, the Hope Award. 
   Henri's extensive record of public service includes his role as a director of the Massachusetts Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, as a trustee and vice-chairman of the Boston Museum of Science, and as a member of the Massachusetts Council on Economic Growth and Technology. 
   In receiving the Golden Door award, Henri joins a distinguished list of previous recipients including Arthur Fiedler, the famed former conductor of the Boston Pops; Jean Mayer, the eminent nutritionist, educator, and former president of Tufts University; and An Wang, the founder of Wang Labs. 
   I commend Henri Termeer for this well-deserved award, and for his new American citizenship. Massachusetts is proud of him, and I congratulate him for his many impressive contributions to our Nation.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year, the American Immigration Law Foundation and the American Immigration Lawyers Association sponsor a national writing contest on immigration. Thousands of fifth grade students across the country participate in the competition, answering the question, ``Why I'm Glad America is a Nation of Immigrants.'' 
   In fact, ``A Nation of Immigrants'' was the title of a book that my brother President Kennedy wrote in 1958 at a time when he was a Senator. All his life, he took pride in America's great heritage and history of immigration. 
   As one of the judges of this year's contest, I was immensely impressed with the quality of the students' writing and the pride of the students in America's immigrant heritage. Many of the students told the story of their own family's immigration to the United States. 
   The winner of this year's contest is Crystal Uvalle, a fifth grader from Pennsylvania. She wrote about her father's immigrant background and how he came to America 20 years ago. Other students honored for the high quality of their essays were Leif Holmstrand and Eugene Yakubov of Chicago, Samantha Huber of Fredonia, Wisconsin, Alexa Lash of Miami, and Daniel Rocha of Media, Pennsylvania.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there has been focus on different provisions of the amendment before us. I want to address two of those in my remarks. 
   One of those provisions is, if a child attends a title I school and becomes the victim of a violent criminal offense, including drug-related violence, while in or on the public school grounds, the school district may use the title I funds or any other Federal funds, including IDEA funds, to provide a voucher for a child to attend a private or religious school or pay the cost to transfer the child to another public school. 
   In title I, we are basically talking about $500. I do not know how one expects to pay tuition to a school for about $500. A variety of technical  issues and questions are raised. It, obviously, is creating a sense of expectation by those who put this proposal forward. 
   Nonetheless, on the issue of the value of the measure, even if it did have sufficient funds to do what it intends, it will not make the schools any safer and will not improve student achievement. We should support violence and crime prevention programs in and around public schools, not divert precious resources to private schools. Therefore, we should further invest in programs such as the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act, afterschool programs, community crime prevention activities, encourage parent and community involvement, and help communities and schools ensure that all children are safe all the time. 
   We all know that juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between 3 and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juveniles in Orange County, CA, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile gang crimes occur on schooldays and peaks immediately after school dismissal. We know afterschool programs reduce youth crime. 
   The Baltimore City Police Department saw a 44-percent drop in the risk of children becoming victims of crime after opening an afterschool program in a high-crime area. A study of the Goodnow Police Athletic League Center in northeast Baltimore found juvenile arrests dropped by 10 percent, the number of armed robberies dropped from 14 to 7, assault with handguns were eliminated, and other assaults decreased from 32 to 20 from 1995 to 1998. 
   This demonstrates how we can deal with the problems of violence in communities, violence around schools, even violence within the schools. We ought to be focusing on what works and supporting those efforts, rather than having an untried, untested program that shows on the face of it very little difference in safety and security for children in schools. 
   In addition to improved youth behavior and safety, quality afterschool programs also lead to better academic achievement by students. At the Beech Street School in Manchester, NH, the afterschool program has helped improve reading and math scores of students. In reading, the percentage of students scoring at or above the basic level increased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third in 1997. In math, the percentage of students scoring at the basic level increased from 29 percent to 60 percent. In addition, Manchester saved an estimated $73,000 over 3 years because students participating in the afterschool program avoided being retained in grades or being placed in special education. 
   This kind of investment will help keep children safe and help them achieve, and that is the right direction for education. 
   There are precious few public funds available, and those public funds should not be funneled to private and religious schools. Public tax dollars should be spent on public schools which educate 90 percent of the Nation's children, and the funds should not go to private schools when public schools have great needs. 
   We should be doing all we can to help improve public schools, 
   academically as well as from a security point of view. We should not undermine the efforts taking place in those public schools. 
   This amendment will allow any Federal education funds to be used for private school vouchers, including the title I, IDEA, and Eisenhower Professional Development Program. The Eisenhower Professional Development Program is targeted to enhance math and science. Rather than enhancing math, science, and academic achievement for children in the public schools, we are drawing down on those funds to permit some students to go to other schools. It makes absolutely no sense. 
   Federal funds should not go to schools that can exclude children. There is no requirement for schools receiving vouchers to accept students with limited English proficiency, homeless students, or students with disciplinary problems. Precious funds should be earmarked for public schools which do not have the luxury of closing their doors to students who pose a problem. 
   The challenges the schools are facing today are much more complex, much more complicated than they were even a few short years ago. I was with the head mistress of the Revere School in the last week. I said: I remember visiting the school 2 years ago and they had nine different languages. 
   She said: How about 29 different languages now with different cultures and traditions? 
   They are facing more complexity in dealing with children, and it is necessary to give them support and not deplete scarce resources. They obviously should have accountability in how effectively those resources are being used, but when you talk about undermining the Eisenhower training programs for math and science or IDEA, which is funding needs for special education, and even the title I programs for disadvantaged children, it makes no sense whatsoever. 
   Our goal is to reform the public schools, not abandon them. Instead of draining much needed resources from public schools, we should create conditions for improvement and reform, not in a few schools but in all schools, not in a few students but in all students. Effectively, what we would be doing is abandoning a great majority of students. That is wrong.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, drug abuse in our Nation is a menace that threatens the security, health, and productivity of all of our citizens. Every reputable authority who has examined the problem of drug addition knows that there is no army large enough to keep all drugs from crossing our borders and no nation powerful enough to imprison all pushers and suppliers. We must use all the constitutional enforcement tools at our command to make the criminals who would profit from the degradation of our fellow citizens pay the price of their crimes. 
   An effective fight against drug abuse must take three approaches: law enforcement, prevention and treatment. Each of these three approaches is vital; no program can be successful unless it involves them all. 
   The widespread use of illegal drugs is one of the most pressing problems facing our society. Illegal drugs are killing children and destroying families. Vast profits from the sale of illegal drugs have created a new criminal underworld which promotes violence and feeds on death. 
   However, this amendment does not go about this problem in the right way. 
   By raising powder cocaine penalties, the amendment reduces the current 100 to 1 ratio between the two drugs, but it doesn't solve the underlying problem. The real problems is that crack penalties are out of proportion to the penalties for other drugs. Increasing the penalty for powder cocaine makes the penalties for both forms of cocaine disproportionately severe compared to other drugs. 
   Twenty-seven former U.S. attorneys who are now Federal judges say they ``disagree with those who suggest that the disparity in treatment of power and crack cocaine should be remedied by altering the penalties relating to  power cocaine. The penalties for powder cocaine, both mandatory minimum and guideline sentences, are severe and should not be increased.'' 
   Clearly Congress is right to be concerned about excessively lenient sentences for serious offenses. but the sentencing guideline system in place today is the most effective way to limit judicial discretion. In 1984, Senator THURMOND, Senator BIDEN, I, and others, worked together to pass bipartisan sentencing reform legislation. A key reform in that legislation was the creation of the Sentencing Commission, to achieve greater fairness and uniformity in sentencing. since its creation, the Commission has developed sentencing guidelines that have eliminated the worst disparities in the sentencing process, without seriously reducing judicial discretion. 
   Unfortunately, actions by Congress continue to undermine the Commission's work. The guidelines system was designed to achieve greater uniformity and fairness, while retaining necessary judicial flexibility. Instead, Congress has enacted a steady stream of mandatory minimum sentences that override the guidelines and create the very disparities that the guidelines are designed to end. 
   A recent study by the Rand Corporation shows that ``mandatory minimums reduce cocaine consumption less per million taxpayer dollars spent than does spending the same amount on enforcement.'' On the issue of controlling drug use, drug spending, and drug-related crime, the same study found that ``treatment is more than twice as cost-effective as mandatory minimums''. 
   One of the important goals of sentencing is general deterrence. We should allow the Commission to do its job, and weigh the Commission's recommendations more carefully before acting to override them. 
   In 1995, the Sentencing Commission issued a formal recommendation to Congress to change the crack ratio to 1 to 1 at the current level of powder cocaine. Congress rejected the Sentencing Commission's recommendation in a House vote and told the Commission to come up with another solution. 
   Two years later, in 1997, the Sentencing Commission issued a second recommendation to Congress to lower crack penalties and raise powder cocaine penalties. Both the Department of Justice and the drug czar's office agreed with this recommendation. Yet, the Commission's recommendation continues to be rejected by Congress. Crack cocaine penalties were enacted over a decade ago without the benefit of research, hearings, or prison impact assessments. Today, we have the advantage of scientific evidence about cocaine in both forms and about the impact of crack sentencing policies. 
   Shame on Congress for ignoring the experts it put in place to address these issues in an informed manner. The Sentencing Commission's conclusion is clear--crack penalties are out of line, not powder cocaine penalties. Two wrongs don't make a right. 
   The Sentencing Commission reports that more than half of current powder cocaine defendants are at the lowest levels of the drug trade, and 86 percent are nonviolent. Increasing the penalty will add almost 10,000 addicts and small-time drug users to the prison population in the next 10 years, at a cost to taxpayers of approximately $2 billion. In the next 20 years, that cost will escalate to over $5 billion, and in 30 years it will be $10.6 billion. 
   This amendment will also increase the disproportionate representation of minorities in federal prison, because 68 percent of the people sentenced federally for powder cocaine offenses are non-white. Of those, 40 percent are Hispanic. 
   Enacting this legislation will worsen current imbalances in drug policy at significant cost. The new powder cocaine sentences will be far above those for many other more serious and violent offenses. 
   We know that merely talking tough is not enough. The war on crime has been declared again and again--and it has been lost over and over. It is clear that we will never succeed in defeating crime if we try to do it on the cheap. We can support our State and local police without turning any locality into a police state, and without destroying the fundamental civil liberties and constitutional guarantees that make this Nation truly free. 
   To combat the drug menace we need local law enforcement programs that work. It is increasingly clear that stronger law enforcement at the local level can be successful when coupled with enhanced drug treatment and education opportunities. One of the most important tools in the war against drugs is Federal assistance to increase the number of these successful local law enforcement programs, not locking up more low-level drug dealers and throwing away the key. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support our distinguished former colleague, Senator Carol Moseley-Braun, and I urge the Senate to confirm her as Ambassador to New Zealand. Senator Carol Moseley-Braun served the people of Illinois with great distinction during her six years in the Senate. She fought hard for the citizens of Illinois and for working men and women everywhere, and it was a privilege to serve with her. In her years in the Senate, she was a leader on many important issues that affect millions of Americans, especially in the areas of education and civil rights. She worked skillfully and effectively to bring people together with her unique energetic and inspiring commitment to America's best ideals. 
   Senator Moseley-Braun has been breaking down barriers all her life. She became the first African-American woman to serve in this body. Her leadership was especially impressive in advancing the rights of women and minorities in our society. As a respected former Senator, she will bring great stature and visibility to the position of Ambassador to New Zealand. That nation is an important ally of the United States, and it is gratifying that we will be sending an Ambassador with her experience and the President's confidence.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one day a year, on Veteran's Day, America pauses to recognize the sacrifices and the contributions of our veterans. We express our gratitude to all those who have served our nation so well. For all of the veterans being honored today, I salute you for your service and your dedication to our country. 
   All veterans deserve our gratitude for their service. But it is especially fitting that we take special notice of the nation's World War II and Korean War veterans. 
   America is losing 1,000 of its World War II and Korean War veterans every day. As they pass, so does our opportunity to pay tribute to them directly. 
   Tom Brokaw has called the World War II generation the ``Greatest Generation.'' He captured the essence of this generation in his recent book by that name. As he stated:  
   The World War II generation came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America--men and women whose everyday lives of duty, honor, achievement, and courage gave us the world we have today.  
   The World War II generation and the size of its veteran population are unique in American history. Sixteen million Americans served in World War II from 1941 to 1945. 
   That war united all Americans--men and women; blacks and whites; rich and poor; old and young. My oldest brother Joe gave his life, and Jack served with great courage on PT-109 in the Pacific. 
   As much as we owe the World War II generation, we are still waiting for the construction of a national memorial in Washington to their service. At last, a site on the Mall has been selected and a design has been chosen for the National World War II Memorial. We owe it to these extraordinary veterans to complete it without delay, so that as many of our World War II veterans as possible can see the nation's enduring monument to their service. 
   We also honor these veterans by ensuring they receive the hard-earned benefits they so eminently deserve. I remain concerned about the healthcare budget of the Veterans' Administration. Health costs continue to rise and the budget has not kept pace. We have an ongoing responsibility to provide every veteran with adequate heath care. This year's VA budget includes a 1.7 billion dollar increase, and we must continue to do all we can so that veterans receive their fair share in each year's budget. 
   In addition, as the number of older veterans continues to grow, the Veterans Administration must find a way to provide long-term care. The VA published an advisory report on this issue last year, but their recommendations were far from adequate. We need to pursue this issue next year, and develop more specific initiatives. 
   Another challenge we face is to deal with the increasing concern that today's generation is estranged from the military. Only 6 percent of people under the age of 65 have ever served in the armed forces. Compare that with the fact that half of men over 50 have had at least two years of military service. 
   In the years ahead, when we no longer have the Greatest Generation--The World War II Generation--as our model, we will have to do much more to guarantee that our society keeps our armed forces strong and able to meet any threat to our country. 
   David Broder, the senior Washington Post journalist and a veteran himself, recently expressed his concern about the growing civilian-military gap. He stated:  
   The fact that no one younger than their mid-forties has even faced the possibility of being called-up for military service is one of the most significant generational divides in this country.  
   Clearly, this is cause for concern. The nation must work harder to preserve and strengthen the duties of citizenship that our veterans symbolize for all of us. 
   The military has traditionally been an effective way for America's youth to serve the nation. It is troubling that today almost two thirds of the nation's youth say they would not join the armed forces. Twenty years ago, only 40 percent said that. Since the Persian Gulf War, the interest among 16 to 21 year olds in enlisting has dropped from 34 percent to 26 percent. Last year the Army asked young adults:  
   If you want to do something beneficial for your country, are you more likely to do it in the military or in a civilian job?  
   Two to one who responded said:  
   In a civilian job.  
   Prosperity and complacency may explain such answers, but they do not justify them. Because of our nation's veterans, America is the greatest in the world, free from any major challenge from any other nation. The skillful work and dedication of our veterans have enabled our children and grandchildren to enjoy unparalleled national security and economic prosperity. 
   It is imperative in our democracy that citizens remain proud of the military and continue to respect and appreciate the sacrifices of those who serve. 
   As President Kennedy said in his Inaugural Address:  
   Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.  
   Million of Americans were inspired by these words, and our obligation is to continue that inspiration into the next century, so that a new generation will continue to ask not what their country can do for them, but what they can do for their country. 
   The reduction in the population of veterans is being felt in Congress as well. The proportion of members of the House and Senate who have served in the military has dropped from more than 75 percent in 1971 to less than 34 percent today. 
   Without the World War II and Korean generations, we will have to pay special attention to ensure that our society does not forget about our Vietnam, Gulf and Cold War veterans, or view their contributions with any less significance. 
   The veterans of these more recent wars did not come home to the fanfare that accompanied the Allied victory in World War II. But their sacrifices and contributions to our nation's defense and to the protection of our democracy are immeasurable. As a nation, it is imperative that we continue to recognize the service of these veterans and pay tribute to their sacrifices. 
   To help ensure that our nation remembers all of its veterans, I supported a Resolution this year that expresses the Sense of the Congress that the third Monday in April be designated as ``In Memory Day.'' That Day will recognize the Vietnam Veterans who have died as a result of illnesses and conditions associated with service in the Vietnam War. 
   We must honor the missing too. Today, over 80,000 American servicemen remain unaccounted for from all our nation's wars, including approximately 10,000 from the Vietnam and Korean Wars. 
   We must never forget our missing veterans. And we must never give up the effort to bring them home. 
   On behalf of the nation's disabled veterans, I strongly support the Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation to establish a national memorial to honor all disabled veterans. Recently, Miss America 1999, Heather  French of Kentucky, testified before the Senate on behalf of this memorial. During her Miss America pageant, she chose veterans as her cause, and she is emphasizing veterans issues throughout her reign. It is commitments and gestures of goodwill like hers that will keep America proud of its armed forces and the sacrifices of its veterans. 
   The cornerstone of our military preeminence rests on many factors, but the most critical is its people. Without men and women willing to volunteer for military duty, we will not be able to respond to crises around the globe that threaten our vital interests. We need cutting-edge weapon systems. But we also need dedicated service members to operate these systems. 
   As we do more to take care of the veterans of today, we must never lose sight of our obligation to take care of the veterans of tomorrow. This year Congress passed the broadest and most sweeping improvements in military pay and benefits in over twenty years. The new law calls for a well-deserved 4.8% pay raise for military personnel--the single largest pay raise for servicemen and women since 1982. It also expands authority to offer additional pay and other incentives to critical military specialties, and it improves retirement benefits for those who are serving now. 
   The military now faces one of the most difficult recruiting and retention challenges in many years. A major reason for the current problem is the strong U.S. economy. But the demands of far-flung military operations in recent years have also taken their toll on our troops. Today's military is a smaller force, and yet it is also a more active force, and we have been slow to recognize the problems that are building. 
   In the past year alone, our servicemen and women conducted combat operations in Kosovo and Iraq. They are serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia, and as humanitarian support personnel in Central America. All of these demands are in addition to the day-to-day operations and exercises at home and overseas in which the military participates throughout the year. 
   Massachusetts is a major part of all these operations. This past year, Guard and Reserve units from Massachusetts were deployed in support of Operation Northern Watch in Iraq, Hurricane Mitch relief in Central America, and in Kosovo. 
   I especially commend all those who served during Operation Allied Force in Kosovo. This was the first war that America fought and won without a single casualty. Yet its victors came home to no parade marking V-K day, and no celebration of heroes. Yet their bravery and skill saved thousands of innocent lives, and they deserve our highest praise. 
   The success of their operations was an impressive tribute to the capability and dedication of our service men and women. Veterans, in particular, should be proud, because it is their legacy and example that have helped create the world's finest armed forces. 
   I am very disappointed that a provision to improve and expand GI Bill benefits was not included in this year's Defense bill. The GI Bill has been a very successful and important program for the military and the nation. Over 2.3 million World War II veterans took advantage of the GI Bill upon returning from the war. It has been called the greatest investment in higher education that any society has ever made, and a brilliant and enduring commitment to the future. 
   In order for the GI Bill to continue its valuable work, it must evolve as our military forces evolve. Access to higher education is an increasingly important benefit for servicemen and women in today's all-volunteer, professional military. 
   Improvements are needed in the GI Bill to enhance the program's value and benefit to our troops, and to improve the bill's effectiveness as a recruiting tool--and these improvements need to be enacted into law as soon as possible. 
   Today's armed forces contain well-educated professionals who have chosen to serve their country in the military. We must treat them as the skilled professionals they are--or we will lose them. 
   Finally, when we think about our veterans, it is easy to recall the Eisenhowers, the Pattons, the MacArthurs, and the Powells. But we must never forget the countless silent heroes--the fathers, brothers, sisters, sons, and daughters who served when their country called. 
   Stephen Ambrose, in his book ``Citizen Soldier,'' talks about the ``can-do'' attitude of these quiet heroes that sets the American military apart. He describes the Normandy landing, where the American Sherman tanks were outgunned, and tells how skilled the Americans were in salvaging damaged tanks, patching them up, and sending them back into action. 
   Ambrose writes:  
   Indeed no army in the world had such a capability. Within two days of being put out of action by German shells, about half the damaged Shermans had been put back on the line. Kids who had been working at gas stations and body shops two years earlier had brought their mechanical skills to Normandy. Nearly all the work was done as if the crews were back in the States, rebuilding damaged cars and trucks.  
   These were not professional soldiers, but average Americans. They left their families and friends behind to fight because their nation called. It is the dedication and ingenuity of these silent heroes that has made America great, and that made their Greatest Generation. 
   All of us in the Kennedy family have enormous respect for our veterans and their service to the nation. Today, on the eve of Veteran's Day, I recall once again the words of President Kennedy. He visited the U.S. Naval Academy in August 1963, and spoke at a ceremony honoring the new class of midshipmen. This is what he said about his service in the Navy:  
   I can imagine a no more rewarding career. And any man who may be asked what he did to make his life worth while, I think can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction: ``I served in the United States Navy.''  
   My brother was a Navy man, but I'm sure that veterans of all the other services feel the same way. I know I am both grateful and proud of my fellow veterans, and I honor, respect, and thank them for their service.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to the Senator from Pennsylvania's comments with great interest. I will mention very briefly in defense of the administration, although they can make the case quite well for themselves that if the Appropriations Committee had finished their business on time we would not be in this particular dilemma. Only four appropriations bills were actually completed on time for the fiscal year. So with all respect to our friend on the other side, if the appropriators had placed, particularly the HEW appropriations, first rather than last, I do not think we would be having these kinds of problems in the areas of negotiation between the President and the Congress. 
   Second, the basic program which the President has been fighting for in this negotiation is almost identical to what the Republicans supported last year. With all respect to the comments we have just heard, the fact is if the classes reach the goals, the 15 percent set-aside for funding for smaller class sizes can be used to enhance the teacher training. If the school had already achieved the lower class size of 18, it would be used for special needs or other kinds of professional purposes. 
   So it is difficult for me to understand the frustration of the Senator from Pennsylvania when the Republican leaders all effectively endorse what the President talked about last year. If their position is not sustained, there are going to be 30,000 teachers who are teaching in first, second, and third grades who are going to get pink slips. I don't think the problem in education is having fewer schoolteachers teach in the early grades but to have more. 
   I want to make clear I am not a part of those negotiations this year, but I was last year. I know what the particular issue is. With all respect to those who are watching C-SPAN II, I want them to know the President is fighting for smaller class sizes as well as for better trained teachers. We have seen Senator MURRAY make that presentation and make it effectively time and again. I think it is something that parents support, teachers understand, and children have benefited from. No one makes that case more eloquently than the Senator from the State of Washington. But I certainly hope the President will continue that commitment. We have scarce Federal resources. They are targeted in areas of particular need. That is the purpose of these negotiations. I hope we can conclude a successful negotiation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to respond, we have a need for 2 million teachers. We have scarce Federal resources. If the States or local communities want to do whatever the Senator from New Mexico says, all well and good. But we are talking about scarce Federal resources that are targeted in ways that have been proven effective in enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   I am again surprised. The Republicans were taking credit for this last year. I was in the negotiations. Mr. GOODLING and Mr. Gingrich--as we were waiting to find out whether the powers that be, the Speaker, was going to endorse this, when we were waiting and having negotiations--went out and announced it and took credit for it. They took credit for this proposal of the President. 
   I find it a little difficult to understand this kind of frustration that is being demonstrated here. But we will come back to this and Senator MURRAY can address these issues at a later time. I certainly hope the President will not flinch in his commitment to getting smaller class sizes and better trained teachers and after school programs. That is what this President has been fighting for. I hope he will not yield at this time in these final negotiations, after we have only had four appropriations that have met the deadline. Before we get all excited about these negotiations, if our appropriators had completed this work in time, we would not be here.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
   In a few moments, we will be voting on the minimum wage issue that is before the Senate. I want to review what the record has been over the last 2 years. 
   In September of 1998, we brought up the minimum wage issue, and were unable to bring that to a vote on the basis of the merits. The Republican leadership said no. 
   In March of 1999, we tried to bring up this issue. Again, we were denied an opportunity to vote on it. 
   In April of 1999, we brought it up again as an amendment on Y2K. We were denied an opportunity to have a full debate. 
   In July of 1999, we brought it up again, and again we were turned down. 
   Now we have the minimum wage legislation before us, and in a cynical move, the Republican leadership said: Even if you get the passage of the minimum wage, it ``ain't'' going to go any further; the President isn't going to see it; it is going to end. 
   It is a sham. Their effort is basically a sham. That is the position in which we find ourselves today. 
   We know Americans are working longer and harder. The working poor are working longer and harder than at any time in the history of our country. We know that over the last 10 years, women are working 3 weeks longer a year in order to earn the minimum wage and men are averaging 50 hours a week. These are some of the hardest working men and women in the country. 
   At the height of the minimum wage in the late 1960s, it had the purchasing power that $7.49 would have today. If we are not able to raise the minimum wage this year and next, its value will be at an all-time low--in a time of extraordinary prosperity in this country. That is fundamentally wrong. 
   A vote for the Republican amendment will not help working families. It is, in fact, an insult to low-wage workers. It robs them of over $1,200 as compared to the Democratic proposal, and it drastically undermines the overtime provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act which has been the law for over 60 years. 
   The Republican proposal jeopardizes the overtime pay of 73 million Americans. The Republicans did not water down their own pay increase of $4,600. They are now watering down the increase in the minimum wage, and they are watering down overtime. On the one hand, they are giving an inadequate increase in the minimum wage and taking it back by cutting back on overtime. That is a sham. That is a cynical attempt to try to win support for working families from those who are trying to do justice for those individuals. 
   We can ask, What difference does an increase in the minimum wage make? 
   Cathi Zeman, 52 years old, works at a Rite Aid in Canseburg, PA. She earns $5.68 an hour. She is the primary earner in the family because her husband has a heart condition and is only able to work sporadically. What difference would an increase in the minimum wage mean to Cathi and her family? It would cover 6 months of utility bills for Cathi's family. 
   Kimberly Frazier, a full-time child care aide from Philadelphia testified her pay of $5.20 an hour barely covers her rent, utilities, and clothes for her children. Our proposal would mean over 4 months of groceries for Kimberly and her kids. 
   The stories of these families remind us that it is long past time to raise the minimum wage by $1 over 2 years. We cannot delay it. We cannot stretch it out. We cannot use it to cut overtime. And we cannot use it as an excuse to give bloated tax breaks to the rich. 
   Members of Congress did not blink in giving themselves a $4,600 pay raise. Yet they deny a modest increase for those workers at the bottom of the economic ladder. I do not know how Members who voted for their own pay increase but I do not know how Members who vote against our minimum wage proposal will be able to face their constituents and explain their actions. 
   It is hypocritical and irresponsible to deny a fair pay raise to the country's lowest paid workers. Above all, raising the minimum wage $1 over 2 years and protecting overtime pay is about fairness and dignity. It is about fairness and dignity for men and women who are working 50 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year trying to provide for their children and their families. 
   This is a women's issue because a great majority of the minimum-wage workers are women. It is a children's issue because the majority of these women have children. It is a civil rights issue because the majority of individuals who make the minimum wage are men and women of color. And it is a fairness issue. At a time of extraordinary prosperity this country ought to be willing to grant an increase to the hardest working Americans in the nation--the day-care workers, the teachers aides. They deserve this increase. Our amendment will provide it, and the Republican amendment will not.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has raised an enormously important point. Americans who are working in poverty, which is at the highest level in 20 years, are working longer and harder than ever. The men work 50 hours a week or more on average and the women work an average of 3 weeks more a year. They have less time--22 hours less--to spend with their children than they did 10 years ago. That is why this is a children's issue, as the Senator has pointed out. 
   On the issue the difference between the Republican and the Democratic proposals, the Republicans say that their proposal makes some difference for those individuals who are going to get an increase in the minimum wage over 3 years. 
   This is a raw deal for them. On the one hand, they give them an increase in the minimum wage, and on the other hand they take back the overtime for 73 million Americans. It is a cynical sham, and it is a cynical sham because the majority leader has said even if it passes, it will never go out of this Chamber. That is the attitude toward hard-working men and women who are trying to play by the rules and get along at a time when they have the lowest purchasing power in the history of the minimum wage and we have the most extraordinary prosperity. And then they insult these workers even further by adding a $75 billion tax break over 10 years. And then we just heard about the difficulty we are having in conference about $1 billion on education because they say we cannot afford to do things, but the same side is suggesting a $75 billion tax break. Where are they getting their money? So it is a cynical play. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   I again thank the Senators from California and Washington for illustrating in very powerful terms what this issue is all about. It is about working women and families. 
   With all respect to my friend from Oklahoma, when we had an increase in the minimum wage a few years ago, the Republicans fought it. They said that it would harm the economy and adversely impact small business. In the measure I have introduced we have tried to provide some relief for small businesses and we have paid for it. Now we can't do that because we have some kind of offsets. Therefore, we can't do it. 
   The fact is, the Republicans are opposed to any increase in the minimum wage. That is the fact. They have been opposed to it even at a time of extraordinary prosperity. This minimum wage affects real people in a very important way, and there is no group 
   in our society it affects more powerfully than women and children. They are the great majority of the earners of the minimum wage, and increasingly so. 
   These days parents are spending less and less time with their families. In the last 10 years, parents were able to spend 22 hours a week less with their families. Read the Family and Work Institute's report of interviews with small children who are in minimum-wage families. They are universal in what they say. They all say: We wish our mother--or our father--would be less fatigued. We wish they had more time to spend with us. We are tired of seeing our parents come home exhausted when they are working one or two minimum-wage jobs. 
   That is what this is about. It is about the men and women at the bottom rung of the economic ladder. Are they real? Of course they are real. I have read the stories. We know who they are. They are out there today, this morning, as teacher's aides in our schools. These teacher's aides are working with young children, our future, and yet they don't earn enough to make ends meet. 
   They are there in the day-care centers. We know that day-care center workers are often at the bottom of the pay scale, earning the minimum wage. As you can see from this graph the purchasing power of the minimum wage  has declined since the last increase. As their wages lose purchasing power, turnover in low paying jobs like child care attendants and those who are working in nursing homes, increases. When people are forced to leave these jobs, there is a deterioration in quality of the service day care centers and nursing homes can offer. 
   This is about the most important element of our society. It is about fairness. It is about work. We hear all of these speeches on the other side of the aisle about the importance of work. We are honoring work. We are talking about men and women with dignity who have a sense of pride in what they do and are trying to do better and are trying to look out after their families. They are being given the back of the hand by the Republicans. 
   Their proposal is a sham. It is a raw deal for these workers. On the one hand, they are dribbling out an increase in the minimum wage; on the other hand, they are taking away overtime for 73 million Americans, and in the meantime, they are giving tax breaks to the wealthiest individuals in our society. That is a sham. Beyond that, they say the minimum wage, if we are even fortunate enough to get it to pass the Senate, will never go to the President because the Republican leadership has made a commitment to whoever it might be that it will never go there. That is what we are up against.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is important to understand exactly what the situation is for our working poor. The number of full-time, year-round workers living in poverty is at a 20-year high: 12.6 percent of the workforce, says the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as of the last 3 days. That is the fact. People are working harder, and they are living in poverty. These are people who value work. 
   Second, the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that, of those who will benefit from a minimum wage increase, 70 percent are adults over age 20, and about 30 percent will be teenagers. 
   If Senators come to Boston and talk to the young people going to the University of Massachusetts, they will find 85 percent of their parents never went to college and 85 percent of them are working 25 hours a week or more. That is true in Boston, in Holyoke, in New Bedford, and Fall River, and cities across the country. I don't know what Members have against working young people who are trying to pay for their education. We have 6 million working in the workforce, and we have 2 million working at the minimum wage. Why are we complaining about that? 
   The Republican proposal is a Thanksgiving turkey with three right wings. It has a watered-down increase in the minimum wage, it has a poison pill for overtime work, and it has juicy tax provisions for the rich. This Republican turkey is stuffed with tax breaks, and it does not deserve to be passed. Vote for the real increase in the minimum wage; vote for the Daschle increase.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I add my support for the amendment that has been offered by the Senator from  Connecticut, Mr. DODD, to address the explosion of credit card debt because students on college campuses are offered credit cards. The amendment, as has been outlined, prohibits credit card companies from giving an individual under the age of 21 a credit card unless the young person has income sufficient to repay the debt or a parent or a guardian, or other family member over the age of 21, to share the liability for the credit card. 
   The point has been made, but I think it needs to be underlined, that when you get right behind this whole issue, what is happening is that the credit card companies are making these credit cards so available to young people who are attending college that the credit cards are effectively irresistible. The amount of debt that is being run up by these students is escalating into significant figures. What inevitably happens is that the parents are required, by one reason or another, to assume the debt obligation. That is the background, really, on why these efforts are being made by the credit card companies. 
   What isn't so evident is the kind of turmoil, anxiety, and depression that surrounds this whole atmosphere of student debt. What we found, in the course of the hearings on the Judiciary Committee, in a number of the different presentations that were made while considering the bankruptcy legislation, is that it 
   isn't only the financial obligations that were assumed, but that many of the young people, who had stellar academic records, who were outstanding students in all forms of behavior, who were actually seduced by these credit card obligations and responsibilities, when they found they were unable to free themselves from these kinds of obligations, went into severe depression and into adverse behavior, where the students had tensions in their relationships with their parents, assuming an entirely different chapter in their development. And this is something that is happening with increasing frequency across this country. 
   The kind of recommendations that the Senator from Connecticut has outlined in the amendment is a very modest and reasonable way of addressing the excesses of this particular phenomenon taking place. This is the place to be able to do it. 
   I welcome the chance to join with Senator DODD in urging that this particular amendment be adopted. It makes a great deal of sense in terms of the young students in this country. It makes a great deal of sense in terms of their parents, most of whom are hard working, decent parents who get caught up in these obligations, assuming the debts of their children. It puts an extraordinary burden on them as well. 
   This is a winner for the students and for their parents and for more sensible and responsible bankruptcy legislation. 
   I reserve the remainder of the time. 
   Mr. DURBIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator DODD and I have proposed an amendment to address the explosion of credit card debt offered to students on college campuses. 
   The amendment prohibits a credit card company from giving an individual under the age of 21 a credit card unless the young person has income  sufficient to repay the debt or a parent, guardian, or other family member over the age of 21 shares liability for the credit card. Credit card applications and solicitations must disclose this information to potential consumers. 
   This amendment is particularly appropriate during debate on bankruptcy reform legislation. We know that credit card debt may not be the sole factor leading to bankruptcy, but for many individuals it is a significant contributing factor. 
   Congress should be particularly concerned that since 1991, there has been a 50-percent increase in bankruptcy filings by those under the age of 25. In many cases, these are young men and women who are just establishing their independence--and just starting to build a credit history. Poor financial decisions, especially credit card mismanagement can have long-term implications. 
   We know the siren song of the credit card industry is loud and clear. In 1998, credit card issuers sent out 3.45 billion credit card solicitations to people of all ages, including college students and others who may not have the ability to repay their debts. In fact, First USA recently issued a credit card to 3-year old Alessandra Scalise. Alessandra's mother said she accurately completed and mailed in the preapproved credit card application as a joke. There was no Social Security number or income listed and Alessandra's occupation was listed as ``preschooler.'' Apparently, this didn't make a difference to First USA. Alessandra received a Platinum Visa with a $5,000 credit limit. 
   This incident may be attributable to ``human error'' but there are numerous examples of irresponsible lending practices by credit card issuers--especially when they lend to students who don't have the capacity to repay their debts. 
   For example, one Discover platinum card issuer's terms of qualification require a minimum household income of $15,000 unless you are a full-time student. Discover explains that an individual either has to have a $15,000 minimum income or needs to prove that they are a full-time student. Student applications are rejected only if they have a bad credit history--a prior bankruptcy filing, for example--or if their student status can not be confirmed. 
   During a February 1998 Banking Subcommittee hearing, Senator SARBANES asked credit card issuers how they determined student income. Bruce Hammonds, senior vice chairman and chief operating officer of MBNA Corporation responded if a student has a loan, ``that means they do not have to pay tuition in most cases and we are looking at that tuition payment. Then we would not count the tuition payment against them with their income and expense analysis.'' In other words, the company ignores the reality of tuition and views a student loan as ``free'' money--an income stream that can be used to repay credit care debt. 
   Not surprisingly, credit card companies have unleashed a well-organized and pervasive campaign to attract student consumers. Credit is available to almost any college student--no income, no credit history, and no parental signature required. The National Bankruptcy Review Commission received an advertisement for a 2-day workshop for creditors entitled, ``Competing in the Sub Prime Credit Card Market,'' including a presentation entitled, ``Targeting College Students: Real Life 101,'' with tips on how to ``target the money makers of tomorrow.'' 
   Students are targeted by the industry the moment they step on to a college campus. Applications are placed in their book bags at the student store, and tempting gifts and bonuses and low teaser rates are used to entice them to send in the application. The American Express Card for College Students has a teaser rate of 7.75 percent for the first 90 days, then it more than doubles to 15.65 percent. Perks include Continental Airlines travel 
   vouchers. The Citibank College Card for Students initial rate is 8.9 percent for 9 months and then it skyrockets to 17.15 percent. The incentive? Eight American Airlines travel coupons. 
   Brian is a student at the University of Minnesota. He said,  
   They gave me a free T-shirt and a water bottle to apply for their credit cards. My clever plan? To sucker them out of their prizes and cut up the cards. $4,000 later ..... I stopped spending ..... In my glory days, I was like King Midas, pointing to things and turning them into my own ..... For me, the worst temptation was food ..... While listening to tunes on your new stereo and munching take out food, the monthly payment seems easy to pay, especially when you can get a cash advance to cover it.  
   The ads are tempting, too. One ad directly targeting students reads: ``Free from parental rule at last. Now all you need is money. Cha-Ching! Get 3 percent cash back on everything you buy.'' 
   The Internet is the new frontier for credit card advertising to students. When a student clicks on ``www.studentcreditcard.com'' he or she finds a treasure trove of shopping offers and discounts, as well as the assurance of 3 percent cash back. Students are told that, ``It's totally simple. Spend $200 on an item with your card and you have an extra six bucks in your pocket. Spend another $400, that's $12. It adds up fast when you use The Associates Student Credit Card for all your purchases.'' 
   The web site includes some information on establishing a good credit record, but nothing compared to the bonuses and incentives for student consumers. 
   Not surprisingly, college students respond to solicitation by credit card companies. A recent study by Nellie Mae found that 60 percent of undergraduates have credit cards and 21 percent have 4 or more cards. The median credit card debt among students is $1,200 and 9 percent of students have debt between $3,000 and $7,000. Five percent of students have credit card debt exceeding $7,000. 
   Other studies replicate similar findings. A June 1998 national survey by the Education Resources Institute--``Credit Risk or Credit Worthy''--found that 55 percent of students obtained their first card during their first year of college and a significant proportion received their first credit card while still in high school. 
   The study argues that many students use credit cards reasonably, but the facts and statistics are disturbing. Fifty-two percent of students say that one of the most important reasons to have a credit card is to ``build a credit history'' and 45 percent say it's to use in an emergency, but the survey shows that 77 percent of all student credit card purchases were for ``routine personal expenses''--a category that may include a wide-range of items. 
   While attending Villanova, Meghan charged $15,000 on her credit cards. When she and her friends first applied for the cards they decided to keep them for emergencies, only. But, according to Meghan, they would ``end up buying things ..... or taking cash advances just to live on.'' Meghan planned to get a job to pay off her debt, but that didn't happen. Instead, her mother paid-off the balance on the card--twice. 
   What's particularly troubling is that many students who use their credit cards when they ``run out of checks'' or are ``on Spring Break'' don't realize the financial implications of credit. In a September 1999 article, Joan Bodnar, senior editor of Kiplinger's Personal Finance Magazine wrote, ``Kids tend to equate credit cards with free money--in a recent survey of college students, fewer than half of those interviewed knew the interest rate on their cards.'' 
   Similarly, a 1993 American Express/Consumer Federation of America study of college students revealed that college juniors and seniors only have a ``fair'' understanding of financial services products, and few appear to understand an annual percentage rate. A similar study of high school seniors reveals that they have a ``poor'' understanding of such products. 
   The result? College students with no income and good intentions often find themselves in debt with no way out. For example, of the 20 percent of students who report an average balance greater than $1,000, half of those students have four or more credit 
   cards and only 18 percent pay off their outstanding balances every month. In addition, 48 percent of these students have other debt and nearly one-third have charged tuition and fees. 
   The economic and emotional consequences of credit card debt can be devastating--even deadly--for many students. Tricia Johnson received a desperate call from her daughter, Mitzi, a student in her first year at the University of Central Oklahoma. Mitzi had lost her part-time job and was  afraid she could not pay her debts. Mrs. Johnson tried to comfort her distraught daughter. But, later that night, Mitzi committed suicide. She had accumulated $2,500 in credit card debt, but her weekly income rarely exceeded $65. When the police found Mitzi, credit cards were spread across her bed. 
   Janie O'Donnell--the mother of Sean Moyer, a National Merit Scholar attending the University of Oklahoma--had the same devastating experience. In 1998, Sean told his mother he had no idea how to get out of his financial mess, and he did not see much of a future for himself. Sean had moved home to save money and pay off the $10,000 he owed Visa and Master Card. A week later, he committed suicide. 
   A study by the University of Minnesota in 1996, suggests that credit card debt by students often goes hand in hand with stress and depression. Two-thirds of students who said they were taking medication for depression had more than $1,000 in credit card debt. The study also found that as credit card debt increased, the student's grade point average went down. In 1998, a University of Indiana administrator said, ``we lose more students to credit card debt than to academic failure.'' 
   Tennessee legislators were disturbed by a study that revealed a large number of Tennessee bankruptcy filers to be surprisingly young, and they are taking action. Several bills were introduced, and the state Senate passed legislation that gives students an opportunity to remove their name from solicitation lists. 
   It's time for Congress to take action as well. The purpose of the amendment before the Senate is to ensure responsible lending by credit card companies to students. In fact some credit card issuers are adhering to self-imposed restrictions that are more narrow than the Dodd/Kennedy amendment. For example, Dorinda Simpson, CEO of American Partners Federal Credit Union testified that when issuing student credit cards, they set a $500 credit limit and require a co-signor ``so parents know up front what we are loaning to that college student.'' 
   This amendment doesn't go that far. It requires credit card companies to either establish that a student has the income to repay the debt or have a co-signor. 
   The requirements aren't overly burdensome. They won't disadvantage 20-year-olds in the military--they have an income. They won't disadvantage a student with deceased parents--another person may co-sign or the student may have income. They won't disadvantage a 19 year-old, non-college student who is between jobs--that person may have unemployment compensation or another form of income. 
   And, finally, this amendment is not a form of lending discrimination. When similarly situated individuals aren't treated equally, that's discrimination. When underwriting standards are based on perception instead of facts, that's discrimination. But, requiring credit card issuers to stop preying on college students they know don't have a means to repay debt--that is ensuring responsible behavior. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for over 100 years, Congress has supported a bankruptcy system that balances the needs of debtors in desperate financial straits and creditors who deserve repayment. Today, however, the tide is changing. Too often the complexity of the problems facing debtors is ignored. Critics, using the unfair rhetoric supplied by the credit industry, call bankruptcy an undeserved refuge for those who can't or won't manage their finances. Honest, hard-working, middle class families are unfairly characterized as dead-beats who abuse the bankruptcy system to avoid paying their debts. The result is the excessively harsh bankruptcy reform bill presented to the Senate. 
   During this debate, every Senator must ask one essential question--who are the winners and who are the losers if this bill becomes law. A fair analysis of the bill will lead members of the Senate to the same conclusion reached by House Judiciary Committee Chairman HENRY HYDE, who counted dozens of provisions that favor creditors. But, decency and dignity need not be victims of reform. Balanced bankruptcy legislation is our goal. Though we must address the needs of creditors, we must also consider the specific circumstances and market forces that push middle class Americans into bankruptcy. 
   Let's take the basic facts one by one. 
   Fact No. 1: The rising economic tide has not lifted all boats. Despite low unemployment, a booming stock market, and budget surpluses, Wall Street cheers when companies--eager to improve profits by down-sizing--lay off workers in large numbers. In 1998, layoffs were reported around the country in almost every industry--9,000 jobs were lost after the Exxon-Mobil merger; 5,500 jobs were lost after Deutsche Bank acquired Bankers Trust; Boeing laid off 9,000 workers; Johnson & Johnson laid off 4,100. Kodak has cut 30,000 jobs since the 1980s and 6,300 since 1997. 
   Often, when workers lose a good job, they are unable to recover. In a study of displaced workers in the early 1990s, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that only about one-quarter of these workers were working at full-time jobs paying as much as or more than they had earned at the job they lost. Too often, laid-off workers are forced to accept part-time jobs, temporary jobs, and jobs with fewer benefits or no benefits at all. 
   Fact No. 2: Divorce rates have soared over the past 40 years. For better or for worse, more couples are separating, and the financial consequences are particularly devastating for women. Divorced women are four times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. In 1999, 540,000 women who head their own households will file for bankruptcy to try to stabilize their economic lives. 200,000 of them will also be creditors trying to collect child support or alimony. The rest will be debtors struggling to make ends meet. 
   Fact No. 3: Over 43 million Americans have no health insurance, and many millions more are underinsured. Each year, millions of families spend more than 20 percent of their income on medical care, and older Americans are hit particularly hard. A June 1998 CRS Report states that even though Medicare provides near-universal health coverage for older Americans, half of this age group spend 14 percent or more of their after-tax income on health costs, including insurance premiums, co-payments and prescription drugs. 
   Fact No. 4: The credit card industry has engaged in a massive and unseemly nation-wide campaign to hook unsuspecting citizens on credit card debt. Credit card issuers logged 24 million telemarketing hours in 1996 and sent out 3.45 billion--billion--credit card solicitations in 1998. In an average month, 75 percent of all households in the country receive a credit card solicitation. In recent years, the credit card industry has also begun to offer new lines of credit targeted at people with low incomes--people they know can not afford to pile up credit card debt.  
   Facts such as these have reduced the economic stability of millions of American families, and have led to the sharp increase in the number of bankruptcy filings. Two out of every three bankruptcy filers have an employment problem. One out of every five bankruptcy filers has a health-care problem. Divorced or separated people are three times more likely than married couples to file for bankruptcy. Working men and women in economic free fall often have no choice except bankruptcy. 
   The bankruptcy system provides a second chance for these large numbers of Americans who would otherwise hit financial bottom. It offers an indispensable opportunity to stabilize their households after an economic crisis. 
   Clearly, we must deal with those who take advantage of the system and abuse it. Reform is necessary to stop repeat filers, eliminate the loophole provided by the homestead exemptions in several states, and prevent wealthy Americans from abusing the system to avoid paying their debts. But the credit card industry is abusing the system, too. Congress needs to deal with their abuses realistically and fairly, in a way that protects millions of struggling middle class and low-income families. It would be irresponsible for Congress to act only in ways that reward the credit card industry for its cynical manipulation of these families. 
   The drop in filings this year is ample indication that a harsh bankruptcy bill is not needed. Without any action by Congress, the number of bankruptcy filings is decreasing. It is estimated that there will be 100,000 fewer filings this year than in 1998--filings have dropped in 42 states. Leading economists believe that the bankruptcy crisis is self-correcting. As economics professor Lawrence Ausubel states,  
   Lenders respond to an unexpected increase in personal bankruptcies by curtailing new lending to consumers teetering closest to bankruptcy, with or without new legislation. The high rates of default at the peak of the bankruptcy crisis began to impinge on the profitability of lending and--as a result--lenders tightened their underwriting standards. This is the non-legislative, free-market response which made the crisis abate.  
   Despite these facts, the Senate is pursuing legislation that is a taxpayer-funded administrative nightmare for struggling debtors. 
   Mr. President, I will include in the RECORD a list of the States that have seen a significant--and some not so significant--drop in the bankruptcy filings, comparing the second quarter of 1999 to the second quarter of 1998. It dropped more than 62 percent in the State of Oklahoma. It was down 1.19 percent in Arizona. Eight States have had some increase. It was two-tenths of 1 percent in Indiana, three-tenths of 1 percent in Utah, six-tenths of 1 percent in Wyoming. It was up nine-tenths of 1 percent in Montana, 3.3 percent in Oregon, 6 percent in South Dakota, 12 percent in Alaska, and 144 percent in Delaware.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this list represents virtually all of the children's protection groups--those groups that have been most identified with protecting women's economic and political rights, those groups that have been looking after workers' interests, and small business groups as well. Virtually every one of them are opposed to the underlying legislation. 
   As I mentioned in the Senate Judiciary Committee, I would like to hear those who are in favor of it point out one single group representing children, workers, women, or consumers who are for this bill. Just bring those names to us. Let's debate it. But we have none, zero. 
   It comes back to what we ought to be asking ourselves when we have this kind of a situation. Isn't it worthwhile that we find out who the winners are and who the losers are? If common sense is any indication, we will try to make a case that in justifies these comments. Virtually every one of the groups representing hard-working Americans--the men and women who work hard and play by the rules; and, in many instances, women who have been discriminated against for a wide variety of reasons and issues; children's groups who understand the importance of making sure that children's interests and their financial security will be protected--are universally opposed and say ``no'' to the bill. But we have others. The credit card companies say yes. 
   So it is interesting, as we are coming into the final hours of this session, we have another one of those situations where the Republican leadership is putting out on the floor of the U.S. Senate a bill the special interests--in this case, the credit card companies--are strongly in favor of, but threatens the economic interests of women and working people and children. 
   We have little time this afternoon to debate a minimum wage, which we have been virtually prohibited from doing before the Senate over the period of the last year. We are not even going to have an opportunity to debate something that could protect consumers, women, children, and workers on a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is being put off. But we have time to debate this issue. Why? Because the credit card companies have a very important and direct interest in the outcome of this particular legislation. 
   Mr. President, I want to take a few moments of the Senate's time to run through some of these charts that show, I think, very effectively, what this case is all about.  
   This chart shows that the U.S. median family income is $42,769 this year. Now these are constant dollars. If we look over at what the income was for those who went into bankruptcy, in 1981, 1991, 1995, and 1997, you find out there has been a gradual decline--$23,000, $18,000, $17,000, and in 1997 it was somewhat below what it was in 1995. 
   We have the greatest economic boom in the history of this country, with the lowest unemployment and rates of inflation. We saw an increase in the numbers of bankruptcies. But who are these people who are filing for bankruptcy? It is actually those in the lower incomes. That is who we are affecting with legislation that is dealing with bankruptcy. Who are these people down here in 1997? Let's look back in 1981. The red indicates joint filings. The yellow indicates men filing. The blue is for women filing. 
   Going back to 1981, we find the greatest number of filings 
   for bankruptcy were joint filings, with some single men and some single women. Look what happens in 1991. Joint still goes up, and there are increasing numbers of women and of men. In 1999, those at the top are women. They are at the bottom in 1981 and at the top in 1999. Do you see the very dramatic increase in the number of women. Why is that so? 
   The reason that is so is women are being denied alimony and child support. That is why it is so. That is why it is so, Mr. President. Every indicator demonstrates that is why it is so. We are passing a major piece of legislation to protect not those who are being adversely impacted by these economic forces, but to protect the credit card industry. It is women who are facing challenges because of alimony and in terms of child support. 
   If you wanted to do something about this line here, you would do more to make sure the deadbeat dads are going to pay up as they should in terms of alimony and child support. You would see this number go down dramatically. Nonetheless, no, no, we are not going to deal with that issue. We have this other kind of formula that is going to hurt these people--not protect them so they might have a second opportunity. The fact is, the number of people who are working who go into bankruptcy is virtually identical to those who are working generally anyway. 
   Isn't that interesting? The fact is, these are not men and women who are dogging it, these are men and women who are out trying to make it. Nonetheless, are we considering a piece of legislation that is going to help them get back on their feet a second time and perhaps pay off their debt? No, no; we are thinking about the credit card companies and looking out after their interests. 
   So we see that the great expansion and explosion in the number of people who are going into bankruptcy are primarily women. Now it is interesting that bankrupt debtors are reporting job problems. Sixty-seven percent of those who are going into bankruptcy are reporting job problems, a direct result of downsizing, direct result of merging, the direct result of being able to go down to Wall Street and cut back in the total number of employees and see a bang in that stock going right up. Extraordinary economic growth and expansion--all of which are very fine and good--doesn't mean that you have to come down with a hammer on workers who, through no fault of their own, are being merged out and are having difficulty in finding jobs to try to meet their responsibilities, especially women. 
   This indicates what has been happening with regard to people who have been going into bankruptcy. More than 67 percent of them are showing that it is basically and fundamentally an issue in terms of their employment. These other colors indicate what those particular matters might be in terms of downsizing and the rest. We have some idea now. 
   We have the numbers I mentioned earlier. We have the growth in the number of men and women who are separated, become divorced, and the economic implications and burdens women are faced with in terms of credit. We find that. 
   Now let's look to see if there are other indicators. Yes, there is another very important indicator. That is the fact that we are seeing the total number of uninsured in our society growing at a rate of over a million a year. Make no mistake about it, that is going to increase and escalate. We are not doing anything about it. That is going to increase and escalate. 
   Isn't it interesting that health care-related problems driving individuals into bankruptcy are the No. 1 reason besides job related reasons. Individuals being dropped from the health care system are individuals at the lower end of the economic ladder who don't have the protections and don't have the health insurance in the first place. 
   We all know what is happening out in the job market with the increasing number of temps. So you do not have pensions and you do not have health insurance. Here we have the individuals who are losing out and falling further behind--women on credit, women on alimony, and women with challenges they have in terms of payments. Then you have the problems with downsizing. 
   Now we have one of the other major issues reflected in the bankruptcies that are taking place all across this country. 
   We know what is happening across the country in terms of many of the major companies and corporations that had good health care protection for retirees. Those numbers are going down in terms of coverage. We know the costs and what is happening in terms of prescription drugs. They are going up and escalating dramatically. 
   When we passed Medicare in 1964, the private sector didn't have prescription drugs, so Medicare didn't have it. Now 90 percent of those policies have it, but we can't even get that issue up before the Senate to debate it. We haven't got the chance to debate whether we ought to have prescription drugs. We don't get a chance to debate whether we ought to try to accept the House bill that provides protection for consumers from the arbitrary rulings of accountants in health maintenance organizations. No, we can't deal with any of that. Let's just look out after the credit card industry. They are the ones who need protection--not the men and women who have lost their health care. No, sir; we don't have to worry about them--not the men and women who have been downsized. No, sir; we don't have to worry about them; and not women. Alimony and child care support--let's not worry about them. Let's worry about the good old credit card industry.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, here is the letter that is being sent by the ``American Bankruptcy Service,'' ``Re: Fresh Start VISA distributorship'':  
   Dear counselor:  
   Do you know who the counselors are? Do you know who those counselors are? They are counselors for the people who have gone bankrupt--the lawyers for people who have gone bankrupt. Here is their friendly ``American Bankruptcy Service.''  
   We offer a unique opportunity that could be of great benefit to your firm and your clients. By becoming a distributor, you will have the ability to market unsecured VISA credit cards. We call it the ``Fresh Start'' card to your clients who: 
   Have filed a chapter 7 bankruptcy; 
   Have completed the 341 meetings of creditors; 
   Have not yet received their discharge; 
   Have attached a copy of their bankruptcy notice. 
   No deposit required.  
   This industry is out soliciting from attorneys who have represented women and workers who have been downsized, those who have gone bankrupt and belly up because of health care bills they just can't afford to pay. 
   Now you have the credit card industry writing to the attorneys and saying: Look, you can get in on the goody trail, too, because if you represented one, you probably represented others, and you can get on and be part of our credit card distributorship as well. 
   That is what they are saying here. You can read this letter right through.  
   Our firm is interested in distributing the Fresh Start VISA.  
   And we will just show you how to do it. You can also be a part of this. 
   Here is their advertising. 
   If you have filed for bankruptcy, you can get a Fresh Start with First Consumers National Bank VISA card today. If you file bankruptcy, that qualifies you. There is no need to wait for a bankruptcy discharge. Rebuild a good credit card fast with monthly accounts reporting to all major credit card business. 
   They have got you once. They want to get you again, and again, and again. How many times do they want to get these people? How many times? 
   We are out here debating this bill in the final couple of days. We are not debating a patients' bill of rights. We had a heck of a time trying to get a debate on minimum wage for the whole session--trying to make a difference for consumers. We haven't got time to do prescription drugs--no way, too difficult, too complex. But we have all the time in the world to debate this particular legislation that is looking out after the credit card companies. 
   That gives you some idea about what the Republican leadership's priorities are here in the Senate. 
   We will have a chance later on to talk about the minimum wage. We have gone ahead and voted ourselves a $4,600 pay increase this year and we still won't vote a pay increase of 50 cents next year for men and women who are at the bottom rung of the economic ladder. 
   What is this, Mr. President? We have to ask ourselves, Why? 
   I can tell you, Mr. President. These issues ought to be addressed. A number of our colleagues have offered amendments to try to address some of these issues. It is going to take a lot of doing to try to make the difference. We are talking about real people. 
   Take for example, Mr. and Mrs. M who live in the suburban community of East Longmeadow, Massachusetts. Although Mr. M. makes about $60,000 per year, the family suffered when Mrs. M lost her job, and the household income dropped by $15,000. Since then, the family has struggled to make ends meet. The $14,775 loan for their 1996 Toyota and the $1,520 monthly mortgage payment that once seemed reasonable became difficult to meet. 
   Even after cutting recreation expenses to zero, the family's expenses exceed their income by several hundred dollars a month. They fell behind on their credit card payments, which they had hoped to resume paying when Mrs. M started working again. The balance they owed to their credit card company ballooned to $27,500. The balance increased by $600 to $800 each month in finance charges and penalties. Mr. and Mrs. M saw no alternative to filing for relief under the bankruptcy laws. Their discharge in bankruptcy gave them a fresh start. They will continue to struggle to make ends meet, but they have relief from the pressures of harassing calls from collection agents and mounting debts they had no hope of paying. 
   If this bill--S. 625--had been law, they would have had no such relief. The means test--which uses IRS expense standards to calculate living expenses and ability to repay debts--would probably force them out of the bankruptcy system, completely. 
   Longmeadow is in Hampden County, where the IRS housing and utility allowance for a family of four is $1,235 a month. Although the family's mortgage and monthly utility expenses exceed this amount, it would not matter. Under this bill, they would face a statutory presumption that their case is abusive. The arbitrary means test--not the reality of their plight--dictates that Mr. and Mrs. M can afford to file a Chapter 13 debt repayment plan, and it is highly unlikely that the family has any ``special circumstances'' that would allow a judge to find differently. 
   They will be selling their home, possibly all their assets. 
   This is unduly harsh. It should not pass in its current form. I will work with a number of our colleagues to address many of these serious abuses, without which it should not become law. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the economic free fall that often leads to bankruptcy. Many of us have sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999 to begin to right that wrong. 
   Amending the bankruptcy bill to increase the minimum wage will help many of the people this so-called bankruptcy ``reform'' is likely to hurt--low income families, minorities and women. For many low income workers, the struggle to make ends meet is too difficult, and they find themselves facing bankruptcy. Raising the minimum wage will help many of these hardworking individuals and families recover from the financial crises that drove them into bankruptcy. 
   For nearly two-thirds of the families that file for bankruptcy, a job crisis led to their downfall. Many of those families faced a job loss. A Bureau of Labor Statistics study reported that only about a quarter of displaced workers had found a new job at the same or better pay as the job they lost. A third of displaced workers were still looking for work. Nearly half of the displaced workers had to settle for work at much lower salaries--an average 20% pay cut for those lucky enough to find full time jobs, and a much steeper cut for those who took part-time work. 
   Large numbers of women who will suffer under this bill will benefit from a minimum wage increase. Divorced women are four times more likely to file for bankruptcy than married women or single men. Often, they are forced into bankruptcy because they are owed child support or alimony. Divorced women trying to raise children face a daunting challenge to provide for their families. This bill will make it harder to meet that challenge. But raising the minimum wage will help almost seven million women, many of them struggling to maintain their families. 
   African American and Hispanic families disproportionately face the threat of bankruptcy and the repercussions of a low minimum wage. They are six times more likely than other Americans to seek bankruptcy protection, and they will be disproportionately harmed by this bankruptcy bill. But they also comprise one-third of those who will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. This amendment will help more African American and Hispanic families meet their families' needs. 
   Low income families struggling to meet their obligations often find themselves facing bankruptcy. Some argue that the rise in bankruptcy filings is due to a lack of responsibility. But too often the problem is a matter of basic household economics. Families going into bankruptcy have less income than most Americans. A raise in the minimum wage will give them the economic boost they need to avoid bankruptcy. 
   Our proposal will give these low income wage earners the pay raise they need and deserve to care more effectively for their families--to buy the food and clothing, and health care they need, without going into debt. 
   Recently, members of Congress voted to raise their own pay by $4,600--but not the pay of minimum wage workers. Republican Senators don't blink about giving themselves an increase. How can they possibly deny a fair increase for minimum wage workers? 
   In fact, the Republican leadership has gone to extraordinary lengths to block action by Congress on a pay raise for the hard-working Americans who work at the minimum wage. 
   But it is time--long past time--to raise the minimum wage. Too many hard-working Americans struggling to keep their families afloat and their dignity intact can't make enough in a 40 hour week to lift their families out of poverty--and that's wrong. The percentage of poor who are full-time year-round workers was 12.6% in 1998--higher than any time in the last 20 years, according to a new report from the Census Bureau. 
   Our minimum wage amendment is a modest proposal-- a one dollar increase in two installments--50 cents next January, and 50 cents the following year. Over 11 million American workers will benefit. 
   At $6.15 an hour, working full-time, a minimum wage worker would earn $12,800 a year under this amendment--an increase of over $2,000 a year. 
   That additional $2,000 will pay for seven months of groceries to feed the average family. It will pay the rent for five months. It will pay for almost ten months of utilities. It will cover a year and a half of tuition and fees at a two-year college, and provide greater opportunities for those struggling at the minimum wage to obtain the skills needed to obtain better jobs. 
   The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the lowest unemployment rate in three decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, our economy is strong. Enterprise  and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating unprecedented economic growth, with impressive efficiencies and significant job creation. The stock market has soared. Inflation is low, and interest rates are low. We are witnessing the strongest peace-time growth in our history. 
   The country as a whole is enjoying an unprecedented period of growth and prosperity. But for millions of Americans it is someone else's prosperity. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, a person earning the minimum wage would earn only $10,700--almost $3,200 below the poverty guidelines for a family of three. 
   Each day we fail to raise the minimum wage, families across the country continue to fall farther behind. One fact says it all--the minimum wage would have to be $7.49 an hour today, instead of the current level of $5.15, to have the same purchasing power it had in 1968. That disparity shows how far we have fallen short in the past generation in guaranteeing that low income workers receive their fair share of the nation's prosperity. 
   The Republican proposal to raise the minimum wage by one dollar over three years beginning on March 1, 2000, is a cruel hoax on the lowest paid American workers. Our Democratic plan to increase the minimum wage by 50 cents on January 1, 2000 and another 50 cents on January 1, 2001, would put almost $1,200 more than the Republican proposal into the hands of the hard-working women and men who work at the minimum wage. 
   The Republican proposal is an insult to low wage workers. In addition to robbing workers of over $1,200, it effectively repeals the overtime pay law that has guaranteed time-and-a-half overtime pay for over 60 years. The so-called ``bonus'' provision of the Republican proposal jeopardizes the overtime pay of 73 million Americans by eliminating the requirement that bonuses, commissions, and other similar forms of compensation be included in a worker's regular pay for purposes of calculating overtime pay. As the United States Supreme Court said in interpreting the Fair Labor Standards Act, exclusion of bonuses from overtime pay will ``nullify all the purposes for which the [Act] was created.'' 
   The Republican proposal is just one more part of an ongoing assault on low wage workers that includes balancing the budget on the backs of the working poor; cutting workers' pay through the compensatory time bill; providing pensions for the wealthy but not for working families; blocking workers' right to organize; and undermining worker safety and health. 
   Shame on those who want to lavish over $75 billion in tax breaks on business, while cutting this modest pay raise for low income workers. Republicans are more interested in providing tax breaks for the rich than in fairly compensating minimum wage workers. When Congress has just voted to raise its own pay, it is hypocritical and irresponsible to deny fair pay for the country's lowest paid workers. 
   As the Washington Post said last week: ``The minimum wage should be increased, and the increase should not become a political football. . . . The price of a bill to help the working poor ought not be an indiscriminate tax cut for those at the very top of the economic mountain.'' 
   Our legislation does contain a fiscally responsible package of small business tax provisions which would cost approximately $11.5 billion over the next five years. Those provisions have been designed to provide financial assistance to the small businesses which will be paying the higher minimum wage to their employees. The cost of these tax benefits is fully paid for. 
   Unlike the Republican proposals, this bill will not draw down the surplus. It will not jeopardize our ability to use the surplus to strengthen Medicare and Social Security for the future. Our tax proposal contains provisions which will benefit both employers and employees. It provides a tax credit for worksite child care facilities, a tax credit to encourage small businesses to offer employee pensions, and a tax credit for companies that provide high tech training to their employees. 
   It also encourages the creation of new jobs for those who are currently outside the workforce by extending the work opportunity tax credit and the welfare-to-work tax credit, and by establishing tax incentives for ``new market'' community development. 
   In addition, our package accelerates the deductibility of health insurance premiums for self-employed workers. It excludes educational benefits provided for employees' children from taxation, and it helps workers save for their retirement. 
   These are the types of tax provisions that Congress should be enacting. They are tax cuts which will benefit a broad spectrum of businesses and workers and strengthen the economy. They are not tax breaks which only further enrich an already privileged few. 
   This debate should be about the real financial needs of low income workers and small businesses. A modest increase in the minimum wage should not be held hostage to the desire for extravagant new tax breaks for those who are already the most economically privileged. It makes sense to provide fiscally responsible tax assistance to small businesses and their employees. All the tax cuts we are proposing are fully paid for and carefully targeted to meet genuine needs. It is appropriate to enact them as part of our legislation to raise the minimum wage. 
   Finally, raising the minimum wage is far more than a labor issue. Raising the minimum wage is a women's issue. Almost 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women. 7 million women across the nation--12.6% of all working women--would benefit from this increase. 
   Raising the minimum wage is a children's issue. Over two million married couples and almost a million mothers would receive a pay raise as a result of our increase. Eighty-five percent of these single mothers have total household incomes below $25,000 a year. 
   Raising the minimum wage is a civil rights issue. Over two million Hispanic workers and almost as many African American workers will receive a raise. Together, they make up one-third of those who will benefit from the increase. 
   Raising the minimum wage is a family issue. The average minimum wage worker brings home half the family earnings. Half the benefits of our one dollar increase will go to households earning less than $25,000 a year. Parents need this raise so they can provide their children with food, clothes, and a decent place to live. 
   Some of our colleagues who oppose the minimum wage still believe the dire ``sky is falling'' predictions of economic disaster that were raised before we voted to raise the minimum wage in 1996. None of those predictions came true. Since the last increase enacted by Congress, the economy has created new jobs at a rate of over 235,000 a month. Job creation in the sectors most affected by the minimum wage is up too--with almost 1.2 million new jobs in the retail sector, and 400,000 new jobs in restaurants. Employment is up--and the unemployment rate is down--among teenagers, African Americans, Hispanics, and women. 
   As Business Week magazine has stated,  
   [H]igher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, minimum wages raise income, not unemployment. ..... A higher minimum wage can be an engine for upward mobility. When employees become more valuable, employers tend to boost training and install equipment to make them more productive. Higher wages at the bottom often lead to better education for both workers and their children. ..... It is it time to set aside old assumptions about the minimum wage.  
   It is time to raise the federal minimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. I urge my colleagues to join me in raising the minimum wage.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, it has taken us a long time during this Congress to have the opportunity to present a legislative proposal to the Senate that would provide an increase in the minimum wage for America's workers who are working on the lower rung of the economic ladder: 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year. 
   We have tried to bring this before the Senate over the year in a number of different forms and shapes. We were unable to do so. Now we have the opportunity to debate it this afternoon and to vote on it tomorrow. Hopefully, we will have success in passing it. 
   It is very clear that its outcome is uncertain because of the fact that, rather than having a chance to vote on a freestanding piece of legislation that would be considered freely and then considered by the House, passed on to the Senate, this will be wrapped into other extremely controversial legislation. But we are doing the best that we can. We want to give assurances to those Americans who are working at the minimum wage that we are going to continue this battle, as we have over these past years. We are going to continue the battle next year at each and every opportunity, until we have the chance to pass meaningful minimum wage legislation. So there should be no doubt in anyone's mind that this somehow is going to conclude the debate. 
   American workers are entitled to an increase in the minimum wage. We are prepared to make their cases. I am absolutely convinced we will be successful. 
   It is unfortunate we have to try and convince our colleagues on the other side on the basis of the merits of this case, but I think it is important that we, in a preliminary way, address some of the reasons that have been raised  historically against the minimum wage. 
   First of all, let's look at where we are on the issue of the minimum wage. This chart reflects where the minimum wage has been since 1967-1968. These are real dollars. We see that if the minimum wage today was going to have the purchasing power it had in 1968, it would be $7.49, not $5.15 an hour. It would be about $2.30 higher than where it is today. What we have seen is a gradual decline of the purchasing power of the minimum wage. This is so despite the fact that we now have the greatest economic prosperity in the history of the country--more Americans employed, the greatest stock market, lowest interest rates, lowest rates of inflation, lowest unemployment, highest rate of employment in the history of the country. Nonetheless, for those individuals who are at the lower end of the economic ladder, they are slipping further and further and further behind. 
   If our amendment does not pass, the purchasing power of the minimum wage will continue to decline--to the lowest minimum wage almost in the history of the country. Every day that we delay, minimum-wage workers fall further behind. If we don't raise the minimum wage by the end of this year, it will lose all of the value of the last increase in 1996. This is where we are. 
   Now, what are we talking about in scope in terms of the minimum wage? How large an increase are we talking about? And what will be its impact in terms of our total economy? Increasing the minimum wage by a dollar is vital to workers, but it is a drop in the bucket of the national payroll. 
   If you combine their wages and salaries, all Americans earn $4.2 trillion a year. An increase of $1 in the minimum wage would amount to one-fifth of 1 percent in terms of total wages over the country. We should not even hear the argument--and I hope we won't--that this effort to raise the minimum wage is somehow going to be inflationary. We are talking about one-fifth of 1 percent of total wages for those who are working 40 hours a week 52 weeks a year. In a moment, I will come to that. More of them are working 50 hours a week, trying to play by the rules, trying to bring up a family and they are still coming up short. 
   This is what is happening. We are finding out that those who 
   are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder are working hard but still in poverty. The annual minimum wage is not even keeping up with the poverty line. We are finding more and more workers who are affected by this. 
   Then, finally, on this phase of the debate, I want to point out the employment figures. We find that we have seen, since the increase in the minimum wage that we passed in 1996 and 1997, there has still been an increase in job growth. This chart shows the increase in 1996, up to $4.75, and then to $5.15. Even with these increases we see new jobs being created and strong economic growth. 
   All of those on the other side of the aisle who made the predictions that we are going to lose 300,000 to 400,000 jobs if we pass an increase in the minimum wage were wrong. To the contrary, we have seen an expansion of job opportunities. Since the last increase was enacted by Congress, the economy has created new jobs at a rate of 235,000 a month. That addresses, I hope, the economic reasons for not having an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Let's take a moment and think about who these people are--who are the minimum-wage workers? This has to be enormously distressing to all Americans because there is no group of Americans that is working harder and slipping further behind than women in our society. Almost 60 percent of minimum wage workers are women. 7 million women across the nation--12.6 percent of all working women--would benefit from this increase. 
   And working fathers are being affected too. We know now that employed fathers with children under 18 work longer hours, averaging 50 hours a week. That is well over the average work time for those tens of millions of Americans who go to work at 40 hours a week, and they get overtime. The average for fathers with children under 18 is 50 hours a week. Fathers' total work time has increased by 3 hours in the past 20 years, and mothers' total work time has increased by 5 hours. 
   Almost one-half, 45 percent of the workers, report having to work overtime with little or no notice. One in five is asked to work overtime 4 or more days a week, with little or no notice. What does that mean to the families? Here they are working at minimum wage, they may have one job, but they probably two jobs, trying to make ends meet, already working 50 hours a week. Then they are told, without warning, they have to work overtime, which may disrupt their other employment. With the number of hours at each job, especially with the addition of overtime, we are seeing increasing numbers of mothers and fathers forced to spend more and more time away from their children. 
   According to a 1999 Council of Economic Advisors study, families are suffering. The study says that parents have, on average, experienced a decrease of 22 hours per week available to spend time with their children. That is what this minimum wage is all about--parents having less time to spend with their children. I hope we are not going to hear a lot of speeches out here about the importance of family values by those who vote against this increase. Twenty-two hours per week less--that is what is available for parents to spend time with their children. A decrease has happened and if we really care about families we need to change that. 
   Another factor, in addition to parents having less time to spend with their children, is the increasing shift work. Shift work is growing fastest in the service sector, which is heavily reliant on women workers. According to the study by Harriet Presser at the University of Maryland, 70 percent of the fastest growing occupations in the United States have a disproportionate number of female employees and require more than 40 percent of their workers to put in nonstandard hours. 
   Here we are finding out about who is being targeted. It is women. And for what? Nonstandard hours and overtime. At a crucial point in their lives when they are trying to bring up children and be there for them, we find out they are working harder, working longer, and they are making less. Two-thirds of the workers would like to work fewer hours--almost 20 percent more than 5 years ago. But most of those workers believe they can't cut back on hours because they need the money--46 percent. These 20 percent of workers, might be able to work fewer hours if the minimum wage were increased. 
   Another recent study, ``Working Hard, But Staying Poor,'' notes that working poor are predominantly hourly employees, and 71 percent have little paid vacation; 48 percent have no paid vacation at all--none, none. And 18 percent have a week or less. Madam President, 70 percent of those making the minimum wage have virtually no vacation, or less than a week of paid vacation. 
   We can't give them an increase of 50 cents an hour? No. Even though we have just voted ourselves $4,600 a year, we are not going to vote for them 50 cents more an hour next year. No. This is what is happening to these families. This is what is happening to these fathers and mothers. This is what is happening to these children. And we say, oh, we can afford $4,600 a year for Members of Congress and the Senate, but we can't do something about mothers and fathers who are increasingly taken away from their children in order to make ends meet. 
   That is what this issue is about when you come right down to it. We say: Wait a minute here. Where is productivity in all of this? In the last 10 years we have seen a 12-percent increase in productivity for workers in the United States, but only a 1.9 percent pay increase to match. That includes the highest increases by workers in the country, not the minimum wage. That is what has happened, a 1.9-percent increase. We have seen a 29-percent increase in productivity since 1973, and the minimum wage hasn't even kept up with it. What is going on here? No unemployment, no inflation, productivity going up through the roof, and we give ourselves $4,600, and Republicans oppose 50 cents more an hour 
   increase in the minimum wage. 
   And are Americans really working? There are no workers in the world--none in the world--who are working longer and harder than American  workers today. Japan works 54 hours less a year; the Canadians, 215; the British, 221; the French, 314; the Germans, 389. Every other industrial nation in the world is working less. 
   The Americans, at the lowest end, are working longer and harder trying to make ends meet, with no kinds of health insurance programs, no paid vacations, and they are being jammed with increases in overtime without notification, and they are trying to provide for their children. What happens? 
   I will tell you what happens. Today, we have the new census figures that are just out, and they are very interesting. The latest census figures show that the percentage of working poor--12.6 percent--is at its highest point in 20 years. That's right, at a time when our country is so strong economically we have the highest number of working poor in 20 years--the highest number of working poor. You can look at those figures and say, well, the median income for lower income families has gone up. OK. I am talking about those individuals who are getting the minimum wage. More of them are working in poverty than at any other time. More of them are working, and working for less, than at any other time. More of them are falling further behind than at any other time. 
   What do we have to prove? What is there to prove? I can tell you this. If you look back on the movement from welfare to work, you will find that every economist virtually agrees that one of the principal reasons for movement from welfare to work was the increase in the minimum wage. About 700,000 of those moved from welfare to work because of the minimum wage. With this additional increase of a dollar, from every estimate, from 200,000 to 300,000 more will move from welfare to work. They value work. People want to work. They did when we increased it last time and I think they'll do it again. 
   What does it mean for the taxpayer? It is beneficial to the taxpayer. Why? You will find if you pay more in the minimum wage, you have fewer people who qualify for support programs. That makes sense. Fewer will be qualified for food stamps, fuel assistance programs, and other kinds of support programs. And it will save taxpayers billions of dollars. So it is difficult for me to understand the opposition we are receiving. 
   In the Democratic proposal, we added a small program, but an important one, that primarily helps working families in the tax program in terms of pensions and some other matters. But we have, on the opposition--and I will come to this later when we will have some time to talk about our Republican friends on the other side--they say don't give them a dollar in the next 2 years; they are not worth it. They are worth a dollar over 3 years, but we are worth $4,600 more a year. We are not going to spread our pay increase out, but we are going to spread out the increase for those at the lowest end of the economic ladder. That is the Republican leadership position. 
   Now, the American people must wonder what in the world is going on when the Senate and House are trying to get together with the President on this budget, and we are talking about spending Social Security, and we have before us in the Senate a tax break for $75 billion over the next 10 years. Where are we getting all that money? I hope they have given up this argument that, ``Well, look out for the Democrats because they are going to spend Social Security.'' There is $75 billion in the Republican program that is unpaid for. 
   As I mentioned, I think the compelling reason is the fact that these are men and women who are hard-working. They are child care and health care workers who we entrust with the care of our loved ones every day. 
   They clean out the buildings of American industry and factories every single night. 
   This is a women's issue because the great majority of the minimum-wage workers are women. It is a children's issue because whether those mothers and fathers are going to make a decent wage is going to affect those children. They worry that they are not going to have warm homes in the winter and enough to eat, which we know they don't have. We know what the Second Harvest reports are about--the number of families working and not making a livable wage are going out to the food pantries all across this country. That is why the mayors--Republican and Democrat alike --support our increase. It is a women's issue, a children's issue, and a civil rights issue because many of these men and women are people of color. And most of all, it is a fairness issue. 
   How in the world does the Republican leadership go home to their communities and say we voted for a $4,600 pay increase and against your minimum wage? 
   I hope every citizen will ask their Members of the Senate when we adjourn--whenever that may be, that particular issue is still in question--why a Member's salary is more important than theirs. 
   Others desire to speak. I see my friend from Minnesota. How much time does he require?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question? 
   Is the Senator familiar with this study by the Family Work Institute? They had an interview with the children of minimum-wage workers. Here are three of the top four things children would like to change about the working parents and the concern about being with their parents. They wish their parents were less stressed out by work, less tired because of work, and could spend more time with them. 
   The kids are right. The parents have less chance to spend time with them. They are working longer. They are working harder. They have less time to spend with their children. The children are crying out for help, assistance, and for understanding. 
   This isn't going to solve all of their problems. But this minimum will put $2,000 into the family income, and it would give those parents time to spend with their children, perhaps buy a Christmas present or a birthday present, and permit them to share some additional quality time. 
   I was wondering if that kind of response from the children of minimum-wage workers surprised the Senator from Minnesota. He has spent a great deal of time traveling this country and talking to needy families.

   Mr. KENNEDY. But, I say to the Senator, as I understand it, when you offer your amendment, you will have 60 minutes and we will have 60 minutes. I think we could accommodate the other Senators. Senator FEINSTEIN is here. We have probably two other Senators. We can let them speak at that particular time. So it is just a question of working out the remaining time this evening.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator talked about the poverty line and the minimum wage. There is a third element, and that is productivity. As we pointed  out in the earlier presentation, the productivity in the last 10 years has increased by 12 percent, and the total wages of all workers, 1.9 percent. 
   The Senator, as a member of the Finance Committee, knows one of the key elements in an economic analysis is the issue of productivity. Here we have fallen so far behind, not only in the poverty rate but also in productivity growth.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I think it is probably appropriate the Senate take a moment to look at what the majority leader has stated about increasing the minimum wage. Over the course of the afternoon, we have had a number of speakers who have made a powerful case in favor of increasing the minimum wage. Yet we have against this background what the majority leader, Senator LOTT, said about our proposal:  
   It will not go to the President. I can guarantee you that.  
   So the American people ought to understand no matter how they might agree with us and are convinced of both the importance and the fairness of the issue, that is the position of the majority leader. That is part of the difficulty and the complexity we have been facing over this whole year. There has been this unalterable opposition to any break for the hardest working Americans, the ones at the lower rung of the economic ladder. Even if we are able to somehow be successful in winning this tomorrow morning, it is not going to go to the President. He is going to use every effort he possibly can to defeat this. 
   Earlier this evening, the Senator from Oklahoma, Senator NICKLES, pointed out CBO estimates of a loss of 100,000 to 500,000 jobs. Those are absolutely identical figures to what they said when we raised it in 1996 and 1997. They were found to be completely inaccurate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, perhaps tomorrow we will be able to take the time to talk about what is happening to minimum-wage workers. As I mentioned earlier today, minimum-wage workers are teachers' aides, nursing home aides. Nursing home aides have a 94-percent turnover. The principal reason for the turnover is because they are paid so poorly. They are the people working to try to provide some care and attention to the elderly. I see our good friend from Connecticut who has been a leader in establishing day care. The turnover that is taking place in the day-care centers is very similar. It is not quite as high but very dramatic. These are our children. This is our future. This is as a result of failing to provide an adequate increase in the minimum wage. 
   There are two final points I want to raise with regard to the Republican proposal. As has been mentioned earlier, the effect of the Republican proposal will mean that 3 years from now, the average minimum-wage worker will have made $1,200 less--$1,200 less--than they would have if we had passed the Daschle proposal. That is a lot of money for working Americans. That is 5 months of rent, a year of tuition, 6 months of utilities. This is important to hard-working Americans, make no mistake about it. 
   It might not mean a lot to Members of the Senate who have just voted themselves a $4,600 pay increase. We are not deferring that pay increase for Senators 2 years or 3 years. We are saying the minimum wage ought to be over a 2-year period. But our Republican friends say, no, let's spread it over 3 years. We are not doing that with regard to our pay increase. 
   I hope when Members go back and talk to their constituents, they are able to justify why we were worth $4,600 more this year while saying no to hard-working Americans--they are not worth 50 cents more next year and 50 cents more the year after. 
   Finally, I want to mention one very important aspect of the Republican proposal that has not been addressed. 
   I yield myself 2 more minutes, Mr. President. 
   With this particular chart, we illustrate what we have been facing over this past year with regard to the Republican attack on working families: Resisting a pay increase with the minimum wage; balancing the budget on the backs of the working poor. Governor Bush pointed that out. You do not have to hear it from Democrats. We have seen some retreat on that by the Republican leadership. Then providing pensions for the wealthiest individuals as they do under this proposal; blocking workers' rights to organize, the salting bill; and undermining worker safety, providing the waivers of penalties for violations of OSHA; cutting workers' pay. 
   You can say, where does that come in? Under the Republican proposal, they recalculate how overtime is going to be considered. This has not been done since 1945 when the proposal was struck down by the Supreme Court which said they basically, fundamentally undermine the Fair Labor Standards Act. If you take the Republican proposal on recomputing overtime, effectively you are undermining what many workers would be able to receive with an increase in the minimum wage. There has not been a word of that spoken by the proponents of this amendment. They tucked this right into their particular proposal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This Senator is saying there will be an overtime payment, but the overtime payment will be calculated in a way that will diminish, in a significant way, the actual overtime workers should be entitled to and the way it has been computed for the last 45 years. It is a dramatic change in the Fair Labor Standards Act. 
   The Supreme Court has said, as I said, if that provision had been accepted when it was offered in 1945, it effectively emasculates the overtime provision of the Fair Labor Standards Act. The overtime words will be there, there will be a base pay that they will pay overtime on, but not the way they are being paid now. The Republican proposal will undermine, in a significant and dramatic way, the way that hourly workers are being paid in the United States.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It is one of the reasons why we ought to have an opportunity to debate this in the light of day, not under the time limit. We are forced to take these time limits in order to at least have a vote on the minimum wage. But this issue is too important to working families to be dismissed lightly. I hope, for reasons I have outlined briefly, the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico will not be accepted. 
   The Senator from Connecticut desires time. I know the Senator from Iowa wants time. Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the current reauthorization of the Developmental Disabilities Act, and I commend Senator JEFFORDS for his leadership in making this reauthorization a priority. 
   I also commend the members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the administration for their leadership in developing this bipartisan bill. I especially want to recognize TOM HARKIN for his leadership and continued commitment to individuals with disabilities. I also commend all the staff members for their skillful work to make this process successful. 
   Today, I particularly want to take this opportunity to say thank you to my sister Eunice Kennedy Shriver for her many years of extraordinary dedication and commitment to children and adults with mental retardation and their families. Had it not been for her vision and commitment on behalf of people with mental retardation, the Developmental Disabilities Act would not be the impressive success it is today. 
   For many years, since the Developmental Disabilities Act was first signed into law by President Kennedy in 1963, developmental disabilities programs in the states have worked effectively to improve the lives of children and adults with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities. The act serves as the foundation for a network of programs that offer them real choices on where to live, work, go to school, and participate in community life. 
   Through these programs, the 4 million individuals with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities are able to obtain the support they need to participate in all aspects of the community. They receive needed assistance in education, and early intervention efforts are used to provide appropriate health care services and support. 
   For millions of Americans these services can mean the difference between dependence and independence, between lost potential and becoming contributing and participating members of their communities. 
   Throughout the preparation of this legislation, we have listened to consumers, advocates, families, and program administrators--all of whom have  contributed significantly to this legislation. Their commitment to constructive compromise will improve the lives and choices of all people with disabilities and their families. 
   This reauthorization builds on the gains of the past three decades, while addressing critical and emerging needs of individuals with disabilities. 
   It improves the accountability of the programs under the Act by emphasizing better coordination, and by concentrating on activities related to child care, health care, housing, transportation, and recreation; 
   It offers wider training opportunities by strengthening the network of university centers that provide technical assistance to persons with disabilities, to their families, and to service providers across the country; 
   It supports stronger protection and advocacy services to prevent abuse and neglect, so that people with disabilities can live safely; 
   It targets funds for the development of statewide self-advocacy organizations, so that people with disabilities will have a stronger voice in determining their lives and their future; 
   It helps states to develop support programs for families with a disabled family member, so that living at home and becoming part of the community is a real choice for persons with disabilities; and 
   It provides funds to develop a new educational curriculum and establish scholarship opportunities for support workers who assist people with developmental disabilities. 
   This bill gives us an excellent opportunity to do more to keep the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act--by ensuring that individuals with mental retardation and other significant developmental disabilities, and their families, have realistic opportunities to obtain the support and services they need to reach their dream of being contributing members of their communities. 
   Disabled people are not unable. We are a better and stronger and fairer country when we open the door of choice and opportunity to all Americans, and enable them to be full partners in the American dream. For countless persons with mental retardation and other developmental disabilities across the country, this legislation will continue to help to make that dream come true. 
   This bill deserves the support of every Member of Congress, and I look forward to its prompt enactment into law.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the past few decades, we have made extraordinary advances as a nation in science and medicine. Unfortunately, those advances are not benefitting all of our citizens equally. Minority communities suffer disproportionately from many severe health problems. 
   We know that poverty, lack of health insurance, and other barriers to care continue to undermine the health of minorities. Clearly we need to do more to give all Americans the fair chance for a healthy future that they deserve. 
   The Administration has taken important steps to address this challenge. Last year, the President announced the Initiative to Eliminate Racial and Ethnic Disparities in Health. This initiative, led by the Department of Health and Human Services, has identified several areas where new commitments, new ideas, and new resources are necessary. The goal is to eliminate disparities in the areas of cardiovascular disease, cancer screening and management, diabetes, infant mortality, HIV/AIDS, and immunizations by 2010. This ambitious goal cannot be met without a major effort to improve research on the health of minorities and develop the steps needed to reduce these disparities. 
   Today, Senators AKAKA, INOUYE, LINCOLN, WELLSTONE, and I are introducing the Health Care Fairness Act of 1999, to secure the commitment and resources needed in each of these areas to ensure that minorities have a fair chance for improved health. 
   Minority populations suffer disproportionately from cardiovascular disease. They have a greater risk of developing high blood pressure, and are less likely to receive treatment to manage the condition after it develops. As a result, African Americans are 40 percent more likely to die from coronary heart disease than whites.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Paul Kirk, who is well known to many of us as a distinguished past chairman of the Democratic Party, recently wrote an eloquent and insightful article on the state of politics in America today. Entitled ``What We Can Do For Democracy,'' Mr. Kirk's article discusses the growing political apathy of Americans, and challenges citizens to take a more active role in government. This issue goes to the heart of our democracy, and I believe that all of us who are concerned about it will be interested in Mr. Kirk's ideas. I ask that his article may be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said numerous times that increased trade has raised the standard of living and the quality of life for almost all countries involved in trade, and especially the quality of life in our own country. Chairman Greenspan believes the No. 1 benefit of trade is not simply jobs but an enhanced standard of living. I can think of no more important enhancement to the standard of living of America's hardest pressed working families than to increase the minimum wage. Surely, it is appropriate to send a message on this legislation that increased trade must definitely mean a better quality of life for the working poor. 
   I had hoped to offer an amendment to this bill to raise the minimum wage. Regrettably, it was perhaps the only vehicle that was going to be left in this year of this particular session. But the majority leader's actions prevented me from doing that. This trade bill has been offered to enhance the standard of living for workers in Africa and the Caribbean. I am certainly in favor of that. But there are honest disagreements as to whether the proposal before us effectively does so. 
   While we express our concern for the workers in these nations, we cannot forget the workers in our own country. I believe the American people will hold this Congress responsible for refusing to address so many issues which are critical to our families and our communities, and the majority, I believe, has once again turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the American people for action. I regret this latest missed opportunity. 
   I take this opportunity as we are coming into the final days of this congressional year to express what I know has to be the frustration of about 12 million Americans who had hoped this Congress would have raised the minimum wage, or at least had the opportunity to debate this issue and discuss this issue and consider this issue during this past summer, or this past fall, or even prior to the time that we were going to go into recess. But we have been denied the opportunity to do so. Every legislative possibility has been excluded from us doing so up to this time, and even excluded on this piece of legislation. 
   I join with all of those who share this enormous frustration and a certain amount of disgust at the way this issue is being treated as we are moving into these final days. 
   We now have seen some modification or adjustment to prior positions of opposition to any increase in the minimum wage which had been expressed by the Republican leadership in the House and also in the Senate. Now, evidently, there is a bidding war in the House of Representatives--hopefully, it won't take place in the Senate, but certainly in the House of Representatives--about not what we can do for the working poor but how many additional tax breaks we can add on to the minimum wage when we consider it in the House of Representatives. 
   If we extend the minimum wage over a longer period of time, for some 3 years, actually the benefits that special interests would receive by the tax considerations, which in the House position would reach $100 billion over 10 years, which isn't paid for, the only way you could assume they could be paid for would be out of Social Security because it is not paid for--and the bidding war wants to keep adding that until finally, evidently, the financial interests, which are the most opposed to any increase in the minimum wage, would finally say: All right, let's go ahead because the benefits we are going to receive so exceed and outweigh the modest increase in the increase in the minimum wage that it is worthwhile. 
   As we are coming to the end of this session, we are finding that this Senate refuses to address an issue which cries out for fairness and decency as the minimum wage slips further and further back for working families at the lower end of the economic ladder, 
   who are in many instances doing such important work as teachers aides in the classrooms of this country, are doing important work in nursing homes and looking after the elderly people, or working in the great buildings of this country at nighttime in order to clean them so the American economy and efficiency can continue during the course of the day, that we have decided in this body evidently that we are going to leave this session granting ourselves a $4,600 pay increase and denying a one dollar-an-hour pay increase for over 11 million of our fellow citizens who are working at the lower rung of the economic ladder. That is not right. That is not fair. That is wrong. 
   We ask ourselves: Why should this be the case? Certainly we have not heard those who have resisted us in bringing this matter to the floor make the economic argument that, well, this will mean an increase in the numbers of unemployed Americans. They haven't been willing to make that. They have made it at other times, and it was so totally refuted during the last increases in the minimum wage that they evidently are not prepared to come out and debate that issue. 
   The other argument, that it was going to be an inflator in terms of our general economy, has been refuted completely, as a practical matter. The last time we raised the minimum wage it was demonstrated effectively that there was virtually no increase in the cost of living. We are denied the opportunity of even hearing a well thought out argument for opposing the minimum wage. All we hear is the same, tired, old arguments that have been disproved time in and time out. 
   What we see as a result is that without the increase in the minimum wage, there is a continued deterioration in the purchasing power of the minimum-wage workers. Even without the minimum wage, if we did not consider it until even 2000 or 2001, we would be back to $4.80 an hour, close to the lowest point in the last 40 years of minimum wage, at a time of unprecedented economic prosperity for everyone except those at the lowest rung of the economic ladder. 
   We will not even debate the issue. If Members want to vote against it, they can do so, but why deny Members the opportunity to debate the issue and take the time on this particular measure? Members cannot make the argument that it will take a lot of time after what we have gone through in the past days where, effectively, from a parliamentary point of view, we were in a stalemate in the Senate without any amendments being even considered on the trade bill for a number of days. 
   We could have dealt with this issue in a matter of hours. We are certainly prepared to deal with this issue in a relatively short time period--a few hours if necessary. Obviously, the majority, the Republicans, retain their rights in terms of a very modest increase in the minimum wage, 50 cents next year and 50 cents the following year. That is too high for our Republican friends. We can debate that and at least have the Senate work its will. The position taken by the Republican leadership on the other side has been, if we are going to extend it, they will deny us the opportunity to bring the minimum wage up this year. If we bring it up at the end of the session, we will put it, effectively, well into next year and carry it on to the following year, which will extend it perhaps $1.00 over 5 years.  
   Still, we will carry on the tax goodies which, over a 10-year period in the proposal recommended by the Republican leadership, will be $100 billion in tax breaks for the special interests. That is what is happening. That is what is so unacceptable.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This article reminds everyone how the interests of some of the hardest working Americans are being toyed with by the Republican leadership. They say maybe we will add a little more in terms of tax breaks if we consider the increase in the minimum wage. 
   This increase is a matter of enormous importance and consequence for the people receiving it. Sixty percent are women; over 75 percent of minimum wage workers heading up families are women. It is an issue in terms of children. It is a family issue. It is an issue relating to men and women of color since one-third of those who receive the minimum wage are men and women of color. It is a civil rights issue, a family issue, a children's issue, a women's issue. It is a fairness issue. Yet we are denied it. 
   How quickly this institution went ahead with a $4,600-per-year increase for their pay while denying this side the opportunity to vote on 50 cents an hour over each of the next two years for the minimum-wage worker, an increase of $2,000 a year for people working at the lower end of the economic ladder. Yet, $4,600 for the Members of Congress. 
   It is wrong to play with the life and the well-being of these workers. They are being toyed with by considering how much in additional tax breaks we will provide for special interests. That is what the bidding is that is going on. It is not the Congress or leadership acting in these workers' best interest. 
   What does $2,000 mean to a minimum-wage family? The two increments, of 50 cents each, mean 7 months' of grocery. That means a lot to a family. It is 5 months of rent. It is 10 months of utilities. It is 18 months of tuition and fees at a 2-year college for a family of four living on the minimum wage. 
   While many parts of our country have experienced the economic boom, we have found another very important area of need for minimum-wage workers: Housing. In so many areas of this country, the housing costs have gone off the chart and are virtually out of the reach of the minimum-wage workers. The hours a minimum-wage worker would have to work in Boston for a one-room apartment--100 a week. It is absolutely impossible to understand why we are not dealing with this issue. 
   This chart/table shows what happened when we had the increase in the minimum wage in 1996 and 1997. The unemployment rates continued to go down. This is true in the industry that has expressed the greatest reservation about a minimum-wage increase, the restaurant industry. They have increased their total workers by 400,000 over the period since the last increase in the minimum wage. They are out here day in and day out trying to undermine and lobby against the increase in the minimum wage. 
   This is not just an issue in which Democrats are interested, although we are interested in and we are committed to it. I daresay if we had a vote on an increase in the minimum wage, the way we have identified it, we would get virtually every member of our party and perhaps a few courageous Republicans as well. 
   This is what Business Week says about the increase in the minimum wage:  
   Old myths die hard. Old economic theories die even harder ..... higher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.  
   This is from Business Week--not a labor organization, although they would agree--from Business Week, which understands it. They have probably reviewed carefully what happened in the State of Oregon that now has the highest minimum wage with the largest growth rate in terms of reduction of unemployment when they introduced the minimum wage. Why? Because people not working went into the labor market, it created more economic activity, and they paid more in taxes. The whole economy moved along together. We are glad to debate it if people want to dispute that. 
   What does this mean in people's lives? 
   Melissa Albis lives in North Adams, MA. She works for the local Burger King for $5.25 an hour. She has five children all under 12. She is struggling to pay her $550-a-month rent and is looking for less expensive housing because she fears she and her children will be evicted if she cannot earn more. 
   Cathi Zeman, 52 years old, works at the Rite Aid in Canonsburg, PA, a town near Pittsburgh. She earns $5.68 an hour: Base pay of $5.43, plus .25 for being a ``key carrier.'' Her husband has a heart condition and is only able to work sporadically, so she is the primary earner in her family. An increase in minimum wage means a lot to Cathi. 
   Shirley Briggs is a senior citizen living near Williamstown, MA. Her husband passed away in 1982, and even though she has arthritis, she works for $5.50 an hour to try to make ends meet. Even with supplement income and Social Security, she has trouble paying for medicine. ``My income is not enough to live.'' Minimum wage means a lot to Shirley. 
   Dianne Mitchell testified in June 1998 that she made $5.90 an hour at a laundry in Brockton, MA. For Dianne, with three daughters and a granddaughter, living on minimum wage is nervewracking. She is ``always juggling food and utilities,'' even having to choose one over the other. An increase in the minimum wage would give women like Dianne peace of mind--they could provide for their families. 
   Cordelia Bradley testified at a Senate forum last year she was working at a clothing chain store outside of Philadelphia. She and her son lived in a rented room for $300 a month. She hoped to have her own apartment, but at the current minimum wage that goal was out of reach. 
   Kimberly Frazier, also from Philadelphia, testified she was a full-time child care aide earning $5.20. A child care aide, how many times are we going to hear long speeches about children and looking out for children; children are our future; we need to do more caring for children. Kimberly Frazier is earning $5.20 an hour as a full-time child care aide. With three children, her pay barely covers the bills for rent, food, utilities, and clothes for her children. For Kimberly and her family, a pay increase of $1 an hour could make a real difference. 
   This is enormously important to individuals. Republicans want to see how little they can do for the workers, and how much, evidently, they can do for the corporations and special interests. You cannot look at the conduct of leadership in these last 4 weeks and not  understand that is what is happening. The workers are being nickled and dimed. This is absolutely unacceptable. 
   We are going to continue. The days are going down, the hours are going down, but we are resolute in our determination, and we are not going to have a bidding war out here on the floor of the Senate on this issue. We are not going to permit the toying with the lives of American workers who are playing by the rules, working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, who want to provide for their children. They should not have to live in poverty in the United States of America. By denying us the opportunity to do something about this, the leadership, Republican leadership, is denying us a chance to deal with that issue, and it is fundamentally and basically wrong. 
   I will speak just briefly on another matter. 
   In passing the Norwood-Dingell bill, a large bipartisan majority in the House voted for strong patient protections against abuses by HMOs. Despite an extraordinary lobbying and disinformation campaign by the health insurance industry, the House approved the bill by a solid majority of 275 to 151. Mr. President, 68 Republicans as well as almost every Democrat in the House stood up for patients and stood up against industry pressure. 
   Now the insurance industry and its friends in the Republican leadership are at it again. Their emerging strategy is, once again, to delay and deny relief that American families need and that the House overwhelmingly approved. Every indication is that the intention of the Republican leadership is to see that this legislation, as it passed the House of Representatives, will not reach the President for his signature. 
   According to the Los Angeles Times, Senator LOTT's response to the passage of the House bill is that the House-Senate conferences on other legislation have a higher priority and resolving the differences on this bill will take some time. 
   According to the Baltimore Sun, Senator LOTT also indicated Congress might not have the time to work out differences or approve a final bill before it adjourns for the year. Senator NICKLES said the conference committee will probably not begin serious work until early next year. 
   I say: Why don't we consider the House bill--the bill that passed the House overwhelmingly with 68 Republicans--a bipartisan bill with Democrats and Republicans working together? Why don't we pass that in the Senate this afternoon? We could do that. I 
   certainly urge that we go ahead and do that today. Every day we fail to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights, we are permitting insurance company accountants to make medical decisions that doctors and nurses and other trained medical personnel should have the opportunity to make. That is why the Patients' Bill of Rights is so important. 
   We believe that medical professionals, trained, dedicated and committed to their patients, should make those decisions, not accountants. This chart shows what we will see as long as we permit accountants to make health care decisions. We are going to see about 35,000 patients every single day will have needed care delayed. Specialty referrals will be denied to 35,000 patients. It may be that a child with cancer will see a pediatrician but doesn't get the necessary referral to see a pediatric oncologist. Mr. President, 31,000 patients are forced to change doctors every day; 18,000 are forced to change medication because the HMOs refused to reimburse the medicine their physician prescribed. The final result is that 59,000 Americans every day experience unnecessary added pain and suffering; 41,000 Americans see their conditions worsen every day that we fail to act. 
   We still have time to act in the final days of this session. Republicans are beginning to lay the groundwork for a failed conference. Comparing the Senate and House bills, Congressman BILL THOMAS says you don't see many crossbreeds between Chihuahuas and Great Danes walking around. That is quite a quote--we don't see many crossbreeds between Chihuahuas and Great Danes walking around. 
   I say, let's do what every health care professional organization in the United States has urged us to do, and pass the House bill. I am still waiting for the other side to list one major or minor health organization that supports their proposal: Zero, none, none. Every one of them--every doctors' organization, patients' organization, nursing organization, children's organization, women's health organization, consumer organization--supports our proposal. 
   Here is how Bruce Johnston of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce put it:  
   To see nothing come out of the conference is my hope. The best outcome is no outcome. But if the strategy of delay and denial ultimately breaks down, the Republican leadership once again has an alternative to try to weaken the House bill as much as possible.  
   As the Baltimore Sun reported:  
   The House majority whip suggested the Republican-dominated House conference would not fight vigorously for the House-approved measure in the conference committee. Mr. DeLay said, ``Remember who controls the conference: the Speaker of the House.''  
   That ought to give a lot of satisfaction to parents who are concerned about health care for their children. It ought to give a lot of satisfaction to the doctors who are trying to provide the best health care. This is what the House majority whip suggested: Remember who controls the conference: the Speaker of the House--unalterably opposed to the program. 
   The conference that produces legislation that looks like the Senate Republican bill will break faith with the American people, make a mockery of the overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives, and cause unnecessary suffering for millions of patients. Every day we delay in passing meaningful reforms means more patients will suffer and die. 
   Finally, I do not think, when we consider minimum wage and consider health, we have addressed these issues in the last few days. These are the matters about which most families are concerned. These are the issues they want addressed. The Republican leadership is considering what they will do on the bankruptcy issue. We have seen great economic prosperity. Do you know who is going bankrupt, by and large? It is the men and women 
   who have lost out in the mergers, the supermergers that have brought extraordinary wealth and accumulation of wealth to individual stockholders. It is families who have had to pay increased costs for prescription drugs. It is women who are not receiving their alimony payments or women who are not getting child care support--there are some 400,000 of them. These are the individuals who are going into bankruptcy. Their needs should be protected. 
   We have to ask ourselves, if we are going to call bankruptcy up, why aren't we dealing with minimum wage? Why aren't we working on the Patients' Bill of Rights? Why are we not coming to grips with these issues, which are at the center of every working family's hopes and dreams. 
   In the months since the House passed the Norwood-Dingell bill and the Republican leadership has failed to allow a conference to proceed, 1 million patients have had needed care delayed; 1 million patients have been denied or delayed referral to a specialist; 940,000 patients have been forced to change doctors; more than 535,000 patients have been forced to change medication; Mr. President, 1.8 million patients have experienced added pain and suffering as a result of health plan abuses, and 1.2 million patients have seen their conditions worsen because of health plan abuses. 
   In the final days of this Congress, we can still take some important steps that will have a direct impact on the well-being of families who are at the lower end of the economic ladder. We can still take important steps that will have a direct impact on families who are faced with health care challenges. We can have a positive impact. We have had the hearings. We have had the debates. We have had the deliberations. All we need is to have the vote the way the House of Representatives had the vote. We can pass what has been a bipartisan bill in the House of Representatives in a matter of a few short hours. 
   The Republican leadership has waited a month since the House bill was passed to start this conference, effectively pushing action to next February at the earliest. Today is another litmus test of their intention with the appointment of House conferees. We expect those conferees to be stacked against meaningful reform. 
   We are prepared to participate in a fair conference, and we are willing to  enter into a reasonable compromise, but we are sending notice today that we will not tolerate a charade designed only to protect insurance company profits while patients continue to suffer. We will come back to this issue over and over until the American people prevail. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend the city of Boston's Crusade Against Cancer and I commend our outstanding Mayor, Thomas M. Menino, for his leadership on this excellent program. Donald Gudaitis, the chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society's New England Division, has called the Crusade Against Cancer, ``the most visionary public health initiative ever undertaken in any city around the prevention and early detection of cancer.'' 
   Through innovative measures such as giving city employees time off for cancer screenings, Boston's Crusade Against Cancer uses a small public investment to create a large public health payoff. It may well serve as a model for communities throughout the nation. 
   Boston's program provides essential preventive care to the city's low income and minority communities, who are hit disproportionately hard by the ravages of cancer. Many members of these communities are neglected by HMOs and private insurers and might otherwise never receive a cancer screening.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, ten years ago, Congress created the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research to help us deal more effectively with critical national priorities in health care and research. I introduced the legislation with Senator HATCH, and it passed as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989. It was based on a precursor organization--the National Center for Health Services Research--that was created by President Lyndon Johnson. The Agency's focus is primarily on health services research and other cutting edge methods to improve clinical practice. In its first decade, the Agency has proven its worth time and again by providing valuable information to Congress, health professionals, patients, businesses, and many others. 
   This reauthorization begins a new chapter for the Agency. New responsibilities come with its new name, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. While the Agency's intramural and extramural research will remain focused on general outcomes research and assessments of the how well the nation is doing with respect to coverage and provision of health care, there will also be increased activity on research to monitor and improve the quality of care. 
   The Agency will serve an increasingly important role in the nation's effort to measure and improve the quality of health care, and to expand access to health insurance and health care. Research supported by the Agency provides critical information about the use, cost and quality of health services. As the health care market evolves, these data are necessary for informed decisions to help patients, providers, employers, government administrators, and policymakers. While the Agency is not directly involved in making policy, its research and expertise provide informed guidance to those who are. This legislation will help the Agency maintain and expand its efforts to encourage public-private partnerships at every level of the health care system. 
   The American people deserve to know that their hard-earned dollars are buying high-quality care. They want to know, as they are voluntarily or involuntarily enrolled in managed care plans, that the quality of care they receive is improving, not declining. Employers deserve to know that their investments in health benefits lead to healthier employees. As a result of the Agency's work, more and more Americans will be able to make the right decisions about their health care. 
   The Agency also provides an important link between advances in medical research and technology, and adoption of these practices by the public and private sectors. The research conducted and supported by the Agency helps identify erroneous denials of treatment, and informs the nation about treatments that are the most effective or have the highest quality. While the Agency is not in the business of developing or promoting practice guidelines, its recommendations and research findings lead to significant savings for patients, providers, health plans, and taxpayers, while simultaneously improving the quality of care. 
   For example, if the Agency's recommendations were applied to even 20 percent of patients, the nation could save hundreds of millions of dollars annually--ranging from $8.5 million for enhanced prenatal care for diabetic women to $130 million for therapies that prevent stroke. We should do all we can to see that decision-making on health care is guided by the best available scientific information. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality will to help us achieve that goal. 
   The reauthorization of the Agency also provides an opportunity to expand research on health care for those with special needs. Our success in treating these patients is an important measure of the overall effectiveness of the nation's health care system. More needs to be done to evaluate how well our system treats those who need the most, and often the most complex, services. Persons with disabilities are often underrepresented in health services research. Assessing how well our fragmented system cares for a person with mental retardation or spina bifida or parapalegia or a person nearing the end-of-life will enable us to assess where better care can lead to both a higher quality of life and significant savings. 
   Reliable information about medical technology is an essential component of providing high quality health care to all Americans at a reasonable cost. It is especially important for Congress to be able to compare and understand the effectiveness of different technologies. For this reason, I was a strong supporter of the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment, which evaluated technologies in a wide range of  scientific disciplines and provided a great deal of useful information to Congress before its funding was cut off in 1995. Fortunately, the Agency is fulfilling this essential role in the area of health care, and its mission is now more important than ever. 
   The ongoing biomedical revolution is bringing extraordinary benefits to our society. The next century may well be the century of life sciences. Every day, we hear about new medical procedures and technologies. To fulfill their promise, the quality and effectiveness of new procedures and technologies must be carefully evaluated. The Agency is uniquely qualified to meet this challenge, and to provide important information about the value and effectiveness of existing procedures and therapies. 
   The assessment reports prepared by the Agency are based on sound scientific data. Expanding access to the Agency's findings is an important step toward improving the overall quality of health care for the nation. We need to do all we can to see that the extraordinary discoveries being made in biomedical research are brought as quickly as possible to the bedside of the patient. 
   This reauthorization puts a new face on the Agency and refocuses and refines its functions. Adequate funding for the Agency is essential, and I look forward to working with the Appropriations Committees and the Administration to achieve these needed and wise investments in better health care for all.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks an important landmark in our efforts to improve children's health. We are taking the first step toward ensuring that the nation's children's hospitals have the support they need to continue to train physicians to care for children.  
   Less than one percent of the nation's hospitals are independent children's hospitals. Yet these hospitals train 30 percent of all pediatricians. These freestanding children's hospitals also train more than half of the country's pediatric specialists--the physicians who care for children with cancer, asthma, diabetes and many other chronic diseases and special needs. 
   In addition to their teaching responsibilities, they care for uninsured children, conduct pediatric research, and provide state-of-the-art specialty care for children in all parts of the nation. The services they provide and the activities they conduct are indispensable. When a child has a rare disease or complicated condition, children's hospitals are the hospitals of choice. 
   In Massachusetts, Boston Children's Hospital provides excellent care and conducts needed pediatric research and training. It provides the highest quality of care for sick or disabled children from Massachusetts, New England and the world. It is a national resource. The primary care and specialist physicians it trains serve in countless communities in Massachusetts and throughout the country. Boston Children's Hospital has been recognized as a world-class institution. Researchers at the hospital continue to offer new hope for children and adults, as they break new ground in battles to fight pediatric diseases. For example, Dr. Judah Folkman has developed two powerful agents that show great promise in the war on cancer. These agents--angiostatin and endostatin--have been shown to shrink cancerous tumors in animals. Clinical trials are now underway to test the effectiveness of bladder tissue grown in a laboratory, and to treat high-risk heart patients with a tiny device that can close holes in the heart without invasive surgery. 
   These advances are the result of the teaching hospital environment that is the heart of the mission of Boston Children's Hospital. Senior clinicians and scientists work with new doctors in training. The interns, residents and fellows who train at Boston Children's Hospital and other children's hospitals are the pediatricians, pediatric specialists and pediatric researchers of tomorrow. The federal government should invest in their training, just as we have invested in the training of physicians who care for adults. The benefits to the nation are immeasurable. 
   In general, graduate medical education activities are supported through Medicare. However, because children's hospitals treat very few Medicare patients, they receive almost no federal support to train physicians. In fact, they receive less than 1/200th per resident compared to other teaching hospitals. The lack of federal support makes no sense. It unintentionally penalizes children's hospitals, and we need to correct this problem as soon as possible. 
   The legislation accompanying the reauthorization of the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research authorizes a new discretionary program to provide support for pediatric graduate medical education. It authorizes the funding necessary to provide adequate support--$280 million in FY 2000 and $285 million in FY 2001. But this authorization is just a beginning. We need to continue to work together this year and next year to ensure that adequate funds are appropriated for this important new program to succeed. 
   Adequate and stable funding for pediatric GME activities can best be achieved by a permanent mandatory program. The Senate Finance Committee has agreed to hold a hearing on this important issue next year, and I hope action will quickly follow. Senator BOB KERREY and I have introduced legislation that will create a mandatory program. It has broad bipartisan support in the Senate. Forty senators, evenly divided among Democrats and Republicans, favor this approach, and I am confident that we will prevail in the end. 
   However, this year we have an opportunity to begin to address this important children's health issue. Today's authorization lays the groundwork for a downpayment in the appropriations for FY2000. The President's budget proposed $40 million for pediatric graduate medical education. The Labor, Health and Human Services Appropriations conference bill includes $20 million for this program. Congress should follow the President's lead and provide at least $40 million for next year, while Congress pursues full funding through a long-term solution. 
   It is an honor to support Boston Children's Hospital and other children's hospitals across the country as they strive to meet the health needs of the nation's children. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House and Senate on this important issue in the coming year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this bill is the result of a concerted and cooperative bipartisan effort. It is an important and timely piece of legislation that is long overdue, and I urge the Senate to support it. 
   Mental illness and substance abuse are national problems that need comprehensive and compassionate attention. These conditions do not respect party affiliation or race or age. They are equal opportunity destroyers, but they don't have to destroy at all. 
   States and local communities provide some of the most critical and ongoing services for persons who struggle with mental illness and substance abuse. This bill enables these dedicated providers to do an even better job with limited resources to accomplish their prevention and treatment goals. 
   Since we passed the original authorizing legislation for the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 1992, a number of major  clinical and service delivery issues have emerged which require legislative attention. Now we have crafted a bill that accomplishes a great deal and that includes significant compromises on a number of key issues. 
   The bill addresses three important clinical issues that have emerged in recent years: the growing problem of co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders, the distressing and pervasive impact of psychological trauma especially on our younger citizens, and the important relationship between mental health or substance abuse and primary care providers. It also places much greater emphasis on preventing and treating mental health and substance abuse problems in children and adolescents. 
   The provisions for children demonstrate the breadth and depth of this bill. It contains a children and violence initiative, centers of excellence for psychological trauma, grants for persons who experience violence-related stress, comprehensive substance abuse prevention and treatment for children and adolescents, special attention for children of substance abusers, wrap-around services for youth offenders, and special training centers to increase the sensitivity and competency of staff who work on these issues in the juvenile justice system. 
   The bill also addresses special problems that adults face. It maintains and expands support for critical programs that serve the homeless, extends its protection to persons who are served in community-based facilities, limits the use of seclusion and restraints in psychiatric facilities, and addresses the special circumstances of Native Americans. 
   I am particularly pleased with the initiatives to meet the intense service needs of persons with co-occurring mental health and substance abuse disorders. Often, they need innovative treatment approaches, including integrated mental health and addiction treatment facilities. Over the next two years, the Secretary will compile a report that establishes the best practices for helping this very challenging but treatable group. 
   The bill authorizes the Secretary to provide additional funding for projects on the increasingly important ties linking mental health or substance abuse and primary care. Family physicians and other primary care providers see many patients with a wide range of psychiatric and psychological problems. Too often, however, they do not recognize the mental health problems of their patients. Even if they do, they are often ill-prepared to provide adequate treatment or counseling. We can do much more to help primary care physicians do a better job of caring for patients with serious mental illnesses. This bill seeks to do that. 
   The bill also accomplishes several important organizational goals. It gives States more flexibility in administering their grant funds, and removes a number of bureaucratic obstacles to greater efficiency. In exchange for this easing of certain mandates, the States will enter into a cooperative agreement with the Administration in developing outcomes-based accountability measures. 
   The bill also gives the SAMHSA Administrator greater authority in managing discretionary grant funds. It enables the Administrator to make emergency grants to deal with immediate problems that cannot be addressed by the standard grant-making process. 
   In spite of the many excellent features in this bill, one provision is seriously flawed. The section that allows religious organizations to compete for public funds for the provision of substance abuse services violates the prohibition against certain forms of discrimination. I recognize the valuable role that faith-based organizations can play in helping to address a wide array of social problems. However, the recent proliferation of charitable choice provisions in federal social service programs runs the risk of creating a religious litmus test for those who provide these services, thus barring many trained, qualified professionals from providing services for faith-based organizations. We need to do more to avoid that discrimination. 
   Our goal is to help many of those in communities across the country who have received inadequate care in the past. The many excellent provisions in this bill will help to ensure that these children and adults will finally receive the care they need and deserve--without stigma or shame, but with dignity and respect--and America will be a better nation because of it. 
   I commend my colleagues for this important action to reauthorize the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. I want to thank Senator FRIST and his Republican colleagues and their staffs for their skillful work for this genuine bipartisan achievement. I commend Senator DODD, who worked effectively on children's issues and the seclusion and restraint provision. Senator HARKIN contributed his important initiative on methamphetamine and inhalant abuse, and Senator DURBIN contributed his critical provision on residential treatment for pregnant women and women who have given birth. Senators BINGAMAN, WELLSTONE, and REED effectively collaborated on a series of significant child and adolescent provisions, and Senator BINGAMAN worked effectively on the needs of Native Americans. Senators MIKULSKI and MURRAY provided excellent counsel on many issues, especially the mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of women. I thank Joe Faha, SAMHSA's Director of Legislation, for his generous assistance throughout the process, as well as Nelba Chavez, the Administrator of SAMHSA. I especially thank David Pollack, David Nexon and Debra DeBruin on my staff, for their dedication and excellent work in bringing this bill to passage.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from my colleagues, and I thank them for bringing this matter to my attention. I will work with Chairman JEFFORDS during the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to ensure that the Impact Aid Program adequately addresses the needs of students in federally impacted school districts, and that funding is directed to the districts with the most need, and is distributed in an equitable manner. I look forward to working with Senator JEFFORDS, Senator INHOFE, and other colleagues to address these issues fairly.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to recognize an outstanding individual who will soon be retiring from public service. Helen L. Westbrook currently works in the Office of the Deputy Under Secretary of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In December, she will complete a career that has spanned many years of distinguished service to our country. 
   This is a special occasion for me and the Kennedy family, as Helen is truly one of our own. In 1955, as a Senator, my brother John F. Kennedy visited Chicopee, Massachusetts, and delivered an address about a recent visit he had made to Poland and Eastern Europe. Like many other young Americans of that time, Helen heard and heeded my brother's call to public service. She moved to Washington, D.C., and in January 1956, she began work as a secretary in my brother's Senate office. Following the 1960 election, Jack asked Helen to join his White House Staff, and she served as a Secretarial Assistant in the Office of the President until January 1963. 
   Helen then decided she wanted to gain experience working overseas, and for the next year and a half, she served in our U.S. Embassy in Rome She then returned to America, and at the request of Jackie Kennedy, she came back to work with our family. For the next few years, she served as an assistant to Jackie in New York City. She watched Caroline and John F. Kennedy, Jr. grow up, and went on to marry and raise a family of her own. 
   In 1992, Helen rejoined the Federal Government and started a career with NOAA. She has been a good friend to Massachusetts and has called for a balanced approach to fisheries management. She has been a skillful advocate for assistance to New England fishermen and coastal communities, and all of us who know her are proud of her achievements and her friendship. 
   Helen Westbrook is a kind, thoughtful person who truly cares about people. She has brought professionalism, wisdom and dedication to each position that she has held. She is a valued and loyal friend of the Kennedy family. 
   We don't have enough Helen Westbrooks in government and in the world. She is a shining example of the wonderful people who answered President Kennedy's call to serve their country. I'm proud of her contribution to public service, and I wish her well in her well-deserved retirement.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from Illinois. I must say, he has summarized the situation as we are drawing to the end of this part of the Congress very well. There is still some time for this do nothing Congress to mend its ways--if there were a disposition to make some progress, there is still some time to do so. 
   But I think it is important, as we come to the end of this session, to take stock of what has been achieved and has not been achieved. My friend from Illinois has done an excellent job summarizing those issues. I would like to provide some additional comments on some of the matters he raised. 
   First of all, as the Senator from Illinois and others have pointed out in these last days, we are still failing to meet our responsibilities to those 11 million Americans who earn the minimum wage. In many instances these are the hardest-working laborers in our economy, but they are on the bottom rung of the economic ladder--and this, during the most extraordinary prosperity in the history of this country. There has been an incredible accumulation of wealth that has taken place over the period of the last 5, 6, 7 years. As a direct result of the leadership of President Clinton and the Democratic Members of Congress, and despite the opposition of nearly every single Republican Member, we are in the midst of the greatest economic growth in the history of the country. We have even found the will to raise our own salaries some $4,600 a year. But the Republicans are now holding a minimum wage increase hostage to $35 billion in new tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. 
   All we are asking is that we have at least the opportunity to bring this matter before the Senate and permit a vote on it. It does not take too much time--Members know this issue. But under the parliamentary situation that we find ourselves in now, the leadership--the Republican leadership--is denying us the opportunity to do so. This is the seventh time that technique has been used this year. Do we think the purpose of it is to open and broaden debate and discussion on matters before the American people? No, it is to narrow and close down the opportunity for debate and discussion. 
   So, when we look where we are as a country, from 1965 up to the year 2000, this line reflects what the purchasing power of the minimum wage would be with constant dollars of 1998. Here we find back in 1965 all the way up to the early 1980s, we actually found Republicans and Democrats alike working together to make sure that working Americans could earn a livable wage. 
   Then there was a period during the Reagan administration, starting in 1980 and going right through 1988, when we had a great deal of resistance in getting any increase. We had one increase in the minimum wage and another spike again in 1995. 
   But if we do not take action by the year 2001, the purchasing power of the minimum wage will be at an all-time low. And still we are denied an opportunity to bring this matter before the Senate. 
   Eighty-five percent of the American people favor increasing the minimum wage, and the opposition refuses to even debate it. The two old arguments they have used against increasing the minimum wage are that it will cause a loss of jobs and that it will add to inflation. Those tired old arguments have long since been discredited. 
   We know that when there has been an actual increase, again, in October 1996 and October 1997, the employment levels have continued to go up. There is absolutely no case that can be made that this will lose jobs. 
   Our proposal is modest, a one dollar increase in two installments--50 cents next January, and 50 cents the following year--to provide a lifeline to so many who are working so hard in our country. We know who the workers earning the minimum wage are. They are assistant schoolteachers who work in our children's classrooms. They are assistants in nursing homes caring for our family members. 
   This is a women's issue because the overwhelming majority of individuals who work at minimum wage are women. 
   This is a children's issue because eighty-five percent of the women who are receiving minimum wage have children. 
   It is a civil rights issue because many of those involved in making the minimum wage are men and women of color. 
   Most of all, it is a fairness issue. How can we justify raising our own salaries $4,600 a year and refuse to provide a $1 increase over 2 years for men and women who go out every single day, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year? 
   This is absolutely unfair. Americans understand fairness, they understand work, they understand fair play, and the Republican leadership is denying the American workers fair play on this issue. 
   I want to mention another important issue which we hope to address in the final days of the Senate, and that is the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, a very simple piece of legislation that says doctors--not accountants--ought to be making decisions in matters affecting the health of our families. 
   The protections contained in the Norwood-Dingell managed care reform bill which passed in the House of Representatives three weeks ago by an overwhelming bipartisan majority of 275-151, have been recommended by the broad-based and nonpartisan Presidents' Commission. They are included in the model standards of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. These protections are already available under Medicare. They are used as voluntary standards by the managed care companies' own trade associations. They are the rights that ethical insurance companies honor as a matter of course, and that every family believes it has purchased when it pays its premiums. 
   These protections listed on this chart are the ones we tried to guarantee to the consumers of America. That essentially is the Democratic proposal we debated in the Senate. These circles indicate what the Senate finally did on these protections. My colleagues can see they are zero in most of the cases, and small coloring in other cases, which means they took a partial fix on some of these protections. And my colleagues can see what the bipartisan Republican and Democratic proposal did in the House of Representatives. 
   We are prepared to bring that House bill before the Senate and debate it for a few hours, pass it, and provide protections for the American people. We do not need a conference. The President will sign it. Why don't we move ahead on this? This has bipartisan 
   support. This has already been debated and it had the overwhelming support of 68 Republican Members in the House of Representatives. 
   Why are we not protecting the American people? Why are we being denied the opportunity to provide protections? If there is some question as to whether we really are providing protections, look at what is happening across the country every single day. Every single day the Congress delays the Patients' Bill of Rights means more patients are suffering. 
   Each day that Congress delays means that more patients will suffer and die. According to a survey by the University of California at Berkeley, every day we delay means that 35,000 patients  will find their access to needed care delayed. Thirty-one thousand will be forced to change doctors. Eighteen thousand will be forced to forego medications ordered by their doctor. Fifty-nine thousand will endure unnecessary pain and suffering as the result of adverse actions by their health plan. And 11,000 will suffer permanent disability. 
   The health professionals who deal with managed care companies every day know that prompt action is critical. According to a survey of physicians by the Harvard University School of Public Health, every week at least 18,000 patients' medical condition worsens because they are denied an overnight stay in a hospital. At least twenty-three thousand patients are harmed every week because of the denial of specialty care. Each week, at least seventy-nine thousand patients are harmed because of denial of needed prescription drugs. The list goes on and on.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. That is an excellent question. As the Senator from Illinois understands, these protections did not just come out of thin air. They were recommended. Recommended by whom? Virtually every medical society in the country supports our program. During this debate, we challenged the other side to produce one medical society that supported their program. We still have not heard it. 
   Every medical society supports our program. Every nursing society supports our program. Every consumer group supports our program. Every patient organization supports our program. Every one of the consumer groups that have been trying to protect children understands the importance of getting specialists for children; not just a pediatrician, but a pediatrician oncologist to deal with cancer in children and specialists in these areas. We guarantee these. This Republican program does not. 
   We have the legislative power of this body to pass something which the President will sign to provide the patient protections we are talking about. All the majority leader has to do is call up that legislation. Just call it up. Let us debate it, and let us act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator again has asked the important question. It is the insurance industry. You have on the one hand, as suggested by the two questions the Senator asked, all of the health professionals, all of the men and women who have devoted their lives to taking care of patients in this country, the doctors, the nurses, all of the various professional societies, all the consumer groups, all the children's organizations that care about this, all the elderly groups. And on the other side you have the insurance industry that is opposed to it. The basic reason for that is that it cuts into their bottom line--even though they have guaranteed the kinds of protections we are talking about. 
   What we are trying to do is make sure the patients are going to get the kind of coverage and the kind of attention for which they had signed up. What happens in so many of these instances is the HMO, the policyholder, just will not give what their patients are guaranteed in these areas. And with all the other complexities in terms of denying the patients the opportunity to sue the HMO, we are denied an opportunity for remedy as well. 
   There is rarely a public policy question that is as important as this one. We know what can be done. We have good legislation, that is almost at the door of the Senate, that could be called up. I am sure the Senator from Illinois would agree with me, and we could get that done today. Certainly we could do that, and the minimum wage as well. 
   I see my time has just about expired, but I want to try to go through, briefly, some of these other areas where we have failed to take action. These are the kind of issues about which people talk to us. This is the kind of issue about which families are concerned--the minimum wage, a Patients' Bill of Rights. When I was in Methuen this past Monday, I must have had four different senior citizens come up to me and say: What's happening on that prescription drug proposal that the President is supporting--that so many of us are supporting? Try to get that up and get a debate, get that reported out of the Finance Committee and reported out here on the Senate floor. Please do something about prescription drugs. 
   But we aren't able to get anything done on that. We aren't able to get anything done on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We have a Republican leader who said that ``House-Senate conferences on other legislation have a higher priority'' than consideration of the Patients' Bill of Rights. So this thing is just being kicked on over to next year. That may be satisfactory to some of the insurance companies. That may be satisfactory to some of the Republican leadership. But it is not satisfactory to the families in this country. 
   In the final few moments, I want to once again mention the areas of education which we would have hopefully had some opportunity to address with greater time. 
   In recent years, too many in Congress have paid lip-service to education--and then failed to act to meet the most basic needs of the Nation's schools. This Congress faces a major test in the coming days, as we seek to guarantee that education receives the funds it deserves for the coming fiscal year. If we want a better and stronger America tomorrow, we must invest more in education today.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has given an excellent example about programs that have been successful. And we know these programs are working, as the Senator has pointed out. 
   Communities do not understand why, just a year ago, we joined hands to help them reduce class size--yet we are on the verge of abandoning our commitment now. 
   Research has documented what parents and teachers have always known--smaller classes improve student achievement. In small classes, students receive more individual attention and instruction. Students with learning disabilities have those disabilities identified earlier, and their needs can be met without placing them in costly special education. In small classes, teachers are better able to maintain discipline. Parents and teachers can work together more effectively to support children's education. 
   Project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 schools in Tennessee. Students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade.  Follow-up studies show that students from small classes enrolled in more college-bound courses, had higher grade-point averages, had fewer discipline problems, and were less likely to drop out of school. 
   Because of the Class Size Reduction Act, 1.7 million children are benefiting from smaller classes this year. 29,000 teachers have been hired. 1,247 are teaching in the first grade, reducing class sizes from 23 to 17. 6,670 are teaching in the second grade, reducing class size from 23 to 18. 6,960 are teaching in the third grade, reducing class size from 24 to 18. 2,900 are in other grades, K-12, 290 special education teachers have been hired. 
   The program is well under way. Abandoning our commitment to help communities reduce class sizes would break a specific promise made by Congress only 1 year ago. It would also be a violation of our responsibility to support a strong Federal-State-local partnership in education. Congress cannot abdicate this responsibility. 
   We must also ensure that teachers get the training they need to come to school ready to teach. Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants are an important step in addressing the critical national need for high-quality teachers. It received strong bipartisan support in the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act, and Congress should fund it at the full authorization level of $300 million for next year. 
   Children need and deserve a good education in order to succeed in life. But they cannot obtain that education if school roofs are falling down around them, if sewage is backing up because of faulty plumbing--asbestos in flaking off the walls and ceilings--schools lack computers and modern technology--and if classrooms are overcrowded. 
   We need to invest more to help States and communities rebuild crumbling schools, modernize decrepit buildings, and expand facilities to accommodate reduced class sizes. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded schools sends an unacceptable message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can to ensure that children are learning in safe, modern school buildings. 
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. Fourteen million children in a third of the Nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. The problem of ailing school buildings is not the problem of the inner city alone. It exists in almost every community, urban, rural, or suburban. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, communities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million students, and will continue to grow. 
   The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools will be needed by 2003, just to accommodate rising enrollments. The General Accounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion to repair and modernize the Nation's schools. Congress should lend a helping hand, and do all we can to help schools and communities across the country meet this challenge. 
   Finally, in June with the support of over 250 groups representing the disability community, health care providers, and the business community, the Senate passed landmark legislation 99-0 to open the workplace doors for disabled people in communities across this country. Last week, the House of Representatives passed this legislation by a vote of 412-9. Once this measure is enacted into law, large numbers of people with disabilities will have the opportunity to fulfill their hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives. 
   But despite the overwhelming bipartisan support for the Work Incentives Improvement Act, the House of Representatives has yet to appoint conferees to move enactment of this bill forward. 
   A decade ago, when we enacted the Americans with Disabilities Act, we promised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life, in which disability would no longer end the American dream. Too often, for too many Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will dramatically strengthen the fulfillment of that promise. 
   We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But the Republican Leadership in the House continues to deny these citizens the opportunity to work be refusing to appoint conferees and move this bill forward. Every day this legislation is delayed is another day the nation is denied the talents and the contributions of disabled Americans. 
   Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern technology are making it easier than ever before for disabled persons to have productive lives and careers. Yet current laws are often a greater obstacle to that goal than the disability itself. It's ridiculous that we punish disable persons who dare to take a job by penalizing them financially, by taking away their health insurance lifeline, and by placing these unfair obstacles in their path. 
   Eliminating these barriers to work will help disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer country when we open the door of opportunity to all Americans, and enable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of Americans with disabilities, this bill is a declaration of independence that can make the American dream come true. 
   For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left behind. It is time for Congress to stop stalling this legislation, and take the long overdue action to correct the injustices they are unfairly suffering. 
   The issues I have discussed today--a fair wage, health care, education, employment for the disabled, freedom from hate crimes--touch the lives of every American. If this Congress wants to make a difference for our constituents--to improve their lives and to ease their burdens--these are major issues we must address. 
   I thank the Chair and thank the Senator from Maine for her indulgence.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are almost a month into the new fiscal year and Congress still has not passed an appropriations bill for the Departments of Education, Labor, and Health and Human Services. The work of these Departments touches the lives of nearly every American, yet the Republican leadership has been unable to work out an acceptable budget for them which will enable them to carry out their responsibilities fully and effectively. 
   The majority has used an extraordinary array of gimmicks, such as bogus emergency spending designations, and an unprecedented level of advance fundings. But even those budgetary slights of hand were insufficient to do the job. 
   They considered reneging on Congress' commitment to provide TANF moneys to the States but backed off under pressure from the Republican Governors. 
   They proposed increasing taxes on the working poor by changing the reimbursement rules for the Earned Income Tax Credit. Even the leading Republican Presidential candidate denounced that as ``balancing the budget on the backs of the poor.'' Again, the Republican leadership was forced to retreat from an outrageous proposal. The fact that these cuts were even considered shows how out of control the budget process is. 
   In desperation, the Republicans have now proposed that we indiscriminately cut all Government programs by 1 percent across the board. In other words, they would treat essential health and education programs no differently than special interest pork barrel projects. They ignore the reality that some of the programs are far more important than others. This type of mindless cut is an admission of total budgetary failure. 
   They pretend such a cut will not have any impact on the programs, but they are terribly wrong. The human cost of such an across-the-board cut would be very high. It would hurt many of our most vulnerable people: 
   Some 5,000 fewer preschoolers in Head Start; 
   2,800 fewer children in the child care programs; 
   74,000 fewer babies receiving nutritional supplements; 
   2,775,000 fewer meals brought to the elderly and disabled; 
   120,000 fewer disadvantaged students helped; 
   6,000 fewer job opportunities for youth; 
   10,000 fewer work-study grants for college students; 
   10,000 fewer children helped to read; 
   3,000 fewer children immunized; 
   20,000 fewer homes for low-income families. 
   Each one of these is an unacceptable price to pay for the Republicans' inability to produce a fair and fiscally sound budget. 
   That was with a 1% cut. Now CBO has made available to us a letter that was sent to the Honorable JOHN SPRATT, who is the ranking Democratic member of the Committee on the Budget in the House, with copies also to Mr. KASICH and Mr. DOMENICI. 
   The conclusion of these letters is that the 0.97% cut that will be included in the conference report, which perhaps we will consider later, is going to be insufficient, according to the latest 
   calculations of CBO, to avoid tapping social security funds this fiscal year. Their estimate is, it would have to be not 0.97 percent but a total of 5.8 percent. If you were to eliminate defense, military construction, veterans programs, it would be in excess of 11 percent. 
   So here on this chart are the cuts with 1 percent. And the CBO says, if you are going to do the job and follow the pathway that is being recommended by the Republican leadership, it will have to be a 5.8 percent cut. 
   So you can multiply all of the cuts to programs needed by our most vulnerable citizens by 5.8, which yields a much more devastating impact. Those are the circumstances we are in. 
   The fact is that the President and the ranking Democrats on the various committees say: Why don't you go back and cut out the pork you put in and cut out the excesses you have added, and send us something that is responsible? Then we can have true negotiations. 
   But that isn't the way the Republican leadership is moving. They are just favoring across-the-board cuts, which will cut valuable, helpful programs that are indispensable to needy people, for infants and for children, for education, and for health--the same amount as the pork programs that have been added by the Republicans. 
   These consequences are all the more deplorable because they are unnecessary. President Clinton and the Democrats here in Congress have proposed fiscally responsible measures to keep our hands entirely off Social Security money even while we make the critical investments needed to strengthen our Nation in the coming year. 
   But the Republicans repeatedly said ``no.'' ``No'' to a cigarette tax that would prevent teen smoking while paying for children's health initiatives; ``no'' to making oil companies pay royalties they owe the Federal Government; ``no'' to reducing corporate welfare; ``no'' even to military officers when they ask to defer or delay programs the Republicans want in their districts. 
   By consistently declining opportunities to reduce a balanced budget, Republicans are on a course to raid Social Security, regardless of this proposed 1 percent cut. 
   Why have Republicans proposed this latest gimmick? To avoid using this year's Social Security surplus to pay for this year's Government spending, they tell us. But what Republicans don't say is that the gimmicks they have already voted for guarantee that the Social Security money will be used in the budget this year. That is what the latest CBO report that has been given to the leaders today has indicated. 
   I have but one simple question for anyone who would disagree: Where will the money come from to pay for the census, which Republicans have suddenly declared to be an emergency? This money must be paid to contractors and staff this budget year, yet it cannot be found anywhere except in the Social Security trust fund. 
   By simply calling a $4 billion entirely foreseeable program an ``emergency,'' Republicans cannot escape the fact that they will certainly spend Social Security surpluses this year, regardless of whether there is an across-the-board cut. The census gimmick is but one of many instances in which Social Security funds have already been spent by Republicans this budget year. When all the smoke and mirrors produced by the Republicans are removed, we can see that the true goal of their 1-percent cut is not to preserve Social Security surpluses but to gut Government spending on core education, health, and criminal justice programs. Republicans in this Congress are returning to the time of Speaker Gingrich when they proposed abolishing the Department of Education, only now they are dismantling it piece by piece. 
   Today's Republicans have proposed a $288 million cut for the Department of Education--continuing their longstanding assault on 
   our children's futures. Let's not forget that when Republicans first assumed the control of Congress in 1995, their top agenda item was to rescind $1.7 billion in education funding that had already been enacted into law by the Democratic Congress. Then, in the first full funding cycle subject to Republican control, their appropriators in the House socked the Department of Education with a $3.9 billion proposed cut--almost 20 percent. They tried again in the budget year 1997 when Senate appropriators sought a $3.1 billion cut to the President's request for education programs. 
   Democrats in the Congress, together with President Clinton, successfully resisted each one of these Republican cuts in education. 
   So since 1997, Republicans have sought more modest education cuts of  $200 million or more below the President. Today's proposed $288 million cut is consistent with the Republicans' longstanding goal of decreasing support for education. It is wrong. It is shortsighted. It is not what the American people want or deserve. 
   Of course, Senator NICKLES and Representative DELAY want us to believe their 1-percent cut won't hurt a bit. It might not hurt the oil companies they want to protect from paying full royalties to the Government this year, but it will hurt the real people I described when I listed some effects of their proposed cut. The cut might not affect the tobacco companies, now that the Republicans have rejected President Clinton's plan to raise cigarette taxes, but it will hurt those who rely on the programs Republicans want to cut. 
   In conclusion, I want to just point out--on this other chart--what the current situation is with regard to the Head Start Program. 
   Today, we have, for the Early Head Start Program, only 1 in 100 eligible children who are actually enrolled. This is what the Carnegie Commission and virtually all recent studies show is probably the wisest investment of funds of any other Government program because these are the earliest years of confidence building among children. And as all of the research has demonstrated, the earliest intervention in these years, in the first, second, third, and fourth years of life, has enormous consequences in the child's cognitive development and future education. Only 1 in 100 eligible children are presently enrolled in Early Head Start. In the Head Start Program, which has been tried and tested, evaluated and strengthened and improved, only 2 in 5 eligible children are enrolled now; 3 out of 5 are financially eligible, and cannot enroll in the program. 
   The Child Care Development Block Grant program only assists 1 in 10 eligible children. Education for the disabled, only 1 in 4 eligible children are assisted. This is the current situation. It is against that background we are going to see tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars in reduction in those programs because the Republican leadership, over the course of the year, have added a lot of boondoggle programs of their own in these other appropriations. 
   I indicated what those reductions would be if they were going to be 1 percent. Now we know it is going to be 5.8 percent, according to the CBO. 
   The proposed cut is wrong. It is an abdication of their duty to state what they believe the nation's priorities should be. It is irresponsible. I hope our colleagues would vote in the negative on this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I was aware of it. The particular need for that program is to provide help and assistance for low-income working families who have children. This is basically the children. That program benefits the children of working poor, to try to give some assurance they will at least have some measure of quality of life. That was the program targeted by the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives to be undermined, that program and the resources in that program, in order to offset the other benefits they had given to their special projects.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. It does not, for example, even give the military, give the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the commanders, the range of options they could have in order to meet their responsibility. We are up to 270-odd billion dollars in terms of defense appropriations; 1 percent is $2.7 billion. As a member of the Armed Services Committee, we heard from the Joint Chiefs that it would be a devastating cut in terms of personnel and in terms of readiness. They don't give the flexibility to any of the administrators to be able to do it. They are just mandating the requirement right across the board. That is the most inefficient way of doing it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Well, I had heard that, that they were going to hold some $7.8 billion. Maybe they could, with $1 billion, hold for some period of time. NIH might be able to deal with that. They are talking about $7.8 billion, effectively undermining the most significant and important basic research that is taking place any place in the world at a time of extraordinary possibility and breakthroughs in terms of health, in order to fund a number of military pieces of equipment that were never requested by the military and other special projects that were never requested by the administration. They don't want to cut those out, but they want to tamper with the greatest research center in the world, which is the NIH, doing so much on so many of these diseases that affect every family in America, whether it is cancer, whether it is on the issues of Alzheimer's, whether Parkinson's disease, you name it, lupus, whatever it is, osteoporosis that affect our senior citizens. They are tampering with those funds. I have seen a lot of shenanigans in the budgeting of the Federal budget, but I would certainly agree with the Senator that tampering with the NIH funds in the way this is done would have a dramatic adverse impact in our whole basic research programs at the NIH and would cause enormous harm. I welcome the Senator's observation, because, if there weren't other problems in this report, that in and of itself would justify the rejection of it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I commend the Senator for his very eloquent and accurate assessment of what has happened to this institution. I have been here for some period of time, and I say this is absolutely a unique set of circumstances. The leader has, I think, accurately described the current system. 
   I think it is important, as our friend from California pointed out, what it means in terms of people's lives. We can talk about the tree and blocking amendments, but let's take one bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   This chart lists in white all the provisions that were in the Senate bill, which our Democratic leader managed so well, and which was submitted in the Senate. All of these provisions represent the best judgment of a bipartisan commission set up by the President. They unanimously made these recommendations. They had to be unanimous in order to make the recommendations. They didn't make the recommendation to put them in law, but they said: This is what is necessary to protect the people. Or by the insurance commissioners, that are neither Democrat or Republican organizations; or, in other instances, in Medicare. 
   This side of the chart represents what happened in the House of Representatives with a bipartisan group of House Members, 68 Republicans and the Democrats. These full dots indicate the House of Representatives has effectively agreed with the legislation advanced by the minority leader. 
   I ask, since this was a bipartisan program and the leader had the overwhelming support of the Democrats, whether the Senator would not welcome the opportunity this afternoon to go ahead and pass what was passed in the House of Representatives so we would not have the kind of circumstance we have every single day we are delayed: 35,000 Americans delayed or denied specialty care; 31,000 forced to change doctors; 18,000 forced to change medicine indications; 59,000 Americans with added pain and suffering; 41,000 with a worsening condition; and 11,000 with permanent disability. 
   That happens every single day. 
   As I gather from what the leader has said, the kind of legislative trapeze that has been set up by the majority leader denies this minority the opportunity to take action that can make a difference in the lives of the families of America. I think it is worthwhile, as we talk and listen carefully to the Senator's concerns, to know the result of the inaction. Real families are being hurt in America. They don't have to be hurt. Republicans and Democrats alike got together to provide some protection, but this leadership in this body is denying the American people the ability to receive the kind of protections they should.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I regret that because of a long-standing commitment, I will not be here for tomorrow's vote on cloture on H.R. 434, The Sub-Saharan Africa Free Trade Act. If I could be here, I would vote against cloture. 
   I strongly oppose the majority leader's decision to fill the amendment tree to prevent us from offering amendments on some of the most important issues facing working families in this country, especially the minimum wage. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has said numerous times that increased trade has raised the standards of living and the quality of life for almost all countries involved in trade, and especially the quality of life in our own country. Chairman Greenspan believes that the number one benefit of trade is not simply jobs, but enhanced standards of living. 
   I can think of no more important enhancement to the standard of living of America's hardest pressed working families than to increase the minimum wage. Surely, it is appropriate to send the message on this legislation that increased trade must definitely mean a better quality of life for the working poor. 
   I had hoped to offer an amendment to raise the minimum wage to this bill, but the majority leader's actions prevent me from doing that. This trade bill has been offered to enhance the standards of living for workers in Africa and the Caribbean. I am certainly in favor of that, but there are honest disagreements as to whether the proposal before us effectively does so. But, while we express our concern for workers in these nations, we cannot forget about the workers in our own country. 
   I commend President Clinton for making trade with Africa a priority for his administration. His leadership is the driving force behind this entire debate. As the Senate debates trade with Sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean region, we must ensure that we take the right approach to building these vital partnerships. Clearly, we must strengthen our economic ties with these nations, but I am not convinced the proposal before us is the best way to do so. 
   Unfortunately, the majority leader's actions have also prevented anyone on this side of the aisle from offering germane amendments that will help us to build lasting partnerships between African and American businesses, provide strong protections for workers rights, and preserve the environment. We clearly had an opportunity to enact a bill that would make trade with Africa and the Caribbean Basin countries a win-win for all of the nations involved, but the majority leader's actions have made that impossible. 
   Any bill on Africa that comes before the Senate should address both trade and the other important issues facing Africa today. It must deal with the AIDS crisis. It must offer substantial debt relief. And it must restore foreign aid. Yet the proposal currently before the Senate is silent on these fundamental issues facing Africa. I am pleased that Senator FEINGOLD, Senator DURBIN, and other Senators are prepared to offer amendments that address all of these concerns, and I strongly support them. 
   I am also very concerned about the impact of the pending bill on our textile and apparel industries, which are often hardest hit by imports. These industries remain a critical source of employment for many American workers. In Massachusetts, many textile and apparel employees live in the Merrimack Valley and in Southeastern Massachusetts. They work hard, and they have made a lasting impact on our state's history and culture.  
   I believe even the proponents of this bill will admit that the short-term effect of the legislation will be an acceleration of job loss in the apparel sector. And while this bill includes a re-authorization of the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program, which I strongly support, nothing in this bill will create a single job for these displaced workers to have. 
   While Massachusetts continues to be a leader in exports, many small companies and workers are suffering as a result of the trade deficits caused by the economic crises in Asia and South America. In response to the needs of companies hurt by imports, the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program in general, and the New England Trade Adjustment Assistance Center in particular, exist as valuable resources. They offer vital assistance to firms and workers suffering from competition by imports. The Trade Adjustment Assistance Program is an effective initiative that has been shown to provide a return on investment of up to 348 percent. 
   The American people, I believe, will hold this Congress responsible for refusing to address so many issues which are critical to our families and our communities. The majority has once again turned a deaf ear to the pleas of the American people for action, and I regret this latest missed opportunity.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators SPECTER, LEAHY, JEFFORDS, and I are introducing the Hunger Relief Act of 1999. Our goals in this legislation are to promote self-sufficiency and the transition from welfare to work, and to eradicate childhood hunger by increasing the availability of food stamps to low-income working families. Republicans and Democrats share these goals, and it deserves broad bipartisan support. 
   Improving Food Stamp accessibility is a central part of helping low-income working families feed their children and achieve self-sufficiency. A strong Food Stamp Program, along with a higher minimum wage and an adequate Earned Income Tax Credit, gives low-income families the stability they need to build a brighter future. With the unemployment rate at a 30-year low and record, economic growth, this is a time of broad economic prosperity for most Americans. But that is not true for the poorest Americans. In 1998 the poverty rate declined from 13.3% to 12.7%, but this still surpasses rates in the 11% range recorded throughout the 1970's. The safety net provided by food stamps has weakened since the 1970's, and hunger among working families in America has grown. 
   In July 1999, the Department of Agriculture reported that 6.6 million adults and 3.4 million children live in households that suffered from hunger in 1998, and that 36 million people comprising 10% of the nation's households lack secure access to enough food for an active healthy life. 
   In the same month, the Congressional General Accounting Office reported that of the 14 million U.S. children who live in poverty, the proportion who receive food stamps dropped from 94% in 1995 to 84% in 1997. During 1997 alone, the number of children living in poverty decreased by 350,000--but the number receiving food stamps decreased by 1.3 million. GAO's report concludes, ``children's participation in the Food Stamp Program has dropped more sharply than the number of children living in poverty, indicating a growing gap between need and assistance.'' 
   In January 1999, the Urban Institute released the results of a study of former welfare recipients and reported that 33% have to skip or reduce meals due to lack of food. This result is corroborated by independent studies in Wisconsin and South Carolina, and by NETWORK's National Welfare Reform Project. 
   In 1998, surveys of emergency food providers conducted by the U.S. Conference of Mayors and America's Second Harvest independently documented that the need for emergency food services increased 15 to 20% over the previous year, and that almost 40% of emergency food clients live in households in which an adult is employed. 
   The Community Childhood Hunger Identification Project conducted surveys of over 5,000 low-income families between 1992 and 1994--the most comprehensive study of childhood hunger ever undertaken in the U.S.--and found that approximately 4 million children under age 12 were hungry, and 9.6 million were at risk of hunger. 
   Far too many working parents still struggle to feed their families. If our national values cannot persuade us to fight hunger now, while the economy is strong, when will we ever do so? If we need economic reasons to fight hunger in America, we need only consider the effects of hunger on children. 
   Hunger and undernutrition are serious problems for people of all ages, but their effects are particularly damaging to children. Over 14 million children live in households that suffer hunger. Hungry and undernourished children are more likely to become anemic, and to suffer from allergies, asthma, diarrhea, and infections. They are also more likely to have behavioral problems and difficulty in learning. When children arrive at school hungry, they cannot learn. If we do not address this problem, our considerable investments in education and early learning activities will not have the full positive impact that they should. Hunger and under-nutrition injure our greatest national resource--our children. 
   In the past three decades, food stamps have grown into the nation's most comprehensive and trusted way to end hunger. The news that participation in the Food Stamp Program has declined 27% over the past three and a half years would be welcome--if poverty had declined by a comparable amount. But the poverty rate declined by only 7% over this time. Six million more poor people are without food stamps today than in 1995. GAO reported that in 1997 alone, while the number of children living in poverty decreased by just 350,000, the number of children receiving food stamps decreased by 1.3 million. We need to be concerned that the nutritional needs of the other 950,000 children are not being met. 
   Just as the decline in the welfare rolls does not by itself show that people are no longer poor, the decline in Food Stamp rolls in no way means that children and families are no longer hungry. Increasingly, low-income working families are relying on emergency food services. Across the country, demand for emergency food services has increased by as much as 50% in some places. Many food banks find themselves unable to meet the increased requests for help. 
   Only two days ago, the Chicago Sun-Times published an article entitled ``Hunger--a growing concern in suburbs,'' describing increasing demand for emergency food in some of Chicago's most affluent neighborhoods.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I join with my colleagues, Senator FRIST, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator MIKULSKI, Senator MURRAY, Senator DURBIN, and Senator COCHRAN to introduce the ``Clinical Research Enhancement Act of 1999''. 
   Our goal is to enhance support for clinical research, which is central to biomedical research. Major advances in basic biological research are opening doors to new insights into all aspects of medicine. As a result, extraordinary opportunities exist for cutting-edge clinical research to bring breakthroughs in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient. Clinical research is essential for the advancement of scientific knowledge and the development of cures and treatments for disease. In addition, the results of clinical research are incorporated by industry and used to develop new drugs, vaccines, and health care products. These advances in turn strengthen the economy and create jobs. 
   Unfortunately, the number of physicians choosing careers in clinical research is in serious decline. Between 1994 and 1998, the number of physicians applying for first-time NIH grants decreased by 21%. Studies by the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Institutes of Health have all highlighted the significant problems faced by clinical researchers, including lack of grant support, lack of training opportunities, and the heavy debt burden from medical school. 
   The legislation we are introducing today seeks to enhance clinical research by addressing these issues. Our bill will provide research support and training opportunities for clinical researchers at all stages of their careers, as well as the necessary infrastructure to conduct clinical research. 
   The bill establishes several research grant awards. The Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Awards will support clinical investigators in the early phases of their independent careers by providing salary and other support for a period of supervised study. The Mid-Career Investigator Awards in Patient-Oriented Research will provide support for mid-career clinicians, to give them time for clinical research and to act as mentors for beginning investigators. 
   To encourage the training of clinical investigators at various stages in their careers, the bill establishes several programs. The NIH will support intramural and extramural training programs for medical and dental students. For students who want to pursue an advanced degree in clinical research, the bill provides support for both students and institutions to create training programs. For post-graduate education, NIH will support continuing education in such research. 
   Our legislation also creates a clinical research tuition loan repayment program to encourage recruitment of new investigators. Student debt is a major barrier to clinical research. Young physicians graduate from medical school with an average debt of $86,000. Because of the limited financial opportunities in clinical research to repay their large debts, many young physicians are under great pressure to choose more lucrative fields of medical practice. NIH has acknowledged this problem, and has established an intramural loan repayment program to encourage the recruitment of clinical researchers to NIH. Our legislation expands the current program, so that researchers throughout the country will be eligible. 
   A solid infrastructure is essential to any research program. In clinical research, that infrastructure is provided, in part, by the general clinical research centers at academic health centers throughout the country. Our bill provides statutory authority for those clinical research centers. 
   In the past, support for these centers was once provided largely by academic health centers. However, academic health centers today are confronted with heavy competition from non-teaching institutions and are increasingly emphasizing patient care over research to minimize costs. In the face of these changes, clinical researchers have become much more dependent on NIH for infrastructure support. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this important legislation through Congress. Our bill is supported by over 70 biomedical associations and organizations. I commend the American Federation for Medical Research for its support of this legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are all deeply saddened by the sudden loss of our colleague and friend, John Chafee. He was a very special Member of the Senate who embodied the noblest traditions of this institution. He would fight with great vigor and passion for the principles he believed in, trying to persuade colleagues to adopt his point of view. But his devotion to a cause never made him intransigent or unwilling to consider competing ideas. 
   John Chafee had a unique ability to build consensus, and he was forever searching to find common ground across partisan and ideological battlelines. He was a student of history, and he knew that principled compromise was essential if the legislative process is to serve the public interest. He understood that a Congress mired in gridlock could not solve the Nation's problems. 
   He cared far too deeply about the country he served to accept political stalemate. Because of his deep commitment to these abiding principles, he held the trust and respect of colleagues across the political spectrum, and he was often able to find that common ground when others could not. 
   John Chafee's 23 years in the Senate have truly made a difference. The American people enjoy cleaner air and cleaner water because of his tireless and skillful efforts to protect the environment. Foster children are treated more humanely because he assumed the role of their legislative guardian. Poor families who must depend on Medicaid have more secure access to health care because of his concern for their well-being. 
   While John Chafee was a skilled consensus builder, he was never reluctant to speak out on controversial issues. His gentle and gracious manner was accompanied by a very strong will. His political courage was evident on a broad range of issues--from his outspoken advocacy of banning the manufacture and sale of handguns, to his  vigorous defense of abortion rights, to his steadfast support for nuclear weapons control. He was a man of principle, whose strength was evident to all who knew him. I will always remember his extraordinary efforts in 1993 and 1994 to enact health insurance coverage for all Americans. Through that battle, John Chafee never gave up and never gave in. He showed great perseverance under exceptional pressure, and great commitment to a cause he believed in deeply. 
   His ideals and patriotism was shaped as a young soldier in combat on Guadalcanal and Okinawa during World War II and in the Korean conflict. Tom Brokaw has called John Chafee's generation ``The Greatest Generation.'' In his well-known book by that name, Mr. Brokaw wrote:  
   They came of age during the Great Depression and the Second World War and went on to build modern America--men and women whose everyday lives of duty, honor, achievement, and courage gave us the world we have today.  
   John Chafee symbolizes those eloquent words. As a state legislator, as Governor of Rhode Island, as Secretary of the Navy, and as a four-term United States Senator, John Chafee devoted his entire adult life to public service. He gave our nation not only length of service, but service of the highest caliber. He believed in the capacity of government to improve the lives of its citizens, and he worked every day to make it so. His distinguished service will leave a lasting legacy. 
   We all feel his loss today. But it will be felt even more deeply by the Senate as time passes. We will miss his wise counsel, we will miss his political courage, and we will miss his extraordinary ability to build bridges across partisan and ideological divides. 
   I extend my deepest sympathy to John's wife, Virginia, and to his children and grandchildren. Our Senate family truly shares your loss.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments of my time under the bill to talk about a subject I am very hopeful we will be able to address in the very near future. It is a subject matter that has been outstanding during the course of this year and that we have still failed to act on, and that is to try to see an increase in the minimum wage for many of the workers in this country. 
   We have seen in more recent times the Congress move ahead to increase its own salary some $4,600 a year. When we increase the minimum wage, it will mean approximately $2,000 to those who are working the hardest at the lower end of the economic ladder but who perform extraordinarily important jobs that are really, in many respects, at the heart of the engine of the American economy today. 
   I think all of us are mindful that we have had the most extraordinary economic boom in the history of our country. But there are those Americans who have been left out and left behind. There is no group of Americans who have been more disadvantaged than those who are working at the minimum wage level. That is why I was very hopeful we would see fit to address this issue this year because we find that those minimum wage workers are falling further and further behind. 
   I want to remind our colleagues about what has happened on the issue of job growth because the most familiar argument we have in opposition to the minimum wage is that it will somehow dampen the increase in jobs and, secondly, it will add to the rate of inflation. 
   Let's look at what has happened in the most recent times. This chart goes from 1995 up through 1999 and it indicates when the Senate and the Congress actually increased the minimum wage. We increased the minimum wage to $4.75 in 1996, and still we saw job growth continue through 1996 and 1997. We increased the minimum wage then in 1997 up to $5.15. This was a two-step increase of 50 cents and 40 cents, up to what is now $5.15. 
   There were those who warned the Senate of the United States that if we saw this kind of increase, we would lose anywhere from 200,000 to 400,000 or 500,000 jobs in the job market. But what we have seen is a continuation of the expansion of the job market, where we find it going up and up until September of 1999. Past increases in the minimum wage have not meant the loss of jobs. 
   Secondly, if we look at this chart, this is the employment rate. Another way of looking at the issue of jobs is the employment in our country with the increase in the minimum wage. The unemployment rate is at historic lows after a minimum wage increase. On the two steps here, if we look, we find that we went from almost 5.5 percent unemployment, and then in September of 1997 we were just below 5 percent. Since that time, it has continued to decline. So we have seen an expansion of the growth rate and a decline in overall unemployment in this country. 
   Well, you could say there must have been some impact in terms of the rate of inflation. But what we have seen, and as we know, is if you have an increase in productivity and the rise in productivity exceeds the increase in the payment, you don't get the rates of inflation. That is what we have seen. 
   According to labor statistics, we have seen what is represented by this blue line on the chart--an increase in productivity for American workers over the period from 1957 to 1959, up to 1998. This is the annual productivity increase. We have seen a significant increase in the productivity. 
   If we look at what has been the impact of the real minimum wage, the kind of decline here, now the spread between productivity and the purchasing power of the minimum wage is at one of its greatest since the enactment of the increase in the minimum wage. Productivity is up, and we should see an increase in terms of the wages for those workers. 
   If we look at what has happened in terms of the real value of the minimum wage, we see that in 1968 it would be worth $7.49. If we had the minimum wage today in purchasing power of what it was in 1968, it would be $7.49. This is what has happened in terms of real dollars. 
   We are now at this level of $5.15 an hour. Without this increase, it will drop down to $4.80, almost back to where it was at the time we saw the very modest increase 4 years ago. Even with the increase, it would put the real value at $5.73. With two 50-cent increases over the next 2 yours, the purchasing power would still be only $5.73. We are always playing catchup with the millions of American workers who receive the minimum wage. 
   We are delighted to debate these issues with those who continue to give the old, worn-out, tired arguments in opposition: that raising the minimum wage will mean loss of jobs and that it is going to add to inflation. We are glad to debate those issues. But we are being denied by the Republican leadership the ability to consider an increase in the minimum wage. 
   This is a Business Week editorial, May 17, 1999. It is not a Democrat journal. It is not a voice for the Democratic Party. Of course, years ago when we had the increases in the minimum wage, we had bipartisanship. It has been only in recent times when it has become a partisan issue. 
   As Business Week points out,  
   Old myths die hard. Old economic theories die even harder ..... higher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, higher minimum wages raise income, not unemployment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in reading that particular article, you will see that they make the point that the money that is actually used or actually received by minimum wage workers is spent and adds to the economy. 
   Take a State such as Oregon, that has the highest minimum wage in the country. Since Oregon went to a higher minimum wage more people are working, because it brought people who work back into the labor market because they were able to provide meaningful income to themselves and to their families. It provided an additional boost to the economy. 
   That concept has been supported by the Card and Krueger studies that have been referred to in other debates on the minimum wage. 
   Raising the minimum wage is an issue of fundamental and basic fairness, fairness and justice for men and women who are working at the lower economic rungs of the economic ladder. These are people working as assistants to school teachers in many of the schools across the country. These are people who are working as assistants in nursing homes that are looking after our parents and grandparents. These are men and women working in the great buildings in our major cities cleaning up after long days. These buildings effectively would not be functioning unless people were willing to provide that kind of work. 
   This issue, as I have said many times, is a women's issue because the majority of individuals will benefit from increasing the minimum wage are women. This is an issue of civil rights because one-third of minimum wage workers are men and women of color. This is a children's issue because more than 80 percent of families earing the minimum age are headed by women. Providing for the children in these families is directly related to the incomes that people have, and many have not just one job but the two jobs held down by many minimum wage workers who are heads of households. 
   We hear a great deal about family values. How are parents going to be able to spend their time with their children when they are out there working on two different jobs trying to put food on the table, a roof over their heads, and trying to clothe their children? 
   It is amazing to me when we have this greatest economic boom in the history of this country, this body is going to be begrudging to men and women who work hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, and who value work. How many speeches did we hear on the other side of the aisle that we honor work, and we want them to go out and work? People are out there working, and you refuse to give them the kind of income they need so that they can work in dignity and not live in poverty. 
   I know we have a lot of important pieces of legislation. This isn't a very complicated issue. Every Member in this body knows these issues. Everybody knows this issue. We are not talking about a complicated policy question. It is just a question of whether we are prepared to stand up and speak for those individuals who have fallen further behind economically than any other group--any other group in our society. They are the minimum wage workers. They haven't even been able to maintain the purchasing power of their wages, they have fallen further and further behind and continue to do so. 
   With all respect to all the other items we have in the Senate in terms of public policy questions, certainly the issue of fairness to our fellow citizens is something the American people understand. 
   The obstinacy of the Republican leadership in refusing to permit a limited period of time for us to vote on this issue, I think, is a real tragedy for these families. It certainly is. But they have refused and refused and refused with these tired, old arguments. We cannot get this issue on the agenda. They say we are the majority and we will set the agenda. 
   Let us have an opportunity to vote on those issues. 
   We saw our colleagues on the other side of the aisle say: Well, all right; if we are going to find an increase in the minimum wage for 2 years, we are going to require $35 billion in unpaid tax breaks that are going to swell to $100 billion over ten years. 
   If you want to look after the working poor, Senators, they say, you are going to have to provide $100 billion in tax breaks--not related to small businesses, not related to minimum wage individuals, but to the highest paid 10 percent of taxpayers in this country who will get over 90% of the benefit from those tax breaks. 
   Still we can't even have a chance to debate, they refuse us the time even to debate that. They ought to be ashamed of themselves. 
   The last time we provided an increase in the minimum wage was the first time we added all the tax goodies. Now the Republican leadership understands they have a train coming along the tracks, and they are piling up and piling up. 
   They may consider doing $1 over 3 years. 
   We have already delayed a year--2 years now. They refused to let us bring up the issue up last year, and they are refusing to let us bring it up this year. They want to spread it out three more years. That won't even keep up in terms of inflation for those working families. And to be able to do even that, you have to tag on $100 billion over a 10-year period of tax goodies, unpaid for. 
   If these individuals end up contributing and paying taxes, they will be paying some of their taxes to try to offset the increase that the Republican leadership wants in these tax breaks. 
   We may see another hour that goes by without facing the minimum wage issue. We may see another day that goes by without facing the minimum wage issue. But I will tell you, it is inevitable that we will one way or the other bring these measures to the attention of the Senate and try to get accountability. 
   How many times do we have to hear about accountability on the other side of the aisle? We want accountability. We want accountability for this. We want accountability for that. We want accountability for everything except being willing to vote up or down on the increase in the minimum wage. Yet they were quite prepared to vote themselves--all of the Senate, and the House of Representatives--a $4,600 raise. But they won't even permit a vote on the Senate floor on an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Mr. President, maybe that goes over well someplace. But it doesn't seem to me that it will go over well with the American people. We intend to continue to press this issue. 
   Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the National Security Archives recently released an additional selection of declassified documents from the State Department, Defense Department, and the CIA on U.S. relations with Chile between 1970 and 1973, when the democratically-elected government of President Allende was overthrown by General Pinochet. The release of these documents is part of the Administration's ongoing ``Chile Declassification Project,'' an effort begun following the arrest of General Pinochet last year. According to the President's directive, U.S. national security agencies are directed to ``review for release *.*.* all documents that shed light on human rights abuses, terrorism, and other acts of political violence during and prior to the Pinochet era in Chile.''

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to commend City Year, a community service program which began eleven years ago in Boston. This landmark program became the prototype for AmeriCorps, which celebrates its own 5th anniversary this week. 
   City Year has an impressive history of working closely with Boston's Mayor Menino to support his work in developing youth leadership, protecting public health, and building stronger local communities. City Year also works closely with the Boston Superintendent of Schools, Tom Payzant, and other educational leaders to develop innovative curriculum-based service learning projects. City Year has also engaged area business in supporting its efforts, so that each year they have been able to increase its membership and its effectiveness. 
   Today, City Year organizations are found in eleven cities across the country. Each local corps is dedicated to offering 17-24 year olds a challenging year of full-time service, leadership development and community involvement. The founders of City Year--Michael Brown and Alan Khazei--has a vision that individuals working together could solve almost any problem. My brothers, President Kennedy and Senator Robert Kennedy, shared that vision. Today, that spirit of idealism is transforming communities across the country and inspiring thousands of young men and women to become involved in helping others.

It is the most important piece of legislation affecting the disabled in this country. We have passed the legislation 99-0. It has been in the House of Representatives for several months. I hope at the time we are announcing we are going to appoint conferees, we would have at least some indication from the leadership as to when we are going to get to conference. I know millions of disabled Americans across this country will want to know what the intention of the leadership is on this legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the fifth time in the past two years, the Republican leadership has chosen to debate and vote on legislation that President Clinton has vetoed twice and that numerous courts have ruled unconstitutional. No matter how often the Senate votes, the facts will remain the same. This bill is unconstitutional--it's a violation of the Supreme Court's decisions in Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey, and the Senate should oppose it. 
   The Roe and Casey decisions prohibit Congress from imposing an ``undue burden'' on a woman's constitutional right to choose to have an abortion at any time up to the point where the developing fetus reaches the stage of viability. Congress can constitutionally limit abortions after the stage of viability, as long as the limitations contain exceptions to protect the life and the health of the woman. 
   This bill fails that constitutional test in two clear ways. It clearly imposes an undue burden on a woman's constitutional right to an abortion in cases before viability. In cases after viability, it clearly does not contain the constitutionally required exception to protect the mother's health. 
   Supporters of this legislation are flagrantly defying these constitutional requirements, and they know it. Similar laws have been challenged in 21 of the 30 states where they have been passed, and the results are clear. In 20 states, laws have been blocked or severely limited by the courts or by state legal action. Eighteen courts have issued temporary or permanent injunctions preventing the laws from taking effect because of constitutional defects. One court and one attorney general have limited enforcement of the law. Of the states where the laws have been blocked, six have statutes identical to the Santorum bill. 
   Recently, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that laws in three states under its jurisdiction--Arkansas, Iowa, and Nebraska--were unconstitutional. In the opinion on the Nebraska law, the court specifically held that, ``Under controlling precedents laid down by the Supreme Court, [the] prohibition places an undue burden on the right of women to choose whether to have an abortion.'' 
   The conclusion is obvious. The supporters of the Santorum bill would rather have an issue than a law. They have rejected compromise after compromise. They have ignored President Clinton's plea to add an exemption for ``the small number of compelling cases where selection of the procedure, in the medical judgment of the attending physician, was necessary to preserve the life of the woman or avert serious adverse consequences to her health.'' 
   In doing so, the Republican leadership has chosen to ignore the Constitution. They are also ignoring the large number of medical professionals who oppose this legislation, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Nurses Association, and the American Medical Women's Association. The American Medical Association--which once endorsed the bill--no longer supports it. The AMA withdrew its support after independent investigators hired by the organization concluded that, ``rather than focusing on its role as steward for the profession and the public health ..... the board ..... lost sight of its responsibility for making decisions which, first and foremost, benefit the patient and protect the physician-patient relationship.'' 
   Most important, in its effort to pass this legislation, the Republican leadership has ignored the tragic situations in which some women find themselves--women like Eileen Sullivan, Erica Fox, Vikki Stella, Tammy Watts, and Viki Wilson. Women like Coreen Costello, who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and told us that she consulted with numerous medical experts and did everything possible to save her child. She later had the procedure that would be banned by this legislation, and, based on that experience, she told the Committee the following:  
   I hope you can put aside your political differences, your positions on abortion, and your party affiliations and just try to remember us. We are the ones who know. We are the families that ache to hold our babies, to love them, to nurture them. We are the families who will forever have a hole in our hearts. ..... please put a stop to this terrible bill. Families like mine are counting on you.  
   For all of these reasons, I oppose the Santorum bill. We should stand with Coreen Costello and others like her, who with their doctors' advice, must make these tragic decisions to protect their lives and their health.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, civil rights is still the unfinished business of America. It is unconscionable that Congress would signal that the Federal Government has no role in combating hate crimes in this country. Yet, that is exactly the signal the Republican leadership has sent by eliminating the Senate-passed provisions on hate crimes from the final report of the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. 
   Since just after the Civil War, Congress has repeatedly recognized the special Federal role in protecting civil rights and preventing discrimination. This Federal responsibility, based on the 14th amendment to the Constitution, is reflected in a large body of Federal civil rights laws, including many criminal law provisions. These laws are aimed at conduct that deprives persons of their rights because of their membership in certain disadvantaged groups. The Federal criminal law, among other prohibitions, bars depriving individuals of housing rights, destroying religious property because of religious bias, and committing violent acts because of racial hatred. 
   The point of these laws is not to protect only certain people from violence--we all deserve to be protected. The point is to recognize this special Federal responsibility to stop especially vicious forms of discrimination, and penalize it with the full force of Federal law. 
   Hate crimes legislation recognizes that violence based on deep-seated prejudice, like all forms of discrimination, inflicts an especially serious injury on society. These crimes can divide whole nations along racial, religious and other lines, as are seen too often in countries throughout the world. These crimes send a poisonous message that the majority in society feels free to oppress the minority. The strongest antidote to that unacceptable poison is for the majority to speak out strongly, and insist that these flagrant acts of violent bigotry will not be tolerated. That is why it is essential for hate crimes legislation to be endorsed by our nation and our communities at every level--Federal, State, and local. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999, that so many of us support, is bipartisan. It is endorsed by a broad range of religious, civil rights and law enforcement organizations. It takes two needed steps. It strengthens current laws against crimes based on race, religion, or national origin. And it adds gender, sexual orientation, and disability to the protections in current law.  
   Earlier this year, the Senate added these important provisions to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. But last Monday evening, the Senate-House conferees approved a conference report that does not contain the hate crimes provision. Behind closed doors, the conferees dropped the provisions. As a result, Congress is now MIA--missing in action on this basic issue of tolerance and justice and civil rights in our society. 
   Clearly, we must find a way to act on this important issue before the session ends. The Federal Government should be doing all it can to halt these vicious crimes that shock the conscience of the nation. State and local governments are doing their part to prevent hate crimes, and so must Congress.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr President, the Indonesian Parliament acted wisely today in ratifying the overwhelming vote of the East Timorese people for independence and recognizing the right of self-determination for these people. 
   The militias that have terrorized the East Timorese people since the historic August 30 referendum should end their campaign of violence. From their bases in West Timor, the militias have continued to act with impunity against  East Timorese refugees in camps in West Timor. Through intimidation tactics, they have undermined the efforts of international humanitarian agencies to provide assistance and to facilitate repatriation. 
   Many of us have been alarmed by persistent reports that the Indonesian military has continued to aid and abet the militias. On October 11, the commander of the international peacekeeping force in East Timor demanded a formal explanation from the Indonesian government as to whether any Indonesian soldiers or police officers were involved in a militia attack against the international peacekeepers on October 10. Officials from the peacekeeping force said that uniformed soldiers and police officers had escorted the militias and did nothing as militia members opened fire on the peacekeepers. I urge the Indonesian military and security forces to sever all links with the militias. 
   I welcome the establishment by the United Nations Human Rights Commission of a commission of inquiry to investigate the atrocities that occurred in East Timor following President Habibie's decision to hold the referendum on East Timor's status. The Indonesian government must end collaboration with the militias if this investigation of the atrocities is to be credible. 
   In the coming weeks, the United States should do all it can to see that the transition to independence is accomplished peacefully and that those responsible for atrocities are brought to justice.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will put in the RECORD the excellent summaries of total contributions according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That is a nonpartisan watchdog group. We can talk about numbers here and numbers there. However, I think it is important for the RECORD that we have summaries from the nonpartisan groups that have assessed the contributions by unions and corporations--hard money/soft money. As the Senator from Nevada, the Senator from Wisconsin, and others have pointed out, the ratio is about 11 to 1. You can slice it any way you want but the fact remains--it is basically the difference between the contributions, according to nonpartisan groups. Others have other ways of adding and subtracting figures; all well and good. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD the summary provided by the Center for Responsive Politics because I think it is helpful to have the findings of those who have no ax to grind.

   Mr. KENNEDY. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, in 1996, $60 million; 1994, $48 million; 1992, $48 million. On the corporations, $677 million in 1996; $492 million in 1994; and $447 million in 1992. That is total contributions. It works out to a ratio of 11 to 1 in 1996, 10 to 1 in 1994, and 9 to 1 in 1992.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In 1996, the unions spent $50 million; the corporations, $501 million. So we are talking 1997, 1998, 1999. That figure may still be consistent with the 10 to 1 or 11 to 1 figure. I don't find that there would be any inconsistency if that were the figure being spent. 
   I was interested to hear our good friend from Idaho, Senator CRAIG, talking about people worrying at the dinner table about these issues. He mentioned people are much more concerned about what is happening down the street or near the school with regard to a shooting incident. I say that is right. And it is very interesting that I was not able to get a report, as a member of the conference committee on the juvenile violence act, that deals with the availability and the accessibility of  guns to children in our society and of the criminal element. That has been locked up now for some 6 weeks. I don't think anyone on this floor is prepared to say the National Rifle Association doesn't have something to do with that. 
   He talked about taxes--people are concerned about taxes. People are concerned about tax loopholes as well. How do the tax loopholes get into the Internal Revenue budget? We have $4 trillion of what are called tax expenditures in the IRS at the present time. That is the fastest growing expenditure we have in the Federal budget, the expansion of tax expenditures, tax loopholes. We don't have any debate on it. Many of us have said, let's do for tax expenditures what we do for direct expenditures--when we are cutting back on education and health care; let what is good for the goose be good for the gander. Do you think you can get those issues raised here on the floor of the Senate? Of course not. We all understand why. 
   It is kind of interesting that those who have been the strongest spokespersons against this proposal also raise incidents in terms of what is on people's minds. It comes back, in many instances, to what the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have talked about. 
   This country has waited long enough for campaign finance reform. The current system is shameful, benefiting only the big corporations and lobbyists who have seemingly bottomless barrels of money to spend, while the voice of average citizens goes unheard in the special interest din. 
   I commend Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD for their consistent leadership on this issue. Their commitment to reform gives us an opportunity to join the House of Representatives and cleanse our campaign financing system of special interest abuses. The House took effective action earlier this year, transcending partisan differences to adopt long overdue reforms. The large margin by which the Shays-Meehan bill passed, 252 to 177, demonstrates that the public feels strongly about the need for reform. The Senate should act now to support the McCain-Feingold proposal and give the country clean elections in the years to come. 
   Effective reform must include a ban on soft money. The McCain-Feingold bill does just that. Soft money contributions are increasing at alarming rates, while hard money contributions are barely rising. In the 1992 Presidential election cycle, both parties raised a total of $86 million in soft money. Compare this to the $224 million total raised in the 1998 election cycle--a 150-percent increase of soft money contributions in only 6 years. A more recent survey shows figures from January to June 1999, soft money contributions totaled $46.2 million--and $30.1 million of that total was given by corporations and business interests. In the 1996 elections, the consumer credit industry alone gave $5.5 million in soft money. True reform means closing this flagrant loophole that allows so many special interests to bypass legal limits on giving money directly to candidates. Until we close it the special interests will continue to strengthen their hold on the political process. 
   The House reforms also ended other serious abuses in campaign financing. It ends the sham of the so-called issue ads loophole, which permits special interests to spend big money on campaign advertising obviously designed to support a candidate, as long as the ads do not specifically call for the candidate's election. The House bill treats these ads as the campaign ads they really are, and rightly subjects them to regulation under the campaign finance laws. 
   The Senate should learn from the House, and join in ending these abuses that make a mockery of our election laws. Instead, the Senate Republican leadership is bent on preserving the status quo. They oppose campaign finance reform because they do not want to lose the support they currently receive from their special interest friends. 
   Our Republican friends say they want to help working families--but their support of the Paycheck Protection Act demonstrates their antilabor bias, because that measure is designed to silence the voice of the American workers and labor unions in the political process. It is revenge, not reform--revenge for the extraordinary efforts by the labor movement in the 1996 and 1998 election campaigns. It imposes a gag rule on American workers, and it should be defeated. 
   The act's supporters claim they are concerned about union members' right to choose whether and how to participate in the political process. But we know better. The Paycheck Protection Act should really be called the Paycheck Destruction Act. It is part of a coordinated national antilabor campaign to lock American workers and their unions out of politics. 
   And who is behind this campaign? It is not the workers, unhappy with the use of their union dues for political purposes. It is businesses and their allies, anxious to reduce the role of labor. It is organizations like Americans for Tax Reform, which supports Social Security privatization, vouchers for private schools, and huge tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. It is think tanks such as the American Legislative Exchange Council and the National Center for Policy Analysis, which support so-called right-to-work laws, the TEAM act, the flat tax, private school vouchers, medical savings accounts, and other antiworker legislation. And it is right-wing Republicans in Congress and in the states. 
   We know that unions and their members are among the most effective voices in the political process. They support raising the minimum wage, protecting Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, improving education, and ensuring safety and health on the job. 
   Silencing these voices of working families will make it easier for those with antiworker agenda to prevail. Sponsors of this legislation support prevatizing Social Security. They favor private school vouchers instead of a healthy public school system. They would undermine occupational safety and health laws, end the 40-hour work week and permit sham, company-dominated unions. They oppose the Family and Medical Leave Act. They want to restrict Medicare eligibility and deny millions of workers an increase in the minimum wage. They are not trying to help working Americans. To the contrary--they are trying to silence the workers' participation in the political process so they can implement an agenda that workers strongly oppose. 
   Campaign abuses abandon other issues as well. The tobacco industry has made extensive PAC and soft money contributions, and the Senate Republican leadership has rejected much needed antitobacco legislation. The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids reports that in the last 10 years, Senators who voted consistently against tobacco reform legislation took far more money from the industry--four times more--than those who supported the bill. 
   The dabate on the Patients' Bill of Rights is another vivid example of the obstructionist influence of industries and special interests. Since 1997, the health insurance industry has been making huge political contributions to Republicans. Blue Cross/Blue Shield and its state affiliates made $1 million in contributions in the 1997-1998 cycle, with four out of every five dollars going to Republicans. Managed care PACs--including the American Association of Health Plans, the Health Insurance Association of America, and Blue Cross/Blue Shield--gave $77,250 to leadership political action committees. According to the Center on Responsive Politics, all but $1,500 went to the Republican majority. 
   These contributions bought the industry at least 2 years worth of stall and delay tactics in Congress. And, when the Senate finally passed legislation this year, it was not what patients needed, but an industry bill that places HMO profits ahead of patients' health. 
   Contributions from the credit card and banking industries have had a similar effect on the bankruptcy reform debate. Master Card, Visa, and others doubled, tripled, or even quadrupled their spending to encourage passage of the bill they wanted. Visa increased its 1998 lobbying to $3.6 million from $900,000 in 1997. Master Card wasn't far behind--their lobbying expenses rose from $430,000 in 1997 to $1.8 million in 1998. In the 1997-1998 election cycle, commercial banks and financial service companies gave $20.8 million in large individual contributions, PAC money and soft money to candidates--  and two-thirds of that total went to Republicans. The result? Legislation that House Committee Chairman HENRY HYDE described as ``pages and pages and pages of advantages [for] the creditor community *.*.*'' 
   Honest campaign finance reform does not include phony proposals that seek to eliminate political expression by average families. It does include eliminating the flagrant abuses that enable big corporations and special interests to tilt the election process in their favor. 
   Real reform means giving elections back to the people and creating a level playing field on which all voters are equal, regardless of their income. Broad campaign finance reform is within the Senate's reach. We should follow the example set for us by the House. The greatest gift the Senate can give to the American people is clean elections. 
   Over the course of debate, we have learned what the other side is against. We rarely learn what they are for. Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD have laid out something I think we should be for. In the next few days, hopefully, the American people will speak through their representatives and support those efforts. 
   One of the provisions we heard a good deal about, again from my friend from Idaho, was the whole question about workers and whether they have control over their dues. Of course, what exists in the McCain-Feingold provision is an incorporation of the Beck decision, which permits workers to check off, at the time they pay their dues, that they are not interested in the political process. 
   Today, evidently, they want something that is going to be harsher on working men and women. Those forces that are pressing to restrict the voice of working men and women are actually the major interest groups that are strongly opposed to the agenda of working families, whether it has been an increase in the minimum wage, whether it has been HMO reforms, whether it has been education and increasing the education budget. These groups are opposed to workers participating because, in many instances, the workers have been the ones to try to advance these interests on our national agenda. 
   I think it is important. I don't know how many of us are getting the communications from workers on these particular issues. Yet we have seen what has happened over this past year, whether it has been on the HMO reform--the change in expenditures by the insurance companies at the time when this body was debating whether doctors are going to be the ones who are going to make the decisions on health care for the particular patients, rather than the accountants and insurance industry. Nobody could deny when we were debating those issues that the contributions and expenditures by the insurance companies skyrocketed dramatically, escalated significantly. This is the kind of thing that we are talking about in terms of the impact that campaign finance reform can have.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we reach the end of this session of Congress, it's essential that we act on the Patients' Bill of Rights before we adjourn. In passing the Norwood-Dingell bill two weeks ago, a solid, bipartisan majority of the House of Representatives voted for strong protections for patients against abuses by HMOs. Despite an extraordinary lobbying and disinformation campaign by the health insurance industry, the House approved the bill by a majority of 275-151. Sixty-eight Republicans as well as almost every Democrat in the House stood up for patients and stood firm against industry pressure. 
   Last Friday, the Senate appointed its conferees. Speaker HASTERT has said that the House will appoint its conferees this week. Prompt action on strong reforms is clearly within our grasp. But a series of recent statements and actions provide ominous signs that the insurance industry and its friends in the Republican leadership are at it again. Their emerging strategy seems once again to be to delay and deny the relief that American families need and that the House overwhelmingly approved. 
   The House vote was a major milestone toward enacting needed reform. It came after the Senate passed legislation with only sham protections by a narrow, partisan majority. 
   It came after years of delay and denial by the Republican leadership in both Houses of Congress, working hand-in-hand with the health insurance companies and HMOs to block reform. 
   Patients and doctors won a clear victory in the House. But now, the insurance industry and their allies in the House and the Senate Republican leadership are once again mobilizing to deny patients and doctors the protections they deserve. The ink is barely dry on the dramatic House vote, and opponents of reform are already talking about a new strategy of delay and denial--a strategy once again to put HMO profits first and patient protections last. 
   The first part of this emerging strategy is to delay the work of the House-Senate conference committee as long as possible. A precondition for appointing conferees and beginning the conference is formal transmission of the House-passed bill to the Senate. That process normally takes a day or two at most. 
   In fact, of 252 bills passed by the House in this Congress, the overwhelmingly majority were delivered to the Senate the day they were passed or the day after they were passed. Except for a few bills passed just before the beginning of a long recess, every bill passed by the House had been received by the Senate by the sixth day after passage. Yet, on the seventh day after the passage of the Norwood-Dingell bill, the legislation was still being held in the House of Representatives. 
   Only after the release of a CRS study documenting the extraordinary delay in transmission of the legislation was the bill forwarded to the Senate and Senate conferees appointed. 
   According to the Los Angeles Times, Senator LOTT's response to passage of the House bill was that ``House-Senate conferences on other legislation have a higher priority and that resolving differences on this bill would take some time.''' According to the Baltimore Sun, Senator LOTT also indicated that Congress might not have time to work out the differences and approve a final bill before it adjourns for the year. According to the New York Times, aides to Senator NICKLES said that ``the conference committee will probably not begin serious work until early next year.'' And just this past Friday, CongressDaily reported that ``a Senate GOP aide said ..... Republicans do not plan to start the conference before the end of this year's session, despite the appointment of conferees.'' 
   Some Republicans are already beginning to lay the groundwork for a failed conference. Comparing the Senate and House bills, Congressman BILL THOMAS said, ``You don't see many cross-breeds between Chihuahuas and Great Danes walking around.'' 
   And, of course, the fingerprints of Republican-industry collaboration are there to see for anyone who cares to look. As Bruce Josten of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce put it, ``To see nothing come out of the conference is my hope. The best outcome is no outcome.'' 
   Even if the strategy of delay and denial fails, the Republican leadership once again has an alternative to try to weaken the House bill as much as possible. 
   As the Baltimore Sun reported, ``House Majority Whip TOM DELAY suggested that the Republican-dominated House conference would not fight vigorously for the House-approved measure in the Conference Committee.'' Mr. DELAY said, ``Remember who controls the conference: the Speaker of the House.''  
   A conference that produces legislation that looks like the Senate Republican bill would break faith with the American people, make a mockery of the overwhelming vote in the House of Representatives, and cause unnecessary suffering for millions of patients. 
   That is why more than 300 groups representing patients, doctors, nurses, and other caregivers, and families support the Norwood-Dingell bill, but only the insurance industry supports the Senate proposal. 
   For every patient right in the Senate Republican bill, there is an industry loophole. If the truth in labeling law applied to legislation, every page of the bill would flunk the test, because every promise of patient protection comes with loopholes to protect HMOs and health insurers. The promise to patients is always broken. 
   At its most basic level, the decision before Congress is whether critical medical decisions will be made by doctors and patients, or HMO accountants. 
   It is time to protect families against abuses by a faceless insurance bureaucracy that can rob average citizens of their savings and their peace of mind, and often their health and their very lives. 
   For the millions of Americans who rely on health insurance to protect them and their loved ones when serious illness strikes, the Norwood-Dingell bill is a matter of life and death, and deserves to be passed by Congress. 
   Every day we delay in passing these reforms means that more patients will suffer and die. Congress has an obligation to act and to act now. 
   The abuses that take place every day should have no place in American medicine. Every doctor knows it. Every nurse knows it. Every patient knows it. The American people know it--and it is time the Republican leadership heeded their views. 
   The first test of the sincerity of the Republican leadership will come this week when the House conferees are appointed. Will a majority of the House conferees come from those who supported the Norwood-Dingell bill, not just on final passage, but on the critical vote to replace it with the leadership-backed alternative? 
   The second test will come in the conference itself. The danger is that the process will go into slow motion so that nothing happens until Congress adjourns for this session. There is ample time for genuine bipartisan negotiations to produce a strong, bipartisan bill that Congress can pass and the President can sign before the session ends. 
   The issues are well-known. There is no need for the conference to be time-consuming--no need unless the objective is to pass a watered down bill, or nothing at all. The Norwood-Dingell bill received overwhelming bipartisan support in the House of Representatives. The Senate conferees should do the right thing and simply accept that bill. 
   The choice is clear. Prompt action to protect patients and their families--or more delay and denial. Those who profit from the status quo have delayed action long enough. It is time for Congress to provide every family the protection they deserve. 
   Mr. President, Friday, we had the appointment of the conferees to represent the Senate with the House of Representatives on the HMO bill, the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation. 
   We want to let the Senate know we are prepared to meet today, tomorrow, the next day, and every single day to try to get a resolution of that issue because we know that every single day we do not act and have strong legislation, like the House of Representatives, American families are endangered and Americans are being hurt. That is wrong. We have the chance to act. On our side of the aisle, we are prepared to take action. We are prepared to meet. We believe this is one of the most important efforts we will have in this Congress. 
   We will continue to challenge our colleagues on the other side to move ahead and have a conference. We have debated these issues. We have had a long time to debate them. We have had extensive debates in committee and for over a week on the floor of the Senate. 
   Let's get about protecting the American citizens on that Patients' Bill of Rights--letting doctors make decisions rather than accountants. Every day, as I mentioned, that we fail to do so, we fail to protect American families. We want to go about America's business and families' business on health care. We are prepared to meet in conference now and every day in the future. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, violent acts of bigotry based on race, religion, ethnic background, sexual orientation, gender, and disability continue to plague the nation. These vicious crimes are a national disgrace and an attack on everything this country stands for, and it is essential for Congress to act against them. 
   Earlier this year, the Senate added important provisions to combat hate crimes to the Commerce-Justice-State Appropriations Act. This afternoon, Senate-House conferees will meet to vote on a conference report that does not contain the hate crimes provision. Behind closed doors, the conferees have tentatively decided to drop the provision, and I urge them to reconsider. It is essential for Congress to take a stand against bigotry, and do all we can to end these modern-day lynchings that continue to occur in communities across the country. 
   Many of us are aware of the most highly-publicized incidents, especially the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, Texas, and Matthew Shepard in Laramie, Wyoming. But these two killings are just the tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have occurred this year: 
   January 14, 1999, El Dorado, California--Thomas Gary, 38, died after being run over by a truck and shot with a shotgun. The assailant claimed that Mr. Gary had made a pass at him. 
   January 17, 1999, Texas City, Texas--Two black gay men, Laaron Morris and Kevin Tryals, were shot to death and one of the men was left inside a burning car. 
   February 7, 1999, Miami, Florida--Three young women stalked, beat and stabbed a gay man while yelling anti-gay epithets. 
   February 19, 1999, Sylacauga, Alabama--Billy Jack Gaither, a gay man, was abducted, beaten to death with an ax handle, and set on fire on burning tires in a remote area. 
   February 24, 1999, Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.--A black woman, Jody-Gaye Bailey, died after being shot in the head by a self-proclaimed skinhead. Minutes before the shooting the perpetrator reportedly boasted of wanting to go out and kill a black person. Bailey and her boyfriend, who is Caucasian, were stopped at a red light when the killer fired at Bailey seven times. The boyfriend was uninjured. 
   February 1999, Yosemite National Park, California--An individual charged with the murder of four women--one of whom was a 16-year old girl--in Yosemite National Park told police investigators that he had fantasized about killing women for three decades. 
   March 1, 1999, Richmond, Virginia--A gay, homeless man was killed and his severed head was left atop a footbridge in James River Park near a popular meeting place for gay men. 
   May 1999, Kenosha, Wisconsin--A 27-year-old man intentionally swerved his car onto a sidewalk to run over two African-American teens. After hitting the two cyclists, he left the scene and kept driving until stopped by police. Eight years earlier the same man rammed his car twice into a stopped van carrying five African-American men and drove away. 
   June 2, 1999, West Palm Beach, Florida--Two teenagers admitted that they beat a gay man, Steven Goedereis, to death on April 27, 1998 because he called one of them ``beautiful.'' 
   June/July 1, 1999, Northern California--Three synagogues in the Sacramento area were destroyed by arson. Two brothers, who have links to an organized hate group, are suspects in the arson as well as the shotgun murders of two gay men in Redding, Calif., Winfield Scott Mowder and Gary Matson. 
   July 4th weekend, 1999, Illinois/Indiana--An indiviudal associated with a racist and anti-Semitic organization, Benjamin Smith, killed an African-American man, Ricky Byrdsong, and wounded six orthodox Jews in Chicago before killing a Korean student, Won-Joon Yoon, in Bloomington, Ind. 
   July 24, 1999, San Diego, California--Hundreds of people were tear-gassed when a military style tear-gas canister was released near the Family Matters group at the San Diego gay pride parade. The 70-person group included small children and babies in strollers. 
   August 10, 1999, Los Angeles, California--A former security guard for a white supremacist organization, Buford O. Furrow, wounded five individuals, including young children, at a Los Angeles Jewish community center, and later killed a Filipino-American postal worker, Joseph Illeto. 
   Clearly, the federal government should be doing more to halt these vicious crimes that shock the conscience of the nation. 
   Dropping the bipartisan Senate provisions from the DJS conference report is a serious mistake. For too long, the federal government has been forced to fight hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. Congress must speak with a united voice against hate-based violence. All Americans deserve to know that the full force of federal law will be available to punish these atrocities. 
   Congress has a responsibility to act this year. The continuing silence of Congress on this festering issue is deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting as if somehow this fundamental issue is just a state and local problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that Congress has been missing in action for so long. I urge the conferees to reconsider their action, and include a strong provision on hate crimes in the conference report. 
   Mr. President, I make these remarks because the timeliness of them is so important. I see my friend and colleague from Oregon, who shares these concerns. Again, we wanted to address this issue, which will be before the conference committee on the State-Justice appropriations this afternoon. We will be faced with this issue in a conference report in these next 2, 3 days. It is regarding the inclusion or exclusion of the hate crimes legislation. 
   We passed hate crimes legislation as part of the State-Justice-Commerce appropriations. It is in conference at a time when this country has been faced with a series of acts that have been violent on the basis of bigotry--based on race, religion, ethnic background,  sexual orientation, gender, and disability. These challenges continue to plague the Nation. These vicious crimes are a national disgrace and an attack on everything for which this country stands. It is essential for Congress to act against them. 
   Just in the very recent times, we have seen the brutal murders of James Byrd in Jasper, TX, and Matthew Shepherd in Wyoming. These two killings are the tip of the iceberg. Many other gruesome acts of hatred have occurred this year. 
   On January 14, Thomas Gary died after being run over by a truck and shot with a shotgun. The assailant claimed that Mr. Gary had made a pass at him. 
   On January 17, 1999, Texas City, TX, two black gay men, Laaron Morris and Kevin Tryals, were shot to death, and one of the men was left inside a burning car. 
   On February 7, 1999, three young women, stalked, beat, and stabbed a gay man while yelling antigay epithets. 
   On February 24, in Fort Lauderdale, a black woman, Jody-Gaye Bailey, died after being shot in the head by a self-proclaimed skinhead. Minutes before the shooting, the perpetrator reportedly boasted of wanting to go out and kill a black person. 
   In February 1999, Yosemite National Park, California, an individual charged with the murder of four women--one of whom was a 16-year-old girl--in Yosemite National Park, told police investigators that he had fantasized about killing women for three decades. 
   The list goes on and on, and that is happening in communities all across the country. This legislation has been taken into consideration. A number of the points have been raised by Members over the last 3, 4 years. The statistics are very clear. This kind of problem is escalating, not decreasing. All we are asking is, in the very selected cases that would qualify under this legislation, that we not deny the Federal Government from participating with the State and local prosecutors in order to be able to solve these problems. These crimes are not just crimes against individuals, they are rooted in bigotry and hatred so deep that they have an important and dramatic and horrific affect upon a community. 
   We will see the opportunity, hopefully, for that Commerce Committee conference this afternoon to vote on these issues. We should at least have a vote on these matters and, hopefully, the Commerce Committee will not disappoint America's march toward justice.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has stated it well and accurately. These kinds of crimes, as I mentioned very briefly, rip at the heart and soul of all Americans. No one could read about these extraordinary acts of violence directed toward specified groups, such as those that took place in Yosemite, where that individual had in his mind one purpose and one purpose only, and that was to kill women. That was it. It wasn't against someone with whom he had a difference. That is the kind of vicious intent we have seen. We have seen that regarding race, religion, and sexual orientation. 
   All we are saying is, in the prosecution of those crimes, we are not going to fight it with one hand behind our backs. We are not going to deny it in the very selective numbers that will be in--I think you are looking at each group, and there are something like maybe 20, 30 cases a year--probably even less--in the testimony of those who represent the Justice Department in any of these areas. But they are so vicious and so horrific that we are going to say we are not going to permit that to take place in this country. 
   We have the opportunity to make a positive commitment in that area in our conference before we leave this year, and we don't want to lose that opportunity. The Senator from Oregon has been a leader on this issue, and our friend and colleague from New York, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator SPECTER have been strong leaders. This has been a bipartisan effort for a long period of time. We don't want to deny the chance of having success.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I express my strong support for the VA/HUD Appropriations Act for FY 2000, which passed the Senate last Friday. I commend Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI for their skilled work on resolving the important issues involved in this legislation. We could not have achieved such an excellent measure without their leadership and commitment. 
   I am pleased that the legislation includes significant new funding allocations for some of HUD's most critical programs. We have promised America's citizens to stand up for their priorities, and this legislation is an important part of keeping that promise. 
   The bill includes an additional 60,000 Section 8 vouchers. These vouchers are critical for struggling families across the country, many of whom pay more than half their income in rent. 
   The bill also restores $70 million for Round II Empowerment Zones. This restoration honors our promise to the communities who have worked hard to build partnerships to revitalize their communities, based upon the promise that they would have HUD resources to leverage the funds they have raised in private-sector investments. The City of Boston and many other communities will benefit from this effort, and I am pleased that we support their initiative with these well-deserved resources. 
   I am also pleased that the Community Builders program is supported in the Act. The program provides a single point of contact with HUD for clients and customers, and streamlines access to HUD resources. With these improvements, HUD will be serving citizens more ably and expeditiously, and the preservation of this important program is an essential part of the legislation. 
   These initiatives offer hope to many distressed communities and low income families who are still left behind in this period of extraordinary economic growth. We must never forget our commitment to safe and affordable housing for our neediest citizens. I commend my colleagues for their skillful work which has led to this major legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the interest of moving this appropriations bill forward, I will withdraw my amendment to increase the funding for the successful GEAR-UP program. However, I urge the conferees to fund this program at $240 million--- $60 million over the Senate bill--so that now needy students can get the support they need to attend college. 
   More than 130,000 students will be denied services if GEAR UP is funded at $180 million rather than at the President's request of $240 million. $154 million is needed just to fully fund continuation grants for this year's grantees. We must uphold our commitment to these students, and extend the opportunity that this program offers to every needy student. 
   This year, 678 applications for both state and local partnerships were received and we were only able to fund 185--only 1 out of 4 applications. We have to do more to help children early so that college is accessible for every child. 
   Many low-income families do not know how to plan for college, often because they have not done it before. We should do more to ensure that schools and communities can provide the academic support, early college awareness activities, and information on financial aid and scholarships so that students and their families can plan for a better future. We must encourage our young people to have high expectations, to stay in school, and to take the necessary courses so that they can succeed in college. We cannot abandon the five-year commitment that we made to these families last year. 
   I commend my colleagues on the appropriations committee for making hard choices between important programs. But, I urge you to give GEAR UP your highest consideration in conference.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this may be one of the most important debates the Senate will have in this recent time. In my view, the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is the single most important step we can take today to reduce the danger of nuclear war. Surely we are in no position to hold a premature vote today or tomorrow on this. 
   After 2 years of irresponsible stonewalling, the Senate has finally begun a serious debate on this treaty. This debate should be the beginning--not the end--of a more extensive and thoughtful discussion of this extremely important issue. The stakes involved in whether to ratify or reject this treaty are clear. Our decision will reverberate throughout the world, and could very well determine the future of international nuclear weapons proliferation for years to come. 
   We have a unique opportunity to help end nuclear testing once and for all. The United States is the world's premiere nuclear power. The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty locks us into that position. No other nations have the capability to assure that their nuclear arsenals are safe and reliable without testing. We have that capability now, and the prospects are excellent that we can retain that capability in the future. 
   Over the past 40 years, we have conducted over 1,000 nuclear tests. We currently have extensive data available to us from these tests--data that would provide us with an inherent advantage under the Treaty. As Hans A. Bethe, the Nobel Prize winning physicist and former Director of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos Laboratory, stated in an October 3 letter to President Clinton,  
   Every thinking person should realize that this treaty is uniquely in favor of the United States. We have a substantial lead in atomic weapons technology over all other countries. We have tested weapons of all sizes and shapes suitable for military purposes. We have no interest in and no need for further development through testing. Other existing nuclear powers would need tests to make up this technological gap. And even more importantly, a test ban would make it essentially impossible for new nuclear powers to emerge. 
   As the foremost nuclear power, other nations look to us for international leadership. We led the negotiations for this treaty. We were the first of the declared nuclear powers to sign the Treaty. Yet, now, because of our inaction and irresponsibility, we have made it necessary for the leaders of three of our closest allies to plead with us not to defeat the Treaty. 
   These three leaders--Prime Minister Chirac of France, Prime Minister Blair of Britain, and Chancellor Schroeder of Germany--wrote in an OpEd article in the New York Times last Friday that, ``Failure to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will be a failure in our struggle against proliferation. The stabilizing effect of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, extended in 1995, would be undermined. Disarmament negotiations would suffer.'' They also go on to say that, ``Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental divergence within NATO.'' 
   Our relationship with our most valuable allies is on the line. It would be the height of irresponsibility for the United States Senate to send the world a message that we don't care if other nations test nuclear weapons, or develop their own nuclear arsenals. Surely, the risks of nuclear proliferation are too great for us to send a message like that. 
   The United States stopped conducting nuclear tests in 1992. Doing all we can to see that other nations follow suit is critical for our national security. Russia and China have both indicated that they are prepared to ratify the Treaty if the U.S. ratifies it. If the Senate fails to ratify it, the likely result is a dangerous new spiral of nuclear testing and nuclear proliferation. 
   Many of my colleagues have spoken about the fact that there is no guarantee about this Treaty. I argue that there is one guarantee--if we fail to ratify the Treaty, the consequences are grave, and could be catastrophic for our country and for all nations. 
   Last week, we held hearings in the Armed Services Committee on the Treaty, and I commend the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of that Committee for taking the lead on this extremely important issue. We listened to expert witnesses on both sides of the aisle, as they presented testimony on the Treaty and the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   General Shelton, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified that it was the unanimous conclusion of all of the Joint Chiefs, that the Treaty is in our national interest. General Shelton said, ``The CTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In short, the world will be a safer place with the treaty than without it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the CTBT.'' 
   Some of my colleagues have referred to the Treaty as ``unilateral disarmament.'' This characterization is grossly inaccurate, both in policy and in practice. A key element of our adherence to the Treaty, with the Administration's safeguards, is the Stockpile Stewardship Program.  
   Last Thursday, in the Armed Services Committee, each of the directors of our nuclear labs testified about that program. John Browne, the director of Los Alamos National Laboratory, said, ``Through the Stockpile Stewardship program, we intend to demonstrate a technical excellence in weapons-relevant science and engineering that will project confidence in our nuclear capability. This technical excellence will be evident in our unclassified publications and presentations at scientific conferences. Other countries will see these accomplishments and will understand their connection to the quality of our weapons programs.'' With the Stockpile Stewardship Program, we will still be able to maintain a powerful nuclear deterrent. 
   Critics argue that the Treaty's not 100 percent verifiable. In reality, the Treaty enhances our current ability to monitor nuclear testing worldwide. It establishes an International Monitoring System, which creates a global network of 321 testing monitors. We would get all of the benefits of this larger system and only have to pay 25 percent of its total cost. The Treaty also establishes an on-site inspection system. Perhaps most important, it will hold other nations accountable for their actions, and require them to provide explanations for suspicious conduct. 
   We also have a safety valve in the Treaty--Safeguard F. The Administration didn't send this Treaty to the Senate as a stand-alone document. They sent it here with six Safeguards under which, and only under which, the United States will adhere to the Treaty. 
   As Safeguard F states, adherence to the Treaty is explicitly conditioned on:  
   ..... the understanding that if the President of the United States is informed by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy that a high level of confidence in the safety or reliability of our nuclear weapons can no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with Congress, can withdraw from the Treaty.  
   The importance of this safeguard cannot be overstated. It ensures that we will be able to do what is necessary to maintain our nuclear arsenal. 
   President Kennedy, in his address to American University on June 10, 1963, spoke about the issue of verification while discussing the Limited Test Ban Treaty. He said,  
   No treaty, however much it may be to the advantage of all, however tightly it may be worded, can provide absolute security against the risks of deception and evasion. But it can--if it is sufficiently effective in its enforcement and if it is sufficiently in the interests of its signers--offer far more security and far fewer risks than an unabated, uncontrolled, unpredictable arms race.  
   These words still hold true today. The risks posed by ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty pale in comparison to the risks posed if we reject it. We have the opportunity, with this treaty, to open the door to a world without nuclear testing--a world that will be far safer from the danger of nuclear war. 
   Voting on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is one of the most important decisions that many of us will ever make. This vote holds profound implications not only for our generation, but for all the generations in the future. It makes no sense to risk a premature vote now that could result in rejection of the Treaty. As the poet Robert Frost pointed out, ``Two roads diverged in a wood''--and the one we take may well make all the difference between peace and nuclear war. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time and yield it back to Senator BIDEN.

   Mr. KENNEDY. What assurances will we have that there will be continued funding for the Stockpile Stewardship Program? I imagine that the Senator agrees, if this is indeed a concern, that we would be glad to make funding for the Stockpile Stewardship Program mandatory. And, I doubt that there would be any hesitancy, on the part of our colleagues, to get broad support for this in the Senate, if that was what was needed so that ensuring funding for this important program wasn't an issue or a question. 
   Many of the witnesses at the hearings said: ``How do we know there will be continued funding? They may very well cut back that program.'' Is this another area about which the Senator is concerned, that we don't know whether, year-to-year, the funds will be available for the Stockpile Stewardship Program. 
   Can he give us some insight about his own thinking on how we can give assurances to the lab directors that there will be adequate funding for that program in the future?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I certainly cannot. The Senator has put his finger on one of the many reasons for supporting the Stockpile Stewardship Program which is to give the necessary assurances that funding for maintaining our weapons stockpile will be there year after year. This was something I noted was a concern during the course of our hearings--this question about the need for adequate funding. And, the Senator has responded to that concern. There is broad support, certainly on our side or for those who support this treaty, for giving the assurance that funding would be there. It is just one more of the arguments made by those who oppose this treaty that has now been rebutted. I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. It is about as clear as can be. I see our ranking member of the Armed Services Committee ready to speak, but I welcome again the comments of the Senator from Delaware about the risks to our international position if we fail to ratify or defeat the CTBT in terms of security and stability around the world and the continued possibility of nuclear testing over time. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I am pleased that we held narrowly focused hearings on the many national security implications of this treaty. It is important that we narrowly focused our attention on our own national security issues. But, these broader international security issues are powerful, and in rereviewing and reading again the letters, statements, and editorials sent in opposition to the Treaty, I think the importance of the broader international security issues, of further testing by other countries, and what the implications are going to be has been missed. I know the Senator addressed those, but I hope before we get into the final hours of this debate the Senator from Delaware will review that for the benefit of the membership.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator BINGAMAN, Senator REED, and Senator WELLSTONE for this particular proposal. Effectively, what they are saying is we want to improve low-performing schools and we want to do it now--not wait until next year. It is reasonable to ask whether this kind of effort can be productive and whether it can be useful. I want to raise my voice and say: Absolutely. 
   I had the opportunity to visit the Harriet Tubman Elementary School in New York City, one of the lowest-performing schools in the city, where 99 percent of the children come from low-income families. After being assigned to the Chancellor's District--a special school district created for the lowest-performing schools--school leaders, parents, and teachers devised a plan for comprehensive change. The school adopted a comprehensive reform program including an intensive reading program. 
   By 1997-98, it had been removed from the state's list of low-performing schools and reading scores had improved; the percentage of students performing at or above grade level on the citywide assessment had risen from 30 percent in 1996, to 46 percent. 
   We have instance after instance where that has happened. At Hawthorne Elementary school in Texas, 96 percent of the students qualify for free lunch and 28 percent of the students have limited English language skills. 
   In 1992-93, Hawthorne implemented a rigorous curriculum to challenge students in the early grades. In 1994 only 24 percent of students in the school passed all portions of the Texas Assessment of Academic Skills. In 1998, almost 63 percent of students passed this test, with the largest gains over the period being made by African American students. 
   The States themselves have been reluctant to use scarce resources when we have not had adequate funding for the Title I program. The Bingaman amendment sets aside a specific amount of resources that will be out there and available to help those particular schools. This makes a great deal of sense. 
   I hope our colleagues will support the Bingaman-Reed-Wellstone amendment. These students have spent enough time in low-performing schools, and deserve much better. The time is now to take action to fix these schools. The nation's children deserve no less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we get started with this debate on the question of Davis-Bacon, it is kind of interesting. Over the course of recent days, we see a series of actions that have been directed at working families. The problem that most working families in our Nation face is that they have not participated in the great economic surge we have seen over recent times. Nonetheless, there is a continued effort to undermine their wages. 
   Let's start with the continuing denial by the majority to permit us a vote on the minimum wage. Then everyone in the country saw the actions of the Republican leadership recently, diverting the earned-income tax credit in order to be used for balancing the budget. We have had recent debates on the floor of the Senate about undermining the National Labor Relations Board, which tries to work out legitimate disputes on the basis of laws that have been in effect for years. There was also action taken on the floor of the Senate which cut back on the total number of OSHA inspections to protect workers in their workplaces in this country. 
   Beyond that, there have been the efforts to pass what is called comp time, which would have eliminated the 40-hour workweek and abolished overtime. All of that has been happening over the last 2 years. 
   I don't know why the other side has it in for, in this instance, construction workers. But the attacks seem to be fairly uniform, if we look over the facts of the record in terms of working families. That is true with regard to pensions as well. We will have another time to debate and discuss this. But those are the facts. 
   Rather than speculate on what is in an editorial or what is in a particular report, the best way to look at this is, first, the average wage of a construction worker in this country is $28,000 a year. Maybe that is too much for some Members of this body, but that is the average in terms of a construction worker. Yet the Senator from New Hampshire, in this amendment, says, in some parts of this country that isn't necessary for a worker to be able to bring up a family. It seems to me that $28,000, which is the average construction wage, is not an excessive wage in this country. 
   Secondly, if you read the Davis-Bacon Act you will see that the President already has discretion to suspend the Davis-Bacon Act if he believes there is a national emergency and its in the national interest. Presidents have in fact exercised this authority: President Bush waived the Davis-Bacon Act in 1992 after Hurricanes Andrew and Iniki. So the President has some flexibility if there are particular emergencies, but that is effectively being denied with the amendment of the Senator from New Hampshire. 
   Thirdly, if you look at various studies on Davis Bacon, including one by the University of Utah looking at 9 States that have repealed State Davis-Bacon laws, you see two very important facts: No. 1, there is a dramatic reduction in terms of training programs for construction workers; and, No. 2, the quality of the work by construction workers deteriorates, so the cost of doing business, rather than going down, actually goes up. Isn't that interesting? Now, with the amendment, we are trying to effectively undermine the wages construction workers would receive in these circumstances. 
   And what do we find in the States that have actually repealed State Davis-Bacon? They may get a little bump in the first few months in terms of some bidding, but what happens is, with the dramatic reduction in training programs and dramatic reduction in skill, the costs of various contracts go up. We will have a chance to go through that. 
   That is the issue: Whether at this time we are going to say men and women who are earning $28,000 a year are to see their wages cut. Many of them lost their homes, too; many of the workers who would be affected by this amendment live in areas where there has 
   been devastation; many of these people have been wiped out completely and now, not only are they trying to get back on their feet, but as a result of this amendment, they will be denied at least the reasonable compensation which they had received at other times. Of course, this has implications in terms of the payment of taxes. This has important implications in terms of health care costs because in most of these contracts where you have Davis-Bacon, they have health care insurance. 
   You are going to find additional kinds of burdens on local communities. This hasn't been talked about. Workers will see insufficient payments into their pension funds, which is going to mean that retirement programs for these various workers are going to be compromised, all under the guise that somehow we are helping the areas where many of our fellow citizens have suffered and suffered extensively as a result of these extraordinary acts of nature. 
   I am all set to support whatever is necessary to help those families in any of these areas--and no one can watch what has happened to people in North Carolina and along those flood zones and not be moved--but let us do it right.

Let us make sure they are going to get a reasonable day's pay for a reasonable day's work. 
   If I may have 30 more seconds, I want to include in the RECORD that after Hurricane Andrew, in 1992, the GAO tried to assess the savings from suspending Davis-Bacon, but the GAO report was unable to conclude there were any savings.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, prevailing wage means just that. That is in a given area. The fact is that the average, as I mentioned, construction worker who will be affected by this earns $28,000 a year. That is what it comes down to. 
   I refer to that University of Utah study which showed that injuries went up and the cost of the buildings went up because there was a deterioration in productivity and the skills that were necessary for completion. 
   It doesn't make any sense to bring this up as an amendment on this particular bill. 
   Let's bring it back to committee. If the Senator has an argument to make, let's follow the regular legislative process. Let us table this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. All I want to do, indirectly on the bill, is just to announce that the House of Representatives passed the Patients' Bill of Rights 275-149. 
   This is a hard-won victory for millions of patients and families throughout America, and a well-deserved defeat for HMOs and the Republican extremists in the House who put managed care profits ahead of patients' health. 
   The Senate flunked this test in July, but the House has given us a new chance to do the right thing. The House-Senate conference should adopt the Norwood-Dingell provisions, without the costly and ineffective tax breaks added by House Republicans.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As you know, it is well documented that domestic, school, and community violence survived or witnessed by children and adolescents causes psychological trauma with very real and serious consequences. These consequences can be physical (changes in the brain, delayed development), psychological (anxiety, depression, learning difficulty), or interpersonal (aggressive and violent behavior, affected individuals passing on the problems to their children). Fortunately, there is a growing body of knowledge that attests to the effectiveness of treating this psychological trauma. While the course of treatment may vary depending on the type of trauma, the length of exposure, and the age of the child, it undoubtedly requires staff with the specialized training needed to identify the signs and symptoms of trauma, and to provide the appropriate therapeutic interventions. In the wake of the violent tragedies in schools, community centers, churches, and increasingly in communities and homes across this country, the desperate need to develop this specialized expertise and to make it more widely available could not be clearer.

I would also like to thank my friend from Pennsylvania, the Chairman of the Labor-HHS-Education Sub-Committee, for his longstanding commitment to children. I understand that bill before us includes $10 million for the creation of national centers of excellence on youth violence. I also understand that a key aspect of these centers is going to be the development of effective treatments for violence related psychological trauma in children, youth, and families, and the provision of training and technical assistance needed to make these best practices more widely available. Is that the Sub-Committee Chairman's understanding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In listening to the Senator's explanation of his understanding of what the underlying issue was, and also the Lautenberg proposal, did the 1 percent underlying proposal consider tax expenditures? We have about $4 trillion in tax expenditures. The 1 percent, as I understand it, doesn't take into consideration a review of tax expenditures, where we might be able to find places where we could tighten the belt on some of these tax expenditures, and we would not need these kinds of offsets in the areas of education or health. I wonder whether the Senator's understanding of the 1-percent cut would include a review of tax expenditures. 
   We have seen some important cutbacks in terms of freezes in various expenditure programs, and we have seen some cutbacks in various programs in the period of the last few years in some important areas of education and health, but we haven't had a real review of these tax expenditures. I wonder whether the Senator--as we come down to this period of time--thinks that issue might be at least something we ought to consider or debate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Finally, does the Senator not agree with me that we have seen a comprehensive review of these various programs, as we should, to find out how effective the programs are? These programs that we authorize and appropriate money for have been watched carefully in the past several years. But I don't know of a single hearing that has been held in the Senate of the United States to have a similar kind of review of tax expenditures, to find out whether there are inefficiencies and waste, or whether they are accomplishing what the public purpose and goal was when they were devised. There very well may be an opportunity to squeeze some resources out of tax expenditures so we don't have to cut education and health and home heating oil. Does the Senator think that ought to be part of this debate and discussion as we talk about the questions of funding these critical programs?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Simply stated, this amendment says:  
   In order to improve the quality of education, funds available for education *.*.*  
   And then it says, such as:  
   Title I, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [IDEA] and Pell Grants shall be excluded from any across-the-board reduction.  
   Just a few minutes ago, we were having a debate on the floor of the Senate on the questions about overall general reductions in the budget which would have affected these education programs. We had a brief debate on alternative ways in order to try to deal with some of the budgetary considerations and constraints. 
   During that discussion and debate, I asked whether we had actually even given consideration to trying to find additional kinds of funding by closing some of the tax expenditures which are generally understood as tax loopholes. We did not receive any assurances on that. Really, as a result of that debate, as we are moving on through this whole appropriation bill, and in anticipation there may be another opportunity or another occasion where Senators will come forward and ask for a reduction in the funding levels across the board, this amendment just excludes the education programs. 
   We can ask why we ought to exclude education programs. Why not other programs? We could have some debate and discussion on that issue. But the principal reason for excluding these programs is because over the period of recent years, we have seen a series of reductions in education programs as a result of House and Senate Appropriations Committee action. 
   Going back to 1995, we had a House bill--this is just after the Republicans had gained control of the House and Senate--that actually requested rescission of $1.7 billion. Then the House bill in 1996 was $3.9 billion below 1995; in 1997, $3.1 billion below the President's request; in 1998, $200 million below the President's request; in 1999, $2 billion below the President's request. 
   We know this appropriation bill that has been reported out by the Appropriations Committee is in excess in total numbers of what the President requested. We also know it is on its way to the House of Representatives for negotiation. 
   The purpose of this amendment is, no matter what we are going to do in terms of other kinds of activities to reduce funding of various provisions of the legislation, we are not going to reduce funding in the area of education. That is basically the reason for this amendment. We know that the title I program works; the Pell program works; IDEA works; the other education programs work. We have had good debates on those measures over the past months. It is very important that we understand that. 
   We are now experiencing a significant increase in the total number of students who are going to be involved in K through 12 education. We will see 500,000 students this coming year attending our schools, an all-time high. We know we will need 2.2 million teachers over the next 10 years, and we are getting further behind, hiring only about 100,000 teachers a year. Even with the current efforts we have made in recruitment we are still falling further and further behind. 
   We are also finding that more young families and needy families are able to get their children through college. One of the most interesting developments that has taken place in this last year is, we have the best repayment of student loans in over 10 years. This means that young people who are going to post-secondary education are taking advantage of the federal loan programs, and are repaying those loans. This is a very important and significant indication that there is a great need for these federal loans, and that young people across this country are demonstrating a responsible attitude by repaying those loans on time. 
   I had raised the question earlier of whether we should not fully fund these important education programs, and other health care measures, child care measures and the community service block grant--I yield myself 3 more minutes. I have asked if we couldn't find some reductions in terms of tax expenditures to find that funding. 
   Only a few months ago, under the Republican tax bill, they effectively found $5.5 billion over 10 years in their legislation. All we are saying is, if you can find $5.5 billion over 10 years, you can certainly find enough now to protect the programs dealing with education, dealing with health care, dealing with the LIHEAP program and some of these other nutrition programs. These are programs which are a  lifeline to the neediest people in our society. That is what we are resisting. We are resisting this wholesale way of trying to diminish the continued commitment and responsibility we have to the neediest children and to the neediest workers and the neediest parents in our society. That is what brings us to the floor of the Senate today.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, if this amendment is accepted, it will provide some $300 million nationwide to improve the quality of teaching in the public schools of America. If we have had some important testimony over these past several years, it has been along these lines. Let's get along with having smaller class sizes in the various early years. Senator MURRAY, from the State of Washington, has made that case very clear. And the STAR report, that has focused in on the work of Tennessee, has also demonstrated that in a very compelling way. 
   The second area is afterschool programs. Our good friends, Senator BOXER from California, Senator DODD, and others, have spoken about the importance of afterschool programs for children in reducing violence and enhancing academic achievement and offering opportunities for business communities to work with children in these afterschool programs to offer career improvements. 
   There have been important needs which have been demonstrated for building additional kinds of facilities and improving the facilities that exist.  The General Accounting Office says that is in excess of over $100 billion. That amendment will follow on tomorrow. It is very important to make sure when every child goes to class in a public school system that the school is going to be in the kind of condition to which all of us want our children to go. If we do not do that, we send a very poor message to children. We say, effectively, it does not matter what that classroom looks like or what that classroom is really all about. That sends a powerful message to a child that perhaps education is not so important. 
   But when you consider that, and consider also the steps that have been taken in terms of improving technology in the classroom, improving the work that is being done in the areas of literacy, there is one important, outstanding additional issue which demands and cries out for attention in the Senate; and it is this: The American families want to have a well-qualified teacher in every classroom in America, period. 
   I think if you ask parents all across this country, at the end of the afternoon, where the greatest priority is--if you said, look, if we could have a well-qualified teacher in your child's classroom, I bet every family in America would put that just about at the top of their various lists. 
   Over the last 3 years, our Committee on Education has had extensive hearings on this issue. We made some recommendations in the last Congress on this issue. It had very strong bipartisan support on the issue of quality teaching. The approach that was taken in that legislation says: All right. We want to provide teacher enrichment for individuals who are already teachers. 
   We had ideas about mentoring with older teachers and working with professional teachers, but what we have not addressed in an adequate way is how we are going to recruit the kinds of teachers who would be the best teachers for our children and how we are going to train them in the most effective ways so they will be the very best. 
   This amendment, if it is accepted, amounts to $300 million. We have some $77 million in there now. The President had asked for $115 million to do it. But certainly the applications for this kind of training has far exceeded even the amounts we are talking about today. 
   This offers an opportunity to say to the young people of this country, and to those kinds of local partnerships--the effective State programs, the universities across this country in the States--that we are going to help and assist you in, as a top priority, recruiting the best teachers for the students in this country. 
   Finally, we have pointed out, in the education debate over the period of the past days, the need for new teachers. Some 2 million teachers over the next 10 years--200,000 a year--is what we need. We are only getting 100,000 at the present time. The Senate 
   has rejected the excellent proposal of the Senator from Washington to increase the number of teachers in the early grades. 
   I yield myself 3 more minutes. 
   In fact, with the rejection of the Murray amendment, we are going to find in excess of 30,000 well-qualified, well-trained teachers who are working in grades K through 3 actually getting pink slips. It makes no sense at all. It makes no sense at all. 
   So it does seem to me that in an overall budget of $1.7 trillion--do we understand? $1.7 trillion--we ought to be able to have $300 million in the tried and tested way of recruiting teachers, additional teachers, who we know we are in short supply of; well-trained teachers, who we know we are in short supply of; and make them available to an expanding, growing population in our K through 12th grade system. We are increasing the number of students by 477,000 this year. So we are falling further and further behind. 
   This is a very simple, straightforward amendment. It is saying that of all of the priorities--and there are many--education is certainly among the very highest; and of all the priorities in the areas of education, getting good teachers, recruiting young and old people alike who will be good teachers, giving them the inspirational kind of training so they can go into the classroom, use the latest in technologies, adapt that to the kind of curricula to benefit the children of this country, should receive these additional funds. 
   Mr. President, I know there are others who want to speak on this issue. How much time remains on our side?

I certainly think all of us on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee in the Senate are very fortunate to have his insights about the importance of this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think I have 3 and a half minutes left. I yield myself 3 minutes. 
   On this chart behind me, we see that communities need more well-qualified teachers. Out of 366 total applications--and this is 1999--only 77 applications were funded. With this particular amendment accepted, we would still be below half of what was actually in the pipeline for this last year, let alone what would be in there for next year. There is enormous need. 
   Finally, I will quote from the chairman of our Education Committee, Senator JEFFORDS, who, in his representation to the Senate on the education bill, had this to say about this particular provision that is in the law--not about this amendment but about this provision:  
   At its foundation, Title II embraces the notion that investing in the preparation of our Nation's teachers is a good one. Well-prepared teachers play a key role in making it possible for our students to achieve the standards required to assure both their own well-being and the ability of our country to compete internationally. 
   .....Title II demands excellence from our teacher preparation programs; encourages coordination; focuses on the need for academic content, knowledge, and strong teaching skills. 
   .....These efforts recognize the fundamental connection that exists among States, institutions of higher education, and efforts to improve education for our Nation's elementary and secondary school teachers.  
   This provision had the strongest bipartisan support in that education bill. We know what the need is. We know this is a very modest amendment. We know what a difference it will make in terms of the high school students of this country. I hope this amendment will be accepted.  
   Mr. President, I understand I have a minute left.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we all want to express our appreciation to our leader, Senator DASCHLE, for the development of this proposal. As he has pointed out, we have worked closely with Senator MOYNIHAN and the members the Finance Committee. We hope this will be the basis of the coming together here in the Senate. This should not be a partisan issue. The kinds of problems Senator DASCHLE pointed out are problems not only in urban areas but in rural communities, too. The program he has advocated touches the health care needs of people all over this country. This particular issue cries for a response and action from this Congress in these final few days. 
   I join with him and others who say we should not leave, we cannot leave, we will not leave this session without addressing these problems. We have the time now to work this process through. I think the way this has been fashioned has demonstrated a sensitivity to the range of different emergencies that are out there across the landscape affecting real people. 
   So I join others on our side in commending him for the leadership he has provided on this issue as in so many other areas. Hopefully, he will be successful in reaching across the aisle so that we can all work on this issue together. 
   Mr. President, no senior citizen should be forced to enter a hospital or a nursing home because Medicare can't afford to pay for services to keep her in her own home and in her own community. 
   No person with a disability should be told that occupational therapy services are no longer available because legislation to balance the budget reduced the rehabilitation services they need. 
   No community should be told that their number one employer and provider of health care will be closing its doors or engaging in massive layoffs because Medicare can no longer pay its fair share of health costs. 
   No freestanding children's hospital should wonder whether it can continue to train providers to care for children because it receives no federal support for its teaching activities. Yet these scenes and many others are playing out in towns and cities across the country today, in large part due to the unexpectedly deep Medicare cuts in the Balanced Budget Act passed two years ago. 
   The 1997 Act was the final part of a process undertaken since 1993 to balance the federal budget and lay the groundwork for the current economic boom and the large budget surpluses we anticipate in the years ahead. However, our ability to balance the budget was primarily attributable to deep savings achieved by cuts in Medicare--by  slowing the rate of growth in provider payments and other policy reforms. These cuts were expected to total $116 billion over five years, and nearly $400 billion over ten years. Clearly, as experience now shows, these cuts are too deep for the Medicare program to sustain. 
   In fact, these cuts were more than double the amount ever enacted in any previous legislation. The Congressional Budget Office has now increased the estimate of the savings to total $200 billion over five years and more than $600 billion over ten years--far greater than Congress intended. 
   Not surprisingly, we are now hearing from large numbers of the nation's safety net providers--especially teaching hospitals, community hospitals, and community health centers. We are hearing from those who care for the elderly and disabled when they leave the hospital--nursing homes, home health agencies and rehabilitation specialists. We are hearing from virtually every group that cares for the 40 million senior citizens and disabled citizens on Medicare. They are saying--with great alarm and anxiety--that Congress went too far. 
   The Medicare Beneficiary Access to Quality Health Care Act that we are introducing today will alleviate much of this damage. It will provide $20 billion over the next ten years to reduce the pain created by the harshest cuts in the Balanced Budget Act. It will ensure that the nation's health care system is able to care responsibly for today's senior citizens, and is adequately prepared to take care of those who will be retiring in the future. 
   The current Balanced Budget Act is unfairly imposing a $1.7 billion cut over the next five years for Massachusetts hospitals alone. Our community hospitals are reeling. Many of our teaching hospitals have laid off staff, and are unable to continue to participate in Medicare HMO contracts. Some say that these cuts are needed to make Medicare more efficient. But Massachusetts teaching hospitals are already efficient. In the past six years, 
   one out of five of our teaching hospitals and one out of four hospital beds have been closed. We cannot afford to compromise on patient care, doctor training, and the state-of-the-art medical research conducted at the nation's top hospitals. 
   In addition, children's hospitals deserve help as well. They currently receive almost no federal support for their important teaching and training activities. They train a majority of the nation's pediatricians and pediatric specialists. Yet current rules keep them from receiving the level of federal support available to other teaching hospitals. While this particular legislation does not address this problem, Senator Bob KERREY and I have proposed a separate bill with strong bipartisan support to correct this injustice and give children's hospitals the funding they deserve to train the pediatricians needed to care for the nation's children in the years ahead. 
   The home-bound elderly--our most vulnerable senior citizens--are also suffering. In Massachusetts alone, home health agencies are losing $160 million annually, and 20 agencies have closed their doors since the Balanced Budget Act went into effect. The ones that remain are seeing fewer patients, and seeing their current patients less often. 
   Massachusetts nursing homes are predicting losses of $500 million over the next five years. Eleven facilities have declared bankruptcy this year, and more are expected to follow. 
   With the impending retirement of the baby boom generation, the last thing we should do now is jeopardize the viability and commitment of the essential institutions that care for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet that is now happening in cities and towns across the nation. In the vast majority of cases, the providers who care for Medicare patients are the same ones who care for working families and everyone else in their community. When hospitals who serve Medicare beneficiaries are threatened, health care for the entire community is threatened. 
   Nearly one million elderly and disabled Massachusetts residents rely on Medicare for their health care. This legislation is a sensible, affordable step to ensure that our health care system will continue to be there for them when they need it. It deserves prompt consideration and passage. I commend Senator DASCHLE for his leadership on this vital issue, and I urge the Senate to approve this important measure.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California. This has been an ongoing and continuous effort on her part, since the beginning of this program 3 years ago when it started out as an extremely modest program. The reason it has grown to where it currently stands at $200 million, is to a great extent, because of Senator BOXER bringing to the attention of both the administration and the Congress, the impact of this program on children, on families, and also in terms of law enforcement. 
   I think many of us were heartened earlier this year when the President asked for $600 million. But I think most of us thought, given the amount of the request for that program, that it far exceeded that by two or three times. As with very strong programs, it will get the kind of focus, attention and priority it deserves. I want to express our appreciation to the Appropriations Committee because they have at least added some resources to that. 
   But, of course, we face a significant decline in terms of the commitment from the House of Representatives. By accepting the Boxer amendment, we will strengthen the commitment that our appropriators have demonstrated in terms of funding this program. 
   As we come into the second day's debate on this appropriations bill, we are seeing the targeting of scarce resources that we have at the national level in areas of proven achievement and accomplishment. 
   Yesterday, under the leadership of Senator MURRAY in the area of smaller class size--and the record is very complete--with smaller class size and with better trained teachers, the academic achievement and accomplishment for children are enhanced significantly, and the benefits of those experiences stay with those children. Of course, if they are enhanced later on, they even expand. The afterschool program is a similar program. 
   If we are able to take both of these programs together--smaller class size and afterschool programs--with the kind of improvement of those afterschool programs, including tutoring, helping children with their homework, and also exposing children in many different instances, as we see in Boston, to a wide variety of other subjects--for example, photography and graphic arts, areas which have awakened enormous interest among children--students may find these are areas where they may concentrate either near school or later as the source of employment. 
   The bottom line is very clear. The results are in. Every dollar we invest in afterschool programs means that a child will have an enhanced academic achievement and accomplishment, period. 
   As this country debates, families say: What can we do about education? 
   This morning many families, as they saw their children going off to school, were saying: I hope my child is going to have a good day in school; that they are going to have good teachers; and that they are going to continue their learning experience. 
   One of the things we know and that has been demonstrated and proven is that afterschool programs work. They have a positive academic impact in terms of children. This ought to be prioritized. That is what this amendment does. 
   I welcome the fact that Senator GREGG withdrew his amendment because I think it is rather cynical to try to place disabled children against afterschool children. Hopefully, we are interested in all children. Disabled children go to afterschool programs. Why try to say to people in local communities: Look, you have to do this, or do that? We ought to do what is necessary in terms of those children who qualify for IDEA, and we ought to do something for the afterschool program. Now we have the opportunity to do something for the afterschool program. 
   I want to state very quickly some of the results of the afterschool program to date. One is in the student achievement. The second is in decreasing juvenile crime. 
   The Senator from California has been able to reflect that in the very strong support from law enforcement officials that she mentioned in the RECORD. That has been demonstrated. It was demonstrated in Waco, TX, where many of the students participated in what they called the Lighted Schools Program for afterschool programs. They saw an important and significant  reduction in juvenile delinquent behavior over the course of the school year. It produces that result, as we saw, as in some of the presentations we made yesterday about giving the students a youthful, productive, and healthy kind of alternative to using their time in a wasteful way after school. It has the result of reducing juvenile crime. 
   Finally, the parents support it. In Georgia, over 70 percent of students, parents, and teachers agree that children are receiving helpful tutoring in The Three O'clock Project, a statewide network of afterschool programs. The parents are the ones who have been the strongest supporters of this program. 
   As we have seen in other programs, there is no requirement and no mandate on this. If the local school and community want to do it, they had better get their applications in because there are going to be scarce resources. We are doing it on the basis of a solid record of achievement, academic improvement, and reduction in crime. They have seen that there have been expanded opportunities for students because of additional learning experiences. 
   This is a win-win-win. I think the Senate of the United States ought to go on record in supporting what the parents want and what has been demonstrated to be effective in enhancing academic achievement in afterschool programs. 
   We are glad for what the appropriators have done. But we are talking about a $1.7 trillion budget. We think $200 million more for the afterschool program, which will bring it up to the $600 million the President had requested, makes a good deal of sense. Again, it is an issue of priority.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. We had a tax cut for $792 billion over the period of the next 10 years. As the Senator remembers, we had the opportunity to fully fund the IDEA program and only reduce the tax cut by one-fifth. That was real money going toward education for the disabled. That was rejected on party lines. Those who are advocating and supporting the Boxer amendment supported it. It was turned down on the other side. 
   If we were able to have that amount of money that would be used in the tax cut, why not take $200 million of that $792 billion and put it in afterschool programs to service 370,000 children? It makes sense to me.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has brought up an enormously important point, one that some Members understand, and hopefully the American people understand. 
   To move ahead with that tax cut would mean an effective reduction in support of programs that reach out and benefit children in the public schools. That is part of the money they were going to use to fund that tax break, and, of course, the President vetoed it so we are able to at least effectively hold those programs at their current level. 
   However, the Senator additionally makes the point that we have 447,000 new children going to school this next year, about 300,000 the following year, and 300,000 the next year. Unless we see an important increase, we will not be able to serve all the children in need. 
   I think the Senator from California's program will move us down that road in an important way.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is appalling that our Republican friends will use any means necessary to kill the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We need time to debate this Treaty in a responsible manner, especially since the Foreign Relations Committee has still not held a single hearing devoted solely to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   On September 24, 1996, President Clinton became the first world leader to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. On that day, President Clinton praised the treaty as the ``longest-sought, hardest--fought prize in the history of arms control.'' 
   Today, we stand on the verge of losing this valuable prize. For almost two years, the Treaty has languished in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee--with no action, no debate, and no results. Now, with the September 23 already passed, the United States may well forfeit its voice on the treaty if the Senate does not act quickly, and in a responsible way, to ratify it. 
   We have a unique opportunity in the Senate to help end nuclear testing once and for all. Other nations look to the United States for international leadership. President Clinton has done his part, in signing the Treaty and submitting it to the Senate for ratification, as the Constitution requires. Now the Senate should do its part, and ratify the Treaty. Ratification is the single most important step we can take today to reduce the danger of nuclear war. 
   Withholding action on this treaty is irresponsible and unacceptable. The Treaty is in the best interest of the United States and the global community. Ratification of this agreement will increase the safety and security of people in the United States, and across the world. But, until the Senate ratifies this treaty, it cannot go into force for any nation, anywhere. 
   The Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty is in the interest of the American people and it has widespread public support. Recent bipartisan polls found that over 8 out of 10 Americans support its ratification. These statistics cut across party lines and are consistent in all geographic regions. The Treaty also has the strong support of present and past military leaders, including four former Joint Chiefs of Staff--David Jones, William Crowe, Colin Powell, and John Shalikashvili--and the current JCS, Hugh Shelton. 
   The United States has already stopped testing nuclear weapons. Ensuring that other nations follow suit is critical for our national and international security. Particularly in the wake of recent allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage, it is essential that  we act promptly to ratify this agreement. China is a signatory of the Treaty, but like the United States, China has not yet ratified it. Prompt Senate ratification of the Treaty will encourage China to ratify, and discourage China from creating new weapons from stolen nuclear secrets. 
   In 1963, after President Kennedy had negotiated the landmark Limited Test Ban Treaty with the Soviet Union to ban tests in the atmosphere, he spoke of his vision of a broader treaty in his commencement address at American University that year. As he said:  
   The conclusion of such a treaty, so near and yet so far, would check the spiraling arms race in one of its most dangerous areas. It would place the nuclear powers in a position to deal more effectively with one of the greatest hazards which man faces in 1963, the further spread of nuclear arms. It would increase our security--it would decrease the prospects of war. Surely this goal is sufficiently important to require our steady pursuit, yielding neither to the temptation to give up the whole effort nor the temptation to give up our insistence on vital and responsible safeguards.  
   In 1999, those words are truer than ever. 
   I commend President Clinton and my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have joined together to speak out on this issue, and I urge the Senate to act responsibly on this very important treaty.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I, first of all, acknowledge the strong interest that my friend and colleague from Wyoming has in the whole area of OSHA. He spends a great deal of time on this issue. Although I have areas of difference with him, he is someone who has involved himself in this issue to a very significant extent. We certainly take note of his longstanding and continuing and ongoing interest in trying to make the workplace safer. 
   Having said that, I do hope his position will not be sustained on this particular issue this afternoon. I hope eventually we will have the opportunity to support the Wellstone amendment that, instead of taking the money from inspections for consultation, would just add additional funding for consultations rather than denying the money for inspections. 
   The way that would ordinarily be done is Senator ENZI would have offered his amendment to transfer, and then Senator WELLSTONE would have come on and offered a second-degree amendment and said: All right, let us have the increased money from forward funding for the $9 million for compliance. We would have gone to the Senate, I think, with the support of the Senator from Wyoming. I think we would have resolved this issue and we would be further down the road in moving ahead on the whole question of the appropriation. 
   But we will go through, I guess, the vote on Coverdell, which is basically a repeat of the Enzi amendment. The Senator is entitled to offer that, to effectively cut off, at least at this time, the Wellstone amendment. Then we will have to come back in on top of that, after the Senate makes a resolution of that particular question. 
   Just to put the facts straight, there are very few of us--I do not know any of us--who do not believe there should be an expansion of both: Consultation, and I think there has to be a very extensive inspection program. They go hand in hand. Why do we say they go hand in hand? We have some very direct and powerful evidence. In 1995 and 1996, when the Congress cut dramatically the funding for inspections, then the number of consultations went down correspondingly, dramatically. The reason for that has been very clear from the record. If there is a reduction in inspections, and there is a sense the companies are not going to be inspected, there is less of an incentive to move ahead with consultations. 
   So these have gone hand in hand. What the Senator from Wyoming wants to do is put a greater emphasis on consultation and reduce the number of inspections. I do not think that is wise, given the fact that we have seen the dramatic increase in the workforce. We have 15 million more people working now than we had 6 years ago, as we saw, as Mr. Ralph Nader, interestingly, reminded us last Labor Day, indicating that and indicting the OSHA department for not having enough inspections in order to provide the kinds of protections for an expanded workforce. 
   Under the amendment of the Senator from Wyoming, he wants to reduce them further. It will be about a 10-percent reduction in the number of inspections. We have about 88,000 or so inspections. This would amount to about a 10-percent reduction in the total number of inspections, which is not insignificant. 
   It is particularly important in the areas of the construction trades, as my friend and colleague has pointed out, the Senator from Minnesota. Even though those in construction are only about 6 percent of the workforce, we find close to 20 percent of all the deaths in the workplace are in construction. This is a dangerous, dangerous industry to work in. We are fortunate in this country to have dramatic escalations of construction projects. We have them in our own city of Boston, and we have them all over this country, dramatic escalation in construction. We find these attendant accidents which happen, and also deaths which occur as well. 
   So if we look at the history, we find very important and powerful evidence. 
   We can represent what we think will happen. We can say what we would like to happen. But the fact is, in this particular situation, we know on the basis of evidence what does happen, and that is, reduction in inspections is reduction in consultations. 
   With all respect to my friend from Wyoming, if we want to see an expansion of the consultations, we ought to increase the number of inspections instead of reducing them. But that is not where we are this afternoon. 
   Finally, the administration and the Congress have seen a significant increase in consultations over the last 4 years, about a 30-percent increase. There has been important work done in the area of consultation. We certainly support--I do--that program and think it is very important. 
   It is interesting that the association which represents those who are involved in consultation is resisting this amendment, and the reason they are resisting this amendment is for the reason I have identified. They understand with the reduction of inspections, there is going to be a reduction in consultations. 
   One would think they would say: Wow, amen, let's get behind them; they are going to put more money into consultations and, therefore, we are going to get more of it. 
   But no, they do not. That ought to say something to us because they understand as well. 
   As I mentioned, I have great respect and affection for my friend and colleague from Wyoming, particularly in this area of OSHA, but in this very important area where we are talking about people's lives, what is the real purpose of this? The real purpose is the protection of workers' lives.  
   We have seen since the time OSHA has gone into effect a dramatic reduction--50-, 60-percent reduction--in the loss of lives on the construction site. OSHA is faced with additional problems of occupational health. It is faced with additional issues with these new toxic substances and a wide range of challenges for the new workplace they are trying to deal with and that also pose a significant and serious threat to workers. What we are basically saying with OSHA is that we in the United States want to make sure we are going to have as safe a workplace as possible for working men and women. 
   We believe with the increased funding provided for OSHA in this appropriations, as compared to the undermining of OSHA, as we saw in the House Appropriations Committee, we will meet that responsibility and OSHA can meet it. 
   Let us not put at risk what is tried and tested policy conclusions: We have strong inspections and strong consultations. That works. That is the position Senator WELLSTONE and I and others support. 
   I hope as a result of these votes that is where we will come out; that we will come out so there will be a modest increase which the good Senator has mentioned in terms of consultation; that we will come out and add those additional funds for the outyears but not take away from the extremely important inspection. 
   Finally, we can pass various pieces of legislation, but unless we are going to have enforcement, a right without a remedy does not go very far. That is true in just about every area of public policy. We learn that every single day. What we need to have is accountability. We hear a great deal of talk about 
   accountability. This is accountability. The question of inspections is a part of accountability to protect workers. If we cut off and reduce inspections, we are denying the important accountability that is necessary to protect workers in this country, and that is an important and serious mistake. 
   Mr. ENZI addressed the Chair.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to pay tribute to Rear Admiral Bob Chamberlin, on his retirement from the United States Navy after 33 years of distinguished and dedicated service to the nation. 
   Rear Admiral Chamberlin is a native of Massachusetts. He graduated from high school in Westwood and went on to earn his bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin, where he distinguished himself as a first-tier ROTC graduate. Shortly after receiving his commission in 1966, he was assigned to the U.S.S. Hisseem in Pearl Harbor. From there he went on to serve in Vietnam, gaining the respect of all who shared duty with him and earning numerous decorations and awards, including the Navy Commendation Medal with Combat V, the Vietnamese Medal of Honor First Class, and the Combat Action Ribbon. 
   Following his Vietnam tour, he came home to Massachusetts and earned an MBA degree from Harvard. He went on to serve in a variety of supply and financial management assignments, ashore and afloat. He was soon regarded by his superiors as a tireless and innovative logistician. Ten years after attending the Naval Supply Corps School in Athens, Georgia, he returned to the school as an instructor and course developer. 
   In 1987, after serving as director of stock control at the Aviation Supply Office in Philadelphia and as supply officer on the U.S.S. Nimetz, he was promoted to captain and was assigned to the Naval Supply Systems Command in Washington, D.C., where he served as the project officer on a major supply-system modernization initiative. Later, he was appointed to be the Command's vice commander. 
   In July 1993, he was promoted to rear admiral, and for the past two years, he has served as the principal deputy director of the Defense Logistics Agency--America's combat support agency. His vision and leadership have been vital to the agency's award-winning business-process initiatives to ensure that the nation's armed forces receive the supplies and equipment they need, and in a way that offers the best possible return to the American taxpayer. 
   Admiral Chamberlin has been in the forefront of the ongoing advances in military logistics. His exemplary military career comes to a close this month, but his contributions and achievements will continue to be felt throughout the Navy and the Department of Defense. 
   Bob Chamberlin has served his country with great ability, valor, loyalty, and integrity. On the occasion of his retirement from the United States Navy, I commend him for his outstanding service. He is Massachusetts'  finest, and I wish him well in the years ahead.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I wonder if the Senator will yield for an additional question. As I understand, in the Senator's presentation, this concept and commitment to the smaller class size is not only based upon her own experience as a teacher and as a school board member but upon very important results of studies and evaluations of what they call the STARS Program in Tennessee. The results of that study indicate the impact on those children was rather dramatic in math and science, in reading, in reduction of disciplinary problems, and also the benefits of that experience actually carried on through the later grades, through the eighth grade, and actually were reflected in the increasing number of students who attended college. 
   The amendment of the Senator is based upon what I imagine is rather intuitive understanding of education, and that is, a teacher understanding the students and knowing their needs in a small class. But also, am I correct, this has been really one of the most important new results of various experiments that have taken place in the several States? Am I correct with that conclusion?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Am I correct also, last year when Congress went on record committing itself to at least the first year of the hiring of additional teachers, it really was not a partisan issue? At that time, as I understand it--I am wondering whether the Senator remembers it--the chairman of the House Education Committee said, essentially, on the proposal of the Senator from Washington:  
   This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more importantly a huge win for local educators, parents who are fed up with Washington mandates, redtape, and regulation. We agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal does not create a big new Federal education program.  
   This was said last year by the chairman of the House Education Committee, and similar words were used by House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY of the Republicans. Is the Senator 
   aware that this concept was warmly embraced by Speaker Gingrich, Majority Leader DICK ARMEY, and Congressman GOODLING in the final hours of the last Congress?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to just ask the Senator to respond to this part of the editorial that says:  
   Remember class size reduction? Last year there was a bipartisan commitment to spend $1.2 billion to hire 100,000 new teachers over a seven-year period, reducing average class size to 18 in grades 1 through 3. St. Louis city and county stood to gain 600 of those teachers. The current spending bills being considered in both houses this week effectively kill the program. * * * * * 
   The rap on public schools is, in most cases, a valid one: If your child is either ahead of or behind his peers, he's going to be lost in the shuffle of 25 to 30 children. * * * * * 
   It's hard to think of anything more obvious or more fundamental than the need for smaller classes in the early years. It's even more difficult to think of anything more unconscionable than bailing out of a long-range commitment one step into it. Members of Congress, keep your promise. Give our children schools where teachers can teach and all students can learn. 
   Does the Senator find this kind of expression that comes from Middle America, the heartland of the Nation, is really expressed in other parts of the country, western parts of the Nation, the great State of Washington which she represents, as well as in the other parts of the country?

No one pretends the answers are going to be easy and are going to be solved virtually overnight. But is it the Senator's sense that by having the smaller class sizes that we not only are dealing with academic achievement, but we are also dealing with some disciplinary problems, and also since we are talking about K-3, we are also talking about the opportunities for teachers to interact with students and perhaps identify some of the younger children who may be faced with some tensions or some developmental difficulties early in the cycle and perhaps have some opportunities to address those particular children's needs? 
   Does the Senator also think this smaller class size can have some impact in terms of discipline and also in terms of the climate and atmosphere which exists in schools in this country?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I will use 10 minutes, Mr. President. 
   What we have heard from the other side in this debate today is a technique which is sometimes used in this body. But the people who are watching this debate ought to understand it. Those listening to it ought to understand it. It is a familiar technique; that is, not to describe what the amendment is and then to differ with it. That is what we have seen. 
   With all respect to the Senator who recently spoke about all the time that is necessary in order to make the application--here it is: One page, to make an application. One page for the local school community to make the application. 
   Let's come back a step and understand the Federal role in education and what this program is basically all about. There is not anyone who is serious about education policy who believes with the 6 or 7 cents out of every Federal dollar that the Federal Government is going to control local decisions on education, not a serious educator. There may be Senators who would like to misrepresent what they understand would be the results of any particular amendment, but that does not stand. I think it is basically intuitive to understand when we are only providing the 6 or 7 cents out of every dollar, basically it is a modest opportunity for local communities to take advantage of these programs. 
   Second, so we have made a commitment to what? Smaller class size, which is the debate now, ensuring we are going to have a quality teacher in every classroom, that we are going to take advantage, later on in these debates, of afterschool 
   programs which have proven effective and which people desire. We are going to have an opportunity to address those issues. But it is all within that 7 cents. 
   To listen to our friends on the other side, you would think this is being jammed down the throats of the various school districts. What is in this amendment of the Senator from Washington? It is $1.4 billion to provide for the hiring of various teachers. I have listened to the other side, the Senator from New Hampshire and other Senators, talking about how this is going to threaten local education, how the heavy hand of the Federal Government is going to come down and dictate to every local school community. 
   This is what it says. Section 304:  
   Each local education agency that desires to receive the funds under this section shall include in the application required. .....  
   If they so desire to participate--completely voluntary. Do we understand that on the other side? This is voluntary. This says, if your parents, your local teachers, the local school boards, want to participate under this, if there is enough resources and the Murray amendment is accepted, then they can voluntarily participate. Do we understand that on the other side? Voluntary. 
   Then the question is, all of this Federal bureaucracy, here it is--one page. I wish those who comment on the Murray amendment would at least extend the courtesy to the Senator from Washington to actually understand, to read the amendment and understand what it does. Here it is.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with all respect to the Senator from the State of Washington, Mr. GORTON, under his particular provisions it would put $1.2 billion in a title VI block grant program that allows 15 percent to be used for administration, reducing the funds to schools. 
   How hollow it is for those on the other side to talk about how we are not getting the bang for the buck when virtually 100 percent of this goes to the local school boards for them to make the judgment in hiring those teachers. Our Republican friends, under title VI, spend 15 percent in administration of it. 
   Let's get real about this. Please, let's get real on it. Let's debate it on the merits. I would be tempted, if the Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, wants to put this as an add-on, to perhaps support it. But that is not what we have here. It is a substitute saying that their program is better than this particular program that has been tried, tested, accepted, and working, and improving the quality of education for children and, importantly, there is a desire for it to be continued. 
   We have heard again from our good friend from New Hampshire about how this is basically robbing the funding for IDEA, the disability program in education. We should not hear that anymore from that side of the aisle, and I am going to tell you why. When we had the major tax proposal under the Republicans, we had an amendment on the floor of the Senate that the Senator from Washington supported and which I supported, the Senator from Minnesota supported, and others supported, that said: Let's take the full funding of IDEA for 10 years and carve that out of the tax bill; let's carve it out and fully fund it for 10 years. 
   It would have amounted to a one-fifth reduction in taxes. That was the key vote in terms of IDEA. That was the key vote in terms of priorities for disabilities. Every single Member of the other side of the aisle voted against it--every single one of them. 
   Let's not come to this Chamber in the afternoon and say: Look what is happening with the Murray amendment; they are trying to take the money from scarce resources. 
   We had the opportunity to do that, and they said no. That was a serious debate at that particular time. Perhaps maybe even the President's position on the tax bill might have altered or changed--might have, maybe not--if we were going to have full funding of IDEA. But absolutely not and not a single one supported that particular proposal. 
   I do not often differ with the chairman of our Appropriations Committee, but he suggests we reserve $1.2 billion subject to authorization, and if the authorizers choose to authorize class size, fine, and if not, it can be a block grant for the States to choose. That is the whole problem. We have not been given the opportunity to authorize that. We have been denied, on each and every opportunity, as the Senator from Washington has pointed out, doing that. 
   The fact is, last year on the appropriations bill, they in effect authorized it and Republicans supported it. All we are asking is to extend it, like we did last year. 
   I mentioned earlier, and it continues to echo in my ears, what the Republicans said about this very program. It is a shame this issue has somehow developed into a partisan issue because last year, with the Murray amendment, it was widely embraced by the Republicans. 
   Listen to what Congressman GOODLING, the chairman of the Education and Workforce Committee, declared about this program, the Murray amendment:  
   ..... a real victory for the Republican Congress ..... 
   That is fine with us. As long as we can get the substance, as long as we get teachers, if Congressman Goodling wants to declare that, fine.  
   .....but more importantly--  
   Thank you--  
   it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with Washington mandates, red tape, and regulation. We agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal does not create big, new federal education programs.  
   Mr. Armey:   
   We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the President's people were willing to work with us so we could let the state and local communities use this money--  
   That was always the intent, and not only the intent, but specifically the language of the MURRAY amendment. 
   He continues:  
   ..... make these decisions, manage the money, spend the money on teachers where they saw the need, whether it be for special education or for regular teaching, with freedom of choice and management and control at the local level, we thought this was good for America and good for schoolchildren. We were excited to move forward on that.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I ask for 2 more minutes. 
   Senator GORTON said this about the class size:  
   On education, there's been a genuine meeting of the minds involving the President and the Democrats and Republicans here in Congress. ..... It will go directly through to each of the 14,000 school districts.....and each of those school districts will make its own determination as to what kind of new teachers that district needs most, which kind should be hired. We never were arguing over the amount of money that ought to go into education. And so this is a case in which both sides genuinely can claim a triumph.  
   What in the world has happened in the last 10 months to those Republican leaders who were enthusiastic about this program 10 months ago and now discard it? What is it? We have not heard it in the Senate; we have not heard it from one single speaker. We hear generalities; we have rhetoric, but there has not been a specific reason for opposition. 
   In conclusion, the results of that investment show the children are benefiting from the Murray amendment every single day they are in those smaller class sizes. 
   I hope this body will accept the Murray amendment and do something that is important for local schoolchildren all across this Nation. 
   Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as we pointed out earlier, this legislation is a voluntary program. Each local education agency that desires to receive the funds shall include the application. So it is completely voluntary. I know it has been repeated time and time again that the Federal Government is imposing this on the local school districts. But it is the local school district who has to make the judgment, who has to fill out the application. All the money goes to the local school district. Under the Gorton amendment, 15 percent goes to the bureaucracy. So let's be accurate in our description of this proposal. 
   Then let's also be accurate that this concept was basically endorsed by all the Republican leadership in the last Congress. Congressman GOODLING, Congressman DICK ARMEY, and Senator GORTON claimed credit for this proposal. We understand that. They claimed credit for the Murray amendment when it was accepted in the last Congress. 
   Just a final point I want to make. I think it is fair to say: One, if they want to do all the things the Senator from Maine has pointed out and you want an additional block grant, I agree with the Senator from Minnesota, if they want to get additional funds, I will vote for it. If the State of Maine wants to do it, that is all well and good. We are talking about limited resources targeted on national needs. 
   The question is whether this program works. The Senator from Washington has said time and time again that it does. And with all the responses on the other side, no one has questioned the various reports that demonstrate that children have made progress--no one, none; silence. 
   You can give all the cliches about one size fits all and all the rest, but just respond to the various STAR report conclusions, such as: 7,000 students in 80 Tennessee schools. Students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. 
   Talk to Maria Caruso, an elementary school teacher in Lawrenceburg Elementary School in Lawrenceburg, TN, who talks about what a difference it makes in all the years that she has been teaching, having the smaller class size, what a difference it has made in the quality of the education for the children in the Lawrenceburg Elementary School. Or talk to Jacqueline van  Wulven a veteran teacher from the Cole Elementary School in Nashville, TN, who said:  
   These students come into third grade far more advanced academically than any other third grade class I have taught. There were very few behavior problems with a small class. The students worked well together, and I was able to provide many different learning experiences because I did not have to spend so much time disciplining the class.  
   Sandy Heinrich from Granbery Elementary School in Davidson County, TN: ``I have been a teacher for 29 years and have never had an experience like I have had with the smaller class size.'' 
   These are the teachers. Respond to these teachers. 
   All we are saying is, if the local community wants to try and replicate what has been tried and tested and demonstrated to produce enhanced academic achievement and accomplishment, that is the Murray amendment. They are already doing it in communities across the country, based upon last year's commitment. All we are saying is, let's continue it. 
   Two million teachers will be needed over the next 10 years. We are getting 100,000 teachers a year normally. We need to recruit an additional 100,000, to handle rising enrollments. The Republicans say, no, no, to the additional teachers. With their proposal, they will eliminate close to 30,000 school teachers across this country. Does that make any sense at all? It does not. 
   In Wisconsin, the Student Achievement Guarantee in Education program is helping to reduce class size in grades K to 3 in low-income. A study found that the students in smaller classes had significantly greater improvements in reading and math and language than students in bigger classes. 
   In Flint, MI, efforts over the last three years to reduce class size in K-3 have produced a 44 percent increase in reading scores, an 18 percent increase in math scores. 
   This issue is not about power. It is about partnership, partnership between the local communities, the States, and the Federal Government. We should insist on the Murray amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, I commend our friend and colleague from California, Senator BOXER, for advancing this very important amendment. It is obviously an improvement over what the House of Representatives did, and it is an improvement over the Senate bill. 
   The Senate bill falls short in some important areas in which I believe we should address if we are going to advance academic achievement and accomplishment. We attempted, under the outstanding leadership of Senator MURRAY, to help communities reduce class size and now with Senator BOXER's amendment, we want to help communities expand afterschool programs. 
   Tomorrow, there will be an effort by Senator HARKIN and Senator ROBB to address school modernization and construction, and to help more communities improve the quality of teachers entering the classroom. 
   I commend Senator BOXER for her leadership of the issue of after-school programs. The 21st Century Community Learning Center program has been vastly popular. Over 2,000 communities applied, but there was only enough funding to grant 184 awards. 
   We all have our own experiences with afterschool programs. We have an excellent program in the city of Boston under the leadership of Mayor Menino. It is not only an afterschool program, it is also a tutorial program for children. Most of the afterschool programs have tutors working with children to help them do their homework in the afternoon, so that in the evening time, the children can spend quality time with their parents. That has been enormously important. 
   Secondly, there have been other programs initiated outside the direct academic programs involved in school such as photography programs and graphic art programs where members of the business community work with children to enhance their interests in a variety of subject matters they might not be exposed to and provide training in specific skills. 
   What every educator involved in afterschool programs will tell you is, with an effective afterschool program, we find a substantial improvement in the academic achievement and accomplishment of these students. 
   In Georgia, over 70 percent of students, parents, and teachers agree that children receive helpful tutoring through what they call the 3 o'clock Project, a statewide network of afterschool programs. Over 60 percent of the students, parents, and teachers agree that children completed more of their homework and homework was better prepared because of their participation in the program, and academic achievement and accomplishments have been enhanced. 
   What we have seen over the course of the day under Senator MURRAY and now under Senator BOXER are amendments to support proven effective programs, programs which have demonstrated that they improve academic achievement and accomplishment. We simply want to target resources to these successful programs. In Manchester, NH, at the Beach Street School, the afterschool program improved reading and math scores of the students. In reading, the percentage of students scoring at or above the basic level increased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third, 33 percent, in 1997. In math, the percentage of students scoring at the basic level increased from 29 percent to 60 percent. In addition, students participating in the afterschool program avoid retention in grade or being placed in special education. 
   There will be those who will say: That is interesting, but they made that decision at the local level to do that. The federal government didn't decide that. 
   If communities want to take advantage of this program, they can apply and compete for funding. No one is forcing any particular community to take part in this program. No one is demanding that every school district in America accept it. But what we are saying is that there will be additional resources for communities across this country to invest in after-school programs 
   that are improving students' academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   Afterschool programs also help reduce juvenile crime, juvenile violence, and gang activity, generally preventing adverse behavior of students. 
   What we see in this chart is that juveniles are most likely to commit violent crimes after school. As this chart shows, which is a Department of Justice chart, the time after school, between 2 p.m. and 8 p.m., is when youth are most likely to commit or be victims of juvenile crime. 
   If you talk to our Police Commissioner Evans in Massachusetts, he will tell you one of the best ways of dealing with violent juveniles and with the gang problems we have in my city of Boston is effective afterschool programs. We know anywhere between 6 and 9 million children are at home unsupervised every single day, every afternoon between the ages of 9 and 15. 
   We are trying to offer children opportunities for gainful activities to, one, enhance their academic achievement and accomplishment; and, two, reduce the pressures that so many young people are under that lead to bad and negative behavior. 
   This amendment, again, is talking about an additional $200 million in a total budget of $1.700 trillion--$1.700 trillion, and we are talking about adding just $200 million. A nation's budget is a reflection of its priorities, and we believe that in after-school programs should get high priority. 
   Finally, we must do far better than the House bill in after-school programs, where they came in $300 million below the President's request, and in many other education priorities that the House drastically cut. We want to raise the funding levels of the Senate bill so that Members going to conference will be able to report out a strong after school program. 
   I thank the Senator from California, again, for making such a compelling case for increased investments in afterschool programs. She has been involved in this issue for years, and she is our real leader in the Senate on this question. It is a pleasure to be a cosponsor of the amendment. I thank her for her courtesy in permitting me to speak at this time. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, each year, up to 1 million nurses and other health care workers are accidentally stuck by needles or other sharp instruments contaminated by the blood of the patients they care for. More than 1,000 of these health care workers will contract dangerous and potentially fatal diseases as a result of their injuries. The Reid amendment is very important--it will require hospitals to use safer devices, and it will provide more effective monitoring of needlestick injuries, so that we can take additional steps to deal with this danger. 
   Karen Daley, of Stoughton, MA, is one of those whose lives have been forever changed by disposing of a used needle. 
   Karen is a registered nurse and president of the Massachusetts Nurses Association. In July 1998, as an emergency room nurse at the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, she reached into the box used to dispose of a needle, and felt a sharp cut. By the end of the year, Karen had been diagnosed with HIV and Hepatitis C. I would like to read from a statement she recently delivered at the Massachusetts State House, where a bill has been recommended by the relevant committees:  
   I have been a practicing nurse for over 25 years. I love clinical nursing and have felt privileged to care directly for thousands of patients over the years....... I have developed expertise in my practice over the years that has allowed me to have a significant impact not only on the quality of care my patients receive, but also in the growth and professional development of less experienced colleagues ..... Since January of this year, I have come to terms with the fact that I am infected with not one, but two potentially life-threatening diseases....... I have had to have weekly blood tests drawn--over 90 tubes of blood since January....... Experience to date is that treating a person infected with both HIV and Hepatitis C is extremely difficult and that each infection makes it more difficult to successfully treat the other. 
   That one moment in time changed many other things. In addition to the emotional turmoil that it has created for myself, my family, my friends, my peers--it has cost me much more than I can ever describe in words. I am no longer a practicing health care provider--I made the decision to not return to my clinical practice setting where I have worked for over 20 years. In the process, I have abruptly been forced to leave many colleagues with whom I've worked for many years and who are as much family as peers to me. The harder decision for me has been the decision I've made not to return to clinical nursing. 
   This injury didn't occur because I wasn't observing universal precautions that are designed to reduce health care workers' exposure to blood-borne pathogens. This injury didn't occur because I was careless or distracted or not paying attention to what I was doing. This injury and the life-altering consequences I am now suffering should not have happened.......and would not have happened if a safer needlebox system had been in place in my work setting.  
   Karen Daley is now battling against two devastating diseases. And it didn't have to happen. Unfortunately, this scene is repeated more than 1,000 times a year--in communities across the country. 
   Lynda Arnold, a 30-year-old registered nurse and mother of two adopted children, is now HIV-positive as a result of a needlestick injury she received in an intensive care unit in Lancaster, PA, in 1992. She has started the Campaign for Health Care Worker Safety. Lynda writes,  
   I no longer work in a hospital. I no longer involve myself in direct patient care. I do not dream of growing old with my 30-year-old husband or dancing with my son at his wedding.  
   These cases are tragedies, and there are many more. At least 20 different bloodborne pathogens can be transmitted by needlestick injuries, including HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C. 
   The average cost of followup for a high-risk exposure is almost $3,000 per incident--even when no infection occurs. The American Hospital Association estimates that a case can eventually cost more than $1 million for testing, medical care, lost time, and disability payments. 
   Up to 80 percent of needlestick injuries could be prevented with the use of safer needle devices currently available. However, fewer than 15 percent of American hospitals use these products. The primary reason for not adopting steps to create a safer workplace is the cost. But the consequences are severe. 
   Safer needle devices do cost approximately 25 cents more than a conventional syringe. But the net savings from avoiding the excessive costs associated with workplace injuries are also significant. Hospitals and health care facilities in California are expected to achieve annual net savings of more than $100 million after implementing a proposal similar to the one now under consideration. 
   This is not a partisan issue. The companion bill in the House has almost 140 cosponsors--including more than 20 Republicans from across the political spectrum. 
   Similar bills have recently passed in California, Texas, Tennessee, and Maryland, and have been introduced in more than 20 other States. 
   These protections have the strong support of the American Nurses Association, Kaiser Permanente, the American Public Health Association, the Consumer Federation of America, and many, many other groups that represent nurses, doctors, and other health care workers. In addition, the Massachusetts Hospital Association and other State level associations have supported these bills at the State level. 
   There is no excuse for inaction. Time is of the essence. Every day 3,000 more accidental needlesticks occur. We need to act as soon as possible. We owe prompt action and greater protection to those who devote their careers to caring for others.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as I understand it, we are expected to have two votes at the hour of 5:30--on Senator DASCHLE's and Senator LOTT's Sense-of-the-Senate proposals. The time has been divided for those who favor and those who are opposed to the different proposals. I strongly support the Sense-of-the-Senate which has been introduced by Senator DASCHLE and which I am a cosponsor. 
   The essence of Senator LOTT's proposal is: Resolved that it is the sense of the Senate that this Congress has taken strong steps to reform our Nation's education system, and allows States, local schools, and parents more flexibility and authority over their children's education; and the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 will enable this Congress to continue its effort to send decision making to States, local schools, and families. 
   Of course, we are all in support of reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We don't have any dispute over that. I have listened to a good part of the debate. I have yet to hear those other steps enumerated and identified or commented on. The one piece of legislation that we took was what was called ED-Flex. That is basically a modest expansion of what was done under the Democratic Goals 2000 in 1994. Goals 2000 was President Clinton's initiative. At that particular time, the initial ED-Flex gave the Governors the flexibility. We provided some modest increase in the flexibility, and I supported it. But it  doesn't deal with the kind of problems which we are talking about. That is at the heart of this debate and discussion. 
   I welcome the fact that since the time Senator DASCHLE introduced his resolution that our Republican leader has made a decision to have a mark-up tonight on these education bills. That is real action. This is the kind of encouragement we would like to 
   have--that we have the introduction of the Daschle resolution, and then under evidently the urging of the majority leader, the Committee on Appropriations is going to meet this evening in order to try to indicate the priority education would have in terms of the national budget. That is as much as you could ever hope for in terms of positive action of a Sense-of-the-Senate resolution--real action. We will wait to see how the Committee on Appropriations in the Senate of the United States is going to act. 
   What brought about the reasons for the Daschle resolution? Quite frankly, what we heard over the course of the afternoon would respond to those facts. The fact is, since the Republicans have taken over leadership in 1995, in the Senate of the United States, we have found that education as a part of the Federal budget has been the last--not the next to the last but the last--appropriations the Congress has considered. We on this side believe it ought to be the first--not the last but the first. 
   Now we are caught in a situation with the deadline for adjournment is some time at the end of October and there are only 3 or 4 days remaining in the fiscal year. Finally, we have the Republicans saying: All right. We will finally hold an Appropriations Committee meeting on Monday night when the fiscal year starts later on this week, on Friday. We find that unacceptable. 
   Members over here can talk in generalities about flexibility. They can talk about the makeup of the Pell program and they can talk about administrative costs over in the Department of Education. We are delighted to get into a more detailed discussion about those particular items. But what those on the other side of the aisle haven't answered is why the funding for the education of the young people in this country has been the last priority under the leadership of the Republicans. That is the issue. That is the question. 
   With all respect to my friend from Mississippi, and with all respect to the many years he went to public school--I admire that and respect it--it doesn't answer that simple question about why, with all the priorities we have in this country, the leadership has placed this as the last priority. 
   The history of where the Republicans have been with regard to education as a last priority kind of escapes certain facts. This is extraordinary. My good friend from Mississippi said on September 24: Since Republicans took control of Congress, Federal education funding has increased by 27 percent. 
   Why? Because of President Clinton and because of the Democratic leadership. 
   You can say: Well, that is an interesting statement, an interesting comment. Show me. 
   That is exactly what I intend to do. Right over here is a chart that shows what the funding levels have been under the Republicans since 1995. 
   In 1994, the Democrats lost the election. The Republicans took over the House and the Senate. 
   What happened in 1995? In 1995, we had a rescission. What is a rescission? A rescission means the House has appropriated money, the President has signed it, but we want to take some of that money back, 
   rarely used in education, and the Republicans did what? What did they do? We have the suggestion our Republican leader is attempting to convey, that they have been the supporters of expanded use of funding in education. 
   They had a rescission for $1.7 billion below the bill actually enacted; they asked for a rescission of $1.7 billion. 
   In 1996, the House bill was $3.9 billion below the 1995 final figure--$3.9 billion below. 
   In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below the President's request. 
   In 1998, it was $200 million below the President's request. 
   In 1999, the House bill is more than $2 billion below the President's request. 
   Those happen to be the facts. 
   Let me state the time line for passage of these appropriations. 
   On March 16, 1995, the House rescission bill came to the floor. The Republican leadership could hardly wait to get into office when they sent this bill up to take some of the money back that funded education. 
   Then we have the omnibus bill in 1996, the last continuing resolution. The funding of that program passed 7 months after the end of the fiscal year. 
   In 1997, it passed on the last day of the fiscal year. 
   In 1998, it passed 1 week after the end of the fiscal year. 
   The agreement for 1999 was passed 3 weeks after the end of the fiscal year. 
   As we have seen, they have virtually all been the last appropriations. Nothing my friends have stated has disputed that. This is the record of the requests under Republican leadership in the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States. The reason we find that Federal education funding rose during this period of time is that we had the Government shutdown and our President refused to go along with it. He actually raised it. 
   For the majority leader now to say, look at what we have done, is a complete distortion and misrepresentation of the facts. They cannot dispute it. Those are the facts. 
   The reason this was brought into such sharp relief is that last Thursday, the House Appropriations Committee went to work again and finally had their series of recommendations where they have cut back or effectively eliminated the President's program to go for smaller class sizes. They had agreed on it at the end of the last Congress. In 1998, Congressman GOODLING said how wonderful it was they had gone ahead and reduced class size for 1 year. 
   Former Speaker Gingrich said:  
   ..... a victory for the American people. There will be more teachers and that is good for all Americans. I'm in.  
   The Republican leader in the House said this will mean more teachers and this is good for all Americans. 
   We say fine, that is why we want to expand it. The Republican leader said it was good for all Americans; President Clinton thinks it is good for all Americans; the various statistics and figures in the various STAR evaluations for smaller classes in the State of Tennessee indicate children are making progress. Everyone seems to agree--except who? The Republicans in the House Appropriations Committee that zeroed that program out. 
   I don't hear from the other side why we have the inconsistency, why it is we have in 1998 Republicans saying it is a victory for the American parents and we have President Clinton supporting it, we have the statistics that say smaller class size for grades 1, 2, and 3 are particularly important in terms of children's academic achievement and accomplishment, and now we find the Republicans in the House of Representatives zero it out, eliminate all of the funding for that particular program. We ask, why? 
   That happened last week. Later, I will review the various studies showing how the smaller class sizes have been important in terms of academic enhancement and achievement. It ought to be self-evident. No one makes this case more passionately and with more knowledge than perhaps the only school teacher in this body, and that is Senator MURRAY of the State of Washington. She has taught and been a member of a school board and can state the difference between having 15, 25, and 30 children in a classroom. We have had the eloquent statements and comments made by the Teacher of the Year, talking about the difference in being able to know the names of the children and the needs of those particular children and being able to take time with those particular children. It is self-evident. We have seen that. But not according to the Republican Appropriations Committee. 
   We say this is wrong. 
   We saw other examples. In the program for helping and assisting children to read, we have made some progress in the area of reading--not much, but we have made noticeable progress. We have a long way to go. We know the challenges out there. There have been a variety of different approaches developed. The chairman of our committee, Senator JEFFORDS, has long been committed to this program. A number of Members enjoy the opportunity to read at Brent Elementary School, here in  Washington. We know the importance of children learning to read and how important that program is in terms of their ability to read and in terms of their own academic achievement and accomplishment. 
   Why in the world would we cut that program way back? It is a matter of priorities. I read Members' comments made on Friday saying: We cannot fund everything; some people--knowing they were meaning this Senator from Massachusetts--want to fund all these programs. The fact is, here is a question of priorities. The debate is about priorities. We are saying education is a No. 1 priority; that is where scarce resources ought to be continued. If there are other priorities, there is a problem, and we have to make a judgment. 
   But hold this institution accountable for making education the No. 1 priority. We are prepared to do that. We are prepared to call the roll on it. If Members have other priorities they think are more important, they can go along with those and make their judgment. 
   One of the major achievements of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act last year was trying to increase the total number of teachers. We don't just need 2.2 million teachers in 10 years; 30 to 40 percent are in retirement at the present time. There is also rising enrollments--447,000 more children started school this year. Some might say we have more teachers, maybe the programs that are working need some help and assistance if we are going to try to help those 447,000 students. 
   What we have found out is one of the important cutbacks was in the program to enhance the additional qualified teachers to be teaching in our schools. 
   These are the realities. These are the numbers. This was, actually with regard to teaching, 40 percent below the President's request. It is the Teacher Quality Enhancement Program. 
   We know, even with the President's programs, with 100,000 new teachers, we are not going to be able to do the whole job. The record-high enrollment this year of 53.2 million students--447,00 more children than last year, and the continued rise over the next ten years; 324,000 in 2000, by 282,000 in 2001, by 250,000 in 2002, and continuing on an upward trend in the following years. I do not hear any discussion about: Look, there is an expanding number of students in our schools in this country. How are we going to ensure we will have sufficient teachers who will be qualified; not people who will be in the classroom but well-qualified teachers? That is what we are strongly committed to. 
   I see my friend and colleague from Illinois who, I am sure, wants to address the Senate. These are questions of priorities. As I have said before, allocating the resources is a question of priorities. Money does not solve all of the problems. But one thing we do know, without resources you are not going to be able to invest in the children of this country--you are not going to be able to do it. We believe this is an indication of a nation's priorities. Not all the programs are going to work perfectly. Some may be altered or changed. We will look forward to the debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which is the principal instrument to help and assist the local schools. 
   Their answer to the question of priorities is suggesting we should give first priority to helping and assisting families in this country in the partnership--and it is a partnership--between the local communities and the States and the Federal Government. We provide very little, 7 cents out of every dollar. This idea we are making these decisions that will decide all education policy--we understand where the education responsibility is, it is locally. They put up the majority of resources in it. But we provide some targeted resource to try to make a difference in specific areas. That is what we believe in. 
   We cannot support this concept that the Congress has taken strong steps. Look at the record: Nothing this year for more teachers or smaller classes; nothing to modernize schools, to help with repairs, to wire the schools for computers; nothing to help train teachers; nothing to help with the basic skills such as literacy--virtually nothing. Virtually nothing. All we have seen so far are cuts in education. That is not strong steps to reform our Nation's education system. 
   I will be glad to yield 10 minutes to the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator was going over 1995 through 1999, does the Senator remember when it was the standard Republican position to abolish the Department of Education? I think you and I want every time that President meets with his Cabinet officials one person who is going to think nothing but education, and every time that President talks about national priorities, to speak for the education of the children of this country. That I know has been the position of the Senator from Illinois. 
   Does the Senator understand why, on the one hand, they were going in that direction and then, within about a year after that, we had Secretary Lamar Alexander's answer in terms of the elementary and secondary school reform: That we have a model school in each congressional district and in each of the States, and they to be decided, by whom? By the local community? No; by the Secretary of Education. 
   Now we have another approach. We have the block-grant approach. Can the Senator explain to me, within a period of about 5 years how we can go from, on the one hand, abolishing the Department of Education to, on the other hand, having the Secretary of the Department of Education saying we ought to have model schools in each of the congressional districts, to now block granting everything and sending it back to the States?

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   Madam President, a couple of quick facts. If the good Senator from New Hampshire went back to March 25 of this last year--the time we were considering the $790 billion tax cut--we offered an amendment that would have taken one-fifth that amount of money and completely funded IDEA. The Republicans unanimously rejected it. They unanimously rejected it. They thought we ought to have tax breaks rather than funding IDEA. So, before we get all worked up about this position that was just talked about, we ought to understand that. 
   Madam President, with all respect to my friend, the majority leader, I don't find traveling around Massachusetts that the school systems are saying: We have sufficient resources and we don't need any help or assistance. The role of the Federal Government, historically, is to provide a very limited amount of resources in targeted areas, where there are some special needs, and that is why we have these targeted resources. 
   If our good friends on the other side want to have a good deal more funding, generally, in terms of education, they can request their Governors to go ahead and do so. Our role is to find targeted resources. 
   Now, what are these targeted areas we have talked about? Let's get specific. One of the key areas are smaller class sizes. As I mentioned, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY, is our leader on that issue. The project STAR studied 7,000 students in 80 Tennessee schools. Students in small classes performed better than students in large classes in each grade from kindergarten through third grade. Follow-up research shows that gains lasted through at least the eighth grade. STAR students were less likely to drop out of high school. Research also shows that STAR schools and smaller classes in grades up from K through 3 were between 6 and 13 months ahead of regular classes in math, reading, and science, all the way through the fourth, sixth, and eighth. 
   That is one of the programs that we support. That is a priority item. The Republicans zeroed that out. 
   I was interested in the Republican leader saying we are going to have a big bill on the floor of the Senate next week. We are saying: Where has it been? We are glad it is going to be here, but where has it been? That is our point. 
   We have the situation of after-school programs. We know the dangers of young students getting in trouble with violence after school. Juveniles are most likely to commit violent crimes after school, as this chart shows, it is between 3 and 6 p.m. 
   We had a modest program by the President with $200 million. There were 1,700 applications for that program. Only 184 programs can be funded at the current level of $200 million. There were 1,800 unfunded after-school programs. We are trying to fund those. The Republicans say no. 
   Take a look at what these dollars have meant in terms of math scores improving. This is in the neediest areas of this country. From 1992 to 1996, in every one of these areas, and particularly in the areas where the students are the poorest, almost double the performance for children in the area of math and science. In each of the various quarters, we have seen a significant increase in the last 4 years. 
   That is our priority: Smaller class size, after-school programs, and trying to improve student achievement in the areas of math and science. 
   I'll mention one more area, wiring the schools for the 21st century. We have seen the gradual increase in the schools that are wired. But still, for the instructional rooms where children learn, they do not have those kinds of resources. We believe we should provide some help and assistance. Local school districts want that help and assistance. We are being denied that under the Republican priorities. 
   Finally, with all respect to our majority leader, the history and the record shows that it has been this President and the Democratic leadership who have seen the increase in the funding over the period of the last 6 years. That is just a matter of record, with all respect. 
   The final point the Republican leader says: Why didn't they support our tax reductions? The Office of Management and Budget has stated that there would have been a 40-percent reduction in  support of education in order to pay for that tax break. 
   I ask the majority leader, if you have $780 billion that you want to give away in tax breaks, why aren't you providing additional funding on programs that have been tried, tested, and have enhanced the educational achievement of the children of this country? 
   Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Democratic leader.

   education funding because they are going to have an appropriations bill that will far exceed the President's request. 
   I ask the Senator if on the one hand he finds it perhaps encouraging that we are finally moving to get education reform, and what kind of consideration we ought to give to that kind of assurance? 
   It is Monday evening. We go into the fiscal year on Friday. The majority leader has said we are going to have a budget that will exceed the President's. Can the Senator tell me why, if they are going to exceed the President's budget, that suddenly we find this money, does he know of any reason we have not had this money before? Doesn't he believe we should have had it before? Or does he know from where the funding will come?

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield further, I searched the RECORD and I didn't find it as of last week when the leader put in his own resolution and when we talked about this. There was no comment, no sense of outrage at that particular time. 
   This is a poor way of dealing with the families of this country that understand our role in the area of education is limited. We spend about 7 cents out of every dollar, but we try to target it in areas of special need. To be able to on one day see these dramatic cuts and 3 days later hear a statement by the majority leader that it will be far in excess of the President's request, does not he agree with me that the American people are entitled to a more serious discussion and debate of a priority which they believe so deeply is important for their children and the future of this country?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I always enjoy having the opportunity to discuss education policies with my friend from New Hampshire. As usual, he has been very eloquent in terms of the positions which he has advanced. I would like to bring a few points to the attention of the membership, though, on items he has raised to try to clarify some of these issues and questions. 
   One was the issue of flexibility, whether there is sufficient kinds of flexibility at the local level to permit the education of the children in various communities across the country. 
   I have Speaker HASTERT's statement he put out at the time the President signed the Ed-Flex legislation. At that time, the Speaker said: ``Ed-Flex''--which passed the House and Senate-- ``ensures our schools have the flexibility they need to make good on the promise to help each child reach their full potential.'' The release goes on and indicates he believes now there is the kind of flexibility the Senator from New Hampshire talks about being extremely important. It seems the Speaker, at least, and many others, believed, with the passage of that act, the local communities had the flexibility they needed. 
   I think that was certainly the purpose of the legislation. I am glad the Speaker certainly has supported the President's concept in having that kind of flexibility. 
   Secondly, there was some talk about the funding of the IDEA. I want to recall for the Members that we did have an opportunity earlier this year to have full funding of IDEA for the next 10 years. The Senator from New Hampshire has mentioned the importance of us in Congress to meet the responsibilities to those children who are participating in that program. 
   The fact is, earlier this year, on March 25, 1999, I offered an amendment that would provide full funding for IDEA over the next 10 years, and also the funding for the class size reduction initiative--that we would provide full funding for those two items. It would have taken one-fifth of the tax cut. With one-fifth of the tax cut, we could have funded all of the IDEA programs for a period of 10 years. That was a party-line vote, including the vote of the Senator from New Hampshire who voted 
   against it. That is real money. That isn't speeches on the floor of the Senate. That is real money. 
   We would have welcomed the opportunity to have worked with him and others in this body to take some of that money, the $780 billion that was going to be used for tax cuts, and use the money that would be necessary for the funding of the IDEA, but that was voted out. We are not giving up on that. 
   So for those who share my belief--I know our colleague, Senator HARKIN, is a great leader on that issue; and it has broad, bipartisan support in terms of fashioning that legislation. We will continue to fight for increased funding  for the IDEA. It certainly is preferred to fund that than have the kind of tax breaks that have been suggested in the Republican proposal. But on that date, it was the sense of the Republican leadership and the Republican Party that the tax breaks were more important than funding the IDEA. That, I believe, was wrong. 
   Finally, I say, I hope in our discussion and debate on education that we can understand a very basic and fundamental concept; and that is, we should not be pitting children against each other. We want to have better teachers. We want smaller classes. We want improved reading skills. We want after-school programs. We want safe buildings. We want those conditions for children who are in the IDEA programs, and we want those conditions for children in the Title I programs, and we want those conditions for children in the high-achievement programs. 
   Let us not begin to pit one group of children against another. That is why we support the kind of coordinated program, in terms of both program and resources, so all children can move along together to take advantage of the real opportunities that are out there. That is what basically underlines the reason for Senator DASCHLE's Sense-of-the-Senate Resolution. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take a moment of the Senate's time to say why I believe this amendment, this Sense of the Senate, is so important at this time. 
   You can ask: Why are we taking time in the Senate on a Friday afternoon to put the Senate on record in urging my colleagues, in the remaining days, to provide the resources that will be necessary to fully fund the President's requests on education and to not see these dramatic cuts which have been indicated with the 17-percent reduction in the allocation of funds for the appropriations for education? 
   Families across this country ought to be concerned. We are hopeful that we are giving that signal to the American families. What we are going to do in the next 4 weeks is going to be of the greatest importance and significance in terms of whether we are going to be enhancing or diminishing the quality of education for children in this country. 
   I would like to see education be the No. 1 appropriations . I wish we had a binding resolution that said: Before we deal with any other appropriations, we are going to deal with the education appropriations. That ought to be the No. 1 appropriations. 
   I daresay, if you ask the American people, sure, they may say national security and defense, that may be in there; but they are going to say national security and defense, and they are going to say education. But what has been the record? 
   Here is the record. 
   In 1994, under the Republican leadership, the day they captured the House of Representatives and the Senate of the United States, they didn't even wait until the appropriations legislation came up. They put a rescission program request into the Congress that effectively said money that had been appropriated, signed by the President, would be rescinded. They asked for a rescission of $1.7 billion below enacted in 1995. That was one of the first actions taken by the Republican leadership. 
   In 1996, the House appropriations bill had a $3.9 billion request for education below what was actually agreed to in 1995; in 1997, $3.1 billion below the President's request. 
   It was in 1995 that the Republican Party introduced a resolution to abolish the Department of Education--abolish the Department of Education. That gives us some idea about what their views are in terms of any kind of partnership between the Federal Government and the States and local communities. They wanted to abolish it. 
   I think most parents in this country want to have someone at that Cabinet table every time the Cabinet meets who is going to say: Mr. President, what about education? That is what the Secretary of Education is supposed to do. That is why he is there. Every time there is a debate on national domestic issues, any time there is a debate on priorities, that Secretary of Education is there saying: What are we doing about educating and enhancing the education of our children? 
   Republicans wanted to forbid that Secretary to come into the room. They wanted to deny him access to the President of the United States. What possible sense does that make? 
   We ask why the Daschle amendment is being brought up now. So we can garner the support of the American people and say we are not going to get rolled on this issue, not without a fight. This President isn't going to get rolled on it. All we have to do is look at where the priorities have been on the education issue. 
   We want the funding for education as the first appropriations. We challenge the Republican leadership in the next Congress to bring it out as No. 1, not as the last one. And the last one, here in 1998, is only $200 million below the President's request; 1999, $2 billion--the House bill. The House bill, according to Mr. Obey, is $2.8 billion below the President's. 
   We have to ask ourselves, what is happening across the country on education? I will tell my colleagues what is happening. We have 400,000 new students--400,000 new students who are going to classrooms in America now. We have 200,000 teachers who taught last year who have given up and retired from teaching, and only 100,000 have been replaced. One would think the effort contained in the President's program of trying to find qualified individuals to teach ought to be something that is pretty important, wouldn't they? Sure, they would. Not the Republican appropriators, not the Republicans. They cut that almost in half. 
   We have to ask ourselves, what are they possibly thinking about? Sure, these are numbers, but they are a pretty good indicator. What we are saying is--talking about numbers--that just because of $1 billion or $2 billion, it is not going to necessarily solve all the education problems we have in our country, but it is a pretty clear indication about what a nation's priorities are. 
   That is what the appropriations process is about--what are our Nation's priorities. What are parents going to say and what should they say, when every single time they see those reductions? Now we are seeing it again with these actions that have been taken in the House of Representatives. 
   We are going to resist those. We are saying it not only because we see what is happening with the growth of the various numbers of students and the decline of the numbers of teachers, but we know a whole host of other things. 
   Most Americans understand we want our children to have the 
   kind of skills that are going to be necessary for them to play a role in getting a decent job and providing for their families for the next century. 
   I will not take the time today, but maybe later I will have the time to discuss the various studies which show that only 20 percent of the graduates now entering the job market have the kind of skills that 60 percent of those students are going to need, not 5 years from now, but 1 year from now--a year from now. That is what is happening out in the job market. That is what is happening in this new economy. 
   President Clinton understands that. He has funding in this so we can have continuing, ongoing training and skills for the young people of this country, so they will be able to be part of the economy. This Republican Appropriations Committee guts that particular provision and effectively wipes it out. 
   I will mention one final item. We heard from our good leader about the importance of reading. There isn't a teacher across this country who doesn't know the significance and the importance of reading. Yet we find here in the United States that we are still challenged in terms of having our children reach acceptable levels that are going to be necessary for the improvement of their education and their academic achievement. 
   I am not taking the time to go through the various assessments and the progress that has been made, although progress has been made. It has been small, perceptible, but we are on the road to enhancing the number of children who are going to be able to read satisfactorily to be able to grow in terms of their own future education. 
   What has happened to the reading programs--the reading programs that depend upon volunteers, that depend  upon local contributions, that depend upon people within the community to be a part of these programs where we get such a bang for the buck in terms of the scarce resources we put in on the reading for excellence programs that are taking place and are oversubscribed in States around the country--they are effectively slashed with this budget.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I would expect that budget would be vetoed and hope that it would be. I think all of us have every expectation that it will be. 
   This President, from the very beginning of his administration, has set a series of priorities and he has expressed those. In more recent times, he has talked about the importance of Medicare, Social Security, a prescription drug benefit, and targeted tax cuts for needs. He has been very clear about his priorities. But there has not been a higher priority for this President than the issue of education, and he has been strongly committed to it. I have every expectation this legislation will not pass, nor should it pass.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Well, it basically says to not just the Nation, but to the students that education really isn't so important. If a student goes into a crowded classroom, uses old books, or goes into a classroom that is leaking, or where there are no recreational programs; if a student goes into these kinds of settings where no music or art is available, we are sending a very powerful message to those children. We are saying your education doesn't really count; it doesn't really matter because it doesn't matter to us to try and provide you with the kind of classroom, the kind of teachers, the kind of athletic facilities, and other after-school programs that you deserve. We say our children are the future, which they are. Children understand, children are perceptive, and they know when they are getting a second-rate deal. That is what they would be getting if the Republican education funding proposal were to pass. 
   Let me finally, in answering this question, mention for the RECORD what the President actually said yesterday. I will put the full statement in the RECORD. He said:  
   If the Republicans send me a bill that doesn't live up to our national commitment to education, I won't hesitate to veto it. If it undermines our efforts to hire quality teachers, to reduce class size, or to increase accountability in our public schools, I will veto it.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print the President's radio address in the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Those were the standards that were insisted upon when we extended the SEA program, which are having an effect and reflecting higher achievements. They are the smaller classes where the most comprehensive study of any education program was done, smaller classes in the State of Tennessee, the STARS Program. We should universally recognize the important academic achievement of those children who started out with a smaller class size in grades 1 through 3, and about the importance of higher quality teachers, which was at the heart of the Higher Education Extension Act that we passed 2 years ago. He  said he would veto it. I welcome the fact. 
   The President continues:  
   If it fails to strengthen Head Start, after-school, or summer school programs, I will veto it. And if it underfunds mentoring or college scholarship programs, I will veto it.  
   It looks like this bill has about 8 vetoes coming up.

   We are all aware of the critical need for housing vouchers for low income families. Our nation is experiencing tremendous economic growth and expansion, with record low unemployment. Yet it is clear that for many families the cost of housing is still out of control. 
   In Boston, housing affordability is a problem for many families, and it is becoming a problem for businesses as well in their efforts to attract and retain employees. 
   The Clinton Administration has requested 100,000 new housing vouchers in this bill. Such vouchers will not solve the housing crisis, but for the families helped, this will go a long way toward stabilizing their families and helping them to lift themselves out of poverty to economic self-sufficiency. Yet this bill provides not one new voucher. 
   We are all aware of the budget constraints under which we are operating. Yet it is unacceptable not to find any resources to address this unmet need. 
   Another issue that deserves higher priority is the Community Builders program, which is an important element in making HUD a better, more effective, more customer-responsive agency. 
   The Community Builders program has helped improve the way HUD works and interacts with its customers and clients, the American people. 
   These Community Builders are people with impressive experience in the housing and community development world. Their expertise helps HUD to meet the needs of communities throughout our nation. 
   Now, however, after these Community Builders have been hired, and in many instances, relocated in order to serve the communities in which they are most needed, the pending bill proposes to eliminate funding for the program. This step would be a serious waste of the investment that has been made in hiring these qualified and talented men and women who are willing to share their expertise to improve the way HUD serves the American people. 
   I urge my colleagues to address both of these issues as the conference committee works to reconcile the House and Senate bills. At a time when Secretary Cuomo has taken such significant steps to improve the management of the agency, we should not undermine programs which are meeting important needs and improving the way HUD serves the American people.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in 1991, the Ukrainian people, after decades of difficult and often tragic struggle, won their right to self-determination. They declared their independence,  as did other peoples of the former Soviet Union, fulfilling the wishes of generations of Ukrainians. 
   Eight years have now passed since that dramatic time, and Ukraine and U.S.-Ukrainian relations are stronger than ever. We now have a U.S.-Ukraine Joint Commission, chaired by Vice President GORE and President Kuchma, which seeks to improve bilateral relations on a wide range of issues. 
   A significant part of this effort is the sister city project to help Ukrainian communities develop more effective local government. I'm proud that the City of Lowell in Massachusetts is a sister city with the Ukrainian city of Berdiansk in this worthwhile project. 
   I especially commend the members of the Ukrainian-American community for their constant courage and commitment in championing the cause of Ukrainian independence over the years. They never gave up this struggle, even during the darkest days of the Cold War. They can be proud of their achievements. Their efforts in recent years have made Ukraine the third largest annual recipient of U.S. assistance. I'm prouder than ever to support their impressive efforts. 
   I also commend the Ukrainian-American community for its ongoing work to help American high school students understand that the Great Famine of the 1930s was a man-made terror-famine, used by Stalin to suppress the Ukrainian people. Millions of Ukrainians died in this great crime against humanity. 
   Sadly, the twentieth century has been filled with too many of these massive crimes. We must never forget the atrocities that have been inflicted on millions of citizens in other lands, including the Ukrainian people. We must do all we can to build a better world in the years ahead.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will be kind enough to yield for a question. 
   Mr. President, as I understand, half of the royalty is returned to the States. Is the Senator familiar with the fact that the amounts that are actually returned to the States go directly for the cause of education, the education funds of these States?

If the amendment of the Senator is carried, then they are going to be denied funding in a number of these States, some 24 different States. I think it is important to recognize--

   Mr. KENNEDY. I again want to ask the Senator: As I understand it, for example, the total share of the royalty funds that goes to the State of California, 100 percent, goes to public education of children in California. Does the Senator understand in Colorado it is some 60 percent, 100 percent in Louisiana? Those would be funds, if this amendment were carried, that would be directly denied to the public school system in those States and would have to be made up, or otherwise there would be cuts in those particular States. Does the Senator understand the relationship between what we are talking about here and the issue on education? It is very significant. 
   Maybe $60 million does not make a lot of difference to some Senators. But it could make a lot of difference if we were talking about the Reading Excellence Act which has just been cut over in House Appropriations. It makes a difference to 330,000 children--whether they are going to learn how to read. 
   We have those examples across the board: Colorado, 60 percent; North Dakota, 57 percent. Has there been any discussion on the floor of the Senate by those Senators on how they are going to make up the money? It seems to me we ought to have at least that kind of information. If you are going to cut out that funding for public education in the schools--and that is what this amendment does--we ought to understand where the other money is going to come from because you are taking it right out of public school education. 
   I do not know what the Senator's conclusions are, but when we realize we are dealing with the appropriations bill that is the last bill on the agenda, it maybe doesn't have a very high priority. Maybe that is one of the reason it has not been talked about very much by the Republicans, those on the other side. But this is money that comes right out of public education. It comes right out of support for public education in a number of these States.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I was interested in the Senator's viewpoint. At the very time we are meeting here, this very time this afternoon, the House appropriators are marking up the education bill. They have just cut $60 million out of the reading programs, the Reading Excellence Act, which would affect 330,000 children. This is what we are talking about. 
   Does the Senator agree with me that we have a limited role in public education? We provide 7 cents out of every dollar in education, but we provide it in targeted areas to try to begin to make some difference in local communities and in States so these efforts can be carried on and expanded if they are worthwhile. We have the Reading Excellence Act, which is just beginning to take hold, just beginning to make a difference. Mr. President, $60 million is a big hunk of change, and that is what this amounts to in total revenues--$66 million. 
   I just want to inquire of the Senator so the membership understands. When we refuse to defeat the Hutchison amendment, we are going to be disadvantaging States in the public education system.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Department of Defense authorization conference report for fiscal year 2000, and I congratulate our new chairman, Senator JOHN WARNER, on completing this first conference report as chairman. While I am disappointed that some provisions in the Senate version of the bill were dropped, on the whole it is an excellent piece of legislation and I am pleased to support it. 
   My most important concern is over the changes made in Title 32, which establishes the National Nuclear Security Administration and reorganizes the Department of Energy's nuclear laboratories. When we first considered this issue on the intelligence authorization bill in July, the Senate passed the Kyl amendment, which reorganized these nuclear labs by a vote of 96-1. Unfortunately, during conference deliberations, these provisions were substantially rewritten. Secretary Richrdson has expressed his strong objections to these provisions, and states that they will make it more difficult for the Secretary of energy to oversee the labs. I hope that the Armed Services Committee will work with Secretary Richardson to address his concerns in the fiscal year 2001 Defense authorization bill. 
   America has faced many global challenges this year that have re-emphasized the need for our Nation to maintain a well-trained and well-equipped military. This year's crisis in Kosovo was particularly challenging and required the Nation's Armed Forces to perform a wide variety of duties, including peacekeeping and humanitarian activities, in addition to sustained combat operations. Our service men and women performed superbly in all that was asked of them, and I commend them on their dedication, professionalism, and unwavering devotion to duty. Without their skill, we would not be as close to peace in the Balkans as we are today. 
   It is the duty of Congress to ensure that we provide our military with what is needs to meet the international challenges common in the post-cold-war era. America must be ready, when necessary, to protect its vital interests and encourage global stability. The fiscal year 2000 Defense conference report is a positive step toward ensuring that the Nation's military is prepared to meet the challenges of the years ahead. 
   The cornerstone of the military's preeminence rests on its most critical component, its people. Without adequate number of men and women willing to serve in the military, the Nation would not be able to respond to crises around the globe. We need cutting-edge weapon systems, but we also need dedicated men and women to operate these systems. The conference report contains many new initiatives and constructive changes in personnel policies that will help to ensure that we adequately provide for our servicemen and women and their families. 
   Specifically, the conference report provides a fully-funded and well-deserved 4.8 percent pay raise for military personnel, as well as expanded authority to offer additional pay and other incentives to retain service members in critical military specialties. The conference report also improves retirement benefits by addressing service members' concerns with the current system and approving their participation in the Thrift Savings Plan. 
   I am very disappointed, however, that Senator CLELAND's amendment to improve and expand GI bill benefits for servicemen and women was not included in the conference report. The Montgomery GI bill has been a very successful and important program for the military. But, in order for the GI bill to continue to be a valuable program, it must evolve as our military forces evolve. Access to higher education is an increasingly important issue for our servicemen and women in today's all-volunteer, professional military. Senator CLELAND's GI bill provisions, included in the Senate version of the bill, made needed improvements in the GI bill that would have enhanced the program's value and benefit to our troops, and would have improved its effectiveness as a recruiting tool. I commend Senator CLELAND on his leadership on these provisions and I urge my colleagues to reconsider these innovative ideas next year. 
   The DOD authorization conference report also reauthorizes and enhances the very successful Troops-to-Teachers program. Over the next ten years, the Nation's schools will need to hire two million new teachers to fill their classrooms. Troops-to-Teachers is helping to meet that challenge by recruiting and training servicemen and women to become teachers in public schools. This program was established by Congress in 1993 and has already placed over 3,000 servicemen and women in elementary and secondary schools in 48 states. The conference report also provides for the transfer of this program to the Department of Education, so that it will be coordinated with other federal education programs that are helping communities to improve their public schools. 
   Concern for our military personnel doesn't end with the active duty servicemember, but with the whole military family. Well over half of the members of today's military are married, and in many cases both parents are employed. The military also contains many single mothers and fathers. All of these individuals have unique characteristics and needs that must be recognized so that we can encourage their continued service and careers in the armed forces. 
   The conference report contains a provision, which I strongly supported, authorizing the Secretary of Defense to provide financial assistance for child care services and youth programs for members of the Armed Forces and their families. These expanded child care provisions will ensure that many more military families have access to quality childcare and after-school care for their children. 
   Also, military families are not immune to the epidemic of domestic violence that confronts the rest of America. We have a responsibility to military families to help prevent domestic violence, and to protect the victims when abuse occurs. 
   An important provision in this year's conference report requires the Secretary of Defense to appoint a military-civilian task force to review military policies on domestic violence. This task force, comprised of military, DOD, law enforcement personnel, and civilian advocates for battered women and children, will work with the Secretary of Defense to establish Department-wide standards for combating domestic violence. 
   These initiatives will include standard formats for memorandums of understanding between the armed services and local law enforcement authorities for responding to domestic violence; a requirement that commanding officers must provide a written copy of any no-contact or restraining order to victims of abuse; standard guidance for commanding officers on considering criminal charges in cases of domestic violence; and a standard training program for all commanding officers on domestic violence. 
   This provision also requires the Department to establish a database, the contents of which will be annually reported to Congress. The information  will include each domestic violence incident reported to military authorities and how that incident was resolved. This provision also requires the military-civilian task force to report to Congress annually about the progress made in combating domestic violence in the military. 
   The conference report also takes a number of worthwhile steps to address equipment modernization requirements that have been deferred for too long. The chairwoman of the Seapower Subcommittee, Senator SNOWE, took the lead this year in advocating a strong shipbuilding budget, as well as a strong research and development budget, for the Navy and Marine Corps. It was a privilege to work with her this year, and, I am pleased that this conference report takes these important steps to ensure that the Navy has the ships, submarines, and other equipment needed to sustain its operations throughout the world. 
   The conference report authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 Destroyer multi-year procurement into fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and increases the number of ships to be built from 12 to 18 ships. The conference report also authorizes the Navy to enter into a five-year multi-year procurement contract for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and increases the number of Marine Corps MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from 10 to 12. These are all strong steps in strengthening the readiness of the Nation's Navy-Marine Corps team. 
   Procurement isn't the only area where we need to strengthen our investment. We also need to strengthen investment in science and technology. Last year, the Defense authorization bill called for a 2 percent annual increase, above inflation, in military spending on science and technology from 2000 to 2008. Unfortunately, the Department's proposed fiscal year 2000 budget reduced spending on science and technology programs. The Air Force alone was slated for $95 million in cuts in science and technology funding. Such a decline would have been detrimental to national defense, particularly when the battlefield environment is becoming more and more reliant on high technology. 
   Fortunately, thanks in great part to the chairman of the Emerging Threats and Technology Subcommittee, Senator ROBERTS, and his ranking member, Senator BINGAMAN, Congress restored much of this Air Force science and technology funding. This restoration will help to ensure that high quality scientists and engineers are available to conduct research to address the Department's technology needs for the future. Congress has taken a clear position in support of maintaining sound investments in Defense science and technology programs. I urge the Department to request a strong science and technology budget next year, one that will ensure the future of these important programs. 
   One of the most significant of these science and technology fields is cyber-security. The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on the Department of Defense's computer systems are cause for concern, and they highlight the need for improved protection of the nation's critical defense networks. This conference report includes a substantial increase in research and development for defenses against cyber attacks, and this increase will greatly improve the Department's focus on this emerging threat. 
   Existing threats from the cold war are also addressed in this legislation. Financial assistance to the nations of the former Soviet Union for nonproliferation activities such as the Nunn-Lugar Comprehensive Threat Reduction programs is essential for our national security. I commend the administration's plans to continue funding these valuable initiatives, and I commend a Congress' support for them. 
   One of the most serious threats to our national security is the danger of terrorism, particularly using biological, chemical or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. We must do all we can to prevent our enemies from acquiring these devastating weapons, and do all we can to keep terrorists from being able to conduct an attack on our nation. Significant progress has been made to strengthen the nation's response to such attacks, but more must be done. The conference report strengthens counter-terrorism activities and increases support for the National Guard teams that are part of this important effort. 
   Again, I commend my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee for their leadership on these important national security issues. This conference report is essential for our national security in the years ahead, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I oppose the amendment offered by Senator SMITH of New Hampshire. I am a strong supporter of AmeriCorps and the positive changes that Corps members have made and continues to make in communities across this country AmeriCorps members are doing an outstanding job helping children in schools. Over two and one half million children have been taught, tutored or mentored in the nation's schools, and half a million children have been served in after-school programs through AmeriCorps. 
   AmeriCorps members give a year of their life to tackle critical problems like literacy, crime and poverty. After their year of service, AmeriCorps members receive education awards to help finance college or pay back students loans. AmeriCorps enables its volunteers to improve their communities while improving themselves. 
   In Massachusetts, the Service Alliance distributes $13 million in grants a year to more than 200 service and volunteer programs across the state. More than 180,000 citizens have contributed 3.5 million hours of service--mentoring young people, helping the homeless, and cleaning up neighborhoods. Through programs like City Year, Habitat for Humanity and Boys and Girls Clubs, volunteers have a wide choice in activities and are bringing their talent and enthusiasm to communities across the state. 
   I urge the Senate to reject this amendment and maintain strong bipartisan support for these important programs. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I hope our colleagues pay careful attention to the excellent presentation that has been made by my friend and colleague from New Mexico. I think all Members who are fortunate enough to serve on the Education Committee know Senator BINGAMAN has been tireless in addressing the issue of enhancing the quality of education for the children of this country. This afternoon he outlined very important, thoughtful steps that I think ought to draw strong bipartisan support. He has certainly urged our colleagues to try to find ways in which we can work together in support of those proposals. I join with him in urging our colleagues to do so. 
   For the number of years I have been in the Senate, the issue of education has never been a partisan issue. I think for the first 15 years I was in the Senate on the Education Committee, we never had a single vote that divided Republicans and Democrats on issues of education--not that we always got it right, but we always attempted to find ways of working closely together. 
   We recognize there are limited resources we can provide for education, probably 7 cents out of every $1, but what the American people are looking for is a partnership to try to find ways we can enhance educational opportunities to children. 
   I rise somewhat reluctantly to draw attention to the fact that we are in a very desperate situation as we come to the end of this session in regards to addressing the issues of education. I think many of us remember the early January speeches by our Republican leader. Senator LOTT said, ``Education is going to be a central issue this year. The Democrats say it's important and it should be a high priority. Republicans say it's a high priority.'' Many were hoping this was the clarion call for all to come together and work together. We had similar statements by our good friend, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI, who said, ``I'm going to recommend the Republicans say it's time to quit playing around the edges and dramatically increase the amount of money that we put in public education.'' This was enormously encouraging. 
   At the outset, I will say just allocating resources is not always the answer to the challenges we are facing in education. It is a pretty clear indication of what our Nation's priorities are. We heard from the leadership in the Senate the rhetoric that this was going to be the education Congress and the education year. 
   It is appropriate that we look back over this past year and over the past few years to find out exactly what our record has been under this leadership in the areas of education. I can remember right after the 1994 elections with the new leadership elected in the House and the Senate of the United States Congress, one of the first things we had was not an appropriation of additional funding in the areas of education, but we had a recision. 
   What does a recision mean? It means it is the judgment of the House, the Senate, and the President to allocate certain resources in the education programs. In my hand I have the conference report, the 1995 recisions: $1.7 billion in the House of Representatives. Those were programs, for example, such as the Title I program to help some of the neediest children; it was cut back almost a third; the Eisenhower Professional Development Programs, which enhance teacher qualities for math and science in our high schools, cut $100 million; the Safe and Drug Free Schools, cut $472 million. 
   We air a great deal of rhetoric on the floor of the Senate about how we will make our schools more safe and secure. Going back to 1995, we find the attempted recisions in the areas of education. Then in 1996--I have the report on the appropriations, the request from the House appropriations which is 
   $3.9 billion below the 1995 figures. That is under the Republican leadership in the House of Representatives--$3.9 billion below. 
   Does this sound as if it is beginning to be a pattern? 
   Wait just a moment, and we will find out what happened in 1997. I have the committee report on appropriations for 1997. This was $3.1 billion below the President's request. 
   Now we have 1995, we have 1996, we have 1997; we have 1998, $200 million below the President's total; and now, 1999, $2 billion below the President's request. 
   That is a fearsome record in terms of the allocation of scarce education resources. Now we see this happening again this year. That is why Democrats are so concerned. 
   We have seen under the Republican leadership a recommendation of a 17  percent cut in education that would be represented by a $15 billion cut this year in the education programs on an appropriation that we cannot even have sent here to the Senate. We find that somewhat distressing and disturbing. 
   What has happened in the past when the Republican leadership had responsibilities? The education proposal in 1995 came in 7 months after the end of the fiscal year. In 1997, the final agreement was not passed until the final day of the old fiscal year, September 30, 1996. In 1998, it was passed 1 week after the end of the fiscal year. In 1999, it was passed 3 weeks after the end of the fiscal year. 
   There is a pattern here--cutting back on education resources and doing it at the very end, the last business for the Congress. 
   If a political party wants to put education at the top of the American agenda, it doesn't come last, it comes first. It doesn't come with the greatest kinds of cuts we have seen in any appropriations bill in recent times; it comes after due deliberation of these very needs and requirements and then the support for those programs. That is the way we deal with it. 
   That is what we find as we come into the last weeks--the enormous frustration of many in this body who believe very deeply, as the American public does, that if we are going to meet our responsibilities in education, we ought to have the opportunity to debate these issues in a timely way and not have the efforts that have been made on 17 different occasions when we tried to bring up various amendments, to have those amendments either immediately tabled or immediately effectively ignored, virtually denying Members the opportunity of having a full and complete debate on what are our fundamental and basic responsibilities for a national Congress and a President of the United States in education. 
   So I believe the Republican leadership bear grave responsibilities in this area. We will over these next few days point this out in very careful detail, about what these particular cuts and programs are, and how they have really affected and adversely impacted the opportunities for children to move ahead. That is the record. It is one of great discouragement, and it is one I hope our Republican friends will be willing to address.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last Thursday the majority leader filed a cloture motion on S. 625, the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. If the Senate adopts cloture, an amendment to increase the minimum wage could not be offered to the bill. Some Senators may support cloture because they believe the minimum wage is not relevant to the bankruptcy debate, but I disagree. Raising the minimum wage is critical to preventing the economic free-fall that often leads to bankruptcy, and many of us have sponsored the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999 to begin to right that wrong.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, invoking cloture would deny us the opportunity, on the floor of the Senate, to offer a minimum wage amendment that will raise the minimum wage 50 cents next January and 50 cents the year after and provide some $2,000 of purchasing power for minimum wage workers. In all, over 11 million Americans will benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. 
   We seek to raise the minimum wage at a time of virtual price stability, at a time of virtual full employment, and at a time when the ink is not even dry on the vote by the Members of the Senate to give themselves a pay increase of over $4,000 this year. I will say, at least the Democrats who voted in support of that increase would also vote in support of an increase in the minimum wage. But why should we be denied that opportunity? Why should we be denied the opportunity to have a vote on this particular issue? It makes such a difference to families that work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year. 
   We believe raising the minimum wage is relevant to the bankruptcy issue. The threat of bankruptcy is related to the availability of resources. The fewer financial resources individuals have, the more difficult it is for them to meet their economic challenges. We do not have the opportunity, at least at this time, to get into all of the reasons so many individual Americans are going into bankruptcy. But we find half of the women are in bankruptcy because their husbands refuse to pay child support. Of workers who are over 55, the greatest percentage of those in bankruptcy are there because they don't have health insurance. Many in bankruptcy are workers dislocated from their jobs because of mergers, who find themselves caught in a downward economic spiral. 
   We should have an opportunity to address those issues. Why does the Republican leadership deny us the chance to have a fair vote on raising the minimum wage, providing hard working Americans with an extra $2,000? That might not seem like a lot to many here, but it is about 7 months' worth of groceries for a family, or 5 months of rent. It will pay for almost two years of tuition for a worker or her son or daughter to attend a community college. It is a lot of money for many hard-working Americans. 
   Finally, the minimum wage is a children's issue because the children of workers who earn minimum wage are impacted by their parents' scarce resources. It is a women's issue, because the majority of minimum wage workers are women. It is a civil rights 
   issue because one-third of minimum wage workers are African-American or Hispanic. It is basically and most fundamentally a fairness issue. At the time of the greatest prosperity in the history of this country, are we going to continue to deny our brothers and sisters, Americans who are working hard, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks of the year, the opportunity to have a livable wage?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for several months, many of us have been concerned about the Senate's continuing delays in acting on President Clinton's nominees to the federal courts. Since the Senate convened in January, we have confirmed only 17 judges and 43 are still waiting for action. These delays can only be described as an abdication of the Senate's constitutional responsibility to work with the President and ensure the integrity of our federal courts. 
   At the current rate it will take years to confirm the remainder of the judicial nominees currently pending before the Judiciary Committee. This kind of partisan, Republican stonewalling is irresponsible and unacceptable. It's hurting the courts and it's hurting the country. It's the worst kind of ``do nothing'' tactic by this ``do nothing'' Senate. 
   The continuing delays are a gross perversion of the confirmation process that has served this country well for more than 200 years. When the Founders wrote the Constitution and gave the Senate the power of advice and consent on Presidential nominations, they never intended the Senate to work against the President, as this Senate is doing, by engaging in a wholesale stall and refusing to act on large numbers of the President's nominees. 
   Currently, there are 61 vacancies in the federal judiciary, and several more are likely to arise in the coming months, as more and more judges retire from the federal bench. Of the 61 current vacancies, 22 have been classified as ``judicial emergencies'' by the Judicial Conference of the United States, which means they have been vacant for 18 months or more. 
   The vast majority of these nominees are clearly well-qualified, and would be confirmed by overwhelming votes of approval. It would be an embarrassment for our Republican colleagues to vote against them. It should be even more embarrassing for the Republican majority in the Senate to abdicate their clear constitutional responsibility to do what they were elected to do. 
   The delay has been especially unfair to nominees who are women and minorities. Last year, two-thirds of the nominees who waited the longest for confirmation were women or minorities. Already, in this Congress, the Senate is on track to repeat last year's dismal performance. Of the 11 nominees who have been waiting more than  a year to be confirmed, 7 are women or minorities. On the 50th anniversary of President Truman's appointment of the first African American to the Court of Appeals--Judge William Hastie--the Republican leadership should be ashamed of this record, particularly 
   given the caliber of the distinguished African American, Latino, and female nominees waiting for confirmation. 
   For example, Marsha Berzon, Richard Paez, and Ronnie White have waited too long--far too long--for a vote on the Senate floor. Ms. Berzon is an outstanding attorney with an impressive record. She has written more than 100 briefs and petitions to the Supreme Court, and has argued four cases there. When she was first nominated last year, she received strong recommendations and had a bipartisan list of supporters, including our former colleague, Senator Jim McClure, and Fred Alvarez, a Commissioner on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Assistant Secretary of Labor under President Reagan. Her nomination is also supported by major law enforcement organizations, and by many of those who have opposed her in court. 
   Ms. Berzon was first nominated in January 1998--20 months later, the Senate has still not voted on her nomination. 
   The Senate is also irresponsibly refusing to vote on two other distinguished nominees--Judge Ronnie White, an African American Supreme Court judge in the state of Missouri, and California District Court Judge Richard Paez. Judge White was nominated to serve on the District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri more than two years ago. Judge Paez was first nominated three years ago--three years ago--to serve on the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
   It is true that some Senators have voiced concerns about these nominations. But that should not prevent a roll call vote which gives every Senator the opportunity to vote ``yes'' or ``no.'' These nominees and their families deserve a decision by the Senate. Parties with cases, waiting to be heard by the federal courts deserve a decision by the Senate. Ms. Berzon, Judge White, and Judge Paez deserve a decision by this Senate. 
   While Republican leaders play politics with the federal judiciary, countless individuals and businesses across the country are forced to endure needless delays in obtaining the justice they deserve. Justice is being delayed and denied in courtrooms across the country because of the unconscionable tactics of the Senate Republican majority. 
   It is long past time to act on these and other nominations. I urge my Republican colleagues to end this partisan stall and allow the President's nominees to have the vote by the Senate that they deserve.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, the construction trades in particular are quite dangerous. Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman reported recently that ``injuries and illnesses for construction laborers, carpenters, and welders and cutters increased by a total of 8,000 cases.'' Truck drivers, too, suffer more than their share of injuries, incurring approximately 145,000 work-related injuries or illnesses each year. 
   For the average worker, backs take the brunt of the injuries. About 4 out of 10 injuries involve strains and sprains, most of them back-related. Women are more susceptible than men to repetitive motion illnesses from jobs such as keyboarding, data entry, cashier work and scanning. These musculoskeletal disorders, known as MSDs, include carpal-tunnel syndrome and tendinitis. Many are caused by faulty ergonomic conditions in the workplace, such as poorly placed furniture and improper counter heights, say industrial hygiene, IH, professionals, experts in occupational and environmental health and safety. 
   I thank the Senator for yielding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator DURBIN in introducing the ``Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 1999. I commend our colleagues in the House, Representatives CHRIS SMITH, LUIS GUTIERREZ, and others, who introduced a companion bill last month. This legislation has the strong support of the Clinton administration, because it is a key component of America's effort to support democracy and stability in Central America and Haiti. 
   Two years ago, Congress enacted the Nicaraguan Adjustment and Central American Relief Act, which protects Nicaraguan and Cuban refugees by enabling them to remain permanently in the United States as immigrants. But many Central Americans and Haitians were unfairly excluded from that bill. At that time, many of us in Congress opposed the unfairness and discrimination involved in treating Nicaraguans and Cubans more favorably than similarly situated Central Americans and Haitians. We believe all of these refugees should be treated equally. 
   It is time for Congress to end this disparity. With this legislation, we are remedying this flagrant omission and adding Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans, and Haitians to the list of deserving refugees. 
   These Central American and Haitian refugees, like Nicaraguans and Cubans, fled decades of violence, human rights abuses, and economic instability resulting from political repression. They suffered persecution at the hands of successive repressive governments. Central Americans and Haitians supporting democracy have faced torture, extra-judicial killings, imprisonment, and other forms of persecution. These and other gross violations of human rights have been documented by the State Department, and by human rights organizations such as Americas Watch and Amnesty International. 
   Like other political refugees, Central Americans and Haitians have come to this country with a strong love of freedom and a strong commitment to democracy. They have settled in many parts of the United States. They have established deep roots in our communities, and their children, that have been born here, are U.S. citizens. Wherever they have settled, they have made lasting contributions to the economic vitality and diversity of our communities and our nation. 
   Citizens in these countries are now working hard to establish democracy in their nations. President Clinton and Secretary Albright have repeatedly stated that it is America's long-standing foreign policy to ensure the continuing stability and viability of emerging, yet still fragile, democracies in Central America and Haiti. The Central American and Haitian communities in the United States have contributed substantially to this goal, sending hundreds of millions of dollars to their native lands. These funds have played a critical role in stabilizing these countries' economies as they make the transition 
   to democracy, at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. 
   The State Department has documented the potential adverse consequences of reducing the flow of these funds. From a U.S. foreign policy and humanitarian standpoint, these amounts have taken on added importance. These funds have become a primary source of income for families who lost their jobs as a result of the hurricanes that ravaged these countries last year. Repatriating thousands of Central Americans and Haitians will impose a substantial additional burden on these countries. It will also diminish the ability of Central Americans and Haitians in the U.S. to contribute financially to rebuilding their countries. Allowing Central Americans and Haitians to remain here as legal residents will enable them to continue to provide assistance that will contribute substantially to vital economic recovery and reconstruction. 
   This legislation will provide qualified Salvadorans, Guatemalans, Hondurans and Haitians with the opportunity to become permanent residents of the U.S. To qualify for this relief, they must have lived in this country since December 1995. By approving the Central American and Haitian Parity Act, we can finally bring an end to the shameful decades of disparate treatment that has existed.  
   This is an issue of basic fairness. The United States has a long and noble tradition of providing safe haven to refugees. Over the years, we have enacted legislation to guarantee safe haven for Hungarians, Cubans, Yugoslavs, Vietnamese, Laotians, Cambodians, Poles, Chinese, and many others. 
   This Congress has the opportunity to right the shameful wrongs that Central American and Haitian refugees have suffered. This bill offers the full protection of our laws to these victims of persecution in their fight for democracy. Congress has a duty to offer the same protection to Central Americans and Haitians that we have offered over the years to other refugees fleeing from repressive regimes. This bill does what is fair, what is right, and what is just. 
   We should do all we can to end the current flagrant discrimination under our immigration laws. Central American and Haitian refugees deserve protection too--the same protection we gave to Nicaraguans and Cubans. We need to pay more than lip service to the fundamental principle of equal protection of the laws. 
   Since its introduction in the House of Representatives, the Central American and Haitian Parity Act has received important bipartisan support. I am optimistic that it will receive similar support in the Senate. It deserves to be enacted as soon as possible.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to take this opportunity to recognize a community leader who has given so much to the people of Southeastern Massachusetts. Rosemary Wahlberg has been a Director of the Quincy Community Action Programs for twenty-six years. Under her leadership, these programs have helped large numbers of families on issues ranging from education to healthcare to child care to energy conservation. This year Rosemary is retiring, and her loss will be felt deeply by all of those whose lives she has touched. 
   Rosemary's commitment to public service is extraordinary. Throughout her many years of service, she has helped people to make impressive progress in improving their quality of life. As an advocate and coordinator, she has assisted South Shore communities in the battle to reduce poverty and promote self-sufficiency for low-income families. She has served as a member of the Quincy Housing Authority, on the Quincy College Board of Trustees, and on the Board of Directors for numerous local, state, and regional committees devoted to community service. 
   Rosemary's accomplishments have earned wide recognition. She has received distinguished awards from the City of Quincy, the University of Massachusetts, the South Shore Coalition for Human Rights, the Atlantic Neighborhood Assocation, South Shore Day Care Services, and many other grateful organizations, who recognize the boundless energy, ability and commitment she pours into every project. 
   For all of us who know Rosemary, we are inspired by her dedication to those less fortunate in our society. She has served the people of Quincy and the South Shore with extraordinary distinction, and she is a dear friend to all of us in the Kennedy family. In addition to all of her other activities, she has been devoted to her wonderful family, raising eight children and caring for twenty-one grandchildren. 
   It is with the greatest respect and admiration that I pay tribute to this remarkable leader. Her public service and generosity are a shining example to us all. I know that I speak for all of the people of Massachusetts when I say that she will be missed greatly.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of the most important provisions in this bill is its support for the National Endowments for the Arts and Humanities. These agencies provide essential Federal support for cultural activities in communities across America. The arts and humanities are a central part of our democracy, our history and our heritage and they eminently deserve this federal support. 
   It is important for the federal government to create an environment which supports the arts and humanities in our nation. The Endowments have done an outstanding job in providing this needed support. They have provided assistance to theaters, museums, dance companies, and a wide range of cultural activities in communities and neighborhoods in every state. 
   The federal role is not an isolated one. It functions in partnership with local and state governments and the private sector. Across the country, mayors have been among the strongest supporters of the arts, because they know that a strong cultural community attracts families and businesses to our cities. Cultural tourism is a growth industry in states throughout the country. 
   Federal support provides needed assistance to cultural institutions, and it also provides critical support in schools. Today's schools face a broad range of challenges, and a compelling body of research demonstrates a strong correlation between study of the arts and academic achievement. The arts are ``the Fourth R,'' and they deserve to have a significant role in the educational experience of all children. 
   In 1998, students with course work in music scored 52 points higher on the verbal portion and 36 points higher on the math portion of the SAT. With results like these, it is clear that we should find effective ways to integrate arts education into the classroom curriculum so that music, painting, drama and other arts can enrich the educational experience of all students. 
   The Endowments have often been the subject of criticism over the last several years. But Congress has imposed reforms that have virtually eliminated controversy over grant awards. 
   The Arts Endowment has worked hard to improve its operations and to respond to the concerns expressed by members of Congress. Its current chair, Bill Ivey, has proposed a major new initiative, Challenge America, that will emphasize outreach projects for education, including after-school programs involving the arts, historic preservation and measures to develop the arts infrastructure in communities. He has also implemented ``ArtsReach'' which will encourage applications and grants to states that have received few grants in the past. 
   The Humanities Endowment has undertaken a leadership role to improve teacher training using the Internet and other technologies to ensure that new public programs in the humanities reach classrooms in as many communities as possible. 
   These agencies are doing all that they can to expand the scope of cultural activities in America. It is essential that we provide them with the resources necessary to carry out their important mission. I support efforts to increase funding for the agencies, so that they can more fully achieve their important goals. As the statute creating the agencies emphasized, the United States cannot afford to limit its efforts to science and technology alone, but should give fair and full support to the other great branches of scholarly and cultural endeavors in our society, in order to achieve a better understanding of the past, a better analysis of the present, and a better vision of the future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support funding for these agencies, and I hope that at long last we can give them the support that they have earned.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in commemorating this impressive anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964. Thirty-five years ago, Congress passed this benchmark legislation, which has opened the door for extensive new protections of wilderness areas throughout the nation. 
   In 1924, the U.S. Forest Service named the Gila National Forest in New Mexico as the first wilderness area. As years passed, it became increasingly clear that a more comprehensive strategy of protection for these priceless areas was needed. Between 1957 and 1964, nine congressional hearings were held, resulting in sixty-six rewrites of the original bill. This enormous amount of attention can be credited to the strong grassroots support for preserving these magnificent resources. As a result, Congress passed the Wilderness Act. It was signed into law by President Lyndon Johnson on September 3, 1964, and established over nine million acres of wilderness areas throughout the country. 
   The act defined wilderness as ``an area where the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.'' Although sharply restricting human activities in these areas, the Act also paid tribute to a piece of our national identity. To Americans, the wilderness is a place to rediscover what it means to be American. As Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas once noted, ``Roadless areas are one pledge of freedom.'' From the time of the first settlers, the nation's wilderness areas have been symbols of freedom and human ingenuity that characterize the American dream. 
   In his classic work, Wilderness and the American Mind, Roderick Nash observed the close relationship between our citizens and such areas, stating ``Take away wilderness and you take away the opportunity to be American.'' The Wilderness Act has protected these priceless undeveloped areas, and it has preserved these magnificent resources for our time and for all time. 
   Since this law was enacted, Congress has created over six hundred wilderness areas, totaling more than one hundred million acres in states across our nation. These are areas that cannot be developed or destroyed, but will retain the original splendor of their natural beauty. 
   It was a special privilege for me to support the Wilderness Act in 1964, as one of the most far-reaching actions by Congress to preserve our environmental heritage. All of us take pride in the many beautiful areas designated under the Act. 
   Finally, I commend all those who have done so much to uphold the great tradition of the Wilderness Act, by working in the agencies that are committed to protecting the nation's wilderness. As the act itself so eloquently states, they continue to ``secure for the American people of present and future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of wilderness.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator FEINGOLD on this legislation to prohibit assistance to the Government of Indonesia until that nation permits the peaceful implementation of the results of the August 30 referendum, in which the people of East Timor overwhelmingly voted in favor of independence from Indonesia. This bill sends a clear and strong message to the Government of Indonesia that the United States will hold it responsible for the fate of the East Timorese people. 
   Tragically, we are now faced with a crisis of alarming proportions as a result of the Indonesian government's failure to disarm the militias and to guarantee the security of the East Timorese people. The militias, together with Indonesian military and security personnel, are committing gross violations of human rights. Hundreds of East Timorese have been killed and tens of thousands have been forced to flee their homes, seeking refuge in West Timor. Hundreds have sought asylum in the UN compound in the East Timorese capital of Dili. Bishop Belo's home was burned and he was forced to seek asylum in Australia. UN personnel have been attacked and two were killed. Journalists have been threatened and forced to leave East Timor. The militias and the Indonesian military and security personnel perpetrating this violence must be stopped. 
   All of us are deeply concerned over the violence and the likelihood of further bloodshed in the coming days. The Indonesian Government must take responsibility for the actions of its military and security personnel. If the Government of Indonesia cannot or will not stop the violence, it must permit the international community to do so. I strongly support the call for an international peacekeeping force, authorized by the United Nations Security Council, to intervene to restore security in East Timor and to implement the results of the referendum. 
   By stopping all U.S. assistance to Indonesia, this legislation will encourage the Indonesian government to meet its international commitments and to ensure that its military and security forces abide by international law. The United States and the international community must use their economic leverage to encourage the Indonesian government to stop the violence in East Timor and permit a peaceful transition to independence. As long as this crisis continues, international financial institutions must not permit additional resources to flow to the Indonesian government--resources which could be used by military and security forces to continue the violence. In particular, the International Monetary Fund should not approve the disbursement of the remaining $2 billion of an already-approved $12 billion loan. 
   The Indonesian government must know that these sanctions will remain in effect until it ensures the safety of the East Timorese people, permits the United Nations Assistance Mission in East Timor to implement the transition to independence, and ensures that its armed forces abide by the principles of international law. 
   The people of East Timor need our help. Despite grave threats, they demonstrated great courage and great faith in the democratic process by going to the polls and voting overwhelmingly in favor of independence. The Government of Indonesia has an obligation to respect that verdict and see that it is implemented peacefully. The international community should do all it can to stop the violence and facilitate the peaceful transition to independence.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of Richard Holbrooke to be America's Ambassador to the United Nations, and I am pleased that the Congressional delay in reaching this vote has finally ended. 
   Richard Holbrooke has a long and distinguished record of public service and is an outstanding diplomat. He clearly has the necessary experience, background, and skills to ably represent America's interests at the United Nations. 
   Richard Holbrooke has served with great distinction in many previous capacities, and all of us who know him have great respect for his ability and judgement. He has served as the President's Special Envoy to Cyprus, as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, as U.S. Ambassador to Germany, as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and as a Peace Corps Director in Morocco. 
   Of his many extraordinary accomplishments, he is best known for his skillful work in presiding over the long and difficult negotiations to achieve the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995, which ended the war in Bosnia. 
   The United Nations is a complex institution involving many international interests, and I'm confident that Richard Holbrooke will represent our country well. Our representative must be an exceptional negotiator. Richard Holbrooke is a skilled negotiator with the ability to articulate clearly our country's ideals and persuade other members of the international community to support these ideals as well. He's an outstanding choice for this very important foreign policy position, and I'm proud to express my strong support.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just a few moments we are going to be casting an extremely important vote that will in many ways have a dramatic impact on the economy of this country. 
   I had the opportunity to be here in 1981 when we had a Republican proposal on a tax program. At that time there were 12 of us who voted in opposition to that program. But it passed, and we saw our Federal debt grow from $400 billion to close to $4 trillion over the period of the next years because of the economic forces that were put in place by that tax program. 
   It had a very dramatic impact, particularly in terms of the allocations of wealth and the distribution of wealth here in the United States. Those that had resources benefited enormously, but for the great majority of the Americans, they had to work longer and harder just to hold on. 
   Then in 1993, the Democrats passed a very important tax measure. The implications of that tax program, which took some belt tightening, so to speak, had a very dramatic impact in terms of our economy. That policy, more than any other single action we have seen, has had a more positive impact on our economy than any other action that has been taken by the Government. The point is that a tax bill of this magnitude has enormous impact on our economy as well as in relation to the issues of distribution. We now have before us, in 1999, a third rather dramatic proposal. 
   Mr. President, very few decisions we make in Congress will have more impact on the long-term economic well-being of our nation than how we allocate the projected surplus. By our vote today, we are setting priorities that will determine whether the American economy is on firm ground or dangerously shifting sand as we enter the 21st century. This vote will determine whether we have the financial capacity to meet our responsibilities to future generations, and whether we have fairly shared the economic benefits of our current prosperity. Sadly, the legislation before us today fails all of these tests. We should vote to reject it. 
   A tax cut of the enormous magnitude proposed by our Republican colleagues would reverse the sound fiscal management which has created the inflation-free economic growth of recent years. That is the clear view of the two principal architects of our current prosperity--Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan. Devoting the entire on-budget surplus to tax cuts will deprive us of the funds essential to preserving Medicare and Social Security for future generations of retirees. It will force harsh cuts in education, in medical research, and in other vital domestic priorities. This tax cut jeopardizes our financial future--and it also dismally  flunks the test of fairness. When fully implemented, the Republican plan would give 80% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 20% of the population. The richest 1%--those earning over $300,000 a year--would receive tax breaks as high as $46,000 a year, while working men and women would receive an average of only $138 a year--less than 40 cents a day. 
   Republicans claim that the ten year surplus is three trillion dollars and that they are setting two-thirds of it aside for Social Security, and only spending one-third on tax cuts. That explanation is grossly misleading. The two trillion dollars they say they are giving to Social Security already belongs to Social Security. It consists of payroll tax dollars expressly raised for the purpose of paying future Social Security benefits. Clearly, these dollars are insufficient to achieve our goal of protecting Social Security for future generations. Yet, Republicans are not providing a single new dollar to strengthen Social Security. They are not extending the life of the Trust Fund for even one day. It is a mockery to characterize those payroll tax dollars as part of the surplus. 
   That leaves the $964 billion on-budget surplus as the only funds which are available to address all of the nation's unmet needs over the next ten years. Republicans propose to use that entire amount to fund their tax cut scheme. Since CBO projections assume that all surplus dollars are devoted to debt reduction, the $964 billion figure includes over $140 billion in debt service savings. The amount which is available to be spent--either to address public needs or to cut taxes--is only slightly above $800 billion. As a result, the $792 billion Republican tax cut will consume the entire surplus. It will inevitably usher in a new era of deficits--just as the baby boom generation is reaching retirement age. 
   Most Americans understand the word ``surplus'' to mean dollars remaining after all financial obligations have been met. If that common sense definition is applied to the federal budget, the surplus would be far smaller than $964 billion. 
   We have existing obligations which should be our first responsibility. We have an obligation to preserve Medicare for future generations of retirees, and to modernize Medicare benefits to include prescription drug assistance. The Republican budget does not provide one additional dollar to met these Medicare needs. 
   The American people clearly believe that strengthening Social Security and Medicare should be our highest priority for using the surplus. By margins of more than two to one, they view preserving Social Security and Medicare as more important than cutting taxes. 
   We should use the surplus to meet these existing responsibilities first, in order to fulfill the promise of a retirement with both financial security and health security. If we do nothing, Medicare will become insolvent by 2015. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to preserve Medicare, without reducing medical care, or raising premiums for senior citizens, or raising the retirement age. The Republican tax cut would take the opportunity away. It would leave nothing for Medicare. In fact, this legislation will actually force additional cuts over the next five years. Under existing budget rules, which Republicans have refused to modify, the enactment of this tax bill will force a sequester of Medicare funds. 
   Senate Democrats have a realistic alternative. We have proposed to use one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next ten years--to strength Medicare and to assist senior citizens with the cost of prescription drugs. The Administration's 15 year budget plan provides an additional $500 billion for Medicare between 2010 and 2014. Enactment of the Republican tax cut would make this $800 billion transfer to Medicare impossible. If we squander the entire surplus on tax breaks, there will be no money left to keep our commitment to the nation's elderly. 
   Unless we use a portion of the surplus to strengthen Medicare, senior citizens will be confronted with nearly a trillion dollars in health care cuts and skyrocketing premiums. We know who the people are who will carry this enormous burden. The typical Medicare beneficiary is a widow, seventy-six years old, with an annual income of $10,000. She has one or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet the Republican budget would force deep cuts in her Medicare benefits in order to pay for this exorbitant tax out 
   The Republican tax cut, if enacted, will also make it impossible for us to assist Medicare recipients with the high cost of prescription drugs. That is one of the choices each of us will make when we vote on this bill. 
   The cost of prescription drugs eats up a disproportionately large share of the typical elderly household's income. Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the high cost to prescription drugs. Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense costs to Medicare--because they are not receiving the drugs they need. Pharmaceutical products 
   are increasingly the source of medical miracles--but senior citizens are being denied access to the full benefit of these new drug therapies. Remedying these inequities should be our priority. Instead, with these enormous GOP tax breaks, we are ignoring the basic needs of the elderly. 
   The Republicans claim that their tax bill provides a prescription drug benefit for the elderly--but it is a meaningless provision which few if any seniors will ever be able to use. The provision is contingent on a whole series of other legislative actions that may not occur. Thus, it may never take effect. Even if it takes effect, it provides an above the line tax deduction for private insurance premiums which can only be used by the small percentage of more affluent senior citizens who itemize deductions. The vast majority of elderly taxpayers will never be able to use this provision. 
   The projected surplus also assumes drastic cuts in a wide range of existing programs over the next decade--cuts in domestic programs such as education, medical research and environmental cleanup; and even cuts in national defense. We have an obligation to adequately fund these programs. If existing programs grow at the rate of inflation over the next decade--and no new programs are created and no existing programs are expanded--the surplus would be reduced by $584 billion. That is the amount it will cost to merely continue funding current discretionary programs at their inflation-adjusted level. 
   In other words, the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy would necessitate more than a twenty percent across the board cut in discretionary spending--in both domestic programs and national defense--by the end of the next decade. If defense is funded at the Administration's proposed level--and it is highly unlikely that the Republican Congress will do less--domestic spending would have to be cut 38% by 2009. No one can reasonably argue that cuts that deep should be made, or will be made. 
   We know what cuts of this magnitude would mean in human terms by the end of the decade. We know who will be hurt. 
   375,000 fewer children will receive a Head Start. 
   6.5 million fewer children will participate in Title I education programs for disadvantaged students. 
   14,000 fewer biomedical research grants will be available from the National Institutes of Health. 
   1,431,000 fewer veterans will receive VA medical care. 
   These are losses that the American people will not be willing to accept. 
   The Democratic alternative would restore $290 billion for such domestic priorities, substantially reducing the size of the proposed cuts. A significant reduction would still be required over the decade. One thing is clear--even with a bare bones budget, we cannot afford a tax cut of the magnitude the Republicans are proposing. 
   Our Republican colleagues claim that these enormous tax cuts will have no impact on Social Security, because they are not using payroll tax revenues. On the contrary, the fact that the Republican budget commits every last dollar of the on-budget surplus to tax cuts does imperil Social Security. 
   Revenue estimates projected ten years into the future are notoriously  unreliable. As the Director of the Congressional Budget Office candidly acknowledged: ``Ten year budget projections are highly uncertain.'' Despite this warning, the Republicans tax cut leaves no margin for error. If we commit the entire surplus to tax cuts and the full surplus does not materialize, or if we have unbudgeted emergency expenses, Social Security revenues will be required to cover the shortfall. 
   The vote which we cast today--the choices which we make--will say a great deal about our values. We should use the surplus as an opportunity to help those in need--senior citizens living on small fixed incomes, children who need educational opportunities, millions of men and women whose lives may well depend on medical research and access to quality health care. We should not use the surplus to further enrich those who are already the most affluent. The issue is a question of fundamental values and fundamental fairness. 
   Unfortunately, Republicans returned from the Senate-House Conference with a substantially more regressive bill than the one the Senate passed last week. The current bill contains a costly reduction in capital gains tax rates which was not in the Senate bill. The current bill completely eliminates the estate tax, providing enormous new tax breaks to the richest few. It also provides more than twice as much in tax cuts for multinational corporations as the Senate bill did. Yet, the permanent extension of the research and development tax credit--the provision which would do the most to help many of those businesses whose innovations have created jobs and fueled our prosperity--was not included in this legislation. Instead, only a brief extension of the credit was provided. How extraordinarily shortsighted. In order to plan this research efficiently, the companies need to know what the rules will be in future years. The permanent extension of the research and development tax credit is the type of tax cut we should be passing. Unfortunately it is not before us. 
   Democrats believes in tax cuts which are affordable and fairly distributed. The Democratic alternative, which I support, would provide $290 billion in tax relief over the next decade. That is an amount the nation can afford without endangering the economic progress we have made and without ignoring our responsibilities to Medicare, to Social Security, to education, and to other vital programs. We oppose the $792 billion Republican tax bill because it would poison our prosperity and lead to a crippling rise in interest rates. We oppose the Republican bill because it would consume the entire surplus, and distribute the overwhelming majority of it to those who already have the most. 
   That is not the way the American people want to spend their surplus. I urge my colleagues to reject the bill. The American people deserve better than this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week, the Environmental Protection Agency announced the first major steps under the Food Quality Protection Act of 1996 to protect children from overexposure to two widely used pesticides. Organophosphate chemicals, such as these two pesticides, kill insects by disrupting nerve impulses. Unfortunately, these chemicals have the same effect on humans, and children are especially vulnerable because of their developing bodies and the high proportion of fruits and vegetables in their diets. Effective protection against these two pesticides is an important step in implementing the Act as Congress intended. 
   These steps by EPA to comply with the law are critical to ensure the health and safety of the nation's children. These actions are welcome, and EPA must continue to carry out its important mission to assess tolerance levels for pesticides that pose the highest risks to children. Much work remains to be done. 
   Timely and complete implementation of the Act is essential, but we need to know more to assure that all children are protected from the harmful effects of pesticides. I have asked the General Accounting Office to evaluate the technologies used to assess immune, reproductive, endocrine, and neurotoxic effects of pesticides on children. GAO will also report on current research on links between pesticides and child health and disease. In particular, I have asked the GAO to evaluate whether the Act is being implemented adequately to protect the health and safety of the nation's children. 
   Our children are our greatest natural resource. The goal in passing the Act was to set a strong public health standard to protect them, and EPA has a clear responsibility to implement the Act in accord with that standard.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with the announcement of his proposal to modernize and strengthen Medicare, President Clinton has demonstrated that we can achieve needed Medicare reform without compromising our clear commitment to the fundamental principles of that basic and highly successful program. Our goal is to preserve and strengthen Medicare, so that it effectively meets the needs of all senior citizens in the years ahead, as it has done so well for the past thirty-four years. 
   Above all, we must reject any proposals that undermine the ability of senior citizens to obtain the health care they need, or that attempt to transform Medicare into a voucher program, as the Medicare Commission's recommendations and other premium support plans do. Such proposals are risky schemes. They abandon Medicare's successful social insurance compact, and current guarantee of a defined benefit. Premium support proposals could price conventional Medicare out of reach and force senior citizens to join HMOs. They threaten to compromise the quality of care and reduce access to care. That is unacceptable to senior citizens, and it should be unacceptable to members of Congress. 
   There are a number of hard-working organizations dedicated to the well-being of senior citizens. I welcome this opportunity to comment on one such group--a distinguished public interest organization that works effectively to protect the interests of senior citizens and ensure fairness in Medicare reform. The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare is a major leader in the national effort to protect and strengthen both Social Security and Medicare. I commend the Committee and its members for their commitment and their leadership, and I look forward to working closely with them in the critical weeks and months ahead to achieve the great goals we share.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my strong support for S. 296, the Federal Research Investment Act, which was introduced earlier this year by Senator FRIST and Senator ROCKEFELLER, and was reported favorably by the Commerce Committee earlier this month. This legislation is important for the future of the nation's economy and our competitive position in the global market-place. 
   A key ingredient in the continued success and growth of our economy is federal investment in research and development. Much of America's technological leadership today and in the past has been stimulated by federal R&D expenditures, and we need to continue to strengthen these investments as a top national priority. 
   The results of this public-private partnership are all around us. They include the biotechnology industry, commercial satellite communications, integrated circuitry, the Internet, satellite-based global navigation and communications, and supercomputers. 
   The Act calls for doubling the federal non-defense science budgets over the next eleven years. As a share of GDP, federal investment in R&D now stands at about half what it was 30 years ago. This share is projected to continue to fall under the current budget caps. Clearly, a strong commitment is needed for investment in R&D funding for basic sciences. Without a strong commitment, the worsening imbalance in R&D funding will have a negative impact on the economy and the nation's competitive position. 
   I strongly support the effort to double the federal R&D budget. It is one of the most effective ways to ensure the continued prosperity of our nation. It is imperative that we continue making these investments which have made Massachusetts and many other states renowned for their innovative leadership. We must continue and enhance, not cut back, on these needed investments. 
   I commend Senator ROCKEFELLER and Senator FRIST for their leadership and vision on this critical piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to join in supporting this important Act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my strong support for the Pet Safety and Protection Act of 1999, which will protect pets from unscrupulous animal dealers seeking to sell them to labs for biomedical research. 
   Animals play a critical role in biomedical research, but we must do all we can to ensure that research involving animals is regulated responsibly. Animal dealers and research facilities must be certain that lost or stolen pets do not end up in a research laboratory. 
   This bill will guarantee that only legitimate dealers who can verify the origin of their animals will be authorized to sell to research facilities. The Pet Safety and Protection Act of 1999 reaffirms the nation's commitment to safe and responsible biomedical research, while maintaining high ethical standards in the treatment of animals.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome the opportunity to join Senator GORTON and many other distinguished colleagues as a sponsor of the Advancement in Pediatric Autism Research Act. Autism is a heartbreaking disorder that strikes at the core of family relationships. We need to do all we can to understand the causes of autism in order to learn how to treat this tragic condition more effectively, and ultimately to prevent it. I want to commend Senator GORTON, the Cure Autism Now Foundation, and the many organizations and families in Massachusetts for their impressive leadership in dealing with this important cause of disability in children. In this age of such extraordinary progress on preventing, treating and curing so many other serious and debilitating illnesses, we cannot afford to miss this unique opportunity for progress against autism as well. 
   Clearly, we can do more to provide support for children and families who face the tragedy of autism. At the same time, I am concerned about certain provisions in the proposed legislation which could inadvertently cause harm to children with autism and to our system of funding research. 
   One provision allows use of NIH funds for health care and other services that ``will facilitate the participation'' in research. We must be clear that research dollars should be used only to cover costs that are required to carry out research. Insurance providers should never be able to use participation in research as an excuse to avoid paying for medically necessary health care. In addition, we must be especially careful to protect vulnerable children and families from situations in which financial incentives could affect decisions about participation in research. 
   I am confident that we can work together to address such issues as the bill moves through Congress. I look forward to working with my colleagues,  with the advocacy organizations and with familes to enact the best possible measure to bring hope to the lives of these very special children.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this proposal to invest more in rebuilding and modernizing the nation's schools. I commend Senator HARKIN for his leadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is necessary to help the nation meet the critical need to modernize and rebuild crumbling and overcrowded schools. 
   Schools, communities, and governments at every level have to do more to improve student achievement. Schools need smaller classes, particular in the early grades. They need stronger parent involvement. They need well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep up with current developments in their field and the best teaching practices. They need after-school instruction for students who need extra help, and after-school programs to engage students in constructive activities. They need safe, modern facilities with up-to-date technology. 
   But, all of these reforms will be undermined if facilities are inadequate. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded facilities sends a message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can to ensure that children are learning in safe, modern buildings. 
   I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of Senator ROBB'S Public School Modernization and Overcrowding Relief Act, which provides tax incentives to rebuild and modernize schools. Senator HARKIN'S bill is a necessary complement to that legislation. Although tax incentives are an important way to meet the nation's critical school infrastructure needs, they do not meet the needs of all communities. The neediest communities need our direct support--and they need it now. 
   Senator HARKIN'S legislation authorizes discretionary funds to help local school districts and states repair, renovate, and rebuild crumbling public schools. It provides targeted discretionary grants to public schools that have major needs. To do so, it creates a revolving loan fund at the state level, which would provide 
   low-interest or no-interest loans to repair existing schools or construct new facilities. The legislation will also provide a grant to  help local school districts in the planning and design of new facilities that would include input from parents, teachers, and the community. 
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half of all schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school buildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in almost every community, urban, rural, or suburban. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, communities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million students, and will continue to grow. 
   The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools will be needed by 2003 to accommodate rising enrollments. The General Accounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion to repair and modernize the nation's schools. Congress should lend a helping hand and do all we can to help schools and communities across the country meet this challenge. 
   In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And 36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems. 
   Last year, I visited Everett Elementary School in Dorchester. The school is experiencing serious overcrowding. The average class size is 28 students. The principal of the school gave up her office and moved into a closet in the hall in order to help accommodate rising enrollment. When the school wants to use the multi-purpose auditorium/library, the rolling bookcases are moved to the basement, and the library has to close for the rest of the day. 
   Two cafeterias at Bladensburg High School in Prince Georges County, Maryland were recently closed because they were infested with mice and roaches. A teacher commented, ``It's disgusting. It causes chaos when the mice run around 
   the room.'' At an elementary school in Montgomery, Alabama, a ceiling which had been damaged by leaking water collapsed only 40 minutes after the children had left for the day. 
   Most of Los Angeles' school buildings are 30 to 70 years old. Enrollment rose from 539,000 in 1980 to 691,000 in 1998, an increase of 28 percent. District officials expect an additional 50,000 students over the next five years. 
   In Detroit, Michigan, over half--150 of the 263--school buildings were built before 1930. The average age is 61 years old, and some date to the 1800's. Detroit estimates that the city has $5 billion in unmet repair and new construction needs. Detroit voters approved a $1.5 billion, 15-year school construction program, but it's not enough. 
   New York City school enrollment has grown by 100,000 students, to a total of 1,083,000 since 1990. School officials expect up to an additional 90,000 students by 2004. P.S. 7 was built for 530 students, but 1,048 students are now enrolled. P.S. 108 was built for 280 students, however 808 students are now enrolled. New York City education officials have identified $7.5 billion in building needs. 
   Schools across the country are struggling to meet needs such as these, but they can't do it alone. The federal government should join with state and local governments and community organizations to ensure that all children have the opportunity for a good education in a safe and up-to-date school building. 
   Children need and deserve a good education in order to succeed in life. But they cannot obtain that education if school roofs are falling down around them, if sewage is backing up through faulty plumbing, if asbestos is flaking off the walls and ceilings, if schools lack computers and modern technology and classrooms are overcrowded. We need to help states and communities rebuild their crumbling schools, modernize old buildings, and expand facilities to accommodate reduced class sizes. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Senator HARKIN'S 21st Century Modernization Act. The time is now to do all we can to rebuild and modernize public schools, so that all children can learn in safe, well-equipped facilities.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator ABRAHAM as a sponsor of the INS Reform and Border Security Act. This legislation will remedy many of the problems that currently plague the Immigration and Naturalization Service. It will ensure strong enforcement of our immigration laws, and also ensure that immigration and citizenship services are provided expeditiously and with greater respect for dignity of those who benefit from these services. 
   These two missions--enforcement and services--are equally important. Both are suffering under the current INS structure. The services are in especially dire straits. Over two million would-be US citizens are now trapped in an INS backlog. Individuals languish for years waiting for their naturalization and permanent resident applications to be processed. Files are lost. Fingerprints go stale. Courteous behavior is too often the exception, rather than the rule. Application fees continue to increase--yet poor service and long delays continue as well. 
   On the enforcement side, the immigration laws are being applied inconsistently. Detention and parole policies and procedures vary widely from district to district. All too frequently, national priorities and directives are ignored at the district level. 
   Many of these problems are not new. During Commissioner Doris Meissner's impressive tenure, the INS has made significant progress in trying to address the agency's problems. She has done an excellent job under the current structure. But, that structure has proven to be unworkable. 
   The goal of INS Reform and Border Security Act is to put the INS house in order. It will untangle the overlapping and often confusing organizational structure of the agency and replace it with two clear chains of command--one for enforcement and the other for services. These two equally important divisions will report, through their respective directors, to an Associate Attorney General who will head the Immigration Affairs Agency. This shared central authority over the two branches will ensure a uniform and harmonious immigration policy. Coordination of the two branches is imperative for the efficient functioning of the agency, and for maintaining a coherent immigration policy. 
   There is strong bipartisan agreement that the INS must be reformed. But restructuring must be done right. Successful reform must separate the enforcement and service functions while maintaining a strong central authority for uniform policy-making, clear accountability, and fiscal responsibility. The INS Reform and Border Security Act accomplishes these aims. The new immigration will be a major improvement over the current INS. I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the INS Reform and Border Security Act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator REED for introducing this important legislation. I am proud to co-sponsor this bill to ensure that parents have a stronger role in the education of their children. 
   The first and most important teachers in children's lives are their parents. It is parents who help children begin learning about the world. It is parents who provide motivation and encouragement for academic success. And it is parents who provide indispensable lessons of character. The central role that parents play in the lives of their children requires strong parental involvement in education. 
   Involving parents in education increases the achievement of all students. Research has repeatedly shown that a child with an involved parent is more likely to attend school regularly, is less likely to engage in violence or substance abuse, and will do better academically and on standardized tests. These fundamental principles apply without regard to the economic status or ethnic background of the parents. 
   Parental involvement is also a vital part of a child's literacy. Children excel in reading when reading is a regular part of their early education. Students who have a greater array of reading material in the home have higher reading achievement. 
   We know that increased parental involvement works. In Worcester, the Belmont Community School has instituted a school-wide reading initiative called ``Books and Beyond,'' which is helping children improve their reading skills and encourage their desire to read. Its success is largely due to special workshops and classes for parents, which emphasizes parental involvement, adult literacy training, and strong parent-school partnerships. 
   The Hueco Elementary School in El Paso, Texas, supports parent involvement in a number of ways. It offers parenting classes throughout the year, including training for parents to support learning at home. It works to increase communication with parents through a Parent Communication Council that meets monthly. Hueco has also hired a successful parent coordinator to help teachers involve parents. This effort has paid off. Now parents have a strong role in the school. They participate in classroom instruction, and they are able to improve their own education. Average attendance has risen to 97 percent. Students whose parents attend workshops and participate in other activities have more success in school and fewer disciplinary problems. 
   The federal government has a responsibility to be part of the effort to enhance parental involvement. The legislation we are introducing will help states and school districts to create strong ties with parents. It strengthens parental involvement programs in Title I, and encourages schools to use proven techniques for helping teachers and parents work together. It also provides support for connecting schools and parents through technology, and it increases the role of parents in the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities program. 
   Strong parent involvement will help ensure strong schools. We should do all we can to make sure that federal support for improving public schools provides a strong role for parents. By doing so, we help create the brighter future that all the nation's children deserve.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In an effort to reduce costs under managed care, more than a third of all hospitals across the country are now reusing medical devices that are labeled by the original manufacturer as ``disposable'' or ``for single-use only.'' More than a million devices a year are being reprocessed and then used on patients without their knowledge, in violation of the original manufacturer's recommendation or warning, and without a determination by the FDA that these devices are safe and effective. 
   To protect patient safety, FDA requires that before a medical device manufacturer can begin selling a single-use device as reusable by additional patients, the manufacturer must file the appropriate premarket notification to prove the safety and efficacy of the reused device. 
   But this requirement only applies to original equipment manufacturers, and not to hospitals, other providers, or third party reprocessors. When hospitals, or third-party reprocessors, prepare a ``single-use only'' device for use again in another patient, they do not supply the FDA with any information on the safety and efficacy of the device and they do not notify the FDA of their intent to remarket the used device. 
   The FDA does require third-party reprocessors to register with the Agency and to conform to the ``Good Manufacturing Practices'' required of device manufacturers. The larger reprocessors are registered with the FDA and may be inspected for compliance. But there are numerous smaller reprocessors that do not register with FDA, and hospitals that reprocess in-house do not register either. 
   Even when registration takes place, is not a form of approval. Compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices does not assure that the reprocessing results in a safe and effective device. The reprocessing industry is, for the most part, unregulated. 
   Some of the disposable devices that are reprocessed and reused are highly invasive and are contaminated with blood and tissue during use. A few examples include: 
   Balloon angioplasty catheters for dilating coronary arteries; 
   Electrophysiology catheters for cardiac testing; 
   Biopsy forceps and biopsy needles for removing tissues and cells; 
   Laparoscopic instruments for surgical procedures. 
   Inadequate cleaning and sterilization of these devices prior to reuse can lead to cross-contamination of patients and hospital staff. 
   Single-use devices are often made from heat sensitive plastics, and have intricate, inaccessible parts which can be difficult, if not impossible, to clean. They often contain long narrow tubing, acute angles, crevices, coils, joints, and porous surfaces where contaminants can collect. The potential is high for contamination by blood, respiratory secretions, gastric 
   secretions, and fecal matter. 
   Cleaning and resterilizing can also threaten the operation of a used single-use device. Physical, mechanical or electrical properties can be altered when the device is subject to harsh chemicals, high temperatures, pressure, gases, and physical removal of debris. Proper use of the device in the initial patient may also alter the performance of the device. 
   Reprocessors say that they test these devices. But any testing is done without the benefit of the data and other proprietary information in the original manufacturer's Premarket Notification to the FDA. 
   The FDA has conducted studies on balloon angioplasty catheters. These devices are threaded from an artery in the leg into the heart, and then inflated to open the coronary arteries. The studies concluded that many of the narrow spaces in these catheters were contaminated with blood, and that the balloons no longer inflated properly. 
   Studies by FDA on reprocessed electrophysiology catheters have found debris accumulated at the edges of the electrodes. These devices are also threaded into the heart, and measure electrical activity to locate abnormal heart tissue and burn it away. 
   FDA concluded that the determination as to which devices can be safely reused must be made on a model-by-model basis, and should not be made for an entire class or type of device. 
   Other independent studies on biopsy forceps used to collect samples from the colon and digestive tract showed that over 80% were contaminated with blood, tissue, or fecal matter. The devices in this study were taken from hospital shelves where they were waiting for reuse on future patients. 
   Injuries and product failures have also been associated with reused disposable devices. In January of this year, metal from an electrophysiology catheter electrode fell off and lodged in the heart of a 32-year-old woman in Kansas. The device had been reprocessed six times. 
   In another case, a reprocessed catheter partially separated, and the tip was retained only by a small piece of wire. In this case, fortunately, the patient was not injured, but the potential for serious injury was great. 
   The Medical Device Amendments of 1976 gave FDA the authority to exercise pre-market control over medical devices for the first time. The Safe Medical Devices Act of 1990 required hospitals and other facilities that use medical devices to report adverse events to FDA. A box on the MedWatch adverse event form asks if the device was being used for the first time or was reused. 
   Additional information is needed on how many times a device has been reused and the name of the reprocessor, so that the Agency can identify signs or trends of problems with the reuse of a particular class or model of device, or with a particular reprocessor or process. 
   The amendment we offer today will help ensure the safety and effectiveness of reprocessed medical devices. 
   I commend the FDA for its continuing efforts to improve the premarket review program. This effort has resulted in reduced review times of Premarket Notifications, so that in 1997 and 1998, FDA had no backlog of these marketing applications. 
   FDA should now move forward and require medical device reprocessors to demonstrate that reprocessed devices are safe and effective for use.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 helped bring us to this era of budget surpluses and economic prosperity. But too much of the actual savings used to balance the budget have come from Medicare. 
   At the time the BBA was enacted, those savings were expected to total $116 billion over five years. Now, they are estimated by CBO to be nearly twice as great--nearly $200 billion over five years. Such deep cuts in Medicare are clearly unfair and unacceptable. 
   Not surprisingly, all of us are now hearing from bedrock health care institutions across the country that are being devastated by these excessive cuts. Teaching hospitals--community hositals--community health centers and many others. We are hearing from those who care for the elderly and disabled when they leave the hospital--nursing homes--home health agencies--rehabilitation facilities. We are hearing from virtually every one who cares for the 40 million senior citizens and disabled citizens on Medicare. They are telling us in no uncertain terms that Congress went too far. 
   This motion is the first step toward reducing the steepest cuts. It would provide $20 billion over the next ten years to slow or eliminate the harshest impact of the Balanced Budget Act. It would ensure that the nation's hospitals and other health care facilities will be able to care for senior citizens and the disabled in the years ahead. 
   With the retirement of the baby boom generation, the last thing we should be doing is jeopardizing the viability of the many health care facilities that depend on Medicare for their survival. These institutions are being hard hit in cities and towns across the nation. 
   Often, the hospitals and other institutions that care for Medicare patients also care for other patients as well. Health care in the entire community is being threatened. 
   Teaching hospitals are on the receiving end of a triple-whammy. The slash in Medicare reductions is leading to less patient care, less doctor training, and less medical research at the nation's top hospitals. In my own state of Massachusetts, for the first time in history, some of the finest and most renowned teaching hospitals in the country are now operating at a deficit. This situation is unsustainable--and it is happening all over our country. We will all suffer if these great institutions are forced out of business or into the arms of for-profit corporations. 
   Community hospitals are suffering, too. Throughout my State of Massachusetts, we are seeing red ink and cutbacks in essential services. This, too, is happening all over the country. 
   In Massachusetts alone, house health agencies are losing $160 million a year. Twenty agencies have closed their doors since the Balanced Budget Act went into effect. Many others are seeing fewer patients, and seeing their remaining patients less often. The home-bound elderly are especially vulnerable, and are suffering even more. In just the last two weeks, two Massachusetts nursing homes have declared bankruptcy. 
   This proposal is an important step to restore the viability of these indispensable institutions in our health care system, and I urge the Senate to approve it. We must undo the damage before it is too late. The last thing we need to see on the doors of the nation's teaching hospitals, community hospitals, home health agencies, and nursing homes, is a sign that says, ``Closed because of the ill-considered activities of the United States Congress.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Republicans continue to deny us the opportunity to vote on our bill to raise the minimum wage for the lowest paid workers. That is why I have filed the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999 as an amendment to the Budget Reconciliation Bill. 
   Shame on Congress for giving tax breaks to the rich, but denying a pay raise for the working poor. The $792 billion Republican tax package will disproportionately benefit the richest Americans. Almost thirty percent of the tax breaks, once fully implemented, will go to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans--those who make over $300,000 a year. Seventy-five percent of the tax breaks will benefit the wealthiest 20 percent of Americans--those with an average income of over $139,000. 
   But these tax breaks do virtually nothing for the lowest paid workers. They give minimum wage earners less than $22 a year in tax relief, compared to an average tax break of $22,964 a year for the wealthiest Americans. The Republicans want to give America's wealthiest 1 percent a tax break that is equal to or higher than what 40 percent of Americans earn in a year. 
   The vast magnitude of these tax breaks is possible only because they depend on severe budget cuts in Head Start, Summer Jobs for low-income youth, and HUD housing subsidies for low-income tenants. Shame on Congress for ignoring the majority of America's workers to benefit the wealthy few. 
   Our amendment is a modest proposal to raise the minimum wage from its present level of $5.15 an hour to $5.65 on September 1, 1999 and to $6.15 on September 1, 2000. It will help over 11 million American families. 
   At $6.15 an hour, working full-time, a minimum wage worker would earn $12,800 a year under this amendment--an increase of over $2,000 a year. 
   That additional $2,000 will pay for seven months of groceries to feed the average family. It will pay the rent for an average family for five months. It will pay for almost ten months of utilities. It will cover a year and a half of tuition and fees at a two-year college, and provide greater opportunities for those struggling at the minimum wage to obtain the skills needed to obtain better jobs. 
   The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the lowest unemployment rate in three decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable period of growth and  prosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating unprecedented expansion, with impressive efficiencies and significant job creation. The stock market has soared. Inflation is low, and interest rates are low. We are witnessing the strongest peace-time growth in our history. 
   The sad reality, however, is that low wage workers are being left behind. And the Republican tax bill only widens the gap between the wealthy and the working poor. The Republican pension provisions, for example, only benefit high income Americans with extra income to contribute to IRAs and 401(k) plans. Raising the contribution limits on these savings vehicles only discourages companies from offering across-the-board retirement plans that benefit all employees. The Republican tax bill also undermines the current tax code rules that require retirement benefits to be distributed fairly among lower and higher paid workers. 
   Under current law, minimum wage earners can barely make ends meet. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712--almost $3,200 below the poverty line for a family of three. The real value of the minimum wage is now more than $2.00 below what it was in 1968. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage should today be at least $7.49 an hour, not $5.15. This unconscionable gap shows how far we have fallen short over the past three decades in giving low income workers their fair share of the country's extraordinary prosperity. 
   To rub salt in the wound, Congress recently signed off on a cost of living pay increase for every member of the Senate and House of Representatives. Republican Senators don't blink about giving themselves an increase--how can they possibly deny a fair increase to minimum wage workers? 
   It is time to raise the Federal minimum wage. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. I urge my colleagues to join me in raising the minimum wage.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is to try to provide some help and additional assistance to those individuals who are receiving the Pell grants. Those are virtually the lowest-income students. For the over 4 million students who are receiving Pell grants, their average income is $14,000 a year. They are the students who are encumbered to the greatest degree as a result of borrowing. They start out, if they are lucky enough to get into college, having these overwhelming debts. This would provide some $39 billion which would increase the Pell grants some $400. It would still only make them about 60 percent of what the Pell grants were some 20 years ago. 
   As we are looking out after providing tax breaks for those in the upper incomes, it does seem to me that to try to give further encouragement to able and gifted students at the lower income level deserves support.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, very few decisions we make in Congress will have more impact on the long-term economic well-being of our nation than how we allocate the projected surplus. By our votes this week, we are setting priorities that will determine whether the American economy is on firm ground or dangerously shifting sand as we enter the 21st century. These votes will determine whether we have the financial capacity to meet our responsibilities to future generations, and whether we have fairly shared the economic benefits of our current prosperity. Sadly, the legislation before us today fails all of these standards. We should vote to reject it. 
   A tax cut of the enormous magnitude proposed by our Republican colleagues would reverse the sound fiscal management which has created the inflation-free economic growth of recent years. That is the clear view of the two principal architects of our current prosperity--Robert Rubin and Alan Greenspan. Devoting the entire on-budget surplus to tax cuts will deprive us of the funds essential to preserve Medicare and Social Security for future generations of retirees. It will force harsh cuts in education, in medical research, and in other vital domestic priorities. This tax cut jeopardizes our financial future--and it also dismally flunks the test of fairness. When fully implemented, the Republican plan would give 75% of the tax cuts to the wealthiest 20% of the population. The richest 1%--those earning over $300,000 a year--would receive tax breaks as high as $23,000 a year, while working men and women would receive an average of only $139 a year. 
   Republicans claim that the ten year surplus is three trillion dollars and that they are setting two-thirds of it aside for Social Security, and only spending one-third on tax cuts. That explanation is grossly misleading. The two trillion dollars they say they are giving to Social Security already belongs to Social Security. It consists of payroll tax dollars expressly raised for the purpose of paying future Social Security benefits. Using those dollars to fund tax cuts or new spending would be to raid the Social Security Trust Fund. The Republicans are not providing a single new dollar to help fund Social Security benefits for future generations. They are not extending the life of the Trust Fund for even one day. It is a mockery to characterize those payroll tax dollars as part of the surplus. 
   That leaves the $996 billion on-budget surplus as the only funds available to address all of the nation's unmet needs over the next ten years. Republicans propose to use that entire amount to fund their tax cut scheme. Since CBO projections assume that all surplus dollars are devoted to debt reduction, the $996 billion figure includes nearly $200 billion in debt service savings. The amount which is available to be spent--either to address public needs or to cut taxes--is only slightly above $800 billion. Their $792 billion tax cut will consume the entire surplus. 
   Even more troubling, the Republican tax cut has been designed to expand dramatically beyond the tenth year. The cost between 2010 and 2019 will dwarf the cost in the first decade. It will rise from $800 billion to $2 trillion dollars. And the cost of the debt service payments necessitated by a tax cut of that magnitude will grow exponentially as well. The GOP plan will usher in a new era of deficits--just as the baby boom generation is reaching retirement age. 
   While the Senate Rules have been invoked to prevent the current tax cut from going beyond ten years, the Republican leadership has made clear their intent to make these massive cuts permanent. If these tax cuts were to become permanent, they would precipitate a genuine fiscal crisis. 
   Most Americans understand the word ``surplus'' to mean dollars remaining after all financial obligations have been met. If that common sense definitions is applied to the federal budget, the surplus would be far smaller than $996 billion. 
   We have existing obligations which should be our first responsibility. We have an obligation to preserve Medicare for future generations of retires, and to modernize Medicare benefits to include prescription drug assistance. The Republican budget does not provide one additional dollar to meet these needs. 
   The American people clearly believe that strengthening Social Security and Medicare should be our highest priorities for using the surplus. By margins of more than two to one, they view preserving Social Security and Medicare as more important than cutting taxes. 
   We should use the surplus to meet these existing responsibilities first, in order to fulfill the promise of a secure retirement with access to needed medical care. 
   If we do nothing, Medicare will become insolvent by 2015. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to preserve Medicare, without reducing medical care or raising premiums. The Republican tax cut would take that opportunity away. It would leave nothing for Medicare. 
   We must seize this opportunity. Senate Democrats have proposed committing one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next ten years--to strengthening Medicare and to assisting senior citizens with the cost of prescription drugs. The Administration's 15 year budget plan provides an additional $500 billion for Medicare between 2010 and 2014. Enactment of the Republican tax cut would make this $800 billion transfer to Medicare impossible. If we squander the entire surplus on tax breaks, there will be no money left to keep our commitment to the nations' elderly. 
   Unless we use a portion of the surplus to strengthen Medicare, senior citizens  will be confronted with nearly a trillion dollars in health care cuts and premium increases. We know who the people are who will be asked by the Republicans to carry this enormous burden. 
   The typical Medicare beneficiary is a widow, seventy-six years old, with an annual income of $10,000. She has one or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet the Republican budget would force deep cuts in her Medicare benefits, in order to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. As a result, elderly women will be unable to see their doctor. They will go without needed prescription drugs, or without meals or heat, so that wealthy 
   Americans earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year can have additional thousands of dollars a year in tax breaks. 
   The projected surplus also assumes drastic cuts in a wide range of existing programs over the next decade--cuts in domestic programs such as education, medical research, and environmental cleanup; and cuts in national defense. We have an obligation to adequately fund these programs. If existing programs merely grow at the rate of inflation over the next decade and no new programs are created and no existing programs are expanded, the surplus would be reduced by $584 billion dollars. That is the amount it will cost to merely continue funding current discretionary programs at their inflation-adjusted level. In fact, the real surplus over the next ten years is only slightly above $200 billion, roughly one-quarter the size of the proposed Republican tax cut. 
   In other words, the Republican tax cut would necessitate more than a twenty percent across the board cut in discretionary spending--in both domestic and national defense--by the end of the next decade. If defense is funded at the Administration's proposed level, and it is highly unlikely that the Republican Congress will do less, domestic spending would have to be cut 38% by 2009. No one can reasonably argue that cuts that deep should be made, or will be made. 
   We know what cuts of this magnitude would mean in human terms by the end of the decade. We know who will be hurt: 375,000 fewer children will receive a Head Start; 6.5 million fewer children will participate in Title I education programs; 14,000 fewer biomedical research grants will be available from the National Institutes of Health; 1,431,000 fewer veterans will receive V.A. medical care; and there will be 6,170 fewer Border Patrol agents and 6,342 fewer FBI agents insuring safer communities. These are losses that the American people are not willing to accept. 
   The Democratic alternative would restore $290 billion, substantially reducing the size of the proposed cuts. A significant reduction would still be required over the decade. One thing is clear--even with a bare bones budget, we cannot afford a tax cut of the magnitude the Republicans are proposing. 
   Our Republican friends claim that these enormous tax cuts will have no impact on Social Security, because they are not using payroll tax revenues. On the contrary, the fact that the Republican budget commits every last dollar of the on-budget surplus to tax cuts does imperil Social Security. 
   First, revenue estimates projected ten years into the future are notoriously unreliable. As the Director of the Congressional Budget Office candidly acknowledged:  
   Ten year budget projections are highly uncertain. In the space of only six months, CBO's estimate of the cumulative surplus has increased by nearly $300 billion. Further changes of that or a greater magnitude are likely--in either direction--as a result of economic fluctuations, administrative and judicial actions, and other developments.  
   Despite this warning, the Republican tax cut leaves no margin for error. If we commit the entire surplus to tax cuts and the full surplus does not materialize, Social Security revenues will be required to cover the shortfall. 
   Second, even if the projected surplus does materialize, the cost of the Republican budget exceeds the surplus in five of the next ten years--2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009. Unless the Republican proposal is restructured, Social Security revenues will be required to cover the shortfall in each of those years. 
   Third, the Republican tax cut leaves no money to pay for emergency spending, which has averaged $9 billion a year in recent years. Over the next decade, we are likely to need approximately $90 billion to cover emergency needs. That money has to come from somewhere. With the entire surplus spent on tax cuts, the Social Security Trust Fund will have to fund these emergency costs as well. 
   The three threats to Social Security I have described are very real. However, there is an even greater impact of the Republican plan on the future of Social Security. As I noted earlier, that plan does not provide Social Security with a single new dollar to fund future benefit payments. 
   In contrast, the Administration has proposed using a major portion of the surplus to strengthen Social Security for future generations of retirees. Beginning in 2011, the President's budget allocates to Social Security the savings which will result from debt reduction. Between 2011 and 2014, the Social Security Trust Fund would receive 543 billion new dollars from the surplus, and it would receive an additional $189 billion each year after that. As a result, the solvency of Social Security would be extended for a generation, to well beyond 2050. 
   The Republican tax cut proposal, which costs over $2 trillion between 2010 and 2019, will consume all of the surplus dollars which were intended for Social Security. There will be nothing left for Social Security. As a result, no new dollars will flow into the Trust Fund, and the future of Social Security will remain clouded. 
   For two-thirds of America's senior citizens, Social Security retirement benefits provide more than 50% of their annual income. Without Social Security, half the nation's elderly would be living in poverty. Social Security enables millions of senior citizens to spend their retirement years in security and dignity. A Republican tax cut of the magnitude proposed here today will put their retirement security in serious jeopardy. 
   The votes which we cast this week--the choices which we are required to make--will say a great deal about our values. We should use the surplus as an opportunity to help those in need--senior citizens living on small fixed incomes, children who need educational opportunities, millions of men and women whose lives may well depend on medical research and access to quality health care. We should not use the surplus to further enrich those among us who are already the most affluent. The issue is a question of fundamental values and fundamental fairness. 
   The Republican tax cut would consume the entire surplus, and distribute the overwhelming majority of it to those with the highest incomes. The authors of the Republican plan have highlighted the reduction of the 15% tax bracket to 14%. They have pointed to this as middle class tax relief. But that relief is only a small part of the overall tax breaks in their bill. It accounts for only $216 billion of the $792 billion in GOP tax cuts. Most of the remaining provisions are heavily weighted toward the highest income taxpayers. 
   If the Republican plan were enacted and fully implemented, nearly 50% of the tax benefits would go to the richest 5% of taxpayers, and more than 75% of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 20%. Those with annual incomes exceeding $300,000 would receive tax breaks of $23,000 per year. The lowest 60% of wage-earners would share less than 11% of the total tax cuts--they would receive an average tax cut of only $139 per year. That gross disparity is unfair and unacceptable. 
   This is not the way the American people want to spend their surplus. I urge my colleagues to reject this bill. The American people deserve better than this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as was indicated in the motion, 
   senior citizens deserve coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare, and it is time for Congress to see that they get it. This amendment presents a clear choice between prescription drug coverage for the elderly and unnecessary new tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   This debate is about priorities. New tax breaks are a priority for the Republicans. Prescription drugs for senior citizens are not. If senior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a Medicare prescription drug bill today--not a tax cut bill. If senior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a tax bill after we had taken care of Medicare and Social Security--not before. 
   These Republican tax bills have $230 billion in new tax breaks for people with incomes over $300,000 a year. They reinstate the three-martini lunch deduction. 
   There are sweetheart deals for the insurance industry, the timber industry, the oil industry, and large multinational corporations. But there is not one dime for Medicare prescription drugs for senior citizens. 
   Medicare is a clear contract between workers and their government. It says, ``Work hard, pay into the system when you are young, and you will have health security in your retirement years.'' But that commitment is being broken today and every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. 
   When Medicare was enacted in 1965, coverage of prescription drugs in private insurance policies was not the norm--and Medicare followed the standard practice in the private market. Today, ninety-nine percent of employment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug coverage--but Medicare is caught in a 34 year old time warp--and too many seniors are suffering as a result. 
   Too many seniors today must choose between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. 
   Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs. Too many seniors are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to pay full price, while almost everyone with a private insurance policy benefits from negotiated discounts. Too many seniors are ending up hospitalized--at immense costs to Medicare--because they aren't receiving the drugs they need at all, or cannot afford to take them correctly. Pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for a host of dread diseases, but senior citizens will be left out and left behind if we do not act. 
   The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the support of the American people, Congress is on its way to our goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health. This investment is seed money for the additional basic research that will enable private and public sector scientists to develop new therapies that will improve and extend the lives of people in the United States and around the globe. 
   In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion in research on new medicines and to bring them to the public. 
   These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All patients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, which is the nation's largest insurer, does not cover out-patient prescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy price for this glaring omission. 
   Prescription drug bills eat up a large and disproportionate share of the typical elderly household's income. Senior citizen spend three times more of their income on health care than persons under 65, and they account for one-third of all prescription drug expenditures. yet they make up only 12 percent of the population. 
   The greatest gap in Medicare--and the greatest anachronism--is its failure to cover prescription drugs. Ninety-nine percent of all employment-based plans--ninety-nine percent--cover prescription drugs today. But Medicare is still mired in the mid-1960s--when the private plans on which Medicare was modeled did not provide this coverage. 
   Because of this gap and other gaps in Medicare, and the growing cost of the Part B premium, Medicare now pays only 50% of the out-of-pocket medical costs of the elderly. On average, senior citizens now spend almost as much of their income on health care as they did before Medicare was enacted. And Medicare was enacted because there was a crisis in health care for the elderly in the 1960s. How can we fail to act today, to deal with the health care crisis for the elderly in the 1990s? 
   Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the elderly for health care. The average senior citizen fills an average of eighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six prescriptions daily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of $100, $200 or even more. 
   America's senior citizens and disabled citizens deserve to benefit from new discoveries in the same way that other families do. Yet, without negotiating power, they receive the brunt of cost-shifting--often with devastating results. In the words of a recent report by Standard & Poor ``Drugmakers have historically raised prices to private customers to compensate for the discounts they grant to managed care consumers.'' The private customers referred to in this report are largely the nation's mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and grandfathers. 
   Despite--and to a large extent because of--Medicare's lack of coverage for prescription drugs, the misuse of such drugs results in preventable illnesses that cost Medicare $20 billion or more a year, while imposing vast misery on senior citizens. It is in their best interest, and in the best interest  
   of Medicare, to design a system that encourages the proper use, and minimizes the improper use of prescription drugs. Substantial savings can be found if physicians and pharmacists are educated on senior citizen-prescription drug interactions and on ways to identify, prevent, and correct prescription drug-related problems. 
   Beneficiaries, too, must follow instructions that are dispensed with the medication itself. Too often, we hear stories of senior citizens who skimp on medicine. They take half doses or otherwise try to stretch their prescription, to make it last longer. That is not right, and it doesn't have to happen. If senior citizens are confident that the drugs they need will be covered, proper usage will improve, and so will the quality of life for senior citizens. 
   During the course of this debate, we will hear many arguments from the opponents of this amendment. Their arguments are as predictable as they are wrong. 
   First, we will hear that the sponsors of this excessive tax cut are all for a Medicare prescription drug benefit, too. They claim that even after their tax cut, they still have $253 billion of surplus left. But we all know that those estimates are as phony as a three dollar bill--and about as valuable. 
   The only way that any money is left after the Republican tax cut is because their budget pretends to cut national defense by $198 billion below the President's request--a request that Republicans say is inadequate. Their budget also pretends that there will never be another emergency appropriation--even though emergencies will cost us $90 billion over the next 10 years if present trends continue. Their budget pretends to cut domestic programs from Head Start to education to highway construction to law enforcement by half a trillion dollars over the next ten years, cuts that no one believes will ever happen. 
   Republicans hope they can continue to play ``let's pretend'' until this reckless and irresponsible tax cut passes the Senate. But by then it will be too late--too late for today's senior citizens, who need prescription drug coverage--too late for tomorrow's senior citizens, who need a solvent Medicare--too late to protect Social Security--too late to meet pressing needs to educate the nation's children, support biomedical research, fight crime, protect the environment, and meet all the other pressing needs that are priorities for the American people. 
   This is an issue of priorities. Republicans may say that there is enough money left over to protect seniors. Let them put their votes where their mouth is. All this motion does is say set aside enough money out of the tax cut to provide a prescription drug benefit before we vote to pass a tax bill. This should be a simple vote for any Senator who cares about senior citizens. Tax cuts are a priority for the Republicans. Prescriptions drugs for senior citizens are not. If senior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a prescription drug coverage bill today--not a tax cut bill. If senior citizens were the priority, we would be debating a tax bill after we had taken care of Medicare and Social Security--not before. If senior citizens were the priority, it would be tax breaks that would get the left-overs, not the elderly. 
   Republicans also say that prescription drug coverage should not be provided to all senior citizens--only to the poor or those who have no current coverage. But we heard those same arguments when Medicare was originally enacted. The American people didn't buy these arguments then--and they won't buy them now. 
   Let's look at the numbers. Fourteen million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries--one-third of the total--do not have a dime of prescription drug coverage today. Not a dime. 
   One-quarter of Medicare beneficiaries have coverage through an employer--but retiree health benefits are on the chopping block as companies seek to cut costs by trimming health care spending. In fact, the proportion of firms offering coverage has dropped one-quarter in just the last four years. No senior citizen--and certainly no 50-year-old looking forward to retirement--can count on prescription drug coverage being there for them when serious illness strikes. 
   Seven million Americans get prescription drug coverage through a Medicare HMO. But that coverage is offered voluntarily--and it is often being cut back or eliminated altogether. 
   Three-quarters of Medicare HMOs will impose caps on their benefits of less than $1,000 next year. Almost one-third will impose caps of less than $500. The majority of seniors have annual drug expenses well in excess of $500. More than $325,000 beneficiaries will be dropped from their HMOs next year. There is not a single senior citizens who joined an HMO because of the promise of affordable prescription drug benefits who can count on that promise being kept. 
   Four and a half million senior citizens get prescription drug coverage through a Medigap plan. But that coverage is extraordinarily expensive and inadequate. According to Consumer Reports, a seventy-four year old senior citizen enrolled in the least generous Medigap plan offering drug coverage would pay an average of close to $2,000 a year more in premiums--on top of $1,4000 for the non-drug part of the coverage--a total of more than $3,000 a year. And that is an average. Some beneficiaries must pay more than $9,000 a year for drug coverage through Medigap. Whatever the starting premium, it goes higher and higher as senior citizens age and their need for medical care grows. Anyone who misses the chance to enroll in a plan offering drug coverage at age 65 never gets another chance if they have any health problems. 
   The only senior citizens who have stable, secure, affordable Medicare drug coverage today are the very poor on Medicaid. The idea that only the impoverished should qualify for needed hospital and doctor care was popular with Republicans more than 30 years ago when they fought against the enactment of Medicare. The American people rejected that cruel doctrine--and Medicare for all was enacted. Today, it is time for the Senate to reject the equally indefensible proposition that poverty is the price that senior citizens should have to pay to get the prescription drugs they need. 
   A couple of Marshfield, Massachusetts vividly demonstrates why we need to act now. Their plight is representative of millions of other senior citizens across the country. They live on a fixed income of $30,000 a year from Social Security and a retirement pension. They are not poor. Their income is not below 135% of poverty. In fact, it is not even below 200% of poverty--but it is not enough for them to afford the prescription drugs they need. Both have substantial medical needs, and both belong to the Medicare HMO--but 19% of the couple's income is still spent on prescription drugs. 
   By April, the couple had already exhausted their HMO's $150 quarterly cap for prescription drug coverage. The $956 cost of the wife's medications for May and June will come completely out of their pockets. She has been rationing her medication--not taking it as prescribed, in an attempt to stretch out the medicine to save money. She was a stroke victim five years ago. Yet, she has to cut back considerably on her most expensive prescriptions. She is having a difficult time with the left side of her body, and cannot move her left arm. 
   She says, ``My muscles are really tight, and it is a result of not taking my Methocarbamol, because I am trying to stretch my prescription dollars. We don't go out, we can't afford gas, and we have had to cut down on groceries.'' 
   Every senior citizen in America could find themselves forced to choose between a decent retirement and the medications they need to survive. No person and no family should have to make that unfair choice. This is what our amendment is all about. 
   Senior citizens need and deserve prescription drug coverage under Medicare. Any senior citizen will tell you that--and so will their children and grandchildren. 
   I would like to just reiterate an earlier point. The debate this week is really about priorities, and there are many of us who believe that, prior to moving toward any of these kinds of tax breaks, we ought to secure Social Security, we ought to ensure the security of the Medicare system, and include in the Medicare system a prescription drug benefit program. 
   I have listened over the course of the past 2 days, as well as earlier in the year, to those who say we can afford the kind of tax breaks that are being recommended. They say that we will have sufficient resources at the end of it in order to provide for a prescription drug benefit. I don't believe that to be the case. 
   Even if it were the case, I am not going to take our limited time to debate how much may be left over after we deal with the Republican tax breaks. I don't think there will be much, if anything. 
   But what we are saying today is rather than wait to see if there is anything left, let's go ahead today. We are saying that any proposal that is going to  
   come out of this Senate dealing with tax breaks is also going to include an important prescription drug benefit for the senior citizens of this country. That is what we are saying. 
   We say send this legislation back to the Finance Committee, and then we ask the Finance Committee to report back within a period of 3 days. 
   There are a number of acceptable proposals. The proposal by the President of the United States is one that I favor. Senator ROCKEFELLER and I also have a proposal that I favor. But this motion simply requires the Finance Committee to come back with funds sufficient to provide prescription drug coverage to all Medicare beneficiaries. It doesn't specify one proposal over another. That is, in effect, what this amendment is really all about. 
   We believe that coverage of prescription drugs is necessary in order to effectively upgrade Medicare to deal with modern realities. There are other considerations in the Medicare program that the President and others have outlined which deserve consideration. But today we should say that before we pass significant tax breaks, we are going to make a commitment that a prescription drug benefit program be put into place. 
   It is a matter of enormous importance. It makes an incredible difference in the quality of life of the senior citizens of this country. 
   Prescription drug benefits in the current system are completely inadequate. Those who rise to oppose it will say: Let us just have a partial program because there are only about one-third that have no coverage. We went through those numbers earlier. Only the poorest seniors have affordable, reliable and adequate coverage. 
   Those with retiree coverage cannot be certain it will continue. Those in HMOs are being told that their coverage will be limited to $500 or $1,000 a year. Others are being dropped because their plan is leaving the program. Seniors who can get into medigap are shelling out thousands of dollars a year for coverage that is inadequate. 
   Coverage of prescription drugs is an issue of life and death for our senior citizens. Some would like to limit our assistance to only some of the elderly. Are we going to say now on this important issue that we should turn Medicare into a poverty program, a Medicaid program? Clearly, we should not. 
   There are those who say, well, Mr. President, we only have a small group that aren't covered. Let's target it at that. But every kind of indicator shows that coverage is declining every year for those who are fortunate enough to have some coverage now. 
   Our program is very clear and simple. Again, it says that this will be a priority. 
   We said: Send this legislation back to the Committee. Have it come back to the floor with funds reserved to have a prescription drug program that is going to be worthy of its name. It says that before we see the major kinds of tax breaks and tax cuts in this bill, we should meet the needs of our senior citizens. 
   Every Member of this body can give chapter and verse about what is happening in their communities, and about how important this is. I am sure that others in this body have had the opportunity, as I have, of visiting a nursing home or a senior citizen gathering and asking them: How many of you are paying out of your pocket for prescription drugs $25 or $50 or $75 a month? You see all the hands go up. You ask them: How many are paying $75 a month? You will find about half to three-quarters of them. How many are paying $50? Half or three-quarters of them. How many are paying $100 or more? You will still see many of those hands in the air. 
   We are finding that many of the senior citizens are skimping on their prescription drugs--they take half of it or skip days--despite all of the negative health implications that has. 
   It is interesting that for the five most common preventable conditions or diseases in the elderly, just five preventable diseases for which prescription drugs are available, the Medicare system pays $30 billion a year in hospitalizations. Many of those hospitalizations could have been avoided if those senior citizens had been able to afford the prescription drugs recommended by their doctors. 
   That is what we are talking about. We are going to pay for it either on the front end or the back end. 
   This motion makes sense because it is the right thing to do from a health point of view. It is the right thing to do from a bottom line point of view. It is necessary if we are going to meet our continuing responsibilities to our senior citizens. 
   I would like to mention on the floor of the Senate a petition I just received from Silver Spring, MD. It is from the Homecrest House Resident Council in Silver Spring, MD. They wrote,  
   We are enclosing our petition signed by most of our 300 residents. We are sure that we voice a concern of our friends around the Nation, seniors and disabled. We do without other necessities in order to buy needed medications.  
   Here are the names from just one senior citizen center. Three hundred senior citizens and disabled persons. They understand the importance of this particular program. 
   Again, this debate is about priorities. Are we going to have tax breaks for the wealthy and for special interests or are we going to have the protection of our seniors? 
   Final point: I was listening with great interest to the debate on the other side about whether we are going to accept the House proposal. The fact is, that House proposal has a lot of tax goodies. There is the restoration of the three-martini lunch. 
   Many Members thought we freed ourselves from the tax break for the three-martini lunch back in 1993. It is back in the House bill. 
   This bill has all sorts of other tax goodies for special interests, tax goodies for various industries, including the insurance industry, the timber interests, the oil and gas industry, for foreign tax credits, and others that I think are questionable. 
   Out of all those issue that are out there, I say prescription drugs for the elderly people are more important than putting into place the tax privileges in this bill. 
   This motion will put the Senate on record in favor of closing the largest gap in Medicare. A vote to reject it is a vote to put a higher priority on new tax breaks for the wealthy than on quality medical care for senior citizens. I know where the American people stand. It is time for the Senate to decide where it stands. 
   I hope this motion will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, to come back to a very basic and fundamental concept, we believe it is as important to give assurances to our senior citizens that there will be a prescription drug benefit for them as it is to have significant tax breaks. That is what this is about. 
   Those that oppose us say they have a different conclusion, a different priority. They think tax breaks are preferable. Then they make other assumptions in terms of what is going to be available at some future time. 
   I am not going to spend the last few minutes on this dispute, because this has been debated over the past few days, but the Wall Street Journal, the CBO, and OMB have basically indicated that if we go through with the kind of tax cut that is being proposed and advanced by our Republican friends, there just won't be resources left to deal with the elderly, the children and other priorities. 
   I say, why ask the senior citizens to wait? Why should they always be the ones who have to wait? Why shouldn't we say that the Senate will put aside the amount necessary to afford a good benefit program on prescription drugs as part of this legislation? 
   We want to give them the assurance that they are going to be protected. Why leave it iffy to the seniors? Why are they always the ones left behind? That is the question. This is an issue of priority. 
   We say, if you are going to go down this road with regard to tax breaks that benefit the wealthy, let's make sure we are going to allocate some funds for a prescription drug benefit for the senior citizens and disabled persons who are on Medicare. 
   My friend and colleague from Louisiana said we can't do that over this period of time. Well, they are going to have a conference on the two tax bills over the weekend. If they can have a conference on these two bills over the weekend, they ought to be able to get together and allocate sufficient funds for a prescription drug benefit in about half an hour. In the Finance Committee, 
   we know they can do that within an hour. They can do it forthwith--introduce and report back with funds reserved for a benefit program. But we wanted to leave this up to the Finance Committee. This should not be a procedural issue, and it is not. Those of us who are supporting it are telling every senior citizen that we believe they are a priority, that their interests are important, and that their health care needs will be met. This isn't only an issue for the health care of the senior citizens; this matters to their children and grandchildren. They have an interest in the health care of their parents and grandparents. 
   We ought to be able to have a Finance Committee that can report back allocations of resources and say a sufficient amount will be reserved for prescription drugs. We will go ahead with the rest, but this is reserved for prescription drugs for all of those in Medicare. Let the Finance Committee work that process out, either as part of the Medicare proposal or as a separate proposal. 
   This is what this is about--priorities. It is about priorities. Those of us who are supporting it are giving the priorities to our senior citizens. 
   Finally, how much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, virtually every major organization that represents senior citizens or persons with disabilities is in urgent support of this particular motion. 
   They know what is happening. There isn't a Member who hasn't gone home and met with seniors in the state that doesn't know what is happening. It is not good enough to say we care about it and we will handle it some time in the future. You have a chance to handle it now, in the next 15 minutes. 
   We have a chance to put the Senate of the United States on record and say: OK, we will work the details out now, but we are going to allocate the resources for it. We don't have to do as my friend and colleague from Tennessee says--that we can wait until after 10 years and see where we are; or as our friend from Louisiana said, we can deal with this some time in the future. 
   The seniors deserve better. They need an answer and they need it now. They need a message from the Senate that says we hear you, we know what is of concern to those who have made this the great country that it is. They deserve this kind of a protection. 
   There is an enormous need and incredible consequences. It is a matter of life and death for many senior citizens. Let us say that it is at least--at least--as important to guarantee that there will be funding for prescription drugs as it is for a tax benefit. Many of us believe it is more important, but with this motion to recommit the bill we are saying it is at least as important as the tax cut bill itself. I hope this motion will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, can we have order? I will just take one moment. 
   Mr. President, when the Medicare program was agreed to in 1965, it was intended to provide health security for the seniors in this country. Now it still is a vital force, but there is a major element that is missing, and that is the prescription drug coverage. 
   There are no senior citizens, unless they are on Medicaid, who have a prescription drug benefit that is reliable, dependable, and affordable. This particular motion says we believe, those who support it, that as a part of this tax cut there ought to be set aside funding for a prescription drug benefit. We do not believe a tax cut has a higher priority than providing a prescription drug benefit for our seniors. But what we do say is the Finance Committee should set aside sufficient funds, and that the program can be developed later in this term. The motion ensures that funds will be earmarked to provide our senior citizens with a reliable, dependable, affordable prescription drug benefit. 
   Make such a fund part of this whole program. Do not take a chance there will be some funds down the line. Do not ask our seniors to wait any further.  They have waited long enough. They need this; they depend on it. Prescription drugs are a lifeline for our senior citizens. 
   I hope this motion will be passed as part of a tax program, and that there will be a designated fund available for a prescription drug program for all Medicare beneficiaries.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we should be doing all we can to help improve public schools to ensure a brighter future for children and the nation. We should help communities improve teacher training and teacher recruitment; reduce class sizes, especially in the early grades; expand after-school programs; build new schools, and modernize crumbling and overcrowded schools; provide up-to-date-technologies in every classroom; and make college more accessible and affordable to all families across the country. 
   But, the Republicans insist on an excessive tax cut at the expense of education and children. We should be making a strong investment in education--not undermining education. 
   The Republican budget denies 5.9 million children in high-poverty communities the extra support they need to meet basic academic standards through the Title I program, including 81,547 children in Massachusetts. It denies 480,000 children the assistance they need to learn to read well by the 4th grade through the Reading Excellence Act. It denies more than a million children the opportunity to learn in smaller classes where they will get the individual attention they need to succeed in school. It denies 430,000 children the Head Start services that help them come to school ready to learn. It denies 215,000 students the after-school and summer school programs they need to stay off the streets and out of trouble. It denies 500,000 disadvantaged students the extra guidance and support they need to prepare for college through the TRIO and GEAR-UP programs. It cuts  IDEA by $3.4 billion, resulting in a reduction in the federal share of the funding, rather than the increase requested by school boards and administrators across the country. 
   The Republican assault on education doesn't stop with young children--it affects college students, too. It makes college less affordable for nearly 4 million low- and middle-income students--by slashing the maximum Pell grant to $2,175, the lowest level since 1987. It denies 500,000 students the opportunity to work their way through college. 
   Education for the nation's children must be a higher priority than tax breaks for the rich. The American people tell us that improving public schools is one of their top priorities. They support reducing class sizes. They support after-school programs to help children learn, and to reduce juvenile crime. They agree that every classroom should have a well-qualified teacher. They believe technology should be part of the classroom. They believe that all children should have the opportunity to meet high standards of achievement. They want us to make college more accessible and affordable. 
   Instead of offering new tax breaks for the wealthy, Congress should be addressing the priority education needs of children and families across the country--and help all children get a good education. 
   Overcrowded classrooms undermine discipline and decrease student morale. Students in small classes in the early grades make more rapid progress than students in larger classes. The benefits are greatest for low-achieving, minority, and low-income children. Smaller classes also enable teachers to identify and work effectively with students who have learning disabilities, and reduce the need for special education in later grades. 
   The nation's students deserve modern schools with world-class teachers. But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. The latest international survey of math and science achievement confirms the urgent need to raise standards of performance for schools, teachers, and students alike. It is shameful that America's twelfth graders ranked among the lowest of the 22 nations participating in the international survey of math and science. 
   The teacher shortage has forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers, or ask certified teachers to teach outside their area of expertise. Each year, more than 50,000 under-prepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four new teachers does not meet state certification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no teacher training at all. Students in inner-city schools have only a 50% chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In Massachusetts, 30% of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
   Another high priority is to meet the need for more after-school activities. Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are left home alone after school. Juvenile delinquency peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. Children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior. 
   We need to do more--not less--to meet workers' needs for additional job training opportunities, and to meet families' needs for affordable college education. The nation's workers require strong skills to compete in the new global economy. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 42 percent of all jobs created between 1996-2006 will require education beyond high school. 
   Education is the key to future earning power. A college graduate earns almost twice as much as a high school graduate earns, and close to three times what a high school dropout earns. 
   Those who complete a post-secondary vocational degree or certificate are more likely to be employed than those who do not pursue post-secondary education. But the average student debt is skyrocketing. In 1995-96, the average debt for undergraduates who borrowed was almost $10,000, an increase of 24 percent just since 1992-93. For graduates of four-year schools, the average debt was $12,000. In the 1990s, students have borrowed more in student loans than in the three preceding decades combined. 
   The time is now to do all we can to improve education across the country. 
   The time is now to meet our commitment to help communities reduce class size, so that students get the individual attention they need. 
   The time is now to expand after-school opportunities, so that constructive alternatives are available to students. 
   The time is now to provide greater resources to modernize and expand schools to meet the urgent need for up-to-date facilities. 
   The time is now to expand support for IDEA, so that more children with disabilities receive a high-quality education. 
   The time is now to provide better training for current and new teachers, so that they are well-prepared to teach to high standards. 
   The time is now to increase funding for critical programs to raise academic standards for all children. 
   The time is now to make college and job training more accessible and affordable for all students. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Senator BINGAMAN's Sense of the Senate commitment to support increased funding for education. Now is the time to do what it takes to give every child a good education.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am in strong support of Senator ROBB's amendment to recommit the tax bill to instruct the Finance Committee to make a $5.7 billion investment in rebuilding and modernizing the nation's schools. I commend Senator ROBB for his leadership on this issue and I urge my colleagues to support this sensible legislation that is necessary to help the nation meet the critical need to modernize and rebuild crumbling and overcrowded schools. 
   Schools, communities, and governments at every level have to do more to improve student achievement. Schools need smaller classes, particularly in the early grades. They need stronger parent involvement. They need well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep up with current developments in their field and the best teaching practices. They need after-school instruction for students who need extra help, and after-school programs to engage students in construction activities. They need safe, modern facilities with up-to-date technology. 
   But, this investment can't succeed when roofs are crumbling and children are in overcrowded classrooms. Sending children to dilapidated, overcrowded facilities sends a message to these children. It tells them they don't matter. No CEO would tolerate a leaky ceiling in the board room, and no teacher should have to tolerate it in the classroom. We need to do all we can  to ensure that children are learning in safe, modern school buildings. 
   Renovation, rehabilitation, and modernization will allow schools to correct problems that prevent them from offering an environment conducive to learning. Researchers have documented a clear link between school building conditions and student learning. A study by Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University in 1996 compared test scores of students in substandard and above-standard buildings, and found that students in better buildings with access to modern technology do better in their academic work then those without these problems. 
   Nearly one third of all public schools are more than 50 years old. 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings, and half of the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. The problems with ailing school buildings aren't the problems of the inner city alone. They exist in almost every community, whether urban, rural, or suburban. 
   In addition to modernizing and renovating dilapidated schools, communities need to build new schools in order to keep pace with rising enrollments and to reduce class sizes. Elementary and secondary school enrollment has reached an all-time high again this year of 53 million students, and will continue to grow. 
   The Department of Education estimates that 2,400 new public schools will be needed by 2003, to accommodate rising enrollments. The General Accounting Office estimates that it will cost communities $112 billion to repair and modernize the nation's schools. Congress should lend a helping hand and do all we can to help schools and communities across the country meet this challenge. 
   In Massachusetts, 41 percent of schools report that at least one building needs extensive repairs or should be replaced. 80 percent of schools report at least one unsatisfactory environmental factor. 48 percent have inadequate heating, ventilation, or air conditioning. And 36 percent report inadequate plumbing systems. 
   This past year, I visited Everett Elementary School in Dorchester, Massachusetts. The school is experiencing serious overcrowding. The average class size is 28 students. The principal of the school gave up her office and moved into a closet in the hall in order to accommodate the rising enrollment. When the school needs the multi-purpose auditorium/library, the rolling bookcases are moved to the basement, and the library has to close for the rest of the day. 
   In Fitchburg, Massachusetts, enrollments are rising by 200 students a year. Educators there would like to reduce class size, extend special education and bilingual education programs, and hire new teachers, but the school system does not have the facilities or resources to accomplish these important goals. Instead, Fitchburg has been forced to construct four portable facilities--and a fifth is under construction--to deal with overcrowding. 
   Forrest Grove Middle School in Worcester, Massachusetts, is at full capacity with 750 students. As enrollments rise, they expect an additional 150 students, forcing them to rent rooms at a local church to alleviate overcrowding. The schools in Olathe, Kansas are growing at a rate of 500-1,000 students a year, which is equivalent to about one new school per year. 
   Two cafeterias at Bladensburg High School in Prince Georges County, Virginia were recently closed because they were infested with mice and roaches. A teacher commented, ``It's disgusting. It causes chaos when the mice run around the room.'' At an elementary school in Montgomery, Alabama, a ceiling which had been damaged by leaking water collapsed only 40 minutes after the children had left for the day. 
   In Ramona, California, where overcrowding is a serious problem, one elementary school is composed entirely of portable buildings. It has neither a cafeteria nor an auditorium, and a single relocatable room is used as a library, computer lab, music room, and art room. 
   In Silver Spring, Maryland, a second-grade reading class has to squeeze through a narrow corridor with a sink on one side into a space about 14 feet wide by 15 feet long. 
   Schools are trying to meet their needs, but they can't do it alone. The federal government should join with state and local governments and community organizations to ensure that all children have the opportunity to get a good education in a safe and up-to-date school building. 
   Children need and deserve a good education in order to succeed in life. But they cannot obtain that education if school roofs are falling down around them, sewage is backing up through faulty plumbing, asbestos is flaking off the walls and ceilings, schools lack computers and modern technology, and classrooms are overcrowded. We need to invest more to help states and communities rebuild crumbling schools, modernize old buildings, and expand facilities to accommodate reduced class sizes. 
   Senator ROBB's bill offers school districts the necessary flexibility and assistance to get the job done. Under this proposal, states will be able to put together a school financing package which best meets their needs. It offers states and school districts five choices from a menu of school construction financing components. It gives states and communities the authority to offer zero-interest school modernization bonds. It also offers other tax incentives to enhance the ability of communities to rebuild their schools, including private activity bonds, advance refunding, elimination of arbitrage rebates for small issuers, and Federal Home Loan Bank guarantees on school construction bonds. 
   I urge my colleagues to support Senator ROBB's amendment. The time is now to do all we can to help rebuild and modernize public schools, so that all children can succeed in safe, technologically-equipped schools.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, members on both sides of the aisle have spent a great deal of time over the past two years talking about child care. We've introduced dozens of bills. We've held extensive hearings. We know the difficulties facing countless families across the nation in obtaining affordable, quality care for their children. 
   We've emphasized the scientific research that confirms again and again that quality early childhood support is necessary for proper brain development of infants and toddlers. We've called for significant additional investments in the nation's children when they are very young, so that all children can benefit from healthy growth and development. The alternative is unacceptable because it means far higher costs in the long run, and because it denies many thousands of children the opportunity to enter school ready to learn. 
   For all the talk, there has been far too little action. We have severely underfunded the Child Care and Development Block Grants to the states. Only one in ten children who qualify for federal assistance actually receives it. When states run out of funds, they place many of the remaining children on waiting lists. Today, over two hundred thousands children who need a safe and stimulating environment while their parents work are on waiting lists instead. At a hearing held this week, Senators from both parties called this a national disgrace, and I could not agree more. 
   Many of those who have taken jobs under welfare reform are parents who can only find minimum wage employment. At today's low minimum wage, full time work pays only $10,712 in wages a year. Yet child care for one child costs thousands of dollars a year. Without adequate child care assistance, it is irresponsible to demand that parents leave their infants and toddlers without adequate care. Yet that is the consequence of our refusal to fully fund the Child Care and Development Block Grant. 
   With the amendment of Senator DODD and Senator JEFFORDS, we can begin to deal more effectively with this serious problem. The amendment represents concrete progress in fulfilling the nation's commitment to children. It would give states the additional resources they need to support quality child care in their communities. In this time of enormous prosperity, it is not only the right thing to do--it is a wise investment for this nation's future.

   I am delighted to bring my colleagues' attention today to a New York Times article last Sunday on ``The Four Seas'' and owner Richard Warren's extraordinary relationship with his employees and the entire community.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the principle of the Bancus amendment goes to the heart of this debate. We should not enact tax cuts which will use up virtually the entire surplus before we solve the significant financial problems facing Social Security and Medicare. 
   Placing Social Security and Medicare on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priorities. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to extend the long-term solvency of these two vital programs, without hurting the senior citizens who depend upon them. We should seize that opportunity. 
   Two-thirds of senior citizens depend on Social Security retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. Without it, half of the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. These same retirees rely on Medicare for their only access to needed health care. For all of them, the Republican proposal does absolutely nothing. It does not provide one new dollar to support Social Security or Medicare. It squanders the unique opportunity which the surplus has given us. 
   Social Security and Medicare represent America at its best. They reflect a commitment to every worker that disability and retirement will not mean poverty and untreated illness. They are a compact between the Federal government and its citizens that says: work hard and contribute to the system when you are young, and we will guarantee your financial security and your health security when you are old. 
   It has been said that the measure of a society is how well it takes care of its most vulnerable citizens--the very young and the very old. By that standard, Social Security and Medicare are among the finest achievements in all of our history. Because of Social Security and Medicare, millions of senior citizens are able to spend their retirement years in security and dignity. A Republican tax cut of the magnitude proposed here today will put their retirement security in serious jeopardy. 
   In the first ten years, the Republican tax cut of $792 billion--plus the increased interest on the national debt required by it--will consume all but $25 billion of the $996 billion surplus. The cost of the tax cut alone will mushroom to two trillion dollars between 2010 and 2019, plus hundreds of billions more in additional debt service. There will be no surplus left to strengthen Social Security and Medicare for future generations of retirees. The needs of the millions of Americans who depend on these basic programs for their well-being are ignored. 
   Democrats propose a very different set of priorities for the surplus. We commit one-third of the surplus--$290 billion over the next decade and more thereafter--to Medicare. And beginning in 2011, we would dedicate all of the savings which will result from debt reduction to Social Security. 
   Today, interest on the debt consumes nearly 13% of the federal budget. Under the President's plan, by 2015, that annual debt interest expense will be completely eliminated. As a result, between 2011 and 2019, more than a trillion additional dollars will be available to pay future Social Security benefits. We will be meeting our responsibility to future generations of retirees. 
   In addition, the GOP tax cut is fundamentally unfair in additional ways. It distributes the overwhelming majority of its tax breaks to those with the highest incomes. The authors of the Republican plan highlight the reduction of the 15% tax bracket to 14%. They point to this reduction as middle class tax relief. But that relief is only a small part of the overall tax breaks in their plan. It accounts for only $216 billion of the $792 billion in GOP tax cuts. Most of the remaining provisions are heavily tilted toward the highest income taxpayers. 
   If the Republican plan is enacted and implemented, nearly 50% of the tax benefits would go to the richest 5% of taxpayers--and more than 75% of the benefits would go to the wealthiest 
   20%. Those with annual incomes exceeding $300,000 would receive tax breaks of $23,000 a year. By contrast, the lowest 60% of wage-earners would share less than 11% of the total tax cuts--they would receive an average tax cut of only $139 a year. 
   The choice could not be more stark--it is between using the entire surplus for an enormous GOP tax cut which overwhelmingly benefits the wealthiest Americans, or using the surplus for modest tax cuts that leave room to preserve Social Security and Medicare for future generations of retirees.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, yesterday, the House of Representatives with very little discussion and debate voted themselves a $4,600 pay increase. The Senate passed a similar measure earlier this month. Fair is fair. If Members of Congress deserve a raise, then surely the hard-working, lowest paid workers across this country deserve an increase in the minimum wage as well. Shame on this Congress when we vote ourselves a $4,600 pay increase, yet do nothing for the lowest paid workers in America. 
   I intend to do all I can to see that Congress acts to raise the minimum wage as soon as possible. When President Clinton signs the law to raise the pay for the 535 Members of Congress, he should also have on his desk the bill to raise the pay for the 11 million Americans who work for the minimum wage. 
   The case for an increase in the minimum wage is overwhelming. Since 1991, congressional pay has increased $39,400. In the same amount of time, a minimum wage worker has seen a pay increase of only $1,870. 
   Legislation to raise the minimum wage--the Fair Minimum Wage Act--has been installed for many months by this Republican Congress. Our proposal will raise the federal minimum wage from its present level of $5.15 an hour to $5.65 on September 1, 1999 and to $6.15 an hour on September 1, 2000. 
   Speaker HASTERT said last March, ``I feel Members of Congress come here, they do their work. I know there are Members that have three or four kids in college at a time. I'm not crying crocodile tears, but they need to be able to have a life and provide for their family.'' 
   I say minimum wage workers have a life, too. They need to provide for their families, too. They need to put their children through college, too. 
   Under our proposal, a minimum wage worker would earn an additional $2,000 a year. That amount will pay for 7 months of groceries to feed the average family. It will pay to house an average family for 5 months. It will pay for 10 months of utilities. It will cover a year and a half of tuition and fees at a 2-year college. It will provide greater opportunities for all those struggling at the minimum wage to obtain the skills they need for better jobs and better careers and better support for their families. 
   We know that under current law, minimum wage earners can barely make ends meet. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712.almost $3,200 below the poverty line for a family of three. A full day's work should mean a fair day's pay. But for millions of Americans who earn the minimum wage, the pay is unfair. 
   Opponents complain that increasing the minimum wage hurts small business and causes job losses. But these claims have been proven wrong. In fact, since the most recent increases in the federal minimum wage--a 50-cent increase in October 1996 and a 40-cent increase in September 1997--employment has risen in virtually all sectors of the economy. Over 8 million new jobs have been added to the workforce, including 1.1 million retail jobs, 350,000 restaurant jobs, and more than 4 million jobs in the service industry. The increases boosted the earnings of 9.9 million low-wage workers directly, and millions more indirectly, but far from enough. 
   As Business Week has stated:  
   [H]igher minimum wages are supposed to lead to fewer jobs. Not today. In a fast-growth, low-inflation economy, minimum wages raise income, not unemployment. ..... A higher minimum wage can be an engine for upward mobility. When employees become more valuable, employers tend to boost training and install equipment to make them more productive. Higher wages at the bottom often lead to better education for both workers and their children.  
   Even Business Week agrees, ``It is time to set aside old assumptions about the minimum wage.'' 
   The national economy is the strongest in a generation, with the lowest unemployment rate in almost three decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable period of growth and prosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating an unprecedented expansion, with impressive efficiencies and significant job creation. The stock market has soared. Inflation is low, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low. 
   But despite this unprecedented economic growth, too many workers are not reaping the benefits of this prosperity. To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage should be at least $7.49 an hour today, not $5.15. This unconscionable gap shows how far we have fallen short over the past 30 years in granting low-income workers their fair share of the country's extraordinary prosperity. 
   Since 1968, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by over 150 percent--while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down by 30 percent. Shame on Congress for allowing that decline. 
   As the economy reaches new heights, so do CEO salaries, often reaching tens of millions of dollars a year. At that rate, it takes a CEO barely 2 hours to earn what a minimum wage worker earns in an entire year. The rise in income inequality between the country's top earners and those at the bottom makes our Nation weaker, not stronger. 
   In a strong economy, we can clearly afford to give low income workers a rise. Our national wage total is over $4.2 trillion. That is what American employers are paying in wages today. The increase of one dollar that we proposed would raise the national wage total by only one-fifth of 1 percent. 
   That is a drop in the bucket in the overall American economy, but a significant benefit for low-income workers. 
   According to the Department of Labor, 59 percent of minimum wage earners are women. Nearly three-fourths are adults. Forty percent are the sole breadwinners in their families. Almost half work full time. They are teachers' aides and child care providers, home health care assistants and clothing store workers. They care for the elderly in nursing homes. They stock the food shelves at the corner store. They clean office buildings in thousands of communities across the country. 
   The minimum wage is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue. It is a labor issue. It is a family issue. Above all, it is a fairness issue and a dignity issue. It is time to raise the federal minimum wage again. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty. 
   This chart over here indicates clearly what has happened to the unemployment rate with previous increases in the minimum wage. For years, we have often heard that an increase in the minimum wage would see an increase in unemployment. In 1996, we had an increase in the minimum wage to $4.75 an hour, and we have seen the gradual decline in unemployment. Then we raised it to $5.15 an hour in September 1997, and we continue to see the decline in unemployment. 
   This chart over here indicates how long an average CEO has to work in order to make what a minimum-wage worker earns over the year. By 10:06 a.m. on the first working day--say, for January 1st--the average CEO has made what will take a minimum-wage worker to earn by 5 p.m. on December 31. In just over 2 hours, the average CEO has made what a minimum-wage worker will make by the end of the year. 
   Finally, this chart over here shows what the poverty line is for a family of three. The lower line here shows what the annual minimum-wage earnings are. What we see in 1999 is the continuing decline in the value of the minimum wage as minimum wage earners fall further below the poverty level. 
   It is time those men and women who work hard--play by the rules, work 52 weeks of the year, 40 hours a week, 8 hours a day--are not going to have to live in poverty. We are going to insist this issue be before the Senate in these next very few days or weeks.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to express my deep disappointment by the failure of the parties to move forward with the peace process in Northern Ireland. The Good Friday Peace Agreement was endorsed by the overwhelming majority of the people of Northern Ireland, and it offers the only  realistic hope for lasting peace for the two communities. We cannot let it fail. 
   It is hard to understand why this moment was not seized. The Good Friday Peace Agreement is the only way forward--the only way to bring the two communities closer together to build a better future for the people of Northern Ireland. 
   Decommissioning was not a precondition for the formation of the Executive, but it should take place along with other provisions of the agreement. The Way Forward proposal outlined a clear timetable for addressing the issue. It required clear progress on decommissioning in the coming weeks. General De Chastelain would review progress on decommissioning in September, in December, and again in May 2000. He would need to say publicly that everyone is cooperating. Without significant progress, the Executive would be disbanded. 
   It is tragic that the opportunity to form the Executive was missed. 
   The Agreement is the mandate of the people, and must be implemented. It offers the Unionists their key demands--their constitutional position, the principle of consent, an end to violence. 
   I would hope that once out of the marching season and after a period of reflection and the review by the governments and parties of the working of the agreement--not a review of the agreement itself--that wiser counsels will prevail in September. 
   I share the frustration expressed by President Clinton that a breakthrough of this potential is being stalled by a dispute on sequencing, which should weigh very little compared to the historic agreement on areas of substance reached in the negotiations. 
   I applaud the determination of the two Prime Ministers and President Clinton to persist in their efforts, with the support of Senator Mitchell, to overcome this last hurdle. 
   Despite this latest impasse, all who care about peace must redouble their efforts to find a solution. We must focus our energy on increasing the political dialogue and securing full implementation of the agreement. 
   A way must be found to build trust between the two communities of Northern Ireland. It is clearly the will of the people of Northern Ireland. 
   The Governments of Ireland and Great Britain and the United States must continue to work together to revitalize the peace process. We cannot let it fail. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes. 
   The longer this debate goes on, the stranger I find those who are supporting the Republican proposal. Their basic proposal started out costing $1 billion. They will have the agreement later this morning, with the acceptance of the long-term care credit, that will end up costing $13.1 billion--$1 billion for patient protections; 100-percent deductibility, $2.9 billion; liberalized MSAs, $1.5 billion; flexible spending accounts, $2.3 billion. That adds to $7.7 billion. And the deductibility of long-term care is $5.4 billion, according to the Senator from Oklahoma. That is $13.1 billion, and not a cent of it is paid for. 
   Their proposal has gone from $1 billion to $13 billion. Our proposal, according to CBO, is approximately $7 billion, which represents the 4.8 percent figure from CBO. I certainly hope we won't hear any more about the cost of our proposal from our good friends. That was a hot button item. It didn't have anything to do with protecting patients, but it was a hot button item. 
   Secondly, I hope we won't hear any more about one-size-fits-all. We listened to that line for 3 days. We will probably hear it later in the course of debate on many different measures. ``We don't want a solution of one-size-fits-all.'' Our good friend, Senator COLLINS from Maine, used that 10 times in her presentation. We are having a one-size-fits-all with the Republican proposal because, effectively, they are excluding the States from making their own determination as to what actions the state might take in holding people accountable. The Republican proposal can be labelled ``one-size-fits-all'' if they are successful on this measure. 
   They are saying to every State in the country: No, you cannot provide the remedies you would like for malpractice by those making health care decisions. We have one industry in this country that is going to be sacred, one industry that will not be held responsible. You can continue to sue doctors, but we will not permit any State in this country to determine whether you can sue your HMO. 
   That is an extraordinary position for our good friends, the Republicans, who are always talking about one-size-fits-all, who are always saying that Washington doesn't always know best. I hope we are not going to continue to hear, ``Washington doesn't know best. The people in the hinterlands know what is going on. They can make up their minds in the States. The States are the great laboratories for innovation and creativity.'' 
   I can give those speeches, but they are wiping that out with this particular amendment. As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, this amendment is so basic and fundamental in protecting American citizens. 
   Even my good friend from New Hampshire has addressed this issue--I am sure he expected to hear this, but he ought to hear it as one of the principals, and now as acting manager. Last year, when we had the issue of liability of tobacco companies, this is what he said, and we will include the statement in the RECORD:   
   When you eliminate that right of redress issue--  
   Which is effectively what the Republican proposal would do--  
   which this bill does, when you take away the ability of the consumer, of the person who has been damaged, of John and Mary Jones, of Epping, NH, to get a recovery for an injury they have received, you have artificially preserved the marketplace, but, more importantly, you have given a unique historic and totally inappropriate protection to an industry.  
   The Senate accepted that position overwhelmingly. I think there were 20-odd votes in opposition on that issue. But here we have the insurance industry. Evidently, the message is that the insurance industry is more powerful than the tobacco industry. 
   Apparently, the insurance industry has the votes to get their way on this issue.  
   Why is this issue important? This issue is important for two very basic and fundamental reasons. First, by making the right to sue available, there is an additional incentive--a powerful incentive--to HMOs and others in the health delivery system. There is an incentive to make sure they do what is medically appropriate because they know they may be held liable if they do not. 
   You may say: That is good in theory, but is it so? Look at Medicaid. Under the Medicaid system, a plan may be held liable, the health delivery system may be held accountable. Do we have people abusing the liability provisions? The answer is no. The answer is no. 
   As the Senator from Illinois pointed out, the State that allowed for liability most recently was Texas. Has there been a resulting proliferation of lawsuits, as the Senator from Alabama has suggested? The answer is no. There is one legal case that was brought and possibly one or two more pending. 
   City and State officials have the right to sue. You can take the example of CalPERS, one of the largest health delivery systems in the country, with 1.2 million members. They have had the right to sue for a number of years. You can look at CalPERS premiums over the last 5 years. The cost increase of the premium for CalPERS--whose members have the right to sue--has actually been below the national average for HMOs over the last 5 years. The Senator from Illinois has indicated, as well, the findings of the various studies which support this. 
   Most important, the answer we get from the other side is we don't need accountability because we have a good internal and external review system under the Republican proposal. That is a phony argument. Over the past 3 days we have shown why this argument is phony. The Republican appeals proposal is a fixed system. There is no de novo review. There are many other problems in their appeals system which we have previously addressed. Yet their best answer is that the external review program is a substitute for the right to hold plans accountable in court. 
   What happens when the plan drags its feet through the review process until it is too late for the patient? What happens when the plan doesn't tell the patient an external review is even available and the patient doesn't find out about its availability until the damage is done? What happens when the plan makes a practice of turning down everyone--this is reality--who applies for an expensive procedure, knowing there will be an appeal in only a fraction of the cases? Knowing that the worst penalty they could have is to pay the cost of the procedure that should have been provided in the first place?

   Mr. KENNEDY. The patient never learns the procedure should have been provided until it is too late. 
   What happens when the plan refers the patient to an unqualified doctor for a procedure because it doesn't want to pay for a more qualified specialist outside the network? What happens when the patient trusted the plan to do the right thing? 
   According to the opponents of this proposal, those kinds of abusive practices should carry no penalty at all because you can't sue your way to quality. I would like to hear them say that to a widow who lost a husband--the father of her children--to a plan's greed. 
   I would like to hear them say that to a young man disabled for life because his health plan insisted on the cheapest therapy instead of the best therapy. 
   I would like to hear them say that to the parents whose child has died because the health plan mislead them about the availability of appropriate treatment. 
   I challenge the opponents of this provision to tell the American people why public employees in there own States should have the right to hold their health plan accountable, but the equally hard-working family just down the street employed in the local bank or grocery store shouldn't have the same right. 
   I challenge them to explain to the child or spouse of someone who has died or become permanently disabled due to HMO abuses, why they should have to live in poverty while a multibillion-dollar corporation gets off scot-free. 
   I challenge those on the other side--who talked so much during the debate on welfare reform about the need for people to take responsibility for their actions--to explain why this standard should apply to poor, single mothers but not to HMOs. 
   I challenge them to explain why every other industry in America should be held responsible for its actions, but HMOs and health insurance companies should be immune from responsibility. 
   The time has come to say that this unique immunity should end. 
   The time has come to say that someone who dies or is injured because an insurance company accountant overrules the doctor is entitled to compensation. 
   The time has come to say that profits should no longer take priority over patients' care. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

   Madam President, statements have been made here to the effect that we should not let this process go forward. Statements have been made that this is basically a Democratic initiative, a partisan issue. We have claimed it is an issue of fundamental justice. 
   Let me quote Frank Keating, the Republican Governor of Oklahoma, a man who was so respected in his own party that he was elected chairman of the Republican Governors' Association. According to an Oklahoma newspaper, in an interview with Keating, Keating sided with congressional Democrats. He said health maintenance organizations should be open to lawsuits if they are grossly negligent. Keating said his oldest daughter had a heart defect since birth, but that the gatekeeper at her health maintenance organization in Texas told her she did not need to see a cardiologist. Keating said he made a call to a top aide to Texas Governor George W. Bush to get some action. He said he realized other people might not be able to pull such strings. 
   That is what a Republican Governor has said is the reality in real America.

   The real distinction between the amendment of the Senator from Oregon and the Republican amendment is that this amendment ensures the doctor will not risk his job if he advocates. He might be able to tell the patient they need a particular process, the doctor will be permitted to relay that information, but then he can be fired under the Republican proposal. 
   Also, they will have the option of giving financial incentives for doctors not to provide the best medicine.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have 2 1/2 minutes left. I will use those minutes. 
   I want to point out for the benefit of the membership, we have almost concluded our 50 minutes of debate. The debate has included a number of different amendments. All are very important because they all relate to the doctor-patient relationship. That is the heart of our entire bill. The heart of our bill is to make sure that medical professionals are able to practice the best medicine and make the best recommendations and that the insurance companies will comply with those recommendations. The heart of our bill is maintaining the relationship between the doctor and his or her patient. That is the heart of our bill. We still have not had any real criticism, observations, or comments on those issues. 
   We had some debate in the HELP Committee when these matters were raised. I note the proponents of those particular amendments--those who were on the committee and those who were not--were on the floor ready to respond to questions. Nonetheless, we have heard debate on the overall legislation. We still have not heard a response to what I think has been a powerful presentation in favor of these measures. Again, I will mention very quickly what this amendment is about. 
   This amendment is critical to preserving the relationship between medical professionals and patients, as well as providing fair information to consumers. Today, medical professionals are too often gagged, harassed, and financially penalized if they advocate for their patients. 
   I am reminded in my own State of Massachusetts of Barry Adams who was fired for simply reporting quality of care problems to his superiors. This happened just 3 months after he received a glowing evaluation that said he was an excellent role model, conducted himself in a professional manner, was an advocate for patients, and channeled his concerns appropriately. 
   Yet after he spoke up about his concerns, the facility mounted a campaign to oust him. The month he was fired, a woman died from a morphine overdose given by an unsupervised junior nurse. This was the very type of incident Barry reported previously, the very type of incident that Barry reported in the complaint that led to his firing. The facility also retaliated against two of his colleagues who reported unsafe patient conditions. 
   Barry fought back, and more than a year after he was fired, a judge ruled that Barry's termination was unlawful. The judge ordered the hospital to reinstate Barry, pay all back wages and expunge his record. He won. But the point is, he never should have been fired in the first place. This amendment prevents that from happening.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if patients cannot count on their doctor, quality medical care is impossible. If doctors cannot do their best for their patients without fear of retaliation, quality medical practice is impossible, too. 
   This amendment protects the relationship between the doctors and their patients. The Republican bill protects only the insurance companies. Part of the doctor/patient relationship is being able to go to the medical professional of your choice, not the HMO's choice. 
   This amendment establishes a point-of-service option that guarantees that choice. The Republican bill offers no meaningful guarantee. 
   Without the type of information the ombudsman program provides, too  many consumers will simply be unable to exercise the rights this bill proposes to grant. As our friend and colleague, Senator REED, pointed out, giving consumers information so they will have their rights protected under their HMO is so important. This amendment provides basic, commonsense protections for health professionals and patients, and I know of no valid reason that it should be opposed. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time. I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator pointed out for those who might be watching that if they had cancer, this amendment, if agreed to, would at least assure them of coverage. Of course, two-thirds of those individuals will not be in the plans that would be covered by this proposal. So two-thirds of those who have cancer, on the face of it, would not be protected. Contrast this with the amendment the Senator from Connecticut offered, which would have applied to all private health plans and would have included all diseases.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are at the conclusion of another part of this debate. There is an amendment that includes a variety of different provisions trying to upgrade the Republican proposal and make it more acceptable and responsive to the points that have been raised during the course of the debate. Most importantly, the points have been raised by doctors, nurses and patients all over this country. Still, they fall short. 
   These amendments are another testament to the priority the Republicans place on protecting profits instead of patients. Every time we point out the severe defects and loopholes in their plan, they say: Oh, no, we will improve it. Then the so-called improvements come, and they are virtually meaningless. It is botched cosmetic surgery; all the wrinkles still show. You can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still a pig. And you can call something a patients' bill of rights, but it is still a patients' bill of wrongs. 
   Every single one of these amendments leaves a profit-protection proposal, a sham proposal, a triumph of disinformation. We have voted on 10 of the amendments that have been offered by the other side, and we will have this amendment--10 amendments. There isn't a single amendment that has the support of a patients' organization or a medical organization--not one. I think that is a fair indication as to what those amendments are really about. 
   On the contrary, each and every one of the positions we have taken had the strong support of the medical profession. Each and every amendments we have offered--each and every one of them--had the strong support of the medical profession. I think that speaks volumes about who is really interested in protecting the patients and not the profits of the HMO. 
   Let's look at these proposals individually. The so-called independent appeals provision leaves every fundamental flaw in the original bill uncorrected. The HMO still chooses and pays the review organization. The HMOs own definition of ``medical necessity,'' no matter how unfair, still controls the whole process. That has been pointed out by our colleague, the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That particular loophole remains in the bill. 
   The clinical trials proposal applies only to cancer patients and only to those in self-funded plans. Two-thirds of Americans are left out. Two-thirds of cancer patients are left out. 
   All of the cancer organizations have rejected this proposal. We have printed their positions in the RECORD. They all reject this particular proposal. 
   If you or your loved one has heart disease or Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis or multiple sclerosis, a spinal cord injury or diabetes or AIDS, you are out of luck under the Republican plan. And if you are a farmer or small business employee who belongs to an HMO and you develop cancer, you are out of luck. 
   The continuity of care provision has not changed a bit. If you have a terminal illness and are fortunate enough to live more than 3 months, they can cut you off; you have to change doctors. If you have a long, ongoing illness--even cancer or life-threatening heart disease--you have no transition at all. And if you are one of the 113 million people not in a self-funded plan, you are not protected at all. 
   Let's go back to the basics. Again, after 4 days and 10 amendments, they have not presented a single proposal supported by any group of doctors, nurses, or patients--not one, zero. 
   Their bill is supported by the insurance companies that profit from abuse. Our bill is supported by 200 groups; doctors, nurses, and patients who want to end these abuses. 
   The Senate should stand with the health professionals and the patients, not with the powerful special interests. 
   We will have another opportunity in a few moments to stand again with the patients. Let's hope the Senate will. 
   I reserve the balance of the time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 9 minutes. 
   We are drawing to a close on this debate. While I am pleased that our colleagues have addressed an issue related to genetic discrimination in their bill, I am very concerned about the way in which this has been approached and I regret that we have not had sufficient time to focus on this issue. I was a co-sponsor of Senator SNOWE's original bill in the 105th Congress, which contained strong penalties and disclosure prohibitions. Unfortunately, the Republican bill will not stop genetic discrimination, because it lacks three key provisions. 
   First, the Republican bill does not prohibit discrimination by employers. If we only address health insurance, we could actually increase employment discrimination. Second, the Republican bill does not prohibit health insurers from sharing the information with each other and with employers. Finally, the Republican bill lacks teeth. The only penalty in the Republican bill for genetic discrimination is a fine of $100 a day. Do we really think that $100 a day will deter the health insurance industry from practicing genetic discrimination? 
   That is why Senator DASCHLE, Senator HARKIN, Senator DODD and I introduced legislation earlier this month to truly prevent genetic discrimination. Our bill prohibits disclosure of genetic information to employers, prohibits employment discrimination, and contains strong penalties. 
   The bottom line is that people are afraid, and that prohibiting health insurance discrimination is not enough. We have letters from patient groups, women's groups, medical groups, and labor groups, asking us to stop employment discrimination, place some limits on disclosure of predictive genetic information, and back up these prohibitions with strong penalties. I look forward to passing a meaningful genetic discrimination bill after this debate. 
   As to our debate this week on the Patients' Bill of Rights, I think it is fair to look at the reaction in communities across the country. I would like to share this with our colleagues. 
   Here is the St. Louis Post-Dispatch editorial, July 14 of this year:  
   The Republicans keep asking the wrong question about health care. Instead of asking how to keep the quality of health care high, their primary concern seems to be how to keep the cost of health care down. They are paying too little heed to the symptoms of an ailing health care system, which are hard to miss. There is a drumbeat of HMO horror stories. 
   Sure, people want inexpensive health care. But it is increasingly apparent that neither doctors nor nurses nor patients are willing to have appropriate medical care dictated by HMO bureaucrats with their eyes on the bottom lines.  
   Dayton, OH:  
   The Republican's bill is largely a statement of goals. The Democrats' bill provides better support for patients and medical-care providers.......  
   The Atlanta Journal and Constitution, July 15:  
   It's called the Patients' Bill of Rights but by the time the U.S. Senate gets done with it a better title will be ``The HMO Protection Act.'' 
   On amendment after amendment this week, Senate Republicans have had their way, creating a bill that seeks to limit the rights of HMO patients, not protect them....... 
   Relying on the mercies of the marketplace and the HMOs to meet America's health care needs has not worked and will not work. Patients need protections. That's what Congress ought to provide.  
   New York Times, July 15:  
   What occurred on the floor of the Senate this week was a GOP-sponsored charade in which one Republican Senator after another talked about protecting the health of patients while voting to protect the profits of industry. 
   It was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy....... 
   All that mattered was the obsession with the profits of the insurance companies and the HMOs.  
   Newsday, July 15:  
   Medical insurance? Try malpractice by GOP.  
   The Fort Worth Star-Telegram, July 13, a column by Molly Ivins:  
   We are watching a classic political shell game: There's the Patients' Bill of Rights that actually gives the patients some rights and there's the Patients' Bill of Rights that doesn't....... 
   The reason we know this is pure hooey is because the very bill they are opposing has already been in effect in Texas for over two years and none of the heinous consequences they predict has occurred here. 
   If the Republicans and the insurance industry have their way, the old shell game will run right through the Senate and we'll get something called a bill of rights that has no remedies in it.  
   The Seattle Post Intelligencer, July 8:  
   The health insurance industry is back again with a misleading campaign opposing a patients' bill of rights. 
   Just as the industry did successfully in 1994 with its Harry and Louise ads that misled the public about President Clinton's health care reform--falsely claiming that people would lose their right to choose their own doctor--the new campaign is designed to convince us that a patients' bill of rights will cause many people to lose their health insurance. 
   Like the Harry and Louise ads, the campaign relies on fear rather than fact....... 
   Consumers need avenues of redress when dealing with health care providers....... [T]he ability to sue their health care provider and portability of their health care should they change jobs or move to another area[,] those are all fundamental rights to which consumers are entitled. No one should be fooled by this later effort to distort the issue of health care.  
   The Charleston West Virginia Gazette, July 14:  
   Democrats have a proposal called the Patients' Bill of Rights. Republicans have called theirs the Patients' Bill of Rights-Plus Act. If truth-in-advertising laws applied to Congress, the GOP would have to call its bill the Patients' Bill of Rights-Minus Act....... 
   Some cost-saving measures may be necessary to keep health care spending under control, but when HMOs sacrifice patient health for profits, they must be held accountable. Democrats want that. Republicans apparently don't.  
   The News and Observer, Raleigh, NC:  
   The GOP is up against it, because this bill of rights, [referring to the Democrats'] is hardly a revolution: It would ensure that people could choose their doctors and their specialists, would allow them to go to the closest emergency room instead of one specified by an HMO, would enable them to keep a doctor who has begun treating them even if that doctor were dropped by the HMO. Republicans rail against regulation of this type, but they fail to see the American people are ready for it.  
   These are just a few examples of editorials being written all across the  country this week. Why do they all get it and no one gets it in here except Democrats and the two or three of our Republican friends who have supported the Patients' Bill of Rights? Why is the debate so different all across the country than it is, apparently, here in the Senate? Why is it that we have all the nurses supporting us? Why is it that we have all the doctors supporting us? Why is it that we have all the health professionals and all the patients groups supporting us? And why is it that newspapers and editorials all over the Nation, north, south, east, and west get it? 
   We wonder whether this is really an issue. We are asked: is this really an issue out there? I can tell you, just from the cases I have had in my own office, that this is an issue. I received a call this morning from Kathy Mills, a registered Republican who called my office from Tulsa, OK. She said her husband was literally ``killed by an HMO'' last July, and she has been trying to find someone to listen to her story. She has given up her efforts to contact her own State Senators because they have not responded to her numerous calls. 
   On July 16 last year--1 year ago tomorrow--Mrs. Mills' husband, who had a history of severe congestive heart failure, was seen by an internist at their new HMO for severe chest pain. Without taking a thorough patient history and despite a positive EKG, the doctor sent Mr. Mills home. As Mrs. Mills was later told by doctors at the HMO, their policy is to refer patients to a cardiologist only after waiting 10 days, unless the patient is ``having a heart attack on the table.'' Mr. Mills was released to go back to his job, working outside in 100-degree weather. 
   Mr. Mills died later that day of a massive heart attack. 
   The HMO doctors have been forthcoming, and after extensive inquiry Mrs. Mills feels certain it is HMO policy that is at fault for her husband's death. Unfortunately, her attorney has informed her she does not have the right to sue the HMO. 
   Mrs. Mills just this morning offered to fly to Washington with what little money she has left to tell her story to the Members of the Senate. Her conviction is that in the future injustices like the unnecessary death of her husband will be prevented, or at the least that when they occur the Americans victimized will have some means to redress the wrong. 
   People ask whether this is still going on. This is yesterday. Here is a story about Jacob. Jacob is 4 years old and lives in a midwestern State. Jacob's mom has asked that we not use his last name or the name of the HMO because she is afraid of what the HMO will do. 
   Jacob was diagnosed with a rare form of cancer. The course of treatment recommended by Jacob's doctor was called monoclonal antibody treatment, and it is only available at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in New York. Jacob could participate in a clinical trial at Memorial Sloan-Kettering that would involve complex surgery, transplant, radiation, and chemotherapy treatment. 
   When Jacob's parents inquired into the clinical trial, their physician told them it was not experimental. Their physician told them that monoclonal antibody treatment is the standard of care for Jacob's type of cancer, and has been standard treatment in use since 1987. Even though this recommended course of action is the standard treatment, because Jacob's treatment could only be obtained through a clinical trial, his HMO denied him this needed therapy. After many months of fighting the HMO from both inside and outside the system, the company approved the first stage of Jacob's treatment. 
   However, the story does not end there. Jacob's only hope for a cure is to complete the entire course of treatment which comes in four stages. Jacob's family continues to live in fear of their HMO because he has not completed the treatment yet and, in the words of his HMO, ``This determination to provide coverage ..... may be terminated at any time, even if the condition or treatment remains unchanged.'' 
   Jacob and his family are currently receiving treatment, but they live in fear. 
   I can give you the story that I received last Friday, a very powerful case involving a small boy and how he was denied needed surgery by one of the major HMOs in this country. 
   This is happening every day, every hour. People all across the country understand it. Certainly the parents of these children understand it. Mrs. Mills understands what is happening. I doubt there is a Senator's office that hasn't received similar calls in the last few days. 
   We have had a series of votes in the last 4 days, and each of these votes has been decided in the interest of the insurance industry. They have prevailed over patients' interests, but only by a narrow margin. That is only temporary. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself 2 minutes on the bill. We may have lost the battle for the minds of Republican Senators, but we are winning the battle in the minds of the public. 
   Once the debate is over and the votes are counted, the action will move to the House of Representatives. I believe we will do better in the House because of the groundwork we have laid in the Senate. We intend to keep the pressure on. There is still a good chance that a strong Patients' Bill of Rights can be enacted into law by this Congress this year. A switch of only two or three votes would have given us victory after victory on each of these specific issues. 
   If there is an attempt to bury this issue in the Senate-House conference, the consent agreement makes clear that we can raise it again and again in the Senate this year. Every day, every week, 
   every month we delay, more patients suffer. 
   This is a Pyrrhic victory for the Republicans. If they keep taking marching orders from HMOs, they will keep losing public support. The American people will not be fooled by hollow Republican promises and cosmetic Republican alternatives. Patients deserve real protections, and not just some patients, but all patients. 
   You should not have to gamble on your health. You should not have to play a game of Republican roulette to get the health care you need and deserve. This issue is not going away. Too many people have had too many bad experiences with abuses by HMOs and managed care health plans. They know the horror stories firsthand. Everyone knows these abuses are wrong, and, frankly, we have only just begun to fight.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Chair would be good enough to let me know when 5 minutes remain. 
   Mr. President, a little over 2 years ago, a number of Members were working with those involved in the health care field, those that have been injured because of actions taken by HMOs, and those doctors and nurses who believe that we could do better. 
   Tonight we are at a point in the development of a policy where we have seen a setback in terms of protecting patients. We have seen a setback in giving patients and their doctors the opportunity to make medical judgments, rather than having their medical judgments overridden by the economic judgments made by gatekeepers, accountants or insurance company officials. We have received a setback, but I, for one, am not discouraged. I believe that as a result of the last 4 days of debate not only do we have a better understanding about what is important, but I think the American people have a much better understanding. 
   I think the actions we can expect from the House of Representatives as we begin their debate and discussions starts at an entirely different level. I am very hopeful we will get a strong bill out of the House of Representatives. 
   I am absolutely convinced, as I stand here, that we will have the opportunity to resolve this issue in favor of the concept underlying the Democratic bill, a concept which as been supported by doctors, nurses, by children's advocates, women's advocates, and advocates for the disabled: that when doctors and patients make a medical judgment, patients will get the type of health care they have actually paid for and not be prevented from getting the best health care. 
   I am absolutely convinced that is a concept that will be accepted. It was not accepted during this debate. Others will have a different judgment on it. I believe that is inevitable. We have seen other battles where we have seen the inevitability come to pass. I am convinced of it. 
   I, for one, think this has been an enormously constructive and productive debate these last 4 days. Quite frankly, as one who has been fortunate enough to be involved in this debate, rarely have I seen--at least on our side--so much involvement by the Members, and their participation, their knowledge, their awareness and the wealth of experience that was brought to illuminate so many of these issues. I think that has to be to the benefit of the American people. 
   I am not discouraged. I regret that we were not successful, but we will continue this battle and we will be successful. 
   In conclusion, I do thank the majority leader and thank the Senator from Oklahoma, for they have responsibilities as leaders of this institution. I thank them for the way in which this debate has been developed and the structures for the discussion that have been afforded to us over the past days. 
   I thank in particular our leader, the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE. I thank Senator DASCHLE on behalf of those of us who feel strongly about this issue--it is not just, I know, those of us on this side. I am sure those on the other side also feel strongly but have come to different conclusions than those we came to about this issue. We would not have had the debate this week if it had not been for Tom DASCHLE of South Dakota. There are no ifs, ands or buts. This has been, I think, an extraordinary service to this institution, and I think it has been an extraordinary service to the patients and the medical professionals in this country. 
   I thank my colleague and friend, Senator REID, who was so much a part of the leadership, and of such help and assistance during this time. 
   I thank the members of our committee. I serve on a number of committees and have been proud to serve on all of them. But my heart is with the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee. All of our members were extremely active. Senator DODD; Senator HARKIN; Senator MIKULSKI, who has been so involved in health care issues; Senator BINGAMAN; Senator WELLSTONE; Senator MURRAY; Senator REED--every one of these Senators has been so engaged and involved in this issue. 
   I pay tribute to our chairman, Senator JEFFORDS, for his courtesies, and Dr. FRIST, for his strong dedication to trying to find ways--which we were unable to on this measure. But I have respect and affection for the members. 
   I also thank so many others who were not on the committee who were so involved and engaged, particularly those on our side, although there were others on the other side. 
   I also wish to thank the many staff people who have worked on this issue this week and for the past two years. From my staff, David Nexon, my long time chief health advisor, Cybele Bjorklund, my deputy health advisor, who worked so ably on this legislation, Michael Myers, my staff director, for his leadership on this legislation, Will Keyser, Jim Manley, Connie Garner, Melody Barnes, Carrie Coberly, Matt Ferraguto, Jacqueline Gran, Jon Press, Ellen Gadbois, Stacey Sachs, Theresa Wizemann, Webster Crowley, Andrew Ellner, Paul Frey, Arlan Fuller, Sharon Merkin, Dan Munoz, Malini Patel, and Kate Rooney. 
   From Senator DASCHLE's staff, Bill Corr, Laura Petrou, Ranit Schmelzer, Mark Patterson, Jane Loewenson, and Elizabeth Hargraves; the staff of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Labor; the staff of the Democratic Policy Committee; and the staffs of so many other Senators that have played a critical role during this debate. 
   I think, as always, their involvement and their support has been invaluable, permitting us to have a level of discussion which I think was worthy of this institution. 
   Finally, I want to say on this issue, as all of us would understand in our responsibilities, that we will be back. We may have a setback tonight, but I, for one, do not believe this is a setback in this issue. We will be back to fight, and fight, and fight again, and I believe ultimately to prevail. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, of all the votes we will have and have had in the Senate yesterday, today and tomorrow, this ought to be the easiest. This ought to be the easiest if you are interested in research, if you are interested in the protection of patients. 
   If we look at what has happened historically, insurance companies have paid for routine care associated with clinical trials. The reason they have paid for it because they knew it was right. Secondly, as the Senator from Iowa has pointed out, covering routine costs associated with clinical trials actually provided savings to the insurance companies. But we now see a dramatic decline in clinical trial enrollment. 
   What are clinical trials? What do they represent? This is what they represent: A woman has cancer--it can be ovarian cancer, breast cancer, cervical cancer--and is told the ordinary treatments for cancer will not cure her disease. Her prospects are extremely grim. Her doctor advises that her only chance of survival is a treatment under study in a clinical trial. We should not permit the insurance companies or their bureaucrats to deny her access to that clinical trial. That is what this amendment is all about--access to the only treatment that may give her a chance of survival. 
   The greatest progress in cancer treatment has been made in childhood cancer, and it is no coincidence that the greatest number of clinical trials performed in this country have been in children's cancer. The reason, as most researchers and most cancer centers recognize, is the types of clinical trials that are taking place. 
   Congress is doubling the NIH budget to take advantage of what I like to think will be the life science century. Progress in making breakthroughs in so many different areas of disease--whether it be Alzheimer's or cancer or Parkinson's disease--potentially emptying nursing homes around this country and improving the health of Americans demonstrate the importance of clinical trials. Clinical trials are the critical aspect in finding effective treatment and cures for diseases. That is why this amendment is so important. All HMOs have to do is continue what insurance companies have historically done and that is cover the routine costs associated with clinical trials. The clinical trial sponsors pay the remaining costs. 
   The Republican proposal to study the importance of clinical trials is poppycock. The choice is: Will we maintain what every researcher, every patient organization, every doctor who works in the areas of these critical diseases recognizes as absolutely vital for medical progress, or will we study this issue some more? 
   The Republican proposal says let's do another study and let's get a report to the committee. We are saying that if the doctor says there are sound medical reasons for this type of treatment, 
   access should not be denied by a bureaucrat or an insurance company. That is the issue this amendment addresses. 
   This amendment should receive overwhelming support. It is ridiculous that we are spending so much time debating the issue of whether clinical trials are important. Every single country in the world envies the progress the United States has made in the area of pharmaceuticals--every single country. Why? Because we have breakthrough drugs. Why? Because we move these breakthrough drugs from the laboratory to the bedside. How is that done? It is through clinical trials. We cannot move breakthrough drugs from the laboratory to the bedside without clinical trials. 
   That is what this issue is about. That is why we have such strong support from the cancer societies and organizations concerned about diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. That is why we have the support of the disability community. That is why we have support from so many children's disease organizations. 
   That is why I hope the Dodd amendment will be accepted.

   I would be interested, as would the American people--we have one of the great children's research center--recognized recently as the No. 1 children's center doing great research--what does that center do for the citizens of Washington and the citizens of this country in terms of research programs, clinical trials?

Doctors were referring women to the Lombardi Center for lifesaving cancer treatment--for clinical trials--and the HMOs were denying coverage? These eight individuals were trying to deal with the HMOs so that these patients could receive potentially lifesaving treatments.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to yield myself 3 minutes. 
   Could I have the attention of the Senator from Michigan just for a moment? 
   I notice on page 3 of the amendment, talking about ``Inpatient Care,'' under the title ``In General'' it states:  
   ......the treatment of breast cancer is provided for a period of time as is determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically necessary and appropriate.......  
   This is going to be universal. Why does the Senator from Michigan think we should protect a woman who has breast cancer and needs a mastectomy but not provide the same protection for a woman who has ovarian cancer and needs a hysterectomy. Why shouldn't we provide the same protection for someone who has brain cancer? Why do you believe this should be applicable to all HMO members--that a decision should be made by the doctor and the patient, using the best health guidelines--but not provide the same protections for these other diseases? What is the justification for this different treatment? Our bill does provide those protections. 
   These are in the findings, on page 3, under the ``Inpatient Care,'' ``In General.'' You provide:  
   ......is determined by the attending physician, in consultation with the patient, to be medically necessary and appropriate.......  
   You do it for a mastectomy, a lumpectomy, and for a lymph node. Why do it universally for all HMOs for these three procedures yet not provide the same protection for women with ovarian cancer, brain cancer, or other illnesses? That is what we would like to know. Because our bill would provide protection for all of these illnesses; yours for just one. What is possibly the rationale and justification for that?

   basically forced into this time element, voting Thursday evening. But we are getting very close to the point where we will not have the opportunity for having a full airing of these issues. We are getting very close to where some of us will believe that there has not been the full, complete fulfillment of the agreement. These issues may very well be left outstanding for future considerations. 
   We are getting very close to the point, Mr. President, where you have such a basic corruption of the rules. By denying what has historically been the rule--that would have permitted a Senator to modify an amendment prior to the time they get the yeas and nays--we are close to having a basic corruption of the rules.

Mr. President, earlier I said that I would enter into the RECORD the fact that last Congress, the majority's version of the Patient's Bill of Rights included a mastectomy provision that was quite similar to the provision offered by Senator ROBB yesterday and by Senator SNOWE today. Yet, this mastectomy provision was conspicuously absent from the majority's bill this year. Drive-through mastectomies were discussed during committee markup but were not added back. In fact, the majority rejected an amendment by Senator MURPHY to end drive-through mastectomies. Now, in response to popular pressure, the majority is offering the Snowe amendment on mastectomies as a way of undermining our attempt to provide coverage for patients in clinical trials. I ask unanimous consent that the table of contents and relevant pages of the Republican bills from the last Congress and from this Congress be printed in the RECORD.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
   All patients, regardless of where they live or how they purchase their insurance, deserve to know that their health plan will cover the benefits they need when they are ill or injured. 
   When we say ``all,'' we mean all. 
   That is a fundamental principle of HMO reform. But it is a fundamental principle that is ignored in the Republican minimal alternative. 
   The amendment that Senator DASCHLE, I, and others are offering makes clear that every provision of the Patients' Bill of Rights should apply to all 161 million Americans with private insurance coverage. 
   No patient should be turned away at the emergency room door, denied access to the specialist they need to save their life, or be told that they will not get the prescription drug they need to treat their illness because they live in Mississippi instead of Massachusetts or in Oklahoma instead of Ohio. 
   No child or parent or grandparent should be denied the medical care they need because they happen to work for a small business instead of a large corporation or because they are a teacher in a public school instead of an executive on Wall Street. 
   Of the 161 million Americans with private insurance, only 48 million are covered under the Republican plan; 113 million Americans are left out or are left behind. The Republican plan limits protections to those who receive their coverage from an employer who self-insures their health plan rather than purchasing an insurance policy. 
   Only the largest corporations self-fund their insurance plan. However, many employees of even the largest employers get their coverage through an fully-funded health plan. These employees would not be protected by the Republican bill. 
   What an incredible irony. Much of the public desire for patient protection legislation comes from the concern about the abusive practices of HMOs. But virtually no one enrolled in an HMO is covered by the Republican bill because HMOs are rarely part of self-funded arrangements. 
   These reforms are supposed to protect patients against HMO and insurance company abuses. But people with coverage from insurance companies and HMOs are not protected by the Republican bill. 
   Nothing more clearly demonstrates that the Republican bill is an industry protection act, not a patient protection act. 
   It is no wonder insurance companies support the Republican bill. It is no wonder that over 200 groups of doctors, nurses, patients, and advocates for women, children, and families oppose the Republican bill. 
   The ``dishonor role'' of those left out under the Republican plan is long. 
   We are talking about 75 million Americans who work for businesses that purchase insurance. We are talking about 15 million Americans who are small business men and women, self-employed salesmen, home day-care workers, early retirees, farmers, or others who purchase their own insurance instead of receiving it through their employer. 
   We are talking about 23 million schoolteachers, police officers, librarians, nurses, and other employees of State and local government. 
   Why are these people excluded? 
   This chart indicates exactly the point that we are making. 
   The Republican bill covers 48 million people. These are the people who receive health insurance through self-insured employer plans. These are the plans in which the company self-insures and, therefore, pays for the various medical treatments. 
   It doesn't cover the 75 million persons whose employers provide coverage through an insurance policy or HMO even though approximately 85 percent of the 75 million are enrolled in HMOs. It doesn't cover the 23 million State and local government workers. It doesn't include the people buying individual health insurance policies. Those are the very small businessmen, the farmers, and others. 
   Why are these people excluded, even though the Republican plan in the House of Representatives includes most of these individuals?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I believe it is. 
   This chart clearly reflects the point the Senator has made. The 48 million who are covered are covered through self-funded plans. The largest group of persons receiving health care through HMOs are the 75 million where the employer purchases coverage through an insurance policy or an HMO; about 85 percent of the 75 million are enrolled in HMOs. This bill does not cover them. 
   This bill doesn't cover State and local workers, and it does not cover people buying individual policies. 
   The bill supported by the Republicans, which is a bill allegedly dealing with the problems occurring in HMOs, covers few if any of the members of Health Maintenance Organizations. 
   Is it any wonder the insurance industry is supporting their particular proposal and is opposed to the proposals we have supported? Isn't it understandable that the major medical groups and professions, the doctors and nurses who are concerned about managed care abuses--who understand the abuses happen to those with employer-provided plans, State and local government plans, and individual plans--uniformly support our legislation?

We heard much stated by the principal supporters of the other side's bill about all the benefits of the Republican bill.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Not knowing whether those particular programs are self-funded offhand, it would be difficult to respond concerning particular companies. 
   However, only the larger companies self-fund. They are the 
   only companies that have the resources to self-fund. It is generally the major companies and  corporations that have the adequate resources to self-fund health coverage. 
   The people buying individual policies are the farmer, and the small shopkeeper. It is the men, women and children on Main Street who are not protected under the Republican plan. 
   When we talk about State and local government employees, we are talking about policemen and firefighters putting their lives on the line every day, their spouses, their children, their parents. They are the State and local government employees. About 75 percent are covered by an HMO--they are getting no protections under the Republican plan. 
   I am reminded by my staff that 89 percent of the people in Delaware who have privately purchased health insurance will not be covered under the Republican plan.

By failing to provide universal protection, if the Republican proposal comes before the Senate and Members support it, we are failing 70 percent of the American people. 
   It is a fraud to represent that we are providing them with protections when we are not. This is why I think we are putting the Senate to the test this afternoon. We are testing the seriousness Members have for ensuring that whatever is passed will apply to everyone in this country who has insurance.

   Do you know the answer to that? There is no State in this 
   country that provides all the protections provided in the Democratic proposal--not one State. There is no State in the country that guarantees pediatric specialty care for children who may have cancer or other kinds of serious illness--not one. 
   You can pick and choose and find out that there are 18 States that have require some type of external appeal; almost all reject the kinds of appeal the Republicans have, the self-serving appeals where the HMO appoints the reviewer. They can fly-speck all afternoon and say we have this here and  this here, but there is not a State that provides all the protections we provide. 
   I ask any of my colleagues who are on their feet if they differ with the concept that we ought to provide a basic floor of protections for all Americans. Then, if the States of New York, California, Massachusetts, or Maryland want to build on those protections, we may do so. This is the model used in the bipartisan legislation Senator Kassebaum and I sponsored which passed the Senate that allows employees to move from job to job while retaining health care coverage. We follow that pattern very closely with this legislation. We follow the same type of model--a federal floor--in COBRA legislation. We follow the same model for mental health programs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have put into the RECORD the letter from the General Accounting Office that said it is 4.8 percent over 5 years. That figure was used by the majority leader, Senator TRENT LOTT, on ``Meet The Press.'' He basically subscribed to that cost over a period of 5 years. 
   If you take the average program, it averages about $2,000 for an individual; $1,000 for a child; about $5,000 for a reasonably good family plan. Maybe it is somewhat more costly in the Northeast than it is in the South. If you look at a 5 percent cost, it would be $250 over 5 years; that is $50 a year. If you look at the percentage paid for by the worker, it is typically about 20%. If you do that for 12 months, do that over 1 year, it is less than $2 a month, it is a Big Mac. 
   I see a number of my colleagues. I think all of them would agree, every time we talk about family and medical leave we get a study done by the Chamber of Commerce. When we talk about minimum wage, we get those studies that are done by the restaurant association on the increase in the minimum wage. They talk about the escalation of costs and how it is going to put everybody out of business. The studies about cost used in this debate are studies that are bought and paid for by the insurance companies--bought and paid for by the insurance companies. 
   We have heard from our Republican friends for months and years, as the President of the United States said yesterday: We always rely on the CBO figures. Now we have a CBO figure, and they do not like it. 
   Their second point is that all those people are going to lose their health insurance. The fact is that the individuals and groups which have fought for expansion of health insurance coverage for years support our bill. Now we have the insurance industry saying pass this bill because it is going to mean the loss of health insurance coverage. That is poppycock. That is wrong. 
   The facts, again, is that the General Accounting Office--and I have put in the RECORD the particular provision--has said there may very well be an expansion in total coverage because there will be good benefits and good protections. 
   The line I like is the one that was stated so well by our good friend from Maryland earlier today at a press conference: Around here it used to be when you bought insurance, it was what you were buying, what you could expect; what you paid for is what you were going to get. Now when you give your money and buy insurance, it is what the insurance company is prepared to give you. 
   That is what has happened in the United States of America. It is what the insurance company is going to give you. As a result, it fails to give adequate coverage to those children and women, the disabled and people who have bought the insurance and deserve appropriate coverage. That is what is happening. 
   When they talk about costs, I wish they at least had the decency to address who picks up the cost when people fall through the cracks? It is charity care in the States. It is taxpayers who pick up the costs. 
   What about the cost of all that advertising we see every day? Mr. President, the profits of the top 10 HMOs total $1.5 billion. There are tens of millions of dollars spent for CEO salaries. Who is paying for all that? That is going to result in higher premiums for American workers, and that is what they should be outraged about. 
   I will take a couple more questions, and then I will be glad to yield the floor. Can I finish with my colleague?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I find that has been the question for a long time. We had hoped to work in a bipartisan way as we did to get coverage for 5 to 10 million children with the Republicans on our committee. We had hoped to work in a bipartisan way as we did with Senator Kassebaum to allow health insurance to become more portable. We are hopeful of working some of the privacy issues out in a bipartisan way. Yet when it comes to the Patients' Bill of Rights, the wall came down. The insurance companies said absolutely not, not an inch. 
   I was listening to my colleagues say this is a regrettable situation; I wish we could get together. The insurance companies will not let them get together with us. They will not let them. This bill has been bought and paid for by the insurance industry; no question about it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. Generally around here it is a pretty good test to take a piece of legislation and ask who is supporting it and who is going to benefit. That is not a bad test for the American public: Who is supporting the legislation--which groups, which people--and who is going to benefit. 
   What you find out is that our plan has the support of every health professional and every patient group. They are the ones supporting our bill. 
   Who is opposing it? The insurance industry. Who is supporting the opposition program? The insurance industry. 
   As this debate goes on and we get involved in technicalities, people ought to know at the bottom line of each and every one of these issues who supports our plan. On the OB/GYN issues, the medical professionals support our proposal in spite of the misrepresentations put forth in this Chamber. 
   That is what is happening. The reason for that, as the Senator understands, is we have worked this out with consumers and health professionals. We tried to find out what is needed from the consumers--the people who have suffered--and also the health professionals who have tried to protect the consumers. We were out there listening. 
   I will take these last two and yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, the kinds of protections for children are included, including the preventive programs, specialty programs, the clinical trial programs, and the specialty care programs. Our good friend, Senator REED, is one of our real experts on these issues. The range of different protections and guarantees is out there for children. That is why every child's health group supports our program. 
   But let me mention something of interest that is on point. The Senate has just accepted the amendment of the Senator from Maine on the issue of mastectomies. In her amendment it says:  
   [I]n order to provide for uniform treatment of health care providers and patients among the States, it is necessary to cover health plans operating in 1 State as well as health plans operating among [all] States.  
   So perhaps we could find a distinction. I know the Senator believes strongly that is the kind of coverage we should have for women. But could the Senator possibly explain to me how we could justify supporting that particular provision and not say we need similar protection for children? Are we missing something on this? They will say: We will do it for this. 
   Right above that it says:  
   [H]ealth care providers located in a State serve patients who reside in the State and [also] patients who reside in other States.......  
   What they are acknowledging is, people move from State to State, so they are going to provide for them. 
   It talks about the amendment covering all health plans. What is the rationale? Can the Senator tell me?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I think the Senator is correct in his statement. It is basically because the industry is putting its profits ahead of the protection of the patients. 
   We had reaffirmation yesterday, in an indirect way, with the publication of an article in the medical journal JAMA, that says the for-profit HMOs provide a good deal less service for the coverage of individuals than those which are not-for-profit. It is, I think, a kind of intuitive, self-evident factor that this is taking place.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened with a good deal of interest to our colleagues on the other side complaining. They want it both ways. On the one hand, they are supporting covering 48 million Americans and leaving out 113 million Americans--so they are covering some Americans--but they are not covering all Americans. Then they are troubled, evidently, because they are covering some Americans. Many of our colleagues on the other side, as we have just heard, do not think there ought to be any kind of protection for the American citizens, that we ought to just leave this up to the States. 
   My response is, the law of the jungle may be good in the jungle, but we do not accept that in the United States, when people are being exploited by the private sector. In this case, the insurance industry refuses to provide the protections for women and children in our country. The insurance industry refused to provide protections for workers in our country. 
   That is basically the fact of it. We hear repeatedly, mistakenly, that the States have provided protections. I will include in the RECORD the Families USA analysis of the various States.  
   An examination of state legislation in 13 areas of basic managed care consumer protections finds that no state has all 13 on the books.......

   Mr. KENNEDY. Vermont has 10 out of the 13, but no State has all 13. These are basic and fundamental standards that can be built upon. If Texas wants to do more, so be it. If Pennsylvania wants to do more, so be it. But these are the most basic and fundamental protections. That is what this legislation is all about. These are basic kinds of protections which, in most instances, have been included in the protections of the Federal employees, who include every Member of this body. 
   I have been so interested in listening to this debate about how we do not want the Federal Government having anything to do with health care. The Federal employment insurance has 11 million members. Every Member of this body has an opportunity to go in there and check a little box and say: We don't want the Federal employment protections. We don't want that. We want the private sector. Yet very few Members of this body have done that. 
   Eleven million Federal employees have these protections. It is so nice to hear: Well, we're glad to have protections for our children. We refuse to provide them for other people's children. 
   You don't hear anyone suggesting we are going to give up our Federal employees' health care. We should not say, when we provide this kind of protection for our children that we are going to provide the protection for other people's children. That is the heart of this issue. 
   I yield myself another minute off the bill.

   Mr. President, what about the bureaucrats in the insurance industry who are denying coverage for children in these emergency rooms? What about the bureaucrats who are denying women the right to be able to be in the clinical trials? What about those? This isn't HCFA. The Senator from Oklahoma knows this. 
   When the General Accounting Office recommended they get additional resources for HCFA, they led the fight against giving them resources to enforce the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation. Go back and look at the RECORD, I say to the Senator. You know that. 
   I am not interested in going back and forth on this issue. But I daresay the  bureaucrats in the insurance industry are the ones about whom people are most concerned. Americans know what the insurance industry is doing. They are looking at the bottom line. I think maybe HCFA has its problems--maybe they made some mistakes--but, by and large, they are dedicated men and women who are committed to public service who are trying to do a decent job. It is easy to beat up on employees, Government employees, but for my money, they do a great job.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to go over where we are in the debate. The amendment that has been proposed by our Republican colleagues covers, as close as I can figure, four different areas: One is the tax credit of long-term care. It is being defined. We have asked the Treasury Department to look at that because many of us are interested in the long-term care issue. We have not heard back from the Treasury Department. Time has expired on this particular amendment. 
   There is also the issue of changes to the OB/GYN provision and whether this is a change which gives the protections to women which we have included in our legislation. The provisions have  been examined by various OB/GYN specialists. We will include in the RECORD the inadequacies of those particular provisions in achieving the objectives described on the floor. The OB/GYN specialists find the language included in that amendment fails. That will be available to the Members. 
   Third is the speciality issue. Our good friends, the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Iowa, as well as the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from North Carolina, and others will address in greater detail the issue of specialists. 
   I want to make a brief comment in response to the particular proposal of the Senator from Tennessee. In reading through the language--and it is important to read the language, as the Senator has said--it says:  
   Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit a group plan from requiring that speciality care be provided pursuant to a treatment plan so long as the treatment plan----  
   Is developed by the specialist. On page 12, it says:  
   ......appropriate to the conditions of the participant or beneficiary, when such care is covered under the plan, such access may be provided.  
   ``When such care is covered under the plan'' makes the provision meaningless because the care is covered only if authorized by the gatekeeper. It says when the care is covered, but it does not say it has to be covered. 
   Then it says:  
   Such access may be provided through contractual agreements with specialized providers outside the network.  
   That is optional. You can read all the lines you want about age-appropriate speciality if they include it in the plan, but if you start right out and say it is not included and is optional, it is meaningless. That is not only my opinion, but it will be gone into to some degree by others. 
   I listened to my friend and colleague from Tennessee say the issue is appealable. Why not write that in the bill? We wrote it in. Why leave any question? Why does he have to quote a letter from some law professor? I have a letter from a law professor that says it does not. Why not just write it in the bill? 
   I hope there will be some kind of response. I will be glad to yield for a minute. We wrote in our bill that it is appealable if a specialist such as a pediatric oncologist or necessary specialist is denied. Why isn't it included in the Republican plan? It is not. 
   We will have an opportunity to debate that issue. 
   I do not want to get off message, but I hope our good friend from Oklahoma, as well as our good friend from Texas, will now look at what the Republican bill is costing. 
   This is what the Republican bill is costing. According to joint tax, it is $1 billion for patient protections; 100 percent deductibility for small business is $2.9 billion; liberalized MSA, $1.5 billion; flexible spending account is $2.3 billion. That adds up to $7.7 billion. Long-term care is $5.4 billion. That is $13 billion--$13 billion for the Republican plan. 
   I hope we do not hear any more about the cost of the plan with no offsets. I hope we can get rid of that argument. It has taken us 2 1/2 days. Under CBO, ours is $7 billion. The Republican plan 
   with this will virtually be doubled. I hope we are going to be free of that argument. We want to focus on what we are interested in, and that is the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We are going to have an amendment when I yield back the time in just a moment. I want the membership to understand, this amendment will not be targeted to OB/GYN. It will not be targeted to long-term care. It will not be targeted to emergency room care, though there are many different provisions in that with which we take issue, which our friend from Florida has pointed out. This will only be targeted to the provisions of the Republican amendment on speciality care. 
   Our amendment is accepted and those who will put forward and present it are Senator BINGAMAN, Senator HARKIN, Senator EDWARDS, and others will debate that for the next 50 minutes. It will only be amending that particular provision. We will have an opportunity to make a judgment on the rest of the provisions later, depending upon what happens on this. 
   We are limiting this debate to what we have always wanted: a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, and that is, protecting people from the abuses of HMOs. Long-term care is not a part of that provision, although it was brought in and that is important. We do not believe it belongs on this, but it is here. 
   Many of us are unprepared to make a judgment on that since we just found out about that particular provision. We will be interested in what the offsets are going to be. 
   The next proposal will be the amendment that will be offered by the Senator from New Mexico which will be targeted to speciality care. We are protecting patients, and we insist they get the specialty care we believe is so essential. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I might use. 
   We are coming into the final moments before we will vote on this amendment. I will take at least these final moments to point out where we are. 
   Primarily, what we are talking about are the protections that have been included in our Patients' Bill of Rights. No matter how many times our Republican friends say they are shocked, shocked to discover the deficiencies in their amendments and promise to do better, their new product is just the same old, tired, flawed proposal in fancy dress. The problem is a simple one: Insurance companies don't want real protections, so Republicans won't produce them. 
   We have two different proposals on emergency care, two different proposals on OB/GYN care, and another proposal in terms of specialty care this evening--all changes, alterations, in terms of their original proposal. No matter how many times they alter or change, they still do not meet the basic standard and test of providing that the medical professions make the judgment of what is in the interest of that patient, not the insurance company. 
   Access to the needed specialty care is one of the most critical ingredients in quality health care. Timely access to a qualified specialist can often determine whether a patient lives or dies. For those living with chronic illnesses or with a physical or mental disability, access to specialty care can improve the quality of life, prevent deterioration, or cure or ameliorate the disease. 
   Nowhere is the contrast between the Republican plan and our proposal clearer than on the issue of access to needed specialty care. Our amendment, offered by Senators BINGAMAN, HARKIN, REED, and others, guarantees it. The Republican plan is a sham proposal that carries the label of access to specialty care but does nothing meaningful to help patients. 
   Our amendment has key protections that guarantee appropriate specialty care. Health plans are required to provide care by a qualified specialist or center of excellence when needed. If sufficient expertise does not exist inside the HMO network, it must allow patients to go to a specialist or a center of excellence outside the network, without any additional financial burden beyond what would be involved in seeing a network specialist. 
   For chronic or ongoing conditions, HMOs must allow standing referrals to a specialist or, where appropriate, allow the specialist to be a care coordinator--in effect, the primary care gatekeeper for treatment related to the condition. 
   These provisions are especially critical for anyone suffering from a chronic disease or disability and for disabled children with their complex needs. If there is a disagreement between a plan and a physician or patient about the need for specialty care or out-of-network care, the dispute will be resolved by a speedy independent review. It is guaranteed. It is written into the law. 
   The Republican plan includes none of these critical guarantees, not a single one. More than two-thirds of all patients are excluded even from the minimal protections it does provide. Access to qualified specialists is essential to quality care, particularly for those who need care the most: those with a disabling or life-threatening illness. If our proposal is adopted, every family can be confident that if serious illness strikes, their health plan will not deny them the care that is essential for recovery--no ifs, ands, or buts; the guarantee is there. 
   Once again, the issue is clear: Will the Senate protect the patients or will it protect the insurance industry profits? That is what is before the Senate in this amendment. That was basically the protections that were included in our legislation. This amendment will guarantee that any measure that comes out of this body will have those protections, and that is why this amendment is so important to be accepted. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I am a good friend of the Senator from Texas. I will tell you, Mr. President, the Senator is as wrong in his explanation about the debate here on the floor of the Senate and as wrong about President Clinton's bill on health care as he was about President Clinton's proposal about economic recovery in 1993 when he predicted the end of the free market system, that inflation was going up through the roof, with unemployment lines around the Capitol of the United States. He predicted that deficits were going to grow and it was going to be the end of the American free enterprise system. He was wrong then, and he is wrong tonight. 
   Mr. President, I yield the last minute to the Senator from South Dakota,

   Mr. KENNEDY. It is our intention to respond to these arguments briefly and then offer an amendment. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, as we see in this institution, there are amendments which are offered that are poison pill amendments. They are amendments that effectively kill legislation. That is really the purpose of this; we ought to be very clear about it. Senator GRAMM of Texas has indicated if that amendment is accepted, this whole debate comes to a halt and it ends any possibility of a Patients' Bill of Rights. That is what we are faced with at this time. 
   We will have an opportunity to judge whether the Senate wants to end any consideration of a Patients' Bill of Rights--or whether this is an issue that ought to be considered--when we vote on that particular amendment. We will have a chance to vote on the various amendments we have outlined and presented in different forms. We will continue to discuss these amendments over the course of this debate. 
   One of the techniques used in this institution--perhaps less so now than in the past--is to present the opposition's arguments with distortion and misrepresentation, and then differ with the distortions and misrepresentations. We saw a classic example of that with my good friend, the Senator from Texas, Mr. GRAMM. He went through this whole routine about what was in this bill and then he, in his wonderful way, differed with it, like only he had common sense and understanding of what is in that legislation. 
   Before responding to that, I start out with the basic core issues, which have been raised again and again by those who are opposed to our bill: One, costs; and, two, coverage. 
   When all is said and done and after we have listened to the distortions and misrepresentations of our good Republican friends, here is, majority leader TRENT LOTT on NBC ``Meet the Press'' saying: By the way, the Democrat's bill would add a 4.8 percent cost. 
   This is the Republican majority leader agreeing with the Congressional Budget Office figures. Maybe the other side gets a great deal of satisfaction--they certainly take a lot of time to distort and misrepresent the facts. But let's look at 4.8 percent--or even 5 percent--impact on a family's premium over 5 years. The family's premium might be $5,000 a year. Looking cumulatively at 5 percent--1 percent a year--that would be $250 for the total of 5 years, $50 a year. 
   You can misrepresent the figures, you can distort the figures, you can frighten the American people, which is a common technique; it was done on family and medical leave. Do you remember that argument put out by the Chamber of Commerce about the cost of family and medical leave to American business? They still cannot document it. Do you remember, when we had the minimum wage debate, claims about the cost to American business? They still cannot document it. As a matter of fact, Business Week even supports an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Now on the third issue, here it comes again, the bought-and-paid-for studies by the insurance industry. That is what these studies are all about. They are bought and paid for by the insurance companies, and they distort and misrepresent.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I will not yield at this time. You would not yield last evening when I was trying to ask Republicans about 
   particular provisions. 
   How many times did we hear from the other side: Let's rely on the Congressional Budget Office, they know what is best. We were just with the President of the United States. He said every time he sat down with the Republican leadership, they said: We will not do anything unless we get the CBO figures. 
   We have given you the CBO figure. The majority leader agrees with the CBO figure. Let's put that aside. 
   The second issue is coverage. The issue is whether more people will lose their health insurance coverage because we are going to do all of the things that Senator GRAMM talked about. I yield to no one on the passage of health care in order to expand coverage. The idea that the groups in support of this particular proposal would support a proposal which means that 2  million Americans would lose coverage is preposterous on its face. On the one hand, they are so busy over here saying: Look who is supporting your program, the AFL-CIO. Do you think they are going to support legislation--I yield myself 2 more minutes--that will cause 2 million Americans to lose coverage? Are we supposed to actually believe that? Or all the many groups--I will not take the time to enumerate them--that support a comprehensive program to expand coverage? That is poppycock. That is baloney. They even understand that in Texas. It is baloney. 
   The idea that 180,000 women are going to lose breast cancer screening, 52,000 a year are going to lose mammograms, 135,000 women in this country are going to lose Pap tests when the American Cancer Society supports us lock, stock, and barrel--come on, let's get real. Whom do you think you are talking to, the insurance companies again? Can you imagine a preposterous statement and comment like that coming from the Senator from Texas? That just goes beyond belief. 
   I will make a final comment or two about freedom. We heard a lot about freedom. Remember that, we heard all yesterday afternoon about freedom? We heard about freedom this morning. We heard about freedom: We are for freedom. The other side is not for freedom, but we are for freedom. Support our position, you will be for freedom. 
   The insurance companies want freedom from accountability. That is what they want, freedom to undermine good quality health care for children, for women who have cancer, for the disabled. That is what they want--freedom from accountability and responsibility. 
   That is baloney, too. We want accountability. I am surprised to hear from the other side all the time about how they want personal responsibility and accountability. 
   I ask for another 2 minutes. 
   They always want personal responsibility and accountability 
   with the exception of HMOs. Sue your doctors, fine, but not your HMOs, not your insurance companies, not those that have paid $100 million and effectively bought this Republican bill--yes; that is right--those provisions are dictated by the insurance companies. 
   That is what we have. The American people are too smart to buy that. 
   I know there are others who want to speak. I yield back my time.

We  cannot even get an engagement of debate on this. 
   I do not know if that means they are willing to accept it. I would have thought they would have the respect at least for the position of several Members, led by our friend and colleague from Virginia, to speak to this issue.

I can understand why they do not want to engage in this debate. We have a limited period of time. We are ready to debate. Our cosponsors are here and ready to debate this basic, very important issue. I believe they have made a very strong case. 
   I guess what they are waiting for is for us to run through the time and perhaps they will come out. Wherever they are, they will come out perhaps at least to try to defend their indefensible position on their legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are reaching the final moments for considering this amendment. We, on this side, who have been strong supporters of the Patients' Bill of Rights, think this is one of the most important issues to be raised in the course of this debate. It is an extremely basic, fundamental, and important issue for women in this country. 
   Our outstanding colleagues have presented an absolutely powerful and indisputable case for our positions. We are troubled that we have had silence from the other side. 
   We listened yesterday about how beneficial the Republican bill was--when it refuses to provide protections to the millions of Americans our colleagues have talked about. 
   We are down to the most basic and fundamental purpose of our bill; that doctors and, in this case, women are going to make the decision on their health care needs, not the bureaucrats in the insurance industry. 
   This is one more example of the need for protections. Our colleagues have demonstrated what this issue is really all about. That is why I hope those Members on the other side that really care about women's health will support this amendment. 
   Mr. President, we are prepared to move ahead and vote on this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the more we debate, the more confused our good colleagues on the other side, quite frankly, become. The underlying amendment dealing with the OB/GYN is the amendment that was offered in committee and that is no surprise. 
   The other provision the Senator from Oklahoma talks about is funding the self-insurance tax deduction introduced by the Senator from Oklahoma without paying for it. This would subject the bill to a point of order if it was carried all the way through. He did not pay for it. 
   It is a red herring. Time and time again we have put in the General Accounting Office document which states that the protections in this bill will enhance the number of people insured, not reduce the number. 
   Does the Senator from Pennsylvania actually believe we are endangering breast cancer tests for women, reducing Pap tests, reducing examinations for breast cancer and yet the breast cancer coalition supports our proposal? Is he suggesting any logic to his position? 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of the time and look forward to the vote.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this amendment goes to the heart of the issue. I urge our colleagues to pay attention to the exchange we are going to have on the floor of the Senate. 
   Let us look, first, at what is in the Democratic bill. In the Democratic bill, ``medical necessity,'' as defined on page 86, is ``medically necessary or appropriate.'' That is the standard definition medicine has used for 200 years. It is the standard recommended by none other than the Health Insurance Association of America itself, on page 269:  
   Medical necessity. Term used by insurers to describe medical treatment that is appropriate and rendered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice.  
   Our legislation does what the Health Insurance Association of America recommended. This is the standard that has been used for 200 years. This is the standard that is supported by the medical profession. 
   The Republican plan knocks that standard out. It knocks it out. What do they put in as a substitute? As a substitute, on page 148, they say ``medical necessity'' used in making coverage determinations is determined ``by each plan.'' ``By each plan.'' The plan can define medical necessity any way it wants. 
   In their appeals procedure we find that medical necessity issues can be appealed, but medical necessity is defined by the HMO. 
   That sounds complicated. What does it mean in real terms? Let me read you a few examples of how HMOs have defined medical necessity. Here is a company--I will not give its name--and their definition. The company:  
   ......will have the sole discretion to determine whether care is medically necessary. The fact that care has been recommended, provided, prescribed or approved by a physician or other provider will not establish the care is medically necessary.  
   In other words, medical necessity is whatever the HMO says. Whatever the HMO says. 
   Here is an example of Aetna U.S. Health Care, the provision in their Texas contract:  
   The least costly of alternative supplies.......  
   Here is another HMO:  
   The shortest, least expensive, or least intensive level.......  
   They throw out the medical necessity standard used for 200 years and say, medical necessity will be whatever the HMO wants it to be. That is the heart of this issue. 
   What do we find when the HMO uses their own medical necessity definition? Who makes the judgment? It is an insurance company bureaucrat. That is what this amendment is all about. 
   Finally, when you see the appeals procedures which will be addressed by my other colleagues, all you have to do is look at the Consumers Union and many other consumer groups. The consumer groups believe their appeals procedure does not provide adequate protections. 
   The American Bar Association believes basic consumer protections are not met. The American Arbitration Association makes the same judgment. 
   This is a status quo amendment. If you want to do nothing about the pain and injury being experienced by children, women, and family members in our country, go ahead and support this program. It is an industry protection amendment. It will protect the profits of the industry; it puts the profits of the industry ahead of protecting patients.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, much of this debate may seem technical, but the definition of medical necessity and a fair and independent appeals process are at the heart of any serious effort to end insurance company abuse. Our plan has it; their program does not. That is why Consumers Union--the outfit that publishes Consumer Reports--calls the Republican program ``woefully inadequate'' and ``far from independent.'' 
   No one supports their program but the insurance companies and the HMOs, the very organizations that profit from the abuses of the status quo. Their program is opposed by the American Cancer Society, and virtually every cancer organization in the country. It is opposed by the American Heart Association. It is opposed by the disability community. It is opposed by the women's community, and the people who represent children. These are the patient groups that have the most to lose from low quality and the most to gain from high quality. And they lose under the Republican program. 
   This amendment will determine whether Senators stand with the patients or with the HMOs. 
   We yield back the remainder of our time and are prepared to vote.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Just 30 seconds of the time to point out, in response to the comments of the Senator from Oklahoma, the insurance industry has just spent $2 million in opposition to our program, which basically includes the provisions so eloquently commented on by the Senators from California and North Carolina. Zero has been spent by the insurance companies in opposition, to my best understanding, to the Republican proposal. If it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. 
   This is the insurance company's proposal, the HMO proposal. They are the ones that will gain if this amendment of the Republicans is accepted. There is no question about that. It is the disabled, the cancer groups, and the children who will gain if our proposal prevails. 
   I yield back the remainder of the time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this vote is directly related to whether the Senate is really interested in covering all Americans who have insurance or whether whatever passes applies to only the 48 million persons who are included in the Republican bill. 
   In the House of Representatives, all of the leading Republican legislation applies to all patients with insurance through their private employers--the whole 123 million here. The proposals put forward by the House Republicans who happen to be doctors also cover the people in the individual market. But not the Senate Republican bill. 
   It is an extraordinary irony, but HMOs are found in all of these other categories--under the 75 million, the 15 million, the 25 million--not in self-funded employer plans. So the Republican bill does not even cover the individuals who first raised the whole question of whether their current coverage is adequate. Whatever we are going to do, Republican program or Democrat, let's make sure we provide protections to all patients. Every category here on this chart. That is what our amendment does. 
   But their amendment would leave out more than 100 million Americans like Frank Raffa, a fire fighter for the city of Worcester, Massachusetts. He puts his life on the line every day, but he and millions of others are left out and left behind with the Republican program. Let's make sure we are going to cover all of them, all the workers in this country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am honored to join as a cosponsor of Senator DODD's ``Family Income to Respond to Significant Transitions'' (FIRST) Insurance Demonstration Project Act. From his work on the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to his countless efforts to improve the quality and accessibility of child care, Senator DODD has been a tireless advocate for families and children, and I commend his leadership on this important new initiation. 
   Millions of families have benefited from the Family and Medical Leave Act, but we must do more to support working families. Nearly two-thirds of employees cannot afford to take family or medical leave when a new child is born or a family member becomes ill. According to a survey by the National Partnership for Women and Families, 64 percent of Americans believe that the time pressures on working families are getting worse, not better. Two-thirds of women and men under the age of 45 believe that they will need to take a family or medical leave in the next 10 years. But, many of these families won't be able to afford it. 
   We should stop paying lip service to family values and find a way to help families afford family leave when they need it. This bill will provide grants to states and local communities to experiment with methods of wage replacement for workers who take family leave. States will use the grants for demonstration projects implementing wage replacement strategies to allow more employees to spend time with their families when family needs require it. 
   Under the Family and Medical Leave Act, businesses with 50 or more employees must provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave to employees to care for a newborn or newly-adopted child, or to care for a child, a spouse, or a parent who is ill. The Act has helped millions of workers care for their families, but too many obstacles prevent too many  workers from taking leave. Forty-one million people, nearly half the private workforce, are not protected by the law because their company is too small to be covered, or because they haven't worked there long enough to qualify for the leave. 
   Others are covered and entitled to a leave, but cannot benefit from the Act because they cannot afford to take an unpaid leave of absence. Although some workers are fortunate enough to receive wage replacement during periods of family or medical leave, most hard-working low-wage earners do not receive this benefit. Low-income employees are less likely to receive wage replacement than more highly educated, well-paid employees. Women, minorities, and younger employees are less likely than men, white Americans, and older workers to receive wage replacement benefits when taking family leave. 
   As a result, 40 percent employees without full wage replacement cut their leaves short, 39 percent put-off paying bills, 25 percent borrow money, and 9 percent turn to public assistance to cover their loss wages. Taking unpaid leave often drives low-wage earners into poverty. Workers who need to care for an ill family member, an elderly parent, or a new baby should not be plunged into poverty. 
   Our bill will help families take needed leave by allowing states to implement alternative funding programs. For example, states may choose to expand state or private Temporary Disability Insurance plans to provide partial or full replacement of wages for those taking time off form work to care for a new child. States may also expand their Unemployment Insurance Compensation to make leave from work economically feasible. The FIRST Act is an important step in the right direction. This bill will provide states with $400 million for fiscal year 2000 to fund demonstration programs, assisting states which are already working to establish wage replacement leave programs. 
   I am proud that Massachusetts is moving forward to address this problem. A bill to establish a Family and Employment Security Trust Fund has already been introduced, providing family leave replacement through the unemployment insurance system. Thousands of workers in Massachusetts will be able to care for their families without falling into poverty--including low-income employees living from paycheck to paycheck. Groups in Maryland, Vermont, and Washington are taking the lead with similar legislation. 
   We need to put families first and this bill does that. I urge my colleagues to support this needed initiative.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very hopeful we will be able to get into the substance of the differences between the approaches taken in the two bills. We heard a great deal of rhetoric, of course, earlier in the afternoon. We have had a brief presentation by the Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE. 
   At the outset, one point worth highlighting, as we begin this debate, is that there isn't a single health or medical organization in the United States that supports the position being advanced by that side of the aisle--not one. 
   This really isn't or shouldn't be a Democratic or Republican debate. Republicans are members of HMOs as well as Democrats. Children are Republicans as well as Democrats. Women who need 
   clinical trials are Republicans and Democrats. Those who have been in the vanguard of protecting women's health issues have been Republicans as well as Democrats. On children's issues, disabled issues, there have been Republicans as well as Democrats. 
   I cannot remember a single piece of legislation that has been considered on the floor of the Senate in the time that I have been here where you have such overwhelming support for one side and virtually no support for the opposition side--in this case, the Republicans--not a single instance. I made that statement during one of the brief times we had a chance to talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights debate and discussion. It has never been rebutted. 
   We heard earlier, in the course of the afternoon, about how the Republican proposal is really going to provide for necessary specialty care. Why is it then that every specialty organization in the country supports our bill? We heard over on the other side: Look, we are really giving the consumers a great deal of protection in our bill. Why is it that every consumer organization in the country supports our bill and opposes theirs? Every one, make no mistake about it. 
   We are in a situation where, as so many of us have seen, special interest groups can pay for and buy just about any statistic they want to buy, and they have done so. They have put out misrepresentations and distortions about our bill. These misrepresentations and distortions about cost are all over the airwaves. We will have a chance later in the course of this debate to address the issue of costs. We will have a chance to make a presentation about what independent studies have concluded about the cost of our particular proposal. Despite the fact that we will introduce and present  these independent studies, do you think that will than alter and change people's minds? Absolutely not. You are going to hear distortions and misrepresentations. You have already heard them over the course of this afternoon. 
   I was sitting here when our good friend from the State of Maine was speaking about the importance of the types of protections included in their Patients' Bill of Rights. The interesting fact is, their proposal doesn't cover any members of HMOs. Isn't that amazing? Listen to this: It doesn't cover any of the patients of HMOs. That is what brought about all of this concern. We can ask ourselves: Is there a concern today? The answer is yes, and not just because we say so. 
   I heard talk about the importance of the State insurance commissioners. I ask our colleagues on the other side of the aisle to call their State commissioners and hear about the complaints that we are hearing. Call them this afternoon; call them tomorrow. Call them before we finish this debate and find out: There are two and three and four times more complaints today than there were a year ago or 2 years ago. Those are the facts. You would not know these facts from the earlier debate. 
   This is a very interesting chart. We know there are 160 million Americans who are covered by private health insurance. On this particular chart, the ``Republican Plan Excludes More Than 100 Million People,'' there are 48 million people covered through self-funded employer plans. That is the total group that is covered by the Republican plan. 
   There are 75 million people whose employers provide coverage through insurance policies or an HMO--that is what I thought this debate was really all about. They are not protected in the Republican plan. We listened this afternoon to assertions about all the protections included in the Republican plan. But these 75 million people are not protected under the Republican plan. They are not phased in next year or in 2 years. They are out; the Republican bill doesn't apply to them. 
   State and local government workers, they are left out of the Republican bill. People buying individual policies, some 15 million, are left out. Who are they, Mr. President? They are the small shopkeepers. 
   They are the farmers and the mom-and-pop stores that have to go out and buy these health plans. They are the one of the most vulnerable groups in our society. 
   Do you know what was missing in the other side's presentation? The fact that the top 10 HMOs in this country, last year, made $1.5 billion. Isn't that interesting? We see crocodile tears coming from the other side of the aisle about the cost of protecting patients. Then we find out the profits of the major HMOs and the multimillion dollar salaries paid to their CEOs. We hear about the $100 million being spent by the insurance companies to defeat our proposal. 
   How much is that going to add? Why don't you address that, I say to our friends on the other side. Over $100 million. You know, generally around here--and the American people understand it--you can look at who is for a piece of legislation and who is against it in terms of who will benefit and who will lose out. It is not a bad way of looking at it. Sometimes issues are so complex that the balance is not completely clear. But on this issue, all the health care groups that favor adequate protections are in favor of our Patients' Bill of Rights. On the other side is the insurance industry--one industry, the insurance industry. That is it. 
   Can we have some explanation by the other side, as we start this debate, about how they justify that? That is the bottom line. It is one industry. The Republican program is the profit protection program for the insurance industry. It is a bill of goods. It is a bill of wrongs. The Democratic proposal is the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   So as we start off on this issue, it is our hope, as we have mentioned before, to review for this body and the American people exactly what we intend to do. We have commonsense protections which have been developed over the last decade. What we want to ensure is that any bill passed will at least provide these commonsense protections. Perhaps legislation isn't going to be so all-inclusive as to include every commonsense protection. I hope it will. 
   These are commonsense protections. You can ask where they all come from? Where did these patient protections that are included in the DASCHLE proposal come from? That is a fair question. We say they come from at least one of four different evolutions. You have the insurance commissioner's recommendations; Insurance commissioners, representing Republicans and Democrats, making recommendations. The President's bipartisan commission made what they call, not majority recommendations but unanimous recommendations. Do we understand that? Unanimously, Republicans and Democrats have said: Here are five or six protections we recommend, and we have included those recommendations. 
   The only difference is that the bipartisan commission recommended that the protections be voluntary. Well, if every one of the companies complied with that recommendation, we would probably not be here today. They have not complied, and they will not comply. We also include protections included in Medicare and Medicaid, and protections recommendations by the health plans themselves. Those four groups have made the recommendations that are included in our proposal. That is why our bill has the unanimous support of the health professions. 
   I will not take further time this afternoon. But I will point out, as we start this debate, that no health care debate this year is more important to every family. Yes, Medicare is enormously important. Yes, the issue of medical records privacy is important. Yes, home health care for our elderly is enormously important. There are other important issues concerning basic medical research. 
   But the issue of health care quality is most important. The issue of whether your child, your wife, your loved one, your family member, receives the kind of health care that well-trained, committed medical professionals, doctors and nurses, who are trained and dedicated to try to provide the best in health care, want to provide, is most important. 
   This legislation belongs to the nurses of this country, the doctors of this Nation, the cancer researchers, the children's advocates, and to the disabled organizations. Every one of those organizations supports our bill. Over the course of this week we will have an opportunity to address each and every one of these items. Hopefully, the American people will speak through their representatives and the result will be sound patients' protection legislation. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, as we start this debate, there are a series of issues before us. One of the most important and most significant is who is covered under the two different approaches before the Senate. One approach has been advanced by Senator DASCHLE, of which many of us are cosponsors, and the other approach on the other side has been reported out of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. Senator FRIST and the Republican leadership are cosponsors. 
   In our proposal, we provide that virtually every individual who has health insurance will have the protections included in our bill. Under the Republican proposal, we are finding out that the total numbers covered are only those in what they call ERISA plans. There are 163 million total individuals who have health insurance covered under our bill. The other side covers only 48 million, and excludes 113 million. They are only covering a third of all Americans. 
   We can ask ourselves: If their proposal is so solid and makes so much sense, why don't they cover all Americans? We heard the principal advocates for the Republicans go on about what good things their particular proposal is going to do. Then why not cover all the people in the country instead of only a third? 
   They will find out that under their proposed legislation, they do not cover anyone who receives their health care through health maintenance organizations. Isn't it extraordinary that this  whole development, the need for patient protections, is a result of insurance companies making medical decisions in the interest of the company profitability rather than the health interests of the patient? That is the basic reason this whole issue has developed. 
   Their solution is to advance a program that does not even cover all Americans. I am still waiting to hear why. If their program is so wonderful, as has been stated in the Senate, I still wonder why they are not covering everyone. Can they explain how they justify to people, living side by side, that one will be covered and the other one will not be covered under the Republican plan? They certainly are not covering the 15 million people who are buying individual policies. These are generally small business men and women, farmers, and individuals who are buying individual policies. They are excluded under the Republican plan. State and local government workers are excluded, and the 75 million whose employer provides fully funded coverage, the largest category, are all excluded. Only 48 million are covered under the Republican plan. 
   I tried to read through every explanation to understand. Then I started to read the proposals advanced in the House of Representatives. 
   There are five different Republican House proposals. But all the Republican proposals in the House of Representatives cover all Americans. Why is it that the Republican bills in the House of Representatives cover all Americans and over here in the Senate the Republicans only cover a third of Americans? I thought there might be some explanation. 
   The Democrats cover all Americans. When we say ``all,'' we mean all. When we say ``protections,'' we mean protections. That is what this legislation is all about. We want to make sure we will have the opportunity, over the course of this week, when we are talking about protections for the type of specialty care that a child might need--such as a child who has cancer--that they are guaranteed they will be covered by the protections we have included in our bill. 
   We want to ensure that all women are going to be guaranteed the protections we have included. We want to make sure that all of those with some type of physical or mental challenge are going to be guaranteed the protections we have included--not just a quarter, not just a third, not just a half, not just three-quarters but all of them. 
   So I find that on the most basic and fundamental issue, the plans differ greatly. We are all asked: Well, look, Senator, the Republican proposal has emergency protections and you have emergency protections. Can you tell us what the differences are? 
   The fact is that virtually two-thirds are excluded from the Republican proposal, before we even discuss the loopholes they have written so that their legislation does not provide adequate protections that have the support of the emergency room physicians. 
   We heard this afternoon how the Republican bill provides protections for emergency room care and specialty care. The fact is that none of those professional groups that are dealing with children every single day and none of the specialists that are dealing with the most complicated cases are supporting their plan. All are supporting our plan. 
   It is for this reason I would have thought we would be able to bring Republicans and Democrats together. Let's decide whether we really want to deal with the issue. Let's start off this debate on the first day, on Monday, and say: OK, let's go ahead and make sure whatever we are going to do is all inclusive in protecting the children, not only those covered by self-funded employer plans. I do not know how many children in this country know whether they are getting their health care as a result of a self-funded employer plan or whether it is the employer providing the services through insurance programs. 
   I say, let's deal with children. Let's deal with all the children. That is what our bill does. And that, I believe, is fundamental.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am not going to take the time right now. I was waiting for my good friend, Dr. FRIST, to be able to get into the questions of scope. I was waiting for Dr. FRIST to and answer why the protections included in our legislation--for example, the guarantees for emergency room care, the access to specialists who might be necessary to care for a sick child, the formulary protections that were included in our legislation, should not apply to all Americans. I was waiting to ask Dr. FRIST why the Republican House of Representatives bills protect 124 million Americans, while the Senate Republican legislation falls woefully short on those particular protections. 
   I hope in these next few days we come back to what this whole debate is about, the commonsense protections that are included in this bill. That is what is important. Are we really going to have the protections necessary to guarantee the prudent layperson's judgment is used in determining whether emergency room treatment is covered? Are we going to have that? Are there going to be real protections, or are we going to have in the fine print something that effectively creates a loophole? Let's get to addressing that issue. 
   Let's start talking about guaranteeing access to clinical trials, which are so important to women who have cancer. Clinical trials may be the only option for saving their lives--yet their medical doctor says this is in your best interest but the HMO says no. That is what this legislation is about. 
   The information that the Senator talked about is all very valuable, but what this is about is clinical trials. Their particular proposal requires a study of this particular provision. There isn't a clinical researcher out there, or I daresay a member of the National Cancer Institute at the NIH, who does not support the importance of clinical trials. That is what is at the heart of this. Those are the kinds of protections we are talking about here. Are we going to make sure we will finally have the accountability that is so important to assure that plans are really going to be serious in guaranteeing good quality health care? 
   Mr. President, on behalf of my colleagues, Senators GRAHAM and others, is it in order for me to send an amendment to the desk?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, HMO's across the country are denying coverage for emergency care, and patients are suffering. 
   A child has a severe fever, but his parents are forced to drive past the nearest emergency room to a distant facility that participates in the HMO's network. The child's hands and feet are amputated as a result of the delay in getting care. 
   A middle-aged man has severe chest pain and believes he is having a heart attack, but finds out at the emergency room that it was merely indigestion. His HMO denies payment for the visit, leaving him with an expensive bill for tests to rule out his symptoms. 
   A woman fractures her skull and is knocked out during a 40-foot fall while hiking. She is airlifted to a local hospital, but her HMO later denies coverage because she did not seek ``pre-authorization'' for emergency treatment. 
   A teenager dislocates his shoulder in an after-school sports program in Massachusetts. Another student's mother--who happens to be a physician--saves his arm by performing an emergency procedure while waiting for his HMO to send an ambulance to take him to the hospital. 
   Each case is unique, but all share a common theme. Patients are injured or stuck with the bill because their HMO tries to avoid responsibility for care that should be covered. According to a September, 1998, survey by Harvard University and the Kaiser Family Foundation, one in seven HMO patients report that their plan refused to pay for an emergency room visit, and one in ten say they have difficulty getting emergency care. 
   Two years ago, Congress passed legislation with strong bipartisan support in the Balanced Budget Act that put a stop to these abuses for Medicare and Medicaid patients. As a result, America's elderly, disabled and low-income citizens can seek care at the nearest hospital--without financial penalty--when they believe they are facing a medical emergency. 
   The Graham amendment and the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, which are strongly supported by the American College of Emergency Physicians, would extend those protections to all 161 million Americans with private health insurance. 
   The Republican leadership claims to do the same in their proposal, but their so-called protections are missing key parts or are riddled with loopholes. They apply to fewer than one-third of privately insured Americans. According to the American College of Emergency Physicians in a letter dated June 22, 1999, S. 326, as reported out of Committee, ``fails to achieve the promise of its section name. As drafted, [it] calls into serious question the underlying intent of the provision.'' 
   First, the prudent layperson standard applies only if the HMO happens to define emergency medical care exactly as the act does. Thus, plans may be able to avoid the standard simply by changing their definition of emergency care. 
   Second, even if the prudent layperson standard were to apply, the Republican bill allows plans to charge patients more for going to the nearest emergency department, instead of the HMO's hospital. An amendment was offered in the committee to try to limit cost-sharing for patients who seek care at an out-of-network provider, but conflicting language in the legislation and accompanying Committee Report calls into question the true effect and intent of the amendment. The American College of Emergency Physicians calls the situation ``vague and confusing.'' Clearly, without this assurance, the protections offered by using a prudent layperson standard and removing prior authorization restrictions are moot. Patients will still feel pressured to seek care only at network hospitals--even if it means risking life or limb to get there--because they will fear the financial repercussions that may occur if they go to the nearest emergency room. 
   Third, the Republican leadership bill does not ensure coverage and coordination of the care that is provided after a patient is stabilized in the emergency room. This is a critically important gap, and an area in which coverage can be confusing and disputes frequent. That is why Congress included coverage for post-stabilization care in the Balanced Budget Act's protections for Medicare patients. Senator HUTCHINSON included it in the legislation he cosponsored with Senator GRAHAM last year. This year, however, Republican support for this important protection has disappeared, leaving millions of patients out in the cold. 
   Coverage of post-stabilization care will not significally undermine an  HMO's relationships with particular facilities or become a vehicle for a hospital or patient to manipulate the system after care is provided at a non-participating hospital. It simply ensures that patients receive all necessary care before being transferred or discharged, and that they are not left with the bill simply because the HMO turns off its phones at 5 p.m. or refuses to coordinate with the hospital. 
   Our plan would create a system to ensure that the treating provider and the plan begin a conversation to coordinate care as soon as practical once the patient arrives at the emergency room. 
   I have heard my Republican colleagues argue that this protection is unnecessary because no hospital will discharge a patient until that patient is sufficiently stabilized. That may be true, but the problem we seek to address here deals with coverage, not treatment. Thanks to the anti-dumping Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, under current law patients should received the care they need when they present with symptoms in an emergency room. 
   But HMOs do not need to abide by this act--hospitals and doctors do. So, when the hospitals and doctors do their job and provide the care they think is necessary, the insurance company can later deny coverage for the care and patients are stuck with the bill. 
   The Graham amendment, which I strongly support, would put a stop to this abuse by ensuring that all parties begin discussing proper treatment and coverage options at the earliest possible moment. This amendment is based on Medicare's provisions. It says that insurance companies must use a prudent layperson standard if they cover emergency services. It says patients should not be charged more for going to the closest, but non-participating hospital. And it says that coverage should extend for necessary post-stabilization care, too. Millions of families deserve this protection, and they are waiting for its passage.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President. I join many other Senators in welcoming our former colleague, Ambassador James Sasser, back to the United States after his outstanding service as our Ambassador to the People's Republic of China. 
   America has vital foreign policy interests in China, and Ambassador Sasser has represented those interests skillfully and effectively for more than three years. 
   During his service as Ambassador, he has worked diligently to restore high level summitry between China and the United States. His able leadership has made the American Embassy in Beijing more responsive to the concerns and interests of American business. He has also worked tirelessly to promote dialogue with the Dalai Lama. 
   In the aftermath of the tragic, mistaken bombing of China's embassy in Belgrade in May, America's embassy in Beijing was under siege, and Ambassador Sasser was virtually held hostage in the embassy. During this extraordinarily difficult time, he ensured that American personnel were safe and accounted for. He displayed remarkable courage during this ordeal, and made America proud of him. 
   All of us who worked with Ambassador Sasser in the Senate knew he would excel when President Clinton nominated him for this position. I congratulate him on a job well done. We are proud of his remarkable accomplishments and the efforts he has made to strengthen the U.S.-China relationship.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the DeWine amendment. 
   It has been 26 years since the Supreme Court decided the case of Roe versus Wade in 1973. That landmark decision recognized a woman's fundamental constitutional right to choose to terminate her pregnancy. It removed the barriers that for generations had prevented large numbers of American women from obtaining safe and legal medical care to terminate their pregnancies. 
   In recent years, however, the barriers blocking access to abortion have begun to be rebuilt. This amendment to ban abortion coverage under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan is part of that unacceptable effort. 
   Several million women currently serve the federal government in every state of the nation. Many work for modest pay and depend upon federal health benefits for all aspects of their medical care, including reproductive health services. The amendment offered today would deny those women access to a legal, medical procedure--a constitutional right--and subject them to discrimination, simply because they have chosen to work in public service. 
   The anti-choice Republican majority in Congress has failed to undo Roe and make abortion illegal. But, they are doing insidious work to make abortion more difficult and more dangerous for the women of this country. 
   The most important majority in America--the majority of the American people--believe in a woman's right to choose. They understand what the anti-choice leadership in the Republican Party is trying to do, and they oppose it very strongly. We must do everything we can to uphold this basic right of American women against this relentless attack. 
   A ban on abortion coverage under the federal health plan would undermine a woman's ability to make a decision on one of the most personal, private, and difficult medical issues that will ever occur in her life. I urge my colleagues to vote against this ban, and preserve the constitutional right to choose for all women who are federal employees.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Nation is making extraordinary progress in biomedical research. The National Institutes of Health will have developed a working draft of the entire human genome by next spring. Comprehensive knowledge of the genetic sequence will enable researchers to identify large numbers of mutations associated with disease. Understanding the molecular basis of hereditary diseases will expedite the search for more effective treatments and cures. The benefits for patients are likely to be unparalleled in the history of medicine. 
   But this new scientific knowledge also raises a number of ethical, legal, and social questions. The National Institutes of Health is dealing with many of these challenges through programs funded by the National Human Genome Research Institute.  
   Congress also has a key role to play in this process, especially in dealing with genetic discrimination, which is an increasingly serious problem in health insurance and the workplace. A 1996 study in ``Science and Engineering Ethics'' documented more than 200 cases of discrimination against individuals with genetic predispositions to certain diseases, even though the individuals have no symptoms of the disease as yet. For example, some employers have used genetic screening to identify African Americans with the gene mutation for sickle cell anemia. Those with the sickle cell gene mutation were denied jobs, even though many were only carriers of the mutation and would never become ill themselves. 
   In other cases, persons at risk for Huntington's disease have been denied health insurance and have lost their jobs. Similar concerns are arising in the wake of research showing a genetic basis for breast cancer. Ethnic groups who were participants in research to identify disease-related genes are increasingly concerned about the adverse effects on their insurance coverage and their jobs. Even at the National Institutes of Health, 32% of women offered a test for a genetic mutation related to breast cancer refused to take the test, citing concerns about possible discrimination and the loss of privacy. 
   To deal with this issue, Senator DASCHLE, Senator HARKIN, Senator DODD, and I are introducing legislation to ban genetic discrimination by both health insurers and employers. Our proposal is the culmination of years of work and debate over genetic discrimination. The proposal that we are introducing today is based on our belief that neither your health insurer nor your employer should be able to discriminate against you based upon your genetic information. In this era, when many people obtain their health insurance through their employer, it is especially critical that both health insurers and employers are prohibited from disclosing genetic information to each other. Proposals that do not address both the insurance and the employment aspects of the issue will not truly prevent genetic discrimination. 
   Our legislation prohibits health insurers from setting premiums and defining eligibility on the basis of genetic information. Because we believe that genetic testing is a decision that patients should make with their physicians, our bill prohibits insurers from suggesting or requiring patients to undergo genetic testing. Because insurers do not need to know genetic information for most situations, our bill prohibits them from requesting, collecting, or purchasing genetic information. In addition, the bill does not allow health insurers to share genetic information with each other, to disclose genetic information to industry-wide data banks, or to disclose genetic information to employers. 
   We know that employers are beginning to collect genetic information and discriminate against applicants and employees. Many examples illustrate the problem on a personal level, such as the story of Christine, in Milwaukee, WI. One of Christine's parents developed Huntington's disease, which meant that Christine had a 50% chance that she had inherited the mutant gene that would cause her to develop the disease. Christine decided to undergo a genetic test to determine whether she had inherited the mutation. She traveled to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor for the test, and paid for the test herself. A co-worker in the small firm where Christine worked overheard Christine making the arrangements for the test and told Christine's supervisor. Her supervisor was initially sympathetic and offered to help. Christine then underwent the genetic test and learned that she had indeed inherited the mutation and would therefore eventually develop the disease. When 
   Chistine shared this information with her supervisor, she was fired, despite a series of outstanding job evaluations. Now, because of Christine's experience, none of her siblings are willing to have the genetic test. 
   This type of blatant discrimination must be stopped. Our legislation prohibits employers from collecting genetic information from any source, including health insurers, and from making any type of employment decision based on genetic information. 
   We should all be concerned about genetic discrimination, because we all have mutations in our genes, and medical researchers are discovering new relationships between genes and diseases. Without legislative action, genetic discrimination will intensify as more genes associated with specific diseases are discovered, and as genetic testing becomes more common. Earlier this week, Vice President GORE proposed a challenge to the biomedical research community--to identify all genes associated with cancer by the year 2002. 
   Our legislation is supported by the Alliance to Genetic Support Groups, the National Partnership for Women and Families, the American Civil Liberties Union, and Hadassah. 
   Congress should act quickly to pass legislation to ban genetic discrimination in health insurance and the workplace, so that we can benefit from those research advances without the threat that people will lose their jobs or their health insurance.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to an extraordinary man and religious leader, His Holiness Karekin I, Catholicos of All Armenians, who passed away on June 29. 
   I was proud to call His Holiness my friend. He was an inspiration to all who knew him. He was loved and respected by the Armenian people the world over, and his courage, intelligence, wisdom, and compassion were renowned in international religious circles. 
   His Holiness dedicated his life to the Armenian people. He worked skillfully for Armenia's freedom, and had the noble distinction of being the first Catholicos of the Armenian people elected in the newly independent Republic of Armenia. In this era, he has worked tirelessly and effectively for the spiritual revival of the Armenian Apostolic Church in Armenia. 
   He was also a warm and humble man, gifted with wit and humor, who related easily with people from all backgrounds and from all walks of life. 
   His extraordinary life began in the village of Kessab in Syria in 1932. He studied at a seminary in Lebanon in the late 1940s, and entered the celibate order of the Church in 1952. A gifted student, he went on to study theology at Oxford University. Recognized for his leadership qualities, he quickly rose through the clerical ranks, leading church dioceses in Iran and the United States. In 1977 he was elected Catholicos of the Catholicosate of Cilicia, based in Antelias, Lebanon. In 1995, he was elected Supreme Catholicos of the Armenian people, based in Holy Etchmiadzin, Armenia. 
   From July 6 to July 8, Armenia will be holding a period of national mourning in honor of this great man of faith. The Armenian people throughout the world are mourning his death and paying tribute to his extraordinary life. His remarkable legacy will endure for generations to come.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I have listened carefully to what the Senator has said. I must say, I am in total agreement with the Senator. 
   As I understand the parliamentary situation, rather than follow the usual procedure, where we have legislation that has passed the House and the Senate, and then we go to the conference, and then the conference comes back and we have an opportunity to evaluate what was in the conference, but then we have at least some resolution to the issue, this process and this parliamentary gymnastics, which the leadership on both sides, evidently, were a part of, effectively, as I understand what the Senator is saying, if I understand the parliamentary situation, basically undermines in a very significant and important way the work that was done here in the Senate in terms of trying to help families deal with the problems of violence in their communities, violence in their schools, and also to deal with the law enforcement issue in terms of the gun show loophole. 
   I believe I am correct, am I not, in understanding what the Senator has represented here this afternoon? Am I correct?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I am just wondering if the Senator could give us some insight. It took us 9 days to work out an agreement with the Republican leadership in order to permit the Senate to consider what we know as the Patients' Bill of Rights when we return from the Fourth of July recess, to dispose of that. What we saw during that time was every type of parliamentary maneuver in order to deny the will of the Senate on that particular issue. 
   Now we have, as a result of the leadership, both the majority and minority leadership, an opportunity to address those issues when we return. 
   It seems to me we are seeing a similar effort by the leadership to deny the Senate the ability to express itself on an issue that is affecting children, an issue affecting violence in our schools and our local communities. Effectively, the rules of the Senate are being used in order to deny the Senate the reasonable chance to express itself. 
   Is that basically the bottom line, when all is said and done; we are seeing a parliamentary maneuver to try and effectively undermine what has been the considered judgment of this body? We are being put back, effectively, to ground zero in terms of this issue?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator. I see on the floor our friend and colleague from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, who made a gallant fight on  the floor of the Senate in terms of reducing the availability and the accessibility of guns to children in this country and also to those of the criminal element. It was a hard-fought battle. The Senate expressed its will. That is the way this body should act. 
   Now, with a parliamentary maneuver, the leadership that was strongly opposed to those provisions has been basically able, at least for the time being, to undermine what has been debated, discussed, and acted on here in the Senate. 
   I thank the Senator from Vermont for bringing this matter to our attention. I thank, again, the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from California, both of whom I am sure share our frustration with this parliamentary maneuver. 
   I think at some time in the Senate, a body that has a very proud tradition of permitting people to express their judgment and 
   to make a determination to deal with public business, at some time we are going to learn the lesson that you can't constantly undermine what is the regular order, which is the reason why this body was established; that is, for Senators to be able to express their will. I think we are seeing another way and means of corrupting the purpose that the Founding Fathers intended. I think it is enormously regrettable. 
   I assure the Senator from Vermont, we will work very closely with him to try to remedy this situation in any way that we can. I thank the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it has been 71 days--71 days --since the tragic shooting at Columbine High School. There are 69 days left before school children in Massachusetts and other states go back to school. It is time for Congress to finish the job we began last month and pass juvenile justice legislation. Communities across America are waiting for our answer. 
   We need to provide communities with the assistance they need to reduce youth violence. 
   We need to help parents struggling to raise their children from birth through adolescence. 
   We need to help teachers and school officials recognize the early warning signals and act before violence occurs. 
   We need to assist law enforcement officers in keeping guns away from children. 
   We need to close the gun show loophole. 
   We need to require the sale of safety locks with all firearms. 
   The Senate passed such legislation with overwhelming support last month. The House of Representatives passed its own version of this legislation earlier this month. It is time to appoint House and Senate conferees to write the final bill and send it to the President, so that effective legislation is in place as soon as possible. 
   Everyday we delay, this critical problem continues to fester. Children are under assault from violence and neglect--from the break-up of families--from the temptations of alcohol, tobacco, and drug abuse--from violence in the media. These are not new problems, but they have become increasingly serious problems, and Congress cannot look the other way and continue to ignore them. 
   We must support youth, parents, educators, law enforcement authorities, and communities. The public overwhelmingly supports more effective steps to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and juveniles. We cannot accept ``no'' for an answer from the National Rifle Association. It is long past time for Congress to face up to this challenge. The tragedy at Columbine High School is an urgent call to action to every member of Congress. Will we finally do what it takes to keep children safe, or will we continue to sleepwalk through this worsening crisis of gun violence in our schools and our society. 
   We have a national crisis, and common sense approaches are urgently needed. If we are serious about dealing with youth violence, the time to act is now. There is no reason why this Congress can not pass a comprehensive juvenile justice bill before the August recess. The citizens of this country deserve better than what Congress has given them so far. 
   The lack of action is appalling and inexcusable. We cannot continue to whistle past the graveyards of Littleton and the many other communities scarred by juvenile gun violence in recent years. Each new tragedy is a fresh indictment of our failure to act responsibly.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I just want to join in expressing real reservations about the Brownback proposal that effectively would provide discretionary provisions to the President of the United States. Obviously, it has been represented by a number of those who have spoken on this issue that the U.S. does have interests in this particular part of the world. But it does seem to me, as someone who has followed this situation closely over a number of years, for the United States now to be in a position where we are seeing a significant alteration of the balance of power by taking unilateral action, rather than trying to add to a resolution of the dispute, I think, only makes it more complicated, more difficult to try to reach some real chance for peace. 
   I think in many different parts of the world, ultimately, the people who do have responsibility, authority, and power have to be willing to come to the negotiating table and be prepared to make tough and difficult decisions. To think that the United States, by somehow changing and altering its position in terms of effectively siding with one side in this, thinks that we can really advance the cause for peace in that area, I think, is shortsighted. I think it really misunderstands the region and the historical and significant political forces at play in that region. 
   All of us see there is a different opportunity in that part of the world currently. As we have seen the change in history in different parts of the world, whether in Northern Ireland, or perhaps even today in terms of the Middle East, or in other parts of the world, we have seen, with the change of circumstances by outside forces, progress made. But for the United States now to be in a position where it moves unilaterally in terms of its interests, I don't feel it really advances the cause of peace. There are those who have advanced different options about moving this whole political process forward, who can advance the country's interest in that part of the world in a positive and constructive way. But I fail to see how this change will advance that interest. I don't believe it does. 
   I strongly support the position my friend and colleague, Senator SARBANES, has mentioned. We find out now there are indirect contacts that are available and accessible. We have the private sector already engaged. There are indirect lines of support to Azerbaijan at the present time. But for the United States now to be in a position which effectively would commit itself to one side in this, after all of the various situations and the current situations, I think would be enormously counterproductive. 
   So I certainly hope we will not take that action at this time. I don't think it is warranted. It is not justified, and I think it would be counterproductive in terms of the interests of the people in that region. There have been initiatives for the cause of peace in that part of the world. The Armenians have indicated a willingness to move that process forward, and those have been rejected, as I understand it, by the Azerbaijanis. For the U.S., under these circumstances, to be in a situation where we could effectively--and we understand what is really at the bottom of this, and that is effectively coming down on one side--I think there fails to be a persuasive argument about trying to advance this process for peace and real prosperity, and freeing that region from the kinds of tensions it has faced in the past. 
   I hope when the Senate comes to deal with this issue, we will maintain what I think has been a sound policy in the past and, with the new initiatives out there in terms of advancing peace, try to find ways to move the process forward rather than interfering in these negotiations by favoring one side over another.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the amendment to the Silk Road Strategy Act. I support the many worthwhile provisions in the Act, but I oppose the waiver of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which was enacted by Congress in 1992. Section 907 restricts U.S. assistance to Azerbaijan because of Azerbaijan's continuing economic blockade of Armenia. This blockade has led to great suffering by the people of Armenia, who have had to endure years of shortages of vital commodities. 
   Azerbaijan's cut off of fuel supplies had a devastating effect on Armenia's industry. Factories were unable to operate, throwing tens of thousands of people out of work. Malnutrition increased because of the shortage of food. Schools and hospitals had to shut down or operate under dire circumstances for only a few hours a day. 
   Over the years, the humanitarian needs have been so great in Armenia. The 1988 earthquake, followed by the blockade, has resulted in continuing devastating circumstances for the people of Armenia. I can remember talking to doctors about the humanitarian needs of the Armenia people. I worked with the Department of Defense airlifting goods donated by the people of Massachusetts and other states to help alleviate the suffering. 
   Although conditions are somewhat better today than they were a few years ago, Armenia still suffers from the effects of this blockade. It continues to obstruct Armenia's ability to import food, fuel, medicine and other important commodities and items. 
   Unfortunately, the Silk Road Strategy Act contains no provision requiring Azerbaijan to lift this blockade as a condition of receiving additional U.S. aid. It makes no sense to reward Azerbaijan while that nation continues this inhumane blockade. Azerbaijan already receives $24 million a year in indirect U.S. assistance. Current law allows the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the U.S. Trade and Development Agency to provide support to the private sector, and USAID is authorized to provide humanitarian aid and democracy-building assistance to Azerbaijan. 
   Section 907 is an important incentive for Azerbaijan to come to the negotiating table to resolve the continuing controversy between Azerbaijan and  Armenia. The amendment offered by Senator MCCONNELL, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senator SARBANES will retain this essential lever of sanctions, and I urge the Senate to adopt it. Unless the waiver of Section 907 is removed, it would be a serious mistake for the Senate to approve the Silk Road Strategy Act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the United States Conference of Mayors recently gave its ringing endorsement to an increase in the minimum wage. On June 15, at their annual conference in New Orleans, the mayors unanimously adopted a resolution calling for such an increase. 
   The resolution was sponsored by Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston, who is renowned for his leadership on behalf of working families in our city, and I commend Mayor Menino for this important and constructive initiation. 
   Thanks to the leadership of Mayor Menino, the Conference of Mayors has highlighted the needs and concerns of America's workers. The adoption of the Mayors' resolution makes it all the more important for Congress to act, and to act this year. 
   Mayors are on the front lines at the local level. They know the day-to-day realities of the lives of working Americans. They have seen firsthand how the decrease in value of the minimum wage leaves workers unable to support their families. By next year, the real value of the minimum wage will have dropped by $2.50 an hour from its peak 30 years ago. For a generation, we have allowed the value of the minimum wage to decline unfairly at the expense of millions of hard working American men and women and their families. 
   The unfortunate reality is that in 1999, large numbers of Americans work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, yet still can't support their families. Their wages don't enable them to put food on the table or a reasonable roof over their heads. A minimum wage worker earns $10,712 a year--$3,100 below the poverty line for a family of three. 
   Every day, working families across the country are forced to turn to emergency food assistance to supplement their diets, and then to emergency shelters for a place to sleep. A 1998 U.S. Conference of Mayors survey found that 61% of people requesting emergency food assistance were families--parents and their children. The majority of cities also reported an increase in requests for emergency shelter by homeless parents with children. As the Mayors' survey emphasized, these are working Americans, yet they are not earning enough to make ends meet. 
   The majority of minimum wage workers are adults struggling to achieve a decent standard of living. Instead of enabling workers to reach this goal that all families deserve, today's minimum wage tramples on that dream for a better life. 
   Now is the time to raise the minimum wage. The country's economy is soaring to new heights and setting new records for growth and prosperity. The economy is the best in decades, and yet millions of America's hardest workers are not sharing in this prosperity. The Dow Jones Average is touching 11,000. The highest compensated CEO in 1998 was paid $117 million. But minimum wage workers still can't lift their families out of poverty. 
   Minimum wage workers deserve better. They serve our food, take care of our children, clean our office buildings, and perform countless other basic jobs. When hard working Americans put in a full day's work year round, they deserve a fair share of the nation's prosperity. 
   Over 11 million workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. They should not have to rely on food aid or shelters. 
   Mayor Menino and mayors across America want action, Congress should heed their call to action and raise the minimum wage.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in sponsoring The Time for Schools Act of 1999, and I commend Senator MURRAY for her impressive leadership. This legislation will provide parents with much-needed assistance as they struggle to balance the needs of their children and the demands of their jobs. 
   Six years ago, the Family and Medical Leave Act became the first bill signed into law by President Clinton. Workers covered by the law can take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year in order to care for a newborn or adopted child, or a seriously ill family member, and know that their jobs will be there when they get back. 
   By any measure, the Family and Medical Leave Act has been a resounding success. Over 89 million Americans--70% of the workforce--are covered by the law, and millions of workers have been able to take the time they need to care for their families. The vast majority of covered employers--over 90%--have found the law relatively easy to administer, according to the bipartisan Commission on Family and Medical Leave. 
   Now it is time to take another step, and extend that success to enable parents to take up to 24 hours of unpaid family leave a year to be involved in their children's academic activities at school. I am proud that, under state law, parents in Massachusetts know they can take care of their children's school needs without losing their jobs. We should give all parents across the nation that right under federal law, too. 
   Parents play a crucial role in their children's lives. But too often, society offers them only barriers and blame as they try to raise their children. While we hear a lot of talk about family values, the test is whether we genuinely value families. If we do, then we must adopt better policies to help working parents balance the competing demands of the workplace and their responsibility to care for their children. 
   We know that working parents want to be more involved in their children's lives. In a study by the PTA, two-thirds of employed parents with children under 18 felt they did not have enough time to spend with their children. Forty percent felt they weren't devoting enough time to their children's education. Almost a quarter reported that attending teacher-parent conferences created problems at work. 
   We know that involved parents increase the likelihood of a child's success at school. According to some studies, it may be the single most important factor in student learning. One study showed that the involvement of both parents in their child's school was significantly associated with the child's academic achievement. 
   The Time for Schools Act will give working parents up to 24 hours of leave a year to participate in their children's school activities, such as attending parent-teacher conferences, taking part in classroom educational activities, or selecting the right school for their children. 
   Responsible employers know that flexible family workplace policies mean better, more productive workers. These policies are good for families, and good for business. In 1998, survey by the Families and Work Institute reported that the overwhelming majority of employers--84%--agree that the benefits of family or medical leave offset the costs. 
   The advantage of this legislation to employers are clear. A mother or father worried about how a child is doing at school is a less effective employee. The 24 hours of leave granted under this Act will be counted towards the 12 weeks of leave already provided under the Family and Medical Leave Act. In addition, workers must give employers a week's notice, except in emergencies. As a result, the legislation will have only a minimal impact on employers. 
   The tragedies we have witnessed at schools in recent years demonstrate how important it is for parents to pay attention to how children are doing at school. When this bill becomes law, workers will know they don't have to stop being parents when they go to work. They can be good parents at school, as well as after school. 
   Again, I commend Senator MURRAY for her leadership on this important measure, and I look forward to working with her to enact it as soon as possible this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending the two leaders for propounding this unanimous consent request. These past days have been hard fought in establishing a procedure which would be fair and permit the opportunity for the Senate to debate fully some of the important measures I think are included in the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think the leaders have outlined a process and the Senate has been willing to accept that procedure. Both leaders do deserve credit. 
   I want to underscore what both leaders have said; that is, we are going into this whole process on the basis of good faith. I join with the Senator from South Dakota in feeling we can do the business of the Senate on this issue in that time. But it is also preserved, if for some reason there is not the kind of constructive and positive attitude we have heard this evening, that there is going to be the denial of that opportunity, that rights will be reserved for Members to raise these issues at another time. I am hopeful we can follow what has been outlined here and in good faith have a full and fair debate on these issues. 
   The real fireworks are going to be after the Fourth of July this year. I look forward to engaging in this debate. 
   I again thank my leader and the majority leader for moving this whole extremely important piece of legislation to the point where it will be center stage in the Senate. I thank the leader for his efforts.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join in this tribute to Rabbi Moshe Sherer. To all of us who knew him and worked with him, Rabbi Sherer was a great friend, a great leader, and a great champion of democracy and freedom. 
   Rabbi Sherer was an inspiration to all of us, especially in his work on immigration and religious freedom. He worked skillfully and tirelessly to free prisoners of conscience in the former Soviet Union, to reunite divided families, and to protect freedom of religion across the globe. 
   Even in the darkest hours of communism, Rabbi Sherer was an eloquent advocate for the right of the oppressed to leave the Soviet Union. He had an enduring belief that the freedom to emigrate to escape persecution is one of the most basic and fundamental human rights. 
   As the President of Agudath Israel of America for over three decades, Rabbi Sherer was instrumental in developing that organization into a powerful force for justice in our nation and across the world. He inspired us all with his generous spirit of tolerance, his extraordinary knowledge and understanding, and his deep commitment to human rights and religious freedom. 
   We are fortunate to have worked with Rabbi Sherer, and we mourn his loss. His brilliant legacy will continue to be an inspiration for future generations. We miss his leadership and we miss his friendship.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just a week ago efforts were made by Members on this side of the aisle to try to encourage our Republican leadership to schedule what is known as the Patients' Bill of Rights legislation, which Senator DASCHLE has introduced and many of us have cosponsored. The underlying point of the Patients' Bill of Rights is very basic and simple: to make sure that medical decisions are going to be made by the trained medical professionals and the patients, and not by accountants or insurance companies. That is basically the concept behind that legislation. 
   We have tried over the past week to have that legislation before the Senate. There are differences with the membership here on various provisions. During March of this year, we had an opportunity in our Health and Education Committee to have a discussion and debate on some of these matters, and the committee itself reported out legislation. At that time, we had more than 20 different amendments dealing with a range of different issues. Those were handled in a relatively reasonable period of time. People were familiar with the subject matter, as I think they are here in this body. We had that legislation reported out more than three months ago. I think many of us expected that, given the statements that were made by the majority leader in January of this year on several different occasions, the Patients' Bill of Rights would be brought up before the Senate by now for an opportunity to debate and discuss it. 
   We have not had that opportunity to do so. We had hoped that was going to be the case last week when we discussed it, and we hoped, at least if we were unable at that time to have this measure actually laid down before the Senate on Tuesday or Wednesday, that the Republican leadership would indicate that we would have the chance to bring it up and debate it now. 
   It seemed that we might have the chance to bring it up today, with the opportunity to offer amendments, and conclude the legislation by the end of the week, prior to the Fourth of July recess. In the meantime, it seemed that the Democratic leader had given strong assurances that he would do everything he possibly could in urging the Members on this side to work in every possible way to expedite the consideration of various appropriations bills. I think he spoke for all the Members--I am sure he did--on this side on this issue. There are some particular items and some of those measures that should be brought to the Senate for resolution. I thought that when he had indicated he thought it was reasonable that we could conclude a number of the appropriations bills and conclude this legislation, that was a very reasonable suggestion to the leadership. 
   Now, Mr. President, as those who follow this issue know, this is not the first time the Senate has been effectively closed down--closed down--closed down over their refusal to consider this legislation. That is effectively what is happening here. We will have some procedural kinds of votes, but the American people ought to understand what is really happening here--that these procedural votes that we are going to have later this afternoon really have nothing to do with the underlying legislation; that is, the four different appropriations bills. It is basically an attempt by the leadership to prohibit the debate and discussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights. The American people are beginning to understand that more clearly. 
   I found when I was back in Massachusetts over this past weekend, talking with various groups, more people are focused on this, more people are paying attention, more people are aware of what is being attempted by the Republican majority--that is, denying us the opportunity for even a reasonable debate and discussion on the Patients' Bill of Rights--than most other 
   issues. 
   I have taken the time of the Senate before--and I won't take it again this afternoon--to review where we were a little over a year ago. Over a year ago, we were in the exact same position. We were denied the opportunity to bring this measure up for consideration of the Senate. The Republican leadership at that time said that the Democrats were not going to dictate what the agenda will be. 
   The only problem with that is that it isn't the Democrats who are attempting to dictate the agenda. It's the American people. It's every health care organization that has taken a position in favor of the proposal introduced by Senator DASCHLE and against the one introduced by Senator FRIST and the Republican leadership. Virtually all  leading patient and medical groups have supported the Democratic proposal, Senator DASCHLE's proposal. We could understand why, if we had an opportunity to actually debate these issues. 
   These groups do not care whether Democrats or Republicans are on a piece of legislation; they just want a strong bill. And virtually every single leading medical group in our country supports ours. None support theirs. 
   You would think that at some time in this body, on a matter that affects all of the families of this country, we would have an opportunity to have some decisionmaking and be ready to call the roll. Of course, if the ramifications weren't so serious, many of us would have been amused by the statements that were made last week by the assistant majority leader when he said: We are not going to let the Members on our side vote because their votes might be misconstrued for political purposes. That would be laughable if it did not relate to an issue as important as the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Imagine a political leader saying they are refusing to permit Members to vote because their votes may be interpreted in ways which might be misconstrued. I think most of us feel that we can stand on our own two feet in facing various votes. I always appreciate their leadership in trying to protect our various interests. But we are not talking about some narrow special interests, we are talking about the people's interests. 
   As I have mentioned before, this matter is important because it is a children's issue. Virtually every major children's health group in our country--all those that advocate for children's health--has supported and recognized the importance of our legislation in protecting the interests of children. 
   They haven't gotten a single organization that is committed to the advancement of the interests of children on their side. We have all of them. We have all of them because of some very important reasons. One of the most obvious ones is that we insist that a child who has some special need is not only going to have a pediatrician--but is also going to have a specialist trained in the area of the particular need of that child. If the child has cancer, the child should be treated by a pediatric oncologist. A doctor that specializes in children and also children's cancer. 
   When our colleagues on the other side say: We don't understand why the Democrats are talking about specialists because we guarantee specialists; they say, ``We guarantee that a sick child will see a pediatrician.'' But that is not the issue. The question is will a child with a specific need for specialty care have access to a pediatric specialist, meaning a pediatric cardiologist, or a pediatric surgeon, or a pediatric oncologist. Under the Republican bill, the answer is no. Under our bill, the answer is yes. 
   This is a children's bill. The children's groups have spoken passionately, actively, and enthusiastically in support of our program. 
   This is a women's issue. The women in this country--the groups that have specialized in women's health generally, and particularly those that have been most concerned about issues, for example, of breast cancer--know the importance of having access to OB/GYN professionals, and to be able to designate that OB/GYN as the primary care doctor for women. We have had voluminous testimony about the importance of that. 
   It makes sense. Women also understand, particularly those who may be afflicted by the devastation of breast cancer, the importance of clinical trials. When they are talking with their doctor, and the doctor says: Well, we know that there is a clinical trial out there that can make a difference in terms of your survival. We know when that patient then asks to be enlisted in that clinical trial--and the doctor says I can't because your HMO won't permit me to do it, the HMO has overridden my judgment on that--that denying access to it is not in the health interest of that woman. It is not in the health interest of her family, and it puts her at greater risk. 
   These are not tales. We had the testimony. We have given the examples of what is happening out there. This isn't a diminishing threat. To the contrary, the system is becoming more of a threat to women. Women understand that. This is an enormously important issue with regard to women. That is why virtually all of the major women's groups and organizations support our legislation. 
   This legislation is also enormously important to those who have some physical or mental disability. We don't necessarily like to use the word ``disability'' because it implies that people may not be able--and we know that those who do have some challenge are able, and in many instances gifted and talented in many different ways. But they often need specialized attention, treatment, and medicine. Prescription drug formularies can deny access to critically important medications. Yet we find that, while you can 
   always go off the particular HMO's formulary, you may have to pay exorbitant prices for the treatment. 
   I listened to the handful of those who spoke on the other side in the period last week who said: Oh, they can always go off the formulary. Of course they can--and pay an additional arm and a leg. I think most families in this country understand what the problem is in terms of prescription drugs. They sign up for health insurance--and the HMO takes their premium--and when the time comes for them to get the kind of treatment that they need, the HMO denies it. 
   We understand how important that is. We want to be able to debate these measures, and these matters. 
   We had an excellent amendment by the Senator from California talking about ``medical necessity.'' Let us use the best definition in terms of ``medical necessity.'' Let's include in the various HMO plans what is going to be necessary in terms of treatment and what is going to represent the best in terms of medical practice. That seems to make sense. That is not a guarantee today. 
   I read in the RECORD last week about some of the various HMOs and their definitions of what was going to be included and what was going to be excluded. Listen to what is in the Republican bill, as offered in an amendment by the majority leader last week. On page 27, it says only that HMOs have to provide a description of the definition of ``medical necessity'' used in making coverage determinations by each plan--each plan. 
   Do we understand that? It isn't what is the best in terms of health care. It is whatever each plan decides. So any of the HMOs can effectively develop whatever they want to use as a definition for ``medical necessity.'' Your doctor might say to you: This is what the best medicine is to save your life, or your child's life, or your wife's life, or your husband's life. And the medical plan will say: No way, Joe Smith. You signed our contract. You signed that contract. And in that contract, we say that treatment is not medically necessary. Make no mistake, the Republican bill says ``a description of the definition of medical necessity'' will be a determination by your plan. That is the HMO. 
   Come on. Don't we think this body should be able to make a decision as to whether you want the Republican plan, which on page 27, line 20, provides patients with ``a description of the definition of medical necessity used in making coverage determinations by each plan,'' or, on the other hand, you want medical decisions to be dictated by the best medical practice in the United States of America? 
   That is what is in the Feinstein amendment. 
   Why shouldn't we be able to have 1 hour of debate on that, and have a rollcall in here and make a decision? Where are the Republican principles? Why is it that they are denying the American people the chance to hold their elected Representatives accountable? 
   That is what they are doing. We can't hold them accountable because the other side won't permit us to get a vote on that particular issue. That is what is going on here. We should have the chance. We will have the chance to go through that legislation. 
   Remember all of last week they were talking about a description of ``medical necessity''--the definition of medical necessity used to make coverage determinations is decided by each such plan under the Republican leadership's bill. 
   That ought to chill every Member of the opposite side--to think that is the  position that they are stuck with. That is in their Republican bill. 
   What we are trying to do with the amendment of the Senator from California is to change that to make sure that decisions of medical necessity will be based on the best that we have in terms of treatment, and in terms of the opinions of trained individuals and research. 
   Let's let the American people understand who is on our side on this particular issue, and who is on the side of the insurance companies. The HMOs are fundamentally the ones that refuse to use the best medical science in terms of their definitions. 
   This is just one example. It is a very powerful one, but I believe that if we had been able to get on this legislation last week when the Feinstein amendment was actually brought up, we would have been on the appropriations bill this week. We might have concluded several of those various appropriations bills. Instead the whole of last week has passed without any progress, and we are starting over again evidently in anticipation of this week's activity. 
   Now, apparently, we are going to take a good part of this week just to deny the Senate the opportunity of making a judgment on whether medical decisions should be made by doctors and patients, or by HMO accountants. They won't permit a number of amendments. They won't even permit Members a chance to debate and conclude this in five days. We took 7 to 9 days on the Y2K legislation to try and deal with some anticipated problem regarding the computer industry, but we won't be able to take the few days necessary to protect the American people. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Corporation for National Service recently announced the first winners of the National Service-Learning Leader Schools program, a Presidential initiative to recognize outstanding schools for their achievements in the field of service-learning. 
   Learn and Serve America, one of the three national service programs of the Corporation for National Service, is sponsoring the Leader Schools initiative. In this, its pilot year, the program is honoring 70 high schools in 41 states and the District of Columbia for thoughtfully and effectively integrating community service into the lives of students. The goals of the program are to promote civic responsibility, improve school and student performance, and strengthen local communities. 
   Four schools from Massachusetts--Drury High School in North Adams, Hudson High School, Phillips Exeter Academy, and Sharon High School have been leaders in our state on service-learning, and were honored by this designation. I commend them for the important work that they have accomplished in making community service an integral part of school life. These schools are impressive models for Massachusetts and for the nation. 
   The Leader Schools program is not simply an awards program. The schools being honored today are also making a two year commitment to help other schools include service-learning in their curriculum. 
   In May 1996, President Clinton announced his intention to identify and honor the schools that have done the best job of encouraging, organizing, and leading the service-learning movement. He said, ``We should make service to the community a part of every high school in America and a part of the life of every dedicated citizen in the United States. 
   Many of us have seen local service-learning programs in action and the inspiring way that students of all ages respond and work together to improve their communities. 
   The Corporation for National Service also administers AmeriCorps, the domestic Peace Corps that is engaging over 40,000 Americans in intensive, service activities. In addition, it administers the National Senior Service Corps, which is involving nearly half a million Americans age fifty-five and older to share their time and talents to help solve local problems. These three outstanding programs are all achieving great success under the strong leadership of our former colleague in the Senate, Harris Wofford, who is the chief executive officer of the Corporation. 
   I also commend Carol Kinsley, a member of the Corporation's Board of Directors, for her strong commitment and leadership in the field of service-learning. The dedication of citizens like Carol are contributing immensely to the success of our national service programs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I see the Senator from California back on the floor prepared to offer her amendment on the pending legislation. It is an extremely important amendment. 
   I noted that she was here yesterday morning prepared to offer the amendment, and then in the midmorning, and then at noontime, and then in the early afternoon, midafternoon, and late afternoon. 
   I am very glad we are going to have a brief period of morning business. But, as one Senator, I hope this is really the last time we are going to have a period of morning business and that we can get on to the business and the substance of this legislation. 
   We went through all day yesterday with continuations of morning business, and we had some 16 Members--those who are cosponsors of the Patients' Bill of Rights--who came to the floor prepared to speak on the Patients' Bill of Rights, different features of it. Many of them--I think eight of them--are actually prepared to offer amendments but were unable to do so because we were in continued morning business. I see that the Senator from California is prepared to move ahead and move this whole process forward. 
   I think the American people want us to move ahead on this. I think it is enormously timely that we do, and particularly in the way the Senator from California intends to address the Senate. I know she will speak for herself in a few moments. 
   We can see what happened in the last few hours among the doctors in this Nation. The American Medical Association is voting to try to come together in a way to advance, one, the quality of health care for the American consumer; and, two, to be able to deal with these economic pressures they are under from the HMOs, in order to give assurance to their patients that they are going to be able to receive the best in terms of health care. 
   It just underlines, once again, the importance of Senator FEINSTEIN's amendment in terms of what is going to be defined as medically necessary. That is at the heart of this whole issue on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I think we ought to be about the debate on that during the course of the day. 
   This is a very fundamental, basic difference. I have read carefully--and it didn't take a great deal of time--the comments of those who spoke yesterday in favor of what I call the ``patients' bill of wrongs'' being submitted by the other side, which was passed out of our Human Resource Committee. There was no real focus and attention on this fundamental and basic issue. We ought to be about it; we ought to debate it and vote on it and move ahead on other pieces of legislation. 
   I find that it appears with the proposal--I see the Senator on her feet at the present time--I listened with great interest to the proposal made by the Republican leadership suggesting how we proceed next week on the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The way I looked at their proposal that was going to be offered by the majority leader, it would effectively permit only one Democratic amendment per day and we would have only 4 days, because under the proposal they would have a first-degree amendment, a Republican amendment, and then you could have a second-degree Democratic amendment and a second-degree Republican. That would take 6 hours. Then you would have a first-degree Democrat amendment, a second-degree Republican amendment, a second-degree Democrat amendment. That is 6 more hours. That is 12 hours with one amendment. 
   That is not the Senate, Mr. President. I don't believe that offer deserves to be accepted. We were tied up in morning business for a full day because they did not want to vote on a single proposition of whether the insurance company accountants or the medical profession ought to make the medical decisions. That is a very basic and fundamental one. This body ought to make a judgment and decision on that issue. 
   I see the Senator from California on her feet now, and I hope that after she makes a presentation on this, we will be able to just have the opportunity to commend our colleagues to her position. I have reviewed both her statement and her amendment; it is an excellent one. With the acceptance of her amendment, it will mean that every insurance policy in this country, virtually, will establish a higher standard of treatment for the American patients, for every child, for every member of a family, and that will be the basic standard that will be used.  
   I don't believe that the American families ought to have any less than the best. The Senator from California has an amendment to address that issue. We should listen carefully to it, and then we should move to let the Senate make a judgment on this decision. I look forward to the discussion and debate, and hopefully we can have some resolution of it. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor. 
   Mrs. FEINSTEIN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thought we would be going back to the amendment of the Senator from California. I hope those Americans who have been watching the Senate for the last few minutes--and also for the past few days--have no doubt in their minds what this is all about. This hasn't got anything to do with the Senate rules at all or Senate procedure. It is about a very fundamental and basic issue; it's about whether the Senate of the United States is willing to take up the Patients' Bill of Rights, the core of which states that decisions affecting the medical treatment of an individual are going to be decided by the doctors and trained medical professionals and not by gatekeepers or insurance adjusters or insurance accountants. That is the basic issue. 
   We can talk about 2-hour amendments, 4 days, a week, we can talk about four cloture motions, but the bottom line is that the Republican majority is refusing to permit the Senate to go about the people's business and schedule a Patients' Bill of Rights and permit the kind of orderly procedure that has been a part of this body for almost 200 years. That is what is going on here. Then they have the effrontery to talk about how they are going to change the rules in order to try and deny any opportunity to have a measure of this kind brought before the Senate. 
   Let's be very clear what this is about. This is about something which is basic and fundamental to the families in this country. For 2 days, the Senator from California has been trying to bring up her amendment and get action on it. She has been precluded from doing so. The last action this evening--morning business at 5:10 on Thursday evening--has again precluded a debate and vote on her amendment. She was here yesterday at 9:30 in the morning. It doesn't take a Member of the Senate to understand what is going on. She is being denied a vote on the key issue of this whole debate, and that is whether insurance companies which cover American families are going to have to use a definition of what is ``medically necessary'' that will reflect the best medical training, judgment, and skill in the United States. That is what her amendment is. 
   I have seen a lot of actions taken in order to preclude a Member of the Senate from getting a vote, but to go through the process of having four cloture votes next Monday, all in an attempt to deny the Senator from California an opportunity to get an up-or-down vote on her amendment, is a very clear indication of what is going on. 
   This isn't about process. This is about substance. What kind of quality health care programs are we going to have in the United States of America? 
   We are being denied the opportunity to make that decision. We were denied it last year and we are denied it again this year. We can listen to all the other bills left to do this year, and the Patients' Bill of Rights should be one of them. We tried to get it up last year, but we couldn't get it up under regular order. We have tried to get it up this year, but, again, we can't get it up under regular order. 
   Earlier today, we heard reference to the process and procedure that was followed during Kassebaum-Kennedy. Let me remind my colleagues that the consent agreement to consider the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation was reached on February 6 of that year. It said the bill must be brought up no earlier than April 15 and no later than May 3, with no time agreements or limitations on amendments. And we passed it, unanimously, under those terms. 
   It seems to me that the last two days provide a very clear example of the majority effectively, I believe, abusing the process and procedures of the Senate, to deny the debate, discussion and the vote on an important issue in order to protect themselves on the issue of health care. We should be protecting the American people. They are going to understand it. There can be no other interpretation of what is happening on the floor of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am proud to stand with Senator JEFFORDS, Senator LIEBERMAN, Congressman FRANK, and Congressman SHAYS to announce the introduction of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act of 1999, which has over 30 co-sponsors in the Senate and over 150 co-sponsors in the House of Representatives. Once this bill becomes law, it will ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to work without fear of reprisal because of their sexual orientation. It is the next important step for civil rights in America. 
   This country has made great progress toward fairness and an end to bigotry in the workplace. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ensures that Americans--without regard to their race, ethnic background, gender, or religion--have the opportunity to obtain and keep a job. The Minimum Wage guarantees a basic standard of living. The Family and Medical Leave Act guarantees that working men and  women can balance important family and employment responsibilities without fear of reprisal by their employer. The Americans with Disabilities Act establishes important protections for workers with disabilities. 
   Now, Congress must take steps to achieve the same kind of fairness for gay men and lesbians who encounter blatant discrimination in the workplace. The Employment Non-Discrimination Act will accomplish that goal by prohibiting employers from using sexual orientation as a basis for hiring, firing, promotion, or compensation. 
   The bill is important for what it does, as well as what it doesn't do. It does not require domestic partnership benefits. It does not authorize ``disparate impact'' claims. It does not apply to the Armed Services. It contains a broad exemption of religious organizations. It prohibits quotas and preferential treatment, and bars the EEOC from requiring the collection of statistical information on sexual orientation. 
   A broad coalition of churches, businesses, and civil rights liberties organizations support the Employment Non-Discrimination Act. 68 percent of Americans from all regions of the country support its passage. 
   The American people agree that workplace discrimination is wrong, and that clear protections are needed to prevent it. Some states already have such laws, and many businesses have policies similar to our proposal. But this patchwork of protection is inadequate. A national standard is essential for the protection of this basic right. 
   The discrimination that exists today is a stain on our democracy. 
   David Horowitz encountered this bigotry when he applied to be an Assistant City Attorney in Mesa, Arizona. He had graduated near the top of his law school class at the University of Arizona. While employed by a private law firm, he applied for a position with the City Attorney. He was not offered a position, but he was told he was the second choice. Six months later, he was called and interviewed for another job opening. The City Attorney asked David for references and told him that, ``I only ask for references when I'm ready to make someone an offer.'' In the interview, David told the City Attorney that he was openly gay, and the tone of the interview suddenly changed. David was told that his sexual orientation posed a problem, and three weeks later he received a rejection letter. 
   What happened to David Horowitz was wrong, but he had no recourse under State or Federal law against this blatant discrimination. No American should be denied a chance to work because of prejudices. It is long past time to close this loophole in our civil rights law, and I urge the Congress to act this year to close it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last evening Senator DASCHLE was prepared to offer an amendment to the agricultural bill that was at the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights. I believe that will be offered shortly on behalf of the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN. We will have an opportunity to get into that discussion and debate. 
   I am hopeful, as are others, that we can work out a process and procedure by which we can have a full discussion and debate on this issue, and where we can have an orderly way of disposing of various amendments on the Patients' Bill of Rights. I am, however, somewhat distressed and disturbed by some of the comments I have read this morning on the AP relating to my friend from Oklahoma, Senator NICKLES, the Republican assistant majority leader. 
   He said he was willing to vote on the issue if the Democrats would agree to limit debate, but he said he was worried that Democrats will pressure some Republicans into supporting amendments that will increase the cost of health care, and therefore the number of Americans without any insurance. He also said he was worried the Democrats will force votes that can be misconstrued for political purposes. He would rather allow a yes or no on the entire package with only a handful of amendments. 
   I have more confidence than the assistant majority leader in our colleagues' ability to make discerning decisions about the merit of these various amendments, and that having been elected by the people, we are charged to make judgments on these measures. 
   This is a new reason for not bringing legislation to the floor. Apparently, one of the leaders is concerned the members of their party would not be able to exercise a balanced and informed judgment in the best interests of the particular States the Senators represent. Of course, if that is going to continue to be the position of the leadership, it does not bode well for a full discussion and debate on this issue. 
   We have seen for the last 2 years a policy of delay and denial of the ability to debate the issues that we referred to yesterday and on other occasions, and which we will have an opportunity again to debate today. But it is out of frustration that Senator DASCHLE has used the unusual procedure of offering this legislation on an appropriations bill, in the hopes we can work out an orderly process or procedure. I certainly support that process, since we have effectively been closed out from any opportunity to debate this issue. 
   It is a simple, fundamental, basic issue: whether decisions relating to the health of patients in this country are going to be decided by the health care professionals who have the training and skill and competency to make those judgments and decisions, or whether the decisions will be made by accountants in the insurance companies or the HMOs. That is really the basis of this whole debate and discussion. That is why virtually every leading health care organization, virtually every major professional health organization--the spokesmen and spokeswomen for children, for women's health, for the disabled, and for the patients' coalitions--has universally supported our proposal. 
   It is not, certainly, because it says ``Democrat'' on it. These organizations support measures on the basis of the merits, whether they are proposed by Democrats or Republicans. 
   There is uniformity among the various groups and organizations that the basic, fundamental issue of who decides what is medically necessary is really at the heart of the whole debate. It is reflected in different ways, as we illustrated in the course of the discussion over the past few days and today, but that is basically what is at the core of this proposition. 
   The Democratic leader indicated that if we took up the Republican proposal that was passed out of committee on a party-line vote--even though we had more than 20 amendments at that time dealing with the substance of the issues--we would limit our side to 20 amendments. He indicated he would be willing to limit discussion of these various amendments to a reasonable time period, expecting the opposition would have similar amendments. 
   Frankly, though, if the Republicans have the opportunity to put their bill before the Senate, I do not understand why they would need a great many more amendments. They already have their bill. If we had our bill before the Senate, we would not have to have a great many amendments because it is our bill. I think we can all understand the logic of that. If we have a particular proposal before us, we ought to be able to debate the changes that may be offered from the other side. 
   The other side has the right, their right as the majority, to lay their bill down. So when we say we need 20 amendments and they say they will need 20 as well, I do not quite follow that. But so be it. 
   I think we will find from the discussions taking place at the leadership  level, and I heard the exchanges last evening, I heard from our leader he was prepared to move ahead. He urged there be cooperation by all Members. That certainly would be the case, I know, for those who are most involved in the Patients' Bill of Rights. They would be willing to expedite consideration of various appropriations bills with the understanding we will have an opportunity to debate this issue in a reasonable period of time with a chance to offer amendments. 
   We will hold the Senate accountable to answer the questions 
   that parents have about their children and medical care: Will you will be able to get specialty care when a child has special needs, or just be given access to a general pediatrician? Will you get a pediatric oncologist if the child has cancer? What about access to new prescription drugs? Will children and others have access to the clinical trials? 
   The opposition fails to mention that gap in their program. The most they do about it is to include a study about clinical trials. I think most American families understand the importance of clinical trials in their family's life experience or their health care. They may not have been part of a clinical trial themselves--although my family has, my son has, and very successfully, I will add. But I doubt if there is a family that does not have a member of their extended family who has not been involved in those programs. 
   Patients need to have access to necessary prescription drugs. This is so important to many different groups in our society: those challenged with mental illness, those with disabilities or other chronic conditions. There are many in our communities who require those essential prescriptions drugs. We do not see those guarantees in the Republican plan. There was reference to those: They will get access to those--but at exorbitant prices. They didn't mention that. They said: We'll make sure they have access to those drugs--but the plan can charge exorbitant prices. 
   We will have an opportunity to come back to the issue on prescription drugs, though probably not on this piece of legislation. But there are important guarantees which we provide in our Patients' Bill of Rights. We will come back to those measures. They are important. 
   I will say a few words now about the subject matter that will be included in the amendment offered by the Senator from California. It will deal with medical necessity. This is an interesting concept, because it reaches the heart of this issue, this debate. When consumers sign up for health care coverage, they assume, I think--it is not presumptuous to assume this--they assume they will be able to get from their doctors and their health care facilities the best care that the medical profession has to offer. Right? Wrong. Our bill will ensure that the best care is given. Their bill does not. 
   You say: I do not understand that. Let me clarify it. The Republican legislation that was reported out of the Health committee permits the HMO to decide what is medically necessary. They let the HMOs decide what is medically necessary. Then, when you have a certain illness and your doctor believes you should receive X, Y, or Z treatment, but the HMO defines ``medical necessity'' in a particular way, your doctor is restricted in the kind of treatment they can give you to whatever it says in the particular contract. 
   I do not think most consumers, when they sign up for health insurance, look into or read the various definitions in those contracts. You have scores of different definitions, each allowing for abusive actions that can have devastating effects on the health of patients across the country. 
   We have one included in here from a HMO that happens to be in Missouri. This is what it says: X company, I will not mention the name here, will have the sole discretion to determine whether care is medically necessary. Here it is--a small provision in the contract that an individual may never see. 
   If they came in and said: The doctor says you may very well need to have this kind of treatment. 
   And then the HMO says: Oh, no, they do not need that treatment, it is too expensive. 
   And the patient says: Why? Is that in my best interests of my best health? 
   Maybe the doctor will say: Yes. 
   Then the person says to the HMO: My doctor says it is in the best interest of my health to have that treatment. 
   Then the HMO says: Let me tell you something. Our definition of what is medically necessary for you is in the sole discretion of our HMO. We say you don't need that treatment. You signed that contract, and that is what you are going to get. 
   Then the person says: I appeal. I appeal this. I appeal. I want the best. 
   Under the Republican proposal--listen to this--the HMOs will decide who will listen to that appeal. They will also decide that appeal on the basis of what the contract says. That person gets an appeal, and then it goes to their HMO. The appeal officer looks at this and says: Here it is, it is their sole discretion whether care is medically necessary. And that is it; you are out. 
   Then that person says: Maybe I will bring a case. Let's get this out into the courts. This is absolutely outrageous. It is violating the basic, common law of good medical treatment. 
   The patient does not get to the courts. It is nonappealable under the Republican proposal. You are stuck there, your child is stuck there, and your wife may be stuck there. A member of your family is stuck there. 
   What does our bill do? It says that plans must use the best evidence and practices to determine what is medically necessary. It uses the best up-to-date scientific information or, if that is not available, clinical practices. 
   At a hearing in our committee earlier this year, there was some question about the definition and the use of various words in our proposal. We said: You develop the words. We have tried to take those words, which have been recommended by the best practitioners and by the medical associations, and put those in the bill. If the opposition has better words, we welcome them, we will embrace them, we will include them. Work with us, and we will work with you. Do they understand what we are trying to get at? We want to ensure that any individual who signs up with a plan is going to get what professionals in a particular field believe is in their best interest. 
   I have in my hand 30 definitions of what is medically necessary, depending on the HMO. Why should American citizens play roulette, and allow their health care to depend on which HMO they are a member of? That is what is happening. 
   Is this such a revolutionary idea? It is not. This basic concept has been supported not only by the medical societies, the medical associations, nurses associations, but countless other patient groups and others. The only people who oppose it are those who seek to preserve the status quo. It is similar to what is used to treat our parents and our grandparents under Medicare, and we do not hear any complaints about it. 
   I ask any Member on the other side to bring in a single letter which demonstrates how that best standard of medically necessary is either being abused or not effective for those people under Medicare. Bring them in. Shouldn't that be the answer? Mr. President, 39 million Americans are being treated that way. Bring in the examples. I will give my colleagues examples on the other side. Let's debate that issue. Let the Senate decide. I will give my colleagues examples. 
   If my colleagues want to take a little time, I will go right through these and let the Senate hear this debate. 
   They may say on the other side: Is that some new idea, some crazy Democratic concept? We know it is being used today to treat our parents. They welcome it. It is good and sound. 
   We want to make sure people are protected. That is what we are concerned with. That is why this issue reaches the heart of the whole debate and why the whole question of medical necessity is of such importance. 
   If that is not a core factor, if we do not have the best judgments guiding what is medically necessary, and if we do not 
   have the assurance this is going to protect the doctor to make that judgment, then this legislation is not worth the paper on which it is written. 
   We can name any bill a Patients' Bill of Rights. But if it has a medical necessity definition that is so construed as to deny people adequate protection or that and they are able to question the doctor giving the best information on the best medical process and procedure,  we are not giving those assurances that the consumers of this country need and deserve, and we will not avoid the human tragedies which we have heard mentioned day after day in the Senate. We hear instance after instance where timely treatment is being denied because doctors are not able to practice what is medically necessary. 
   This is the heart of this debate today. I can mention some other definitions. I see other colleagues in the Chamber who want to address the Senate. I am going to come back and review with the Senate some other definitions that have been included in the HMOs and how they have worked in ways which have been tragic to the medical profession. 
   I have a definition from another major HMO, one of the largest in the country. I am not interested in using names, but I will be glad to if Members are questioning this issue. This is their definition in use today:  
   Health care services that are appropriate and consistent with the diagnosis in accordance with accepted medical standards and which are likely to result in demonstrable medical benefit and which are--  
   Listen to this--  
   the least costly of alternatives.  
   There it is, ``least costly of alternatives.'' Not what is in the best interest of the patient, not what can save that person's life, not what can reduce pain and suffering and offer the best hope and opportunity for the future but which is least costly. 
   Here is another HMO. This is the definition of medical necessity in another very prominent HMO:  
   ..... the shortest, least expensive or least intensive level of treatment, care or services rendered or supplies provided.  
   How many Americans, when they go in to look at their HMOs and sign that contract, say: Look, I have a health insurance proposal. Look what it's going to do. It's going to cover me and going to cover my family and going to cover my children, and going to cover my wife. This is what it's going to cost. This is what the drug benefit is. 
   How many are going to look at the fine lines and look into ``medical necessities'' and are going to wonder whether they are using the most modern and comprehensive care for ``medical necessity.'' Virtually none of them are going to. That is why we have so many examples of the kinds of tragedies that have been mentioned. We will talk about those later in the day. 
   I see my friend and colleague from California. We all look forward to hearing from her on the amendment she will be proposing. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my friend from Illinois and others who have spoken before the Senate on the issue of the Patients' Bill of Rights, which, translated into layman's terms, means legislation that will give assurance to all Americans who are fortunate enough to have health insurance policies that medical decisions are being made by trained professional medical personnel and not by insurance company agents. 
   That is the underlying concept of this legislation, as has been pointed out during the course of the morning with the examples that have been given, and there are scores more. If we get the chance during the debate on the provisions, hopefully later in the afternoon, we will be able to review the various protections that we are attempting to achieve and why they are important to the children and families of this country. 
   Under the Republican program, there is a guarantee of getting direct access to a pediatrician for a child, but if that child has cancer, there is no guarantee the child will see a pediatric oncologist. Or if one has a disability, there is no guarantee that person will have access to the needed specialists. The guarantee they will have the best care available is important to patients, and there is no country which has better quality health care. 
   We have a challenge nationwide regarding access to health care, and we have a challenge nationwide in terms of the cost of health care, particularly in a number of different areas. One that comes to mind now is the issue of prescription drugs. We are going to have an opportunity, hopefully in this Congress, to address that issue. 
   On the issue of what we call quality, meaning that patients are going to get the best health coverage in terms of recommendations made by the professionals who have been trained and who have a wealth of experience in this area, we are trying to make sure that every medical decision will be based upon sound and meaningful medical teaching and experience. 
   That is the heart of this legislation. It is very important we get this kind of protection. Otherwise, we will continue to have today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow the tragic circumstances we have experienced and are being experienced in communities and towns all over this country. 
   Earlier in the day, we had some important statements and speeches by our colleagues. Senator FEINSTEIN talked about a provision making sure every health insurance proposal has as its basis of treatment the best in terms of medical necessity. The best that is available will be the standard used in providing treatment for individuals. 
   I took some time earlier today and illustrated how different health insurance programs have different definitions. Sometimes a definition works to the advantage of the HMO and works to the advantage of the insurance company but to the disadvantage of the individual. Such a definition can even threaten the life of that individual. 
   It may be favorable to the HMO regarding its bottom line financially, but it certainly is not favorable to the patient. We ought to be about the business of doing what is important for the patient. 
   Senator FEINSTEIN has talked about this issue very eloquently and persuasively today. That certainly would be an area that we ought to be able to debate and discuss. I do not believe we have that kind of standard with the language which is included in the provision being advanced by our Republican friends. 
   It is not only my opinion that this is important, but it is the opinion of the health practitioners in this country--the doctors, the American Medical Association, the nurses, the various specialists. They are concerned that the Republican proposal does not provide a good standard to protect the health and safety of children, of women, of patients in our country. 
   We ought to be able to debate that issue. It is a very important issue. Senator FEINSTEIN has spoken eloquently about that particular problem. But we cannot. We are virtually prohibited from being able to do so. We cannot even get this measure up. We were told yesterday to either take the whole package or we were not going to get anything at all. That has been repeated time in and time out. There appears to be the continuation of that policy now by the Republican leadership--delay and deny, delay and deny. 
   Then later we had the excellent statement that was made by our colleague and friend, Senator MIKULSKI, who was talking about the importance of the kinds of protections that are guaranteed in our Patients' Bill of Rights, particularly with regard to women and children. 
   She very eloquently pointed out how these gatekeepers who are part of these HMOs--the gatekeeper being the person who ultimately dictates to the doctor what they can effectively prescribe in terms of treatment and in terms of medicines--makes those medical judgments and decisions. That is what is happening out there; and that is startling. 
   People can say, well, that really isn't happening in America. It is happening. We have given examples of the devastating results that occur as a result of that kind of interference. She illustrated the importance of having those kinds of specialists who are particularly trained and understand the particular needs of women and children. 
   She talked from her own personal experience in a very significant and important way about how she had a gallbladder operation and was able to stay in the hospital in order to recover. But if a woman had a mastectomy--and she used the word ``amputation'' because she said that is what a mastectomy is --she would still be required to leave the hospital that same day. She reminded us about the unsuccessful efforts we made in the committee to try to alter and close that gap in the Republican bill. It makes no sense how those efforts were defeated. 
   It seems to me we ought to be able to have some debate. I do not think that issue would take a long period of time. I thought that Senator MIKULSKI, in about an 8- or 10-minute presentation, made a presentation that was powerful and convincing and compelling. 
   Maybe there is a good argument on the other side. We certainly have not  heard it yet. We never heard it in the committee when we were marking this bill up. We did not hear one. So maybe there is an argument on the other side that we haven't heard yet. A woman who is going to have a mastectomy ought to be under the care of the doctor, and the doctor and the patient ought to decide whether that person can leave the hospital that day or ought to be there 1 or 2 or 3 more days. Leave it up to the doctors and their recommendations. That is not permitted under the majority's bill. 
   We heard a great deal of talk about that. That is not in the bill that is the Republican proposal. The specific amendment that the Senator talked about on the Senate floor would be an amendment that we ought to be able to debate. We ought to be able to debate why it is not in the Republican bill that will eventually, 
   hopefully, be laid down before the Senate. 
   There is not that protection for women in this country. There is not that protection that will permit the doctor to make a judgment about how long it will be medically necessary to keep that woman in the hospital if she has a mastectomy. That protection is not there. It was defeated when it was offered. 
   Let's have a brief debate on that issue, and let's have the call of the roll. Why is it we are being denied that today? Why is it we are being foreclosed from that kind of an opportunity? Why is it we cannot have the kind of debate in relation to the excellent presentation that the Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, made, the excellent presentation that the Senator from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, made on two different kinds of phases? 
   Yesterday we talked with our Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, about the importance of clinical trials and the necessary aspects of increasing the clinical trials. Historically, the insurance companies of this country have basically supported clinical trials. There is a very good reason why they should, because--besides the medical reason that it is important for the patient--if the person gets better they will not need as many services, and that means the insurance company will pay out less in the long run. That is something that should be a financial incentive for the insurance companies; and it is. 
   Let me repeat that. While clinical trials make sense in terms of the treatment for the patient, they make sense for the insurance companies, too. But what we are seeing, under the health maintenance organizations, is the gradual squeeze and decline in terms of the insurance companies' payments for routine health needs of the particular patients. 
   Under our proposal, they would only pay for routine costs, as they have historically. The research regime pays for the special kinds of attention, treatment, and tests that are necessary in order to review whether that particular pharmaceutical drug or other therapy is useful or not. That is not paid for by the insurance companies. So they only have to pay for the routine health needs--the costs that they would pay for even in the absence of a clinical trial. The regime, the testing group or organization or pharmaceutical company that is having that clinical trial, pays for the rest. 
   But what we are seeing is virtually the beginning of the collapse of clinical research taking place. I will just make a final point on this issue. The group that has had the greatest amount of clinical research done on them in this country has been children. The greatest progress that has been made in the battle for cancer has been--where?--with children. 
   Most of the clinical researchers who have reviewed this whole question of our efforts on cancer would make the case that one of the principal reasons that we have made the greatest progress in the war on cancer in children, in extending their lives and improving their human condition, is because of these clinical trials. 
   We want to continue to encourage participation in clinical trials. They offer hope for the future. If the doctor says this is what is necessary for the life and the health of a woman who has cancer, that this is the one way she may be able to save her life, and there is a clinical trial available, we want to be able to say she ought to be able to go there. The opposition says: Let's study it. I say: Let's vote on it. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If I understand the Republican proposal, if you had a child, for example, with cancer, and you had a pediatrician, but what you needed was an oncologist for that child, one who is a specialist in pediatrics, and the HMO denied you that, and you believed this was enormously important for the treatment for the child, under the Republican proposal you have no right to appeal that particular decision. I understand that the right to an independent appeal applies only to certain decisions, and a denial of access to a specialist is not one of them. I believe I am correct. 
   We heard our wonderful friend, Dr. FRIST, yesterday talk about how any child who had cancer would be guaranteed a specialist and everybody said: Doesn't that do the trick? No. 
   We know you need not just a pediatrician, but as the Senator from Rhode Island knows--as one who has been a leader in the Senate on children's issues regarding access, and has introduced special legislation on this--that child needs a pediatric oncologist. That kind of specialist is absolutely crucial, if that child is to have a fighting chance; but denial of access to that particular specialist would not be eligible for appeal under the majority's program.

To the best of my recollection, the good Senator from California, Senator FEINSTEIN, has been here since 10 o'clock this morning, prepared to go ahead and introduce her amendment and has still not been able to do it. There has been an extension of the time limits, evidently because of some negotiations about which all of us are hopeful. But I think we probably could have disposed of the amendment of the Senator and probably the proposal of the Senator from Rhode Island also. I do not know whether the Senator would agree with me or not.

Mr. President, I'm delighted that the managers' amendment includes the provision Senator GORDON SMITH, Senator LEAHY, and I sponsored to require the State Department to report on progress on the July 2000 referendum in the Western Sahara, and I commend Senators HELMS and BIDEN for including this provision in the managers' amendment. 
   Since 1988, the United Nations has sought to organize a free, fair, and open referendum on self-determination for the people of the Western Sahara, the former Spanish colony that Morocco has illegally occupied since 1975. 
   The International Court of Justice, the Organization of African Unity, the United States, and many other nations throughout the world have not recognized Morocco's claim to the area. However, Morocco's occupation continues. Tens of thousands of the Sahrawi people languish in refugee camps in southern Algeria and have been denied the opportunity to determine their own future.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, now we are back to where we were yesterday just about 24 hours ago. At the request of the Democratic leader, the  amendment on the Patients' Bill of Rights was submitted to the Senate as an amendment on the appropriations bill yesterday afternoon. The majority leader then offered an amendment to that amendment, which was effectively the legislation that was passed out of the Health and Education committee some 3 months ago and the tax provisions from the Senate Republican leadership proposal. That is an amendment to Senator DASCHLE's proposal. 
   We have this measure now before the Senate. Many of us over the last 2 years have tried to gain the opportunity to debate what we call the Patients' Bill of Rights. The underlying concept of the Patients' Bill of Rights is very simple and very straightforward. Our legislation has the strong and compelling support of over 200 organizations all across this country. Medical decisions that affect the members of our families ought to be made by doctors--by professional, trained medical personnel--and the patients. They ought to be the ones that make the decisions that are going to affect our lives and the lives of our families, our grandparents, and our children. Those decisions should not be made by an insurance agent, or by an HMO official. 
   This is a very basic and fundamental concept, and all of the basic measures--the proposals--that are advanced in our Patients' Bill of Rights, which was introduced by Senator DASCHLE, reflect this concept. The Republican proposal does not address this critically important concept. I call the Republican proposal the ``patients' bill of wrongs.'' They use the right words in their title, but that's it. Their bill doesn't guarantee that these decisions are going to be made by the doctors and nurses and by the trained medical professionals. 
   The Members of this body do not have to take what I say on this interpretation of the Republican proposal. The fact remains that we have been waiting and waiting and waiting for well over a year, or for close to 2 years, to hear from our Republican friends about the medical associations or the medical professionals that support their proposal. Let's be clear, we don't advance this proposal because we are Democrats. We advance it because it will protect consumers and families in this country. 
   It isn't that I say it, or that Senator DASCHLE says it, or that any of our colleagues say it. It is because the doctors in this country say it. The American Medical Association says it. The American Nurses Associations says it. The consumer organizations that have been dedicated to protecting patients have said it. 
   If you look over the list of those various groups that are supporting our particular proposal, you will find that virtually every organization that represents women's health care support our legislation, and for very good reasons, which we will outline today. Virtually every leading group that has dedicated itself to protecting the well-being of children in our society and the health care of children are supporting our proposal. Why? For very good reasons, which have been outlined before by Senator DASCHLE, Senator REED and those of us who support helping children. You will find that virtually every organization in this country that is concerned about the needs of the disabled in our society is supporting our program. Virtually every group that is concerned about cancer and cancer research is supporting our particular proposal. And virtually none are supporting the opposition's proposal. 
   This is something that the American consumers ought to understand. This is something the American consumers ought to realize. 
   I see our leader on the floor at this time. I think all of us are looking forward to listening to his presentation. 
   I yield the floor at this time and will come back and address the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows full well, we can take one example. There are many, and we will come back to those later in the afternoon. But the Senator has been a strong supporter in terms of increasing the NIH research budget and has followed the various recommendations so that hopefully we are going to double the NIH research budget. Our Republican colleagues have supported this proposal. Senator MACK and Senator SPECTER have been leaders. Senator HARKIN has been one of the important leaders. Many other Members have supported that proposal. Why? Because it is universally accepted that we are in the early morning sunrise period of major scientific breakthroughs on many of the kinds of diseases that affect millions of our fellow citizens. 
   This year, more than 563,000 will die from cancer, and 1.2 million will be diagnosed. We have these enormous potential breakthroughs that can mean the difference between life and death. These breakthrough treatments allow individuals some degree of hope of being freed from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease or cancer. Every medical researcher understands that. That is why they support the access to clinical trials piece in our proposal. When they have the breakthrough in the laboratory, they want to get it to the bedside. The way that is done is through clinical trials. 
   Under the Daschle proposal, we would continue the traditional support for clinical trials so that we can move these breakthroughs that are coming in the laboratory to the patients, to the mothers, and to the daughters, and to others.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. 
   If I could add to what the Senator has said, we have made great progress in dealing with cancer, especially children's cancers, over the last 10 years. The principal reason for this progress is the large number of clinical trials. We should take the time to spell out what has actually happened in the clinical trials and why that is an important provision of the leader's Patients' Bill of Rights.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, I will speak from a personal point of view. My son was 12 years old when he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, bone cancer. Chances of survival were 15 percent; the mortality rate was 85 percent. We were able to enroll my son in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial, which only 22 children had gone through successfully. He was in that program for 2 years. By the time he finished, they had more than 400 children taking part in that program who survived osteosarcoma, with a breakthrough new treatment for osteosarcoma. Seven thousand children are affected every single year. At that time, the loss of a leg was a matter of course; it is not at the present time. 
   There is no question that not only my son but many of the other children would not likely have survived had they not participated in the clinical trial. That treatment for osteosarcoma is now the standard treatment and is saving countless children's lives. 
   There are many other examples. Our greatest progress in cancer research  and in treating cancer has been a direct result of clinical trials.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Not only am I saying that, but most important is that the directors of the Lombardi Cancer Research Center, located here in Washington, DC, one of the major centers in the country in cancer research programs and clinical trials, is saying that as well. The director says they employ eight professionals who work 18 hours a day combating health maintenance organizations to help enroll women in breast cancer clinical trials. Doctors have recommended patients for clinical trials, with treatment that can probably save their lives, but due to resistance and denials by the health maintenance organizations, those women are effectively denied treatment that may save their lives. That is happening today. 
   As the Senator knows, all we are trying to do with this particular proposal is follow sound medical guidelines, the medical guidelines that your doctor--who may be an oncologist acting on behalf of a victim of breast cancer--believes, given the clinical trials taking place, providing you a real chance of surviving if we enlist you in the clinical trial; this is in your medical best interest. 
   Your bill says your physician's medical determination is going to be the controlling judgment. It isn't going to be an accountant in the HMO who says: We don't believe that treatment is justified and we are not prepared to pay for it; I am making the medical judgment--even though I am trained as an accountant.

   The interesting question I ask the Senator, if these protections were such burdens on the delivery system, doesn't the Senator think he would have heard? These protections are available today, for those who are covered with Medicaid or Medicare. The other side in opposition to the Daschle proposal is always saying these protections are burdening the system, and we can't protect all Americans because it will burden the system? 
   The Senator has made the correct point. We do it today in Medicaid. We do it in Medicare. We do it for Federal employees. Most of the good HMOs do it. It is the bad apples that are threatening the well-being and the health of many of the citizens in our States whose procedures we need to address.

   Mr. KENNEDY. May I just make this point? Access to emergency care, which is carefully protected in the leader's legislation, does the leader know that the provisions in his legislation were almost unanimously supported in the President's Commission on Quality Care? The one exception is the President's Commission did not make the recommendation that it be put in law, although they said every quality health maintenance organization ought to have it. 
   Second, the American Association of Health Plans has recommended it.  They do not mandate it, but they recommend it, saying it is essential in providing care. 
   The National Association of Insurance Commissioners--not a Democratic group, the majority of Insurance Commissioners are probably Republicans--has recommended it for the States. They say, in the States, as a matter of good quality health care, they ought to have the provisions which are in our Patients' Bill of Rights. As the Senators have pointed out, it has been included in Medicare. 
   So this proposal, which was offered and defeated in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, should be a matter where we have an opportunity to present it and let the Senate make a judgment. As I mentioned, it has been recommended by the nonpartisan commission. It has been recommended by the independent insurance commissioners. It is in Medicare. We would like to hear on the floor of the Senate those individuals who are opposed, those individuals who say no to this particular protection. That is the kind of protection that is included in the Daschle proposal, which is of such importance. 
   Mr. President, I see others want to speak on this proposal. 
   In looking down this list of protections, you can ask yourselves: Where do these protections really come from? As I mentioned, the protections we have put into the Daschle proposal 
   are effectively the ones supported by the President's commission, the American Association for Health Plans, and the Insurance Commissioners. It is in Medicare. It is working, and it is working effectively. We do not have examples that protecting those under Medicare is a burden, and I do not think those who are opposed to that particular proposal can make an effective case in opposition to this provision. 
   I will take the time later to mention two or three more protections. Virtually every one of these protections is either part of a recommendation from the President's commission, part of the recommendations of the American Association of Health Plans, recommended by the state Insurance Commissioners, or is being implemented and protecting persons covered under Medicare. 
   These are commonsense proposals. They are not protections we have suddenly grabbed from some way-out organization or group. They are fundamentally rooted in sound health care practices. That is the case we want to bring to the floor of the Senate. 
   I see my colleague and friend on the floor now, wishing to speak. I will be back to address the Senate shortly.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Given that this patient is denied the treatment that can make all the difference in restoring his health or well-being, and given that we have heard examples where, as a result of denying that treatment, a decision made by the health maintenance organization despite the recommendations of the medical professional--can the Senator tell me the remedies available? What remedies are available to a family whose loved one dies or whose loved one sustains a permanent injury because a judgment was made by the insurance company or the HMO, in conflict with the recommendation by the treating doctor. What remedy is available to that family that loses its breadwinner or has to care for an individual who is permanently injured for the rest of their life? What remedy is available for the family who loses a loved one due to the negligence or the clear malfeasance of the insurance company or the HMO?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Further, is the Senator suggesting that this is the only area in civil law that a remedy is really being denied on the basis of real negligence, malfeasance? Are these the only companies in America that have this sort of privileged position of being free from what I think most Americans would understand as accountability? Is that what the Senator is suggesting?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Finally--because I see others on the floor; and this issue is going to be addressed in the Daschle proposal--I am wondering whether the Senator would agree with Justice William Young, a Federal judge on the Federal bench in Massachusetts, who was appointed by President Ronald Reagan, who said, after a very tragic case--and I will not review all of the facts here, but it was quite clear that there was responsibility by the insurance companies; and it will be self-evident in his quote; and there was 
   a real injustice done--this is what Judge William Young, appointed by President Reagan, who prior to the time he  served on the bench was a Republican, said:  
   Disturbing to this Court is the failure of Congress to amend a statute that, due to the changing realities of the modern health care system, has gone conspicuously awry from its original intent. This Court has no choice but to pluck the case out of State court ..... and then, at the behest of Travelers [Insurance Company]--  
   That is effectively the culprit--  
   slam the courthouse door in [the wife's] face and leave her without any remedy. ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity that protects health insurers ..... from potential liability for the consequences of their wrongful denial of health benefits.  
   That is the statement from the bench of a distinguished Federal judge who came down and eventually effectively testified about the injustice of this provision. As I understand it, the Daschle proposal addresses that inequity and unfairness, which the Senator has outlined.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the Senator knows, they have independent review. We have it under the Medicare proposal. It works. It works very effectively. It works pretty well. It is somewhat different in scope than was included in the Daschle proposal. I favor this one here, but there is an independent review. But not only in that measure, we have some 23 million Americans who are working for State and local governments that have the kind of protection that is favored in the Daschle proposal, and it is working very effectively. 
   One of the very important programs that has the kind of protections the Senator has favored and that I favor is what they call the Calpurse Program in the State of California, which has well over a million individuals who are part of that program with the kind of protections that are supported by the Senator. 
   What they have found out--we will have a chance to get into this, hopefully, at the time we get a debate on it--is that the cost of that whole program has not increased as much as the increase in health insurance nationwide, or even in the programs in California that do not have that protection. 
   Do you want to know why, Senator, I believe that is so? For the same reason we had the expert witnesses who appeared before Senator SPECTER's Appropriations Committee; and that is, because the HMOs take more time and attention to make sure the patients are going to get better kinds of health care and health care coverage. That basically means they are able to get a better handle on the cost. 
   So it makes a major difference in terms of the quality of health care, and it makes a major difference in terms of the protections of individuals. 
   I thank the Senator for his response.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, with regard to just one fact that the Senator has mentioned, I have the GAO report to which the Senator refers. The fact that the Senator refers and is talking about is on page 4 of the report. It says:  
   If premiums increase by 1 percent only for some insurance types (for example, HMOs), then the coverage loss predicted by the Lewin Group to .....  
   Not the GAO, it is the Lewin Group that makes the estimate referred to in the GAO letter. 
   To the contrary, if you read on, GAO says:  
   Because many factors can affect the number of individuals covered by private insurance, it is difficult to predict the impact of an increase in insurance premiums. For example, new mandates may increase premiums but may also change individuals' willingness to purchase insurance.  
   Therefore, there might be more people covered. 
   This is the kind of thing we ought to be debating out here. This is just the type of thing we ought to be debating. We have a lot of distortions and misrepresentations. The insurance companies themselves have spent $100 million  in distorting our proposal. What we want to do is to try to clarify the RECORD on this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just mention one other point, the Senator talked about what we wanted to do last year with regard to the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I have in my hand the majority leader's unanimous consent request. Here it is. This is an offer from last June 18, a little over a year ago, when we were trying to bring this legislation up.  
   I ask unanimous consent that prior to the August recess .....  
   Isn't that interesting? June of last year; they are saying ``prior to the August recess.''  
   ..... the majority leader after notifying the minority leader shall turn to the consideration of the bill to be introduced by the majority leader .....  
   It doesn't tell us what that is going to be.  
   ..... or his designee regarding health care. I further ask that the Senate proceed to its immediate consideration.  
   And following the report by the clerk that Senator DASCHLE be recognized to offer as a substitute the text of S. 1891, which really wasn't the all-inclusive legislation, the majority leader is trying to tell the Democratic leader which bill he ought to put in.  
   I further ask that during the consideration of the health care legislation it be in order for Members to offer health care amendments in the first and second degree. I further ask consent that the Chair not enter a motion to adjourn or recess for the August recess prior to a vote or in relation to the majority leader's bill and the minority leader's amendment, and following those votes it be in order for the majority leader return to the legislation to the calendar.  
   To the calendar--not send it over to the House of Representatives--to the calendar. 
   Let's be clear about who is serious about bringing this up. Here is their consent request. They are going to return it to the calendar. Even if we win the vote, under their proposal, that could be the end of it. 
   Then it says:  
   Finally, I ask consent that it not be in order to offer any legislation, motion, or amendment relative to health care prior to the initiation of this agreement and following the execution of the agreement.  
   Therefore, you can't offer a health care measure for the rest of the Congress. 
   If the Senator from Vermont can say with a straight face that it is the Democrats who are trying to lock this thing up when the Senator has his own leader making a proposal like this, he is defying any kind of rational understanding of what a unanimous consent rule is.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to reserve the last 20 seconds, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, to listen to my friends on the other side, you would think that you were hearing the talking points written by the insurance industry: It costs too much. 
   Here is the CBO report: 4.8 percent for average premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance over 5 years. For the sake of this exercise, call it 5 percent. Say a families' premium is $5,000. That is $250 over 5 years. Allocate that in terms of employer-employee, and you will find that the cost paid by an employee is around the cost of a Big Mac each month. This  is a buy to ensure that you are going to have the protections in our legislation. 
   We hear about all the things that their program is doing. But the one thing that Senator FRIST left out is that they are only covering a third of all of Americans. They are leaving out more than 110 million Americans. If this plan is so good, why not include everyone? 
   For those that are so concerned about the cost, I hope they are going to explain where they are getting the money that the Joint Tax Committee says their proposal will cost. Their medical savings accounts alone--which are little more than a tax shelter for the rich--are $4.2 billion over the next 7 years. But they don't say how they will pay for it in their proposal. 
   They are concerned about cost? Why are they expanding that tax loophole? Why aren't they at least jawboning the insurance companies to hold down the 6 to 10 percent increase that we see in the insurance premiums every year just to increase profits? 
   Every single provision of the Republican bill is riddled with loopholes. It is a bill that only an insurance company accountant could like. As this debate proceeds, we will expose those loopholes. 
   Mr. President, one of the ways you know a person is by who their friends are. Our friends in this debate are the 200 groups that represent the doctors and nurses--the health delivery professionals--and consumers. Not a single organization supports the opposition. 
   If our amendment is tabled, it is a vote against children, a vote against families, a vote against women; it is a vote against every individual with a serious health problem, and it is a vote in favor of mismanaged care and a vote in favor of placing insurance company profits ahead of patient care. I hope the motion to table Senator DASCHLE's amendment is defeated. 
   I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the issue that is before us with the proposal that Senator DASCHLE has advanced is a very basic and fundamental one: Who ought to be making the decisions on your health care? 
   The whole concept behind the Daschle proposal is that we should let the medical professional guide that judgment--the doctor, nurse and patient together. That ought to be the basis of the judgment--not an accountant, not an insurance company official. That is really at the heart of this whole legislation. Our legislation protects that and preserves it. 
   The other legislation that is reported out of our committee fails to do it. That is why we have the support of the health care professionals and they do not. I hope we will have the opportunity to at least debate these various issues in an orderly way. That is what this battle is about. I hope that we will be able to continue with a reasonable procedure to permit the Senate to make a judgment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in recent decades, the nation's schools have made great progress in ensuring that young girls receive an equitable education. Gender gaps in math and science performance have narrowed. More girls are taking algebra, geometry, pre-calculus, trigonometry, and calculus than ever before. More girls are taking honors and advanced placement level courses in calculus and chemistry. 
   Schools are making progress in other areas as well. More and more schools are instituting programs to address the problems of sexual harassment and abuse. Increasing numbers of girls are participating in high school athletics and receiving college athletic scholarships. 
   While these improvements are commendable, they are not enough. Continued progress is necessary. The Educating America's Girls Act addresses  some of the most pressing issues in educational equity: access to technology, school safety, high school athletics, and dropout rates. 
   Technology education is particularly important for all students, but girls' needs are particularly acute. While gaps between boys and girls in math and science are narrowing, the gender gap in technology is growing. 
   Girls tend to come to the classroom with less exposure to computers and other technology than boys. Girls often believe that they are less adept at using technology than boys are. They tend to be more cautious than boys in the ways that they interact with technology. 
   Girls are also dramatically under-represented in advanced computer science courses, making them less eligible than boys for high wage, high-tech jobs. The fact that girls are less likely than boys to take advanced computer science courses actually helps perpetuate a cycle of disadvantage in educational technology. Because fewer girls will have the skills to enter high-tech fields, fewer women will be developers of educational software and fewer role models will be available for young girls. 
   For girls to have equal access to the growing job market in the computer field, immediate steps must be taken to close the technology gap between boys and girls. The Educating America's Girls Act addresses problems with girls' access to technology by providing professional development to assist teachers in dealing more effectively with the technology needs of girls. It gives local and state governments and private and pubic schools and institutions of higher education the opportunity to meet their needs in their applications for federal grants. Finally, the Act states that the Title III provisions authorizing support for development of education technology must give special consideration to programs incorporating the technology learning needs of girls. 
   School safety is another concern for America's girls. Recent studies reveal that 85 percent of girls have experienced some form of sexual harassment. Sixty-five percent of girls who have been harassed were harassed in the classroom, and 73 percent were harassed in school hallways. Eighty-one percent of girls who have been harassed do not report the harassment to an adult. Thirty-three percent of girls report not wanting to go to school because of anxiety and stress caused by harassment. Nearly one quarter of girls report staying home from school or cutting classes because of harassment. 
   These numbers are clearly unacceptable. It is imperative that our schools do a better job of recognizing and eradicating sexual harassment in schools. As the recent Supreme Court ruling in Davis v. Monroe County Board of Education makes clear, school districts may now be sued for damages if they fail to respond to student sexual harassment of other students. 
   The Educating America's Girl's Act provides $10 million for district level programs to train teachers and administrators in identifying and preventing sexual harassment. In addition, the Act makes high rates of sexual harassment in schools a consideration in determining the distribution of state grants for violence prevention programs. It also requires that sexual harassment and abuse prevention be among the activities included in a school's comprehensive drug and violence program. Finally, the Act requires the National Center for Educational Statistics to collect data on sexual harassment and abuse in schools as a means of identifying and addressing the problem more effectively. 
   The Act supports girls' participation in high school athletics. Since the passage of Title IX over a quarter century ago, increasing numbers of girls are participating in organized sports, although boys continue to participate at higher rates. 
   Studies show that girls who do so are emotionally and physically healthier than girls who do not. Involvement in sports can also lead to higher self-esteem and confidence, more positive attitudes toward school, an improved sense of physical well-being, social recognition in the school and community, and a reduction in destructive behavior. 
   In addition, higher rates of athletic participation for girls are associated with lower rates of sexual activity and pregnancy. Girls who participate in sports are also less likely to drop out of school and less likely to smoke cigarettes. Girls who engage in physical activity in high school are less likely to suffer from heart disease, breast cancer, and osteoporosis in late life. 
   Participation in sports also has a positive effect on students' academic performance. Students involved in sports and other extracurricular activities perform better on assessments in reading and mathematics. In addition, for many girls, high school athletic opportunities translate into college scholarships. 
   Although there is ample evidence that physical activity and athletics are beneficial to girls, they are less physically active and less involved in high school athletics than boys are. In order to determine in what ways girls are affected by athletic participation, it is vital that accurate data on girls' participation in physical education and high school athletics be collected and made available. Unfortunately, current nationwide data is limited, making it difficult to determine progress toward equity in athletics, as required by Title IX. The Act helps ensure that girls' interests are being met by requiring data collection on the participation of high school students, by gender, in physical education and athletics. 
   The Act also addresses concerns about the dropout rate among pregnant teenagers. Almost one million girls in America become pregnant each year, and 80 percent of these pregnancies are unintended. Education is the means for all girls, including pregnant and parenting teens, to achieve economic success. Yet girls who become pregnant as teenagers are most likely to drop out of school, jeopardizing not only their own economic security but that of their children as well. The younger a girl is when she becomes pregnant, the more likely she is to drop out. Two-thirds of girls who become pregnant before age 18 will not complete school. Girls who drop out of school are less likely to return than boys. While teenage pregnancy rates have declined in recent years, they are still too high and a reason for grave concern. 
   The Act focuses on the needs of pregnant and parenting teens by supporting mentoring and support programs that encourage girls who are pregnant or have children to stay in school. 
   It is also important that the Women's Educational Equity Act be reauthorized. WEEA stands for the federal commitment to help schools eradicate sex discrimination and ensure that girls' futures are not limited by their gender, but are determined by their interests, aspirations, and abilities. Since its enactment in 1974, it has provided critical support in combating inequitable educational practices. 
   It provides resources for teachers, administrators, and parents seeking proven methods to ensure equity in schools and communities. It provides materials and tools to help schools comply with Title IX. It provides research and model programs to back up Title IX's promise to students of a non-discriminatory education. 
   It helps girls become confident, educated, and self-sufficient women through projects to prevent teen pregnancy; to keep girls in school; to guide them toward careers in math, science, and technology; and to provide them with mentors. It has funded over 700 programs since 1974, including programs on math and science education and careers, sexual harassment, gender-biased teaching practices, and women's history. 
   The Educating America's Girls Act will continue all this vital work on behalf of girls and young women by reauthorizing the Women's Educational Equity Act. 
   Significant strides have been made in securing more equitable education for the nation's young women and girls, but we cannot afford to be complacent. We must keep moving forward to guarantee that girls are full participants in the economic and social development of our country. Measures to assure gender equity in education are a key means of accomplishing this goal. Passage of the Educating America's Girls Act is a vital next step for increasing gender equity in education.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will address the Senate this morning on a subject which I believe needs attention in the Senate and also needs action by this body, and that issue is the legislation called the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights is legislation which has been before the Senate for some 2 years. It is a rather simple bill. It is understandable. It is a rather commonsense bill. That is, we are, with this legislation, going to give assurances to the American people when they purchase insurance, that the medical profession, the doctors and the patients themselves, are going to make decisions related to the health care which affects them, rather than the accountants or insurance agents. 
   Basically, that is what this legislation is about. There are a number of guarantees and protections included in the Patients' Bill of Rights, which I have addressed on other occasions and which I, again, will mention this morning. 
   Every day we fail to take action on this legislation, we see what has happened in this country over the last 2 years; 
   the patients suffer, while our Republican leadership refuses to schedule this particular legislation. 
   During the 2 years that we have been blocked, effectively, from a Patients' Bill of Rights, HMO abuses have caused some 33 million patients difficulty in getting specialty referrals, delayed needed medical care for some 33 million patients, forced some 23 million patients to change their doctors, forced 14 million patients to change medications, denied payments for emergency services to 11 million patients--those are patients who use the emergency room, who felt they had a medical emergency but were denied the coverage from their HMO and had to pay for it out of their own pocket--and caused unnecessary suffering and financial loss and frustration for millions more.  
   Over these last days, as we did last year, we have pointed out not only numbers but also in real terms what is happening to families all across this country. For those supporting a Patients' Bill of Rights, which is the legislation introduced by Senator DASCHLE, he has stated--and others who support it have stated--that we are ready, willing and able to enter into time agreements, but we want to have this measure scheduled. We ought to be able to permit the Senate to vote on these measures. They are enormously important, as we have been reminded in the past days by my colleagues and others. 
   We spent 5 days on legislation protecting various computer companies in this country from the potential of a Y2K glitch. We believe that we would not even need that amount of time to debate legislation that will provide protections for families, for parents, for loved ones, for husbands and wives, and particularly for children. We make the case--I do today--that it is time for the Congress to act to protect the patients against the abuses of managed care. 
   Patients and doctors should make the medical decisions, not the insurance company accountants. Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. Members of the Senate know it. Doctors, nurses and other health care professionals know it. The American people know it. It is time for the Republican leadership to stop protecting the insurance company profits and start protecting patients. 
   I point out that we have more than 200 organizations that support our legislation. It isn't that we just want to advance some proposal that has been assembled by the members of our party; there are those in the other party, including Dr. GANSKE, a doctor who is a Republican, and others who support our proposal. But more than 200 organizations representing the medical profession--the nurses, the doctors, the consumers, those who have studied this program--favor our proposal. There isn't one--not one--we are still waiting to hear just one medical professional group that supports the Republican proposal. 
   We are prepared to debate. But the American people, and those who are involved in the health care delivery system, those who are involved in research, those who are involved in protecting children, those who are involved in protecting women, those who are involved in protecting the disabled, those who are at the cutting edge in advancing research, understand the importance of this debate, this discussion, and votes here in the Senate. 
   We think it is time that we get to the business of the families of this country by moving ahead and starting to have this measure before us. We have reviewed the proposal made by the Republican leadership. We are now 2 weeks before the July break. We believe we can handle this legislation prior to that period of time. We want this matter scheduled. We want to be able to move toward this debate. 
   I remember the comments that have been made in recent times by the Republican leadership: Well, we need to have a certain number of amendments. We can have two amendments, three amendments, four amendments, but we are not going to permit this matter to be 
   brought before the Senate unless we have a prior agreement for three or four amendments. 
   That was last year, and we are again being denied the opportunity to debate this legislation even though we had before the Senate, just a very few weeks ago, the juvenile justice bill. There was no limitation on the number of amendments at that time. We had many contested amendments during that debate on the issue of gun control. We had a series of amendments, but nonetheless we had action on that legislation. We debated it, and then we brought that measure to a close. We did it in the longstanding, 200-year tradition of the Senate. We believe that on a matter which is of fundamental importance and significance to families that we ought to follow that procedure and that we ought to move ahead on this legislation at this time. 
   During the past year and a half, the Republican leadership has effectively used every trick in the book to delay or deny action on this issue. It is no secret what is going on. Stonewalling tactics have stalled consideration of this legislation for more than a year. 
   It was just over a year ago, on June 18, 1998 that Senator LOTT proposed to bring up the bill on terms that made a mockery of the legislative process. That proposal would have allowed the Senate to proceed to HMO reform but permitted the majority leader to pull the bill down at any time. The agreement also barred the Senate from considering any other health care legislation for the rest of the year. 
   Do we understand--do the American people understand what was being proposed for debate in the consideration of a Patients' Bill of Rights? The majority leader said: Well, I'll bring it up, but I'll be able to pull it down if I want. And if we bring it up, we have to have the assurance that no other legislation dealing with health care would be permitted on the floor of the Senate. That was the proposal a year ago. Obviously, we were not willing to agree to that proposal because that was completely in conflict with the public's interest for debate and discussion about these matters. 
   On June 23 of last year, 43 Democratic Members wrote to Senator LOTT to urge that he allow a debate and votes on the merits of the Patients' Bill of Rights. We requested that the Senate address the issue before the August recess. The response, on June 24 of last year, almost a year ago, was that Senator LOTT simply repeated his earlier unacceptable offer. 
   Then on June 25 a year ago, Senator DASCHLE proposed an agreement in which Senator LOTT would bring up the Republican bill by July 6 so that Senate DASCHLE could offer the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights, and the Senate could offer relevant amendments to HMO reform. 
   The Democratic leader had indicated that every amendment would be relevant to the proposal, that there would be only relevant amendments to the Patients' Bill of Rights. Yes, that was rejected as well. 
   The next day, on June 26, the majority leader offered a proposal, once again, that allowed him to withdraw the legislation at any time and bar consideration of any other health care legislation. That was on June 26. That is twice they did it almost a year ago, and we are no to a debate. 
   It goes on. 
   On July 15, 1998, he made another offer. This time he proposed an agreement that allowed for no amendments. He would bring up his bill, we could bring up ours, and that is it--all or nothing. The American people would be denied votes on key issues, denied key protections, too. 
   On July 29 and on September 1, the Republican leader offered variations of the proposal. 
   I could go on--and will--but it is just an indication of how long and how hard we have been trying to get this matter 
   before the Senate in order to be able to try and vote on this. 
   Many Members of this body say: Well, we know it is not being called up because of various interests and interest groups. But let me just remind the Senate what has happened. See if they are somewhat troubled by it when we talk about interest and interest groups. 
   Not long ago, Mr. Gradison, who is the former head of the Health Insurance Association of America, was asked in an interview published in the Rocky Mountain News, to sum up the strategy of the special interests that are committed to blocking meaningful reform on the Patients' Bill of Rights. Acording to the article, Mr. Gradison replied, ``There's a lot to be said for `just say no.' '' 
   The author of the article goes on to report: At a strategy session called by a top aide to Senator DON NICKLES, Gradison advised Republicans to avoid taking public positions that could draw fire during the election campaign. Instead of participating in a productive debate on how best to assure that all patients have the protections currently afforded only to those fortunate enough to be in the best plans, such as Members of the United States Congress and the Senate, insurance companies and their allies in the business community have heeded the call of the Republican leadership. The leadership aide, acting on the behalf of Senator LOTT, urged the industry in 1997 to get off their butts and get off their wallets and block reform. The Republican leadership directed these special interest friends to write the definitive paper  trashing all these bills, and they have responded accordingly, pouring tens of millions of dollars into paid advertising, ginned-up studies, and lobbying campaign coffers of those who are willing to stand in the way of the much-needed change. 
   Over $100 million has been spent in distortion and misrepresentation on this legislation, Mr. President. The interesting thing is, even with $100 million spent, if you take the various studies and reviews out there, not just the case studies which come to our offices every day, but any of the measurements that are being taken out there about people's concerns, you find that it really hasn't impacted families in this country. They know what is happening every single day, and they know the kinds of protections they need. They know the importance of this legislation. 
   What are we basically talking about in terms of these commonsense rights? 
   How much time do I have remaining?

   Mr. KENNEDY. These are the commonsense rights: The right to a specialist, if you have a condition serious enough to require specialty care--no parent should be told that his child, with a rare cancer, will be treated by an HMO adult oncologist when the physician lacks the expertise needed to save the child--the right to prescription medicines that your doctor knows best that you need; the right to go to the nearest emergency room without financial penalty; the right to participate in clinical trials--that is so important with the whole range of new breakthrough drugs--the right to continue care if you are in the middle of a course of treatment and your doctor is dropped from a network or your employer changes insurance plans; the right to a speedy and fair, truly independent appeal; and the right to hold your plan accountable in court. These protections and the others are simply common sense. We believe we ought to have an opportunity to debate those and to offer those measures in the Senate. 
   I am very hopeful that we are going to be able to get this matter scheduled. It is a matter of enormous importance. We have seen reported out of our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee legislation that has been favored by our Republican friends. Let's have that legislation before the Senate, with the time and opportunity to cover those matters, and let the Senate express its will. I am convinced that we will act to protect the families of America.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, three years ago, the entire Nation watched in horror and disbelief as an epidemic of church arsons gripped the South. The wave of arsons was primarily directed at African-American churches and it was a reminder of some of the darkest periods in our history--when African-Americans were the constant targets of violence by cowardly racists. In response to this epidemic, Congress, with overwhelming bipartisan support, passed the Church Arson Prevention Act. We recognized that all Americans--Democrats and Republicans, men and women, whites and nonwhites, Jews, Catholics, Protestants, and Muslims--deserve to be free from these vicious hate crimes. 
   Unfortunately, this kind of bigotry has raised its ugly head again, in the form of the despicable arson attacks on the synagogues in Sacramento, California last Friday. Houses of worship have a special place in our society, and when they are attacked, the devastation is far-reaching. The B'nai Israel synagogue is the oldest synagogue west of the Mississippi River. In the charred remains of its library were over 5,000 books, some hundreds of years old and many out of print. 
   Since passage of the Church Arson Prevention Act in 1996, the FBI and ATF have documented over 600 cases of church arson. With the passage of that legislation, the Justice Department was given the tools it needs to apprehend and prosecute the individuals responsible for these deplorable acts, and to deal with such hate crimes more effectively. 
   All of us look forward to swift action to bring those responsible for these shameful attacks to justice. Although the parishioners at B'nai Israel, Congregation Beth Shalom, and Knesset Israel Torah Center may have lost the use of their synagogues for a time, their spirit and strength in the face of their loss are an inspiration to the entire country. 
   Congress needs to bring the same vigorous bipartisan attention to other kinds of hate crimes. 
   Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our society than hate crimes. These despicable acts injure the victim, the community, and the nation itself. 
   We have acted to deal with arson attacks on places of worships, and we need to take similar action to deal with other hate crimes. 
   We need to give the federal government more effective tools to investigate and prosecute these contemptible acts. In March, many of us joined in introducing S. 622, the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This bill has the support of the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and many organizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes. The goal of the Hate Crimes Prevention Act is to provide federal investigators and prosecutors the tools they need to fight these senseless and violent acts. 
   Congress' silence on this basic issue has been deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't care--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state and local problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and for too long, Congress has been AWOL. We must act, and we must act now, to make the federal government a full partner in the ongoing battle against hate crimes in all their ugly forms. 
   Mr. LEVIN addressed the Chair.

There is at least a very strong sense among many of those most concerned about this legislation that this is a priority for families in this country, and that we have dealt with other legislation, such as the juvenile justice bill. We worked that process through without limitations and restrictions, in a responsible way. It is certainly the intention of Senator DASCHLE, and others who are cosponsoring this 
   legislation, to do it in a likewise manner. There is the determination that we will have an opportunity to do so, and we will do that. We want to be able to work that out. I know the leader does. I know that is the way it should be worked out. I am hopeful we will have an opportunity to address this in the Senate.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to take this opportunity to salute a group of special individuals who have been honored by the Boston Celtics as ``Heroes Among Us.'' These are people representing all walks of life who have helped others. They have demonstrated courage, they have made sacrifices, and they have achieved worthwhile goals. They have improved lives, and sometimes saved lives. Some have worked with the elderly and others the very young. Some have overcome personal handicaps, and all have inspired others. In doing so, they have tackled difficult issues and helped the entire community. These heroes are role models. We look up to them as examples of people who have made a difference. They are eminently deserving of the award bestowed upon them by the Boston Celtics. 
   The ``Heroes Among Us'' Award was instituted by the Boston Celtics Charitable Foundation in 1997. Since then, 67 heroes, including educators, business executives, medical professionals, clergy and public servants, have been honored. During a special ceremony each home game on the Celtics legendary parquet floor at Boston Garden, the heroes were honored by players and fans at home games during the past two basketball seasons. 
   The Boston Celtics have a longstanding tradition of giving back to their community. Throughout the years, the team has initiated or participated in many community outreach programs, through the non-profit work of the Boston Celtics Charitable Foundation and the Red Auerbach Youth Foundation. 
   In 1996, the Celtics organization was awarded the Professional Team Community Award from the World Sport Humanitarian Hall of Fame, and was honored for having the most effective and innovative community relations program among all professional sports teams. The Boston Celtics' players, coaches, family and staff are committed to improving the lives of youth and families. Their philosophy--``The Celtics Standing Tall in Partnership with the Community''--is reflected year after year in the outstanding work they do to accomplish their mission, and I commend them for their brilliant achievements.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will take just a few moments this evening to address the Senate on an issue which our leader, Senator DASCHLE, and others, have spoken to the Senate about in the period of these last few days. I would like to urge that the leadership here in the Senate set a firm time for the consideration of legislation, which I believe is of central concern to families all over this country, known as the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   We have taken advantage of the opportunity in the Senate to make a case for the consideration of this legislation. We are very mindful that there are appropriations bills that have to be addressed, but I think this is a matter which is of central importance and concern to all of the families of this country. It does seem to me that we ought to address this question and at least establish a timeframe for which the Senate could debate and finalize its actions on this legislation. 
   I know there are probably Members wondering why there are several of us who are bringing this to the attention of the Senate again this evening. I would like to just review for the Senate membership what the timeframe has been in the consideration of this legislation since the introduction of the original Patients' Bill of Rights more than 2 years ago. 
   When we introduced legislation in the Senate over 2 years ago, we thought we would have an opportunity to address it, at least in the final months or weeks of the last session. We were unable to do so. At the very end of the session, the majority leader, at that time, indicated this would be a priority item for the consideration of the Senate. 
   I thought I would just review briefly tonight the key parts of this legislation and why so many of us are anxious that we have the assurance by the leadership that this matter will be considered by a date certain. If we secure a date, then members will know about it, and the American people will understand it. They will be able to focus on this extremely important health measure, which effectively, when all is said and done, will guarantee that medical decisions in this country are going to be made by the trained professionals and the patients they are treating and not be made by accountants in the various HMOs and insurance companies. 
   When you get right down to it, that is what this legislation is all about. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights was introduced over 2 years ago. It was never scheduled in the last Congress, despite our repeated efforts to bring it before the Senate. This year's track record is equally troubling. 
   On January 19, the majority leader said on the floor of the Senate that it was a priority. On January 27, in an address to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the majority leader announced that he expected the bill to come up in May. On March 18, our Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee  passed a bill on a party-line vote, but a report has just filed today. We passed the legislation out of our committee on March 18. Now we have April 18, May 18, June 18 coming up tomorrow. 
   On April 15, the majority leader issued a list of bills to be completed by Memorial Day. The Patients' Bill of Rights was not even on that list. On May 19, the majority leader told the National Journal that he hoped to bring up the bill in June, that he had ordered the Finance Committee to move its portions of the bill. But that committee has held 30 hearings this year, not one on the Patients' Bill of Rights, and no markup is scheduled. 
   Then on May 27, just as the Memorial Day recess was starting, the majority leader said at a press conference that he hoped it could be brought up by the summer. 
   So we have gone from an announcement in January that it is a priority to a possible scheduling in May, to a possible scheduling in June, and now it is something that might come up this summer. And just today, the Republican leader said flatly that if we asked for a reasonable number of amendments, the answer was no. That is a quote from the majority leader in today's publication of Congress Daily. 
   We can say, well, what is this really all about? Why should we be giving this consideration? We had the opportunity in the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to actually mark up a Patients' Bill of Rights in March of this year. It was reported out over the opposition of a number of us on some very important measures. 
   I will review very quickly with the Members of the Senate in the time that I have tonight--how much time remains?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself the 3 minutes then. 
   Mr. President, listed in this chart are the protections in the Patients' Bill of Rights. First of all, the legislation that we favor covers all 161 million Americans with private health insurance. Those on the other side, whose legislation primarily favors so-called self-funded programs, don't protect anyone in HMOs. But that's the issue here. HMOs are making decisions on the basis of the bottom line rather than the interests of the patients. We want to protect families. The Republican proposal doesn't even cover those individuals in HMOs, because HMOs are not self-funded. 
   One amendment would allow the Senate to show whether we are really interested in providing protection for all Americans who need it or just for one-third? It seems to me that could be an issue that wouldn't take a great deal of time to be able to understand. 
   We heard very considerable debate on complicated issues here this afternoon and were able to make resolutions of those measures. Certainly we ought to be able to make a decision on the floor of the Senate whether we are interested in covering all Americans or whether we are interested, as our friends are on the other side, in only covering about a third of those. 
   So these issues on the chart are the principal differences between the Republican proposal and the Democratic bill. We would 
   make sure we are going to cover all the patients. We would make sure that we are going to guarantee that all patients, including children, are able to get the specialists that are needed to deal with their needs. 
   We are going to guarantee coverage for routine costs in certain clinical trials. I believe that the next century is going to be known as the century of life sciences. We are committed here, I believe, in the Senate to doubling the research budget in the NIH. Why? Because of the promises of breakthroughs in lifesaving drugs for cancer and Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's and other conditions. But to get these breakthrough drugs, you have to provide clinical trials. Clinical trials are a key element in terms of bringing the brilliance of our researchers from the laboratory to the bedside. 
   We want to make sure that individuals who are afflicted with a disease for which traditional treatments offer very little hope for their survival have access to the breakthroughs that can be achieved by clinical trials. If the medical doctor that is treating that patient recommends a clinical trial, we are committed to making sure that clinical trial will be available for that mother, for that daughter, for that child, for whomever it might be in the family that can benefit from it. That is one of the very important aspects in this debate. 
   It doesn't make a lot of sense on the one hand to be voting for billions of dollars to support research at the NIH to discover breakthrough therapies, but on the other hand not be able to use them. We want to make sure that there is going to be a law, a guarantee, that encourages access for certain patients. 
   So, we will take the time in the Senate to go over a few of these issues each day and spell out exactly the kinds of protections that we think are needed in a real Patients' Bill of Rights. There are not a lot of them. 
   When the minority leader indicated there would be probably 20 amendments or so needed on our side, it is no secret what many of those amendments would be. You can look right over this list and see the protections that are guaranteed in our Patients' Bill of Rights and the failings of the one that will be proposed by the opposition. 
   The bottom line is that over 200 organizations in this country, made up of the best of the medical profession, the best doctors, the best nurses, the patients' organizations, working families and others, universally and uniformly support our proposal. And the other side does not have one, not one organization. There isn't a single medical organization in our country that supports their program. But 200 leading groups support ours. Not because it is Democrat or Republican. It is because ours protects patients.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct, according to this morning's edition of Congress Daily. The leader was here earlier this evening and has not refuted it. The Democratic leader has restated it. 
   Here it is. He says, ``If they are still insisting on 20 amendments, the answer is no.'' Then he says, ``We don't have but 2 weeks before the Fourth of July.'' 
   But, as I understand it, there are some 52 or 53 amendments that are now pending on the legislation we are calling up tomorrow, dealing with the State Department authorization. So 52 amendments are OK for the State Department authorization, but our 20 amendments are not OK for the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Here they are, effectively, on this chart. There is no secret about what we are generally interested in addressing. There may be some changes in some of the language. I think one of the ones that might be missing is something on ``drive-through mastectomies,'' which is not spelled out here. But there is no secret here.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is quite correct. I mentioned a moment ago--but it bears repeating--that we had the assurance by the majority leader on January 19 and January 27 that this would be a priority, and we expected the bill to come up in May. On March 18, we acted in our Health and Education Committee and reported out what I consider to be a ``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' It doesn't provide the protections American patients need. But we ought to have whatever is going to be used out here so we can debate it. The bill from our committee was just filed today. They have had half of March, all of April, May, and half of June--3 months. That gives an indication of what the attitude and atmosphere is here in terms of acting on something that is of central importance to protecting families across this country. 
   And then, finally, as we heard today, it isn't just to the Senator from California, or from Illinois, or the Senator from Massachusetts, but they are saying no to the families in this country: No, you are not going to be able to have those protections considered. No, you are not going to be able to bring this up. We heard last year from those on the other side of the aisle that we are not going to let you decide what the agenda is going to be. 
   All we are trying to do is the people's business. It is the business that has been supported by virtually every single major medical and patient organization. It is their business, and their treatment. It is each family's business. That is why I wonder whether the Senator from California, like myself, is troubled by the fact that we can't get this legislation up, why we get a refusal to consider this proposal. 
   If I could ask the Senator, does the Senator remember that the Democratic leader indicated that, as far as speaking for the Democrats, we could go on sort of a dual track. If it was the judgment of the Republican leadership that we could do their agenda, I know I would be here through the afternoon tomorrow and through the afternoon on Saturday, or in the evenings, of course, 
   next week. We could certainly get a debate and discussion on the various 20 or so amendments needed to pass a good bill. And I am wondering if the Senator from California or the Senator from Illinois remembers when that proposal was put forward. I have been here a number of times when we have followed that procedure.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, the proposal advanced by our Republican friends is so bad that you can't even appeal the rights it purports to guarantee. If, for example, you had a child whose doctor recommended a cancer specialist--a pediatric oncologist--and the HMO rejected it, by saying, ``No, we are not going to allow you to see that specialist, even if the doctor recommended it,'' and the parent said, ``Well, I want to appeal''; under the proposal reported out of the Labor Committee, that family has no right of appeal, because the right of appeal is defined to deal only with certain decisions and not with regard to individuals' access to specialists. So it effectively excludes from the appeal system a whole range of care and protection that it claims to provide. That is rather a technical aspect. That may take a little time to debate. We can certainly vote on that. But not only don't you get the specialist, you don't even have a right to appeal it even if the doctor says this is what your child needs. 
   I can say, from a personal point of view, how important these provisions are. My son had cancer, osteosarcoma, and he was given little chance in terms of survival. They told him he needed a pediatric oncologist, and he was able to participate in a clinical trial that worked miracles for him and the other children who participated in it. 
   Members of the Senate always have very good insurance. We can get into clinical trials, and we can have our specialists. It is always interesting to me that some Members can vote no on these protections when they have it themselves. Then some Members wonder why people are cynical about how they view Members of the Congress. 
   As you well know, when you become a Member of the Senate, you fill out that little card so you can have the health care coverage that is available to Federal employees. You don't have to take it. But I bet there isn't a Member of the Senate who has refused it. 
   Yet, they are prepared to deny Americans across the country the kind of protections we have, and that our families have. They don't want to debate this issue.

But when you look behind those statistics about who is covered and who isn't covered, you will find that it is the working families, the small business men and women, and the farmers and the workers who are the ones that aren't included. They certainly should be protected as well as everyone else.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield such time as I might use. 
   Mr. President, today, we will pass landmark legislation to open the workplace doors for disabled people in communities across this country. At long last, once this measure is enacted into law, large numbers of people with disabilities will have the opportunity to fulfill their hopes and dreams of living independent and productive lives. 
   A decade ago, when we enacted the Americans With Disabilities Act, we promised our disabled fellow citizens a new and better life in which disability would no longer end the American dream. 
   Too often, for too many Americans, that promise has been unfulfilled. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will dramatically strengthen the fulfillment of that promise. 
   We know that millions of disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity to do so, and the nation is denied their talents and their contributions to our communities. 
   Current laws are an anachronism. Modern medicine and modern technology are making it easier than ever before for disabled persons to have productive lives and careers. Yet current laws are often a greater obstacle to that goal than the disability itself. It's ridiculous that we punish disabled persons who dare to take a job by penalizing them financially, by taking away their health insurance lifeline, and by placing these unfair obstacles in their path. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act removes these unfair barriers to work that face so many Americans with disabilities: 
   It makes health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work, or develops a significant disability while working. 
   It gives people with disabilities greater access to the services they need to become successfully employed. 
   It phases out the loss of cash benefits as income rises, instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that workers with disabilities face today. 
   It places work incentive planners in communities, rather than in bureaucracies, to help workers with disabilities learn how to obtain the employment services and support they need. 
   Eliminating these barriers to work will help large numbers of disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer country when we open the golden door of opportunity to all Americans, and enable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of Americans with disabilities, this bill is a declaration of independence that can make the American dream come true. 
   We must banish the patronizing mind-set that disabled people are unable. In fact, they have enormous talent, and America cannot afford to waste an ounce of it. 
   Today's action is dedicated to the 54 million disabled American men and women who want to work and are able to work, but who face unfair penalties under current law if they take jobs and go to work. 
   It is dedicated to the 12 million children and their families who will now have the chance to dream of a future of work and prosperity, and not government handouts. 
   Our goal is to remove the unconscionable barriers they face, and free up the enterprise, creativity, and contribution of these Americans. Now, when we say ``equal opportunity for all,'' it will be clear that we mean all. 
   No one in America should lose their medical coverage, which can mean the difference between life and death--if they go to work. No one in this country should have to choose between buying a decent meal and buying the medication they need. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act will remove these unfair barriers  and continue to make health insurance available and affordable to people with disabilities. 
   Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long and hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, family members, citizens, and advocates. They see every day that our current job programs are failing people with disabilities; and forcing them and their families into poverty. 
   We have worked together for many months to develop effective ways to right these wrongs. To all of those who have done so much, I say thank you for helping us to reach this long-awaited day. This bill truly represents legislation of the people, by the people and for the people. 
   Nearly a year ago, President Clinton signed an executive order to increase employment and health care coverage for people with disabilities. Today, with strong bipartisan support, the Senate is demonstrating its commitment to our fellow disabled citizens. 
   I especially commend Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ROTH, and Senator MOYNIHAN for their indispensable leadership on this landmark legislation. I also commend the many Senate staff members whose skilled assistance contributed so much to this achievement--Jennifer Baxendale and Alec Vachon of Senator ROTH'S staff, Kristin Testa and John Resnick of Senator MOYNIHAN'S staff, Chris Crowley, Jim Downing, and Pat Morrissey of Senator JEFFORDS' staff, and Michael Myers and Connie Garner of my own staff. 
   For far too long, disabled Americans have been left out and left behind. Today, we are taking long overdue action to correct the injustice they have unfairly suffered.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank all of our colleagues for the program and for their support. 
   Yesterday when the President was here, he indicated he would like to have this legislation on his desk by the Fourth of July. This really is a declaration of independence for the disabled. He mentioned if we were not able to meet that time limit, we ought to do it the 26th of July which will be the ninth anniversary for the Americans With Disabilities Act. 
   I think either date will be entirely appropriate for the celebration in this country of the Fourth of July. I can't think of a better Fourth of July for millions of our fellow Americans than the successful signing into law of this legislation. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is another case where the seniors and the young people of this country ought to look beyond the words to the real meaning of the program. We will have an opportunity to debate a Patients' Bill of Rights in the next few days, I hope. But we will have what is effectively a ``Patients' Bill of Wrongs.'' It will be introduced by our good friends on the other side of the aisle as a ``Patients' Bill of Rights'', but it does not provide the protection. 
   And here we have another example of this, where we have an illusion that we are protecting Social Security. They say it, but they do not mean it, because the legislation effectively denies it. In reality, this Republican ``lockbox'' does nothing to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. In fact, it would do just the reverse. The sponsors of the legislation deliberately designed their ``lockbox'' with a ``trapdoor.'' Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified ``reform'' plans. This loophole opens the door to risky tax cut schemes that would finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future. 
   As has been pointed out by my good friends from New Jersey, South Carolina, and others here, this loophole undermines the protection of these resources that should be allocated to protect our senior citizens. 
   No matter how many times those on the other side say that this really does give them the insurance and that it really does provide the protection, as has been pointed out by speaker after speaker after speaker, it fails to meet the fundamental and basic test. Because of the ``trapdoor,'' the Republican ``lockbox'' fails to provide protections for our senior citizens. It does not deserve the support of the Members of this body. 
   This Republican ``lockbox'' is an illusion. It gives only the appearance of protecting Social Security. In reality, it does nothing to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. It would, in fact, do just the reverse. The sponsors of the legislation deliberately designed their ``lockbox'' with a ``trapdoor''. It would allow payroll tax dollars that belong to Social Security to be spent instead of risky privatization schemes. 
   It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the ``lockbox.'' Their statements convey the impression that they have taken a major step  toward protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their proposal would not provide even one additional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it extend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even one more day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. At best, that is all their so-called ``lockbox'' would do. 
   By contrast, the administration's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 trillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next fifteen years. By doing so, the President's budget would extend the life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050. 
   There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do with the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt reduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have been required to pay interest on the national debt will become available each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes those debt service savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. I wholeheartedly agree. But the Republicans refuse to commit these savings to the Social Security Trust Fund. They are short-changing Social Security, while pretending to save it. 
   Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every budget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By using the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next fifteen years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every budget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Sensible fiscal management now will produce enormous savings to the government in future years. Since it was payroll tax revenues which make the debt reduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social Security. 
   That is what President Clinton rightly proposed in his budget. His plan would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for all future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable plan. But Republican Member of Congress oppose it. 
   Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources to fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even effectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used to pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a trapdoor in their ``lockdoor.'' Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified ``reform'' plans. This loophole opens the door to risky tax cut schemes that would finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, there will be nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to fund future Social Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse then it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future. 
   A genuine lockbox would prevent any such diversion of funds. A genuine lockbox would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The Republican ``lockbox'' does just the opposite. It actually invites a raid on the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Repubican retirement security ``reform'' could be nothing more than tax cuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefitting their wealthy friends. Pacing Social Security on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priority, not further enriching the already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. without it, half the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. 
   To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to strengthen Social Security, at last do not weaken it. Do not divert dollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other purposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future Social Security benefits.'' 
   While this ``lockbox'' provides no genuine protection for Social Security, it provides no protection at all for Medicare. 
   The Republicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care that they have refused to reserve any of the surplus exclusively for Medicare. They call this legislation the ``Social Security and Medicare Safe Deposit Box Act,'' but in fact they do nothing to financially strengthen Medicare. Rather than providing a dedicated stream of available on-budget revenue to Medicare, their proposal pits Medicare against Social Security in a competition for funds that belong to the Social Security Trust Fund. We all know that the dollars in the Social Security Trust Fund are not even sufficient to meet Social Security's obligations after 2034. There clearly are no extra funds available in Social Security to help Medicare. Their plan will do nothing to ease the financial crisis confronting Medicare. The Republican proposal for Medicare is a sham--and they know it. 
   By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 40 percent of the on-budget surplus to Medicare. Those new dollars would come entirely from the on-budget portion of the surplus. The Republicans have adamantly refused to provide any additional funds for Medicare. Instead, they propose to spend the entire on-budget surplus on tax cuts disproportionately benefitting the 
   wealthiest Americans. 
   According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if we do not provide additional resources, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will require benefit cuts of almost 11 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. Keeping it solvent for 50 years will require cuts of 25 percent. 
   The conference agreement passed by House and Senate Republicans earmarks the money that should be used for Medicare for tax cuts. Eight-hundred billion dollars are earmarked for tax cuts--and not a penny for Medicare. The top priority for the American people is to protect both Social Security and Medicare. But this misguided budget puts Medicare and Social Security last, not first. 
   Democrats oppose this ``lockbox'' because we want real protection for Social Security and Medicare. Our proposal says: save Social Security and Medicare first, before the surpluses earned by American workers are squandered on new tax breaks or new spending. It says: extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, by assuring that some of the bounty of our booming economy is used to preserve, protect, and improve Medicare. 
   Our proposal does not say no to tax cuts. Substantial amounts would still be available for targeted tax relief. It does not say no to new spending on important national priorities. But it does say that protecting Medicare should be as high a national priority for the Congress as it is for the American people. 
   Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren know, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are already stretched to the limit--and often beyond the limit--to purchase the health care they need. Because of gaps in Medicare and rising health costs, Medicare now covers only about 50 percent of the health bills of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent of their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--almost as large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have risen to 29 percent. Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, senior citizens have to choose between putting food on the table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. This problem demands our attention. 
   Those on the other side of the aisle have tried to conceal their own indifference to Medicare behind a cloud of obfuscation. They say their plan does not cut Medicare. That may be true in a narrow, legalistic sense--but it is fundamentally false and misleading. Between now and 2025, Medicare has a shortfall of almost $1 trillion. If we do nothing to address that shortfall, we are imposing almost $1 trillion in Medicare cuts, just as surely as if we directly legislated those cuts. No  amount of rhetoric can conceal this fundamental fact. The authors of the Republican budget resolution had a choice to make between tax breaks for the wealthy and saving Medicare--and they chose to slash Medicare. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to establish genuine lockboxes for both Social Security and Medicare. H.R. 1259 creates only the illusion of protecting these two landmark programs. It provides inadequate protection for Social Security and no protection at all for Medicare. We can do better than this. 
   I thank the Senator from New Jersey and yield back my remaining time to him.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join my friend, the Senator from Illinois, in his presentation, as well as the Senator from New York, and urge that Members in this body begin debate on one of the most important pieces of legislation that we, hopefully, will have an opportunity to consider; that is, how we will ensure that medical decisions are made by those in the medical profession, rather than the accountants and the insurance companies. 
   The Senator has made that case with an excellent example this afternoon. I wonder whether the Senator realizes it has been over 2 years we have had legislation pending before the Senate. The Human Resources Committee has the jurisdiction, and we were effectively denied--I know the people who are watching or listening are not really interested in these kinds of activities. We have to have the hearings in the committee. Then we have to try to work the will of the committee and report it out to the Senate. 
   This legislation has been before the Senate for 2 years, but we were not even permitted to have a hearing under the leadership of our friends on the other side, the Republican leadership. We were denied the opportunity to debate these questions when we tried to bring this up in the last Congress. 
   I gather from what both Senators have said, they believe, as I do, that this is one of the fundamental and basic issues of central concern to families all over this country. If we can spend 5 days dealing with the Y2K issue, we can certainly afford to spend a few days--perhaps not even the 5 days, 4 days--on an issue that is so important to families, families who may have an emergency, families who may want to have clinical trials for the mother, the grandmother, or the daughter, to deal with problems of cancer. Or the whole issue of specialty care, to make sure those who need the kinds of prescription drugs necessary to deal with a particular illness and sickness would be able to get them. 
   I wonder if the Senator would agree with me that included in Senator DASCHLE's legislation is a series of recommendations that were made by a bipartisan panel to the President, with Members who were nominated by the leaders of both parties and by the President of the United States. It had to be unanimous. They made a series of recommendations. Those recommendations have been included in Senator DASCHLE's Patients' Bill of Rights. The only difference was the panel recommended they be voluntarily accepted. We have seen that the companies are unwilling to accept those. The leader has said if they are not going to accept them voluntarily, we will include them, but they reflect a bipartisan panel. 
   Secondly, they include some other recommendations that have been recommended by the insurance commissioners. They are not a notorious group favoring the Democrats or Republicans. I imagine, if you looked over the field, most of them are actually Republicans. They made some recommendations. Those effectively have been included. 
   Finally, there are the kinds of protections that have been included in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We don't hear a murmur from the other side about 
   those protections not being effective. 
   If that is the basis of this legislation, and it has the support of 130 groups that have responsibility for treating the American families in this country, why in the world shouldn't we have an opportunity to debate it? 
   On the other hand, our Republican friends haven't a single group, not one, that represents parents, children, women, or disabled that support their program. Can the Senator explain to me why, if that is the case, we are being denied? Does the Senator agree it is completely irresponsible to deny the Senate the full opportunity to debate these measures?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I express appreciation for the very excellent commitment of our leader on this issue. He has been tireless in the pursuit of the protections of our fellow citizens in the health area. 
   I see the Senator from New York on his feet. I will ask one or two questions and then I will yield. 
   Is one of the points the Senator from Illinois thinks worth debating, with the approach that has been taken by our Republican friends, the limited number of people who are actually being covered? As one who was the author of the HMO legislation in the 1970s, we passed it five times here in the Senate before we finally got the House to pass it. 
   Then it was passed and it was on a pilot program. But the concept at that time was we were going to change the financial incentives from having more and more tests and more and more treatment to having a capitation payment that said to the health delivery system you have this amount of money to take care of this patient, so they have an incentive to work for preventive health care, keep the person healthy. They get more resources the healthier the person is and the longer the person stays healthy. But we have seen abuses where they have cut back on more and more of the coverage. That has stimulated this whole program. 
   The fact remains, under the Republican proposal we find out that somewhere above a quarter, about 30 percent of all of those who are covered, and even a lesser percent of HMOs, which is really the problem, are actually covered. Would this not be an issue that ought to be debated out here, that the Members of this body ought to be able to make some call about? I do not think that is a very complex issue. Do we want to cover 30 percent or do we want to cover 100 percent? How long do you think that issue would really take, for people to understand it and be able to express a view? It does not seem to me that would take a very long time. People can make that judgment. People ought to be able to make that judgment. Does the Senator agree?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Just a final point. Does the Senator agree with me that now the insurance industry has spent somewhere around $15 million to misrepresent and distort the Patients' Bill of Rights, which has been introduced by our leader, Senator DASCHLE, and of which many of us are cosponsors? They have spent that last year doing that, when people thought we were supposed to take it up. If you ask across the spectrum of America about the importance of this issue, the American people still want action taken. They still want to have these protections for themselves and for their families. I think this is a clear indication. 
   I think our friends on the other side ought to understand that Americans understand this issue. I think parents understand it. I think mothers and grandparents understand it best. Those who are opposed to it can distort and misrepresent and advertise, as they have done in the past, but American people know what this issue is all about. 
   Does the Senator not agree with me on that, and that the American people want action by this body?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as all of us understand, we are considering a very important appropriations bill. The floor managers, Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID, have a responsibility to see that we meet the responsibilities of the Senate and the appropriations procedures by making sure this legislation is considered and that Members have an opportunity to address it and move towards conclusion. I respect that, and I have great respect and friendship for the two Members. 
   I rise today to raise an issue which is not related to the underlying measure but is related to a very significant issue that is affecting many individuals across this country, and that is the issue of whether we are going to free members of our community, referred to as the disability community, who are facing some physical or mental challenge, whether or not we are going to free them from the kinds of governmental policies that discourage them from employment but really, beyond employment, from living a full and constructive and positive and independent existence, 
    which I think all of us want to be able to achieve.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I have talked to the majority leader today, as well as our own leaders, Senator DOMENICI and Senator REID, and Senator GRAMM of Texas, who had effectively put a hold on the legislation and had indicated that request, that we file the legislation so it would conform to the request of the floor managers. It would be at the desk. 
   It is at least my impression that, given the agenda that has been announced by the majority leader, we would not conclude this legislation today and we will be moving on to the Y2K, and what they call the Social Security lockbox, later in the week, and we would have an opportunity and a good-faith effort to see if there could  be an agreement to consider this legislation independently--which, as the Senator from New Mexico understands, is desirable for a number of different reasons--but to do it with a precise time for the scheduling. That, I believe, is the preferable way to do it. But we didn't want to foreclose our opportunity, if we were unable to do so, to at least be able to exercise some judgment and move ahead with the legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I would like to take this one step at a time, and I think there is very little reason, given the expressions of the majority leader and the Senator from Texas, why the Senate--not only the Senator from Massachusetts, but Senator ROTH, Senator JEFFORDS and Senator MOYNIHAN, and myself, who are the principal cosponsors, be given assurance that this would be ready. We are quite available through the afternoon to be able to take that. I want to say at this time that I would like to proceed in that way, without indicating exactly what our course of action would be. 
   There is no reason why we should be denied further opportunity to consider this legislation. I personally would be inclined to move ahead with a short timeframe for consideration of the amendment. But I am hopeful, as I said, that we may be able to work this out. So that is my intention. I am going to file this, if I may, at the desk and conform to the request of the floor managers. 
   Mr. President, I raise this issue, and it is a rather unusual process and procedure. I know the Senate has its responsibilities, but there is also a responsibility to the millions of Americans with disabilities. They have been waiting for some period of time as well. The fact is that this legislation has 78 cosponsors. I don't know of a piece of legislation that is before the Senate that has that degree of support from Republican and Democrat alike, and from over 300 organizations. We have a variety of different important pieces of legislation, but for my money, this legislation was more important to consider than Y2K or, with respect, the legislation that we have before us even at the present time, because it has such overwhelming support. There is no reason why we should not move ahead on this legislation. Millions of Americans are waiting for us to take action. The overwhelming majority of the Members of this body feels strong support for this, and that is a compelling reason to move forward with the legislation. 
   Mr. President, we have seen this legislation pass out of the Finance Committee 16-2, and one of the Members who had expressed 
    opposition has since indicated that the changes that have been made in the legislation sent to the desk have effectively addressed those concerns. So here we have the overwhelming, overwhelming, overwhelming sentiment of those on the Finance Committee in favor of it. It is virtually unanimous in the House Commerce Committee. We don't have pieces of legislation like this. We have had differences on some pieces of legislation between Republicans and Democrats but not on this one, because the legislation is so compelling. We ought to be moving forward, and we ought to be moving forward now. 
   There are 175 cosponsors in the House of Representatives. The reason this legislation has such incredible support is because the legislation, perhaps more than any legislation I have seen in recent times, is really a reflection of the grassroots efforts to address this problem. The overwhelming majority of Americans who have some disability want to work and have the ability to work. But because of the way that the support systems are set up in terms of health insurance, they are prohibited from doing so because they will lose the health benefits they so desperately need. They are effectively disincentivized from going to work. This legislation understands that particular dilemma and addresses it. It is one of the most important pieces of legislation we are going to have in this Congress. 
   At the outset, I want to pay tribute to my friend and colleague, the Senator from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS. He has been an enormously important leader in this body on issues involving the disabled. I welcome the opportunity to work with him on this and other legislation. We have a number of members on our committee who have taken special interest in the care of the needy and disabled; Senator HARKIN and Senator FRIST come to mind, as do others. We have had the overwhelming support of the members of our committee, most of whom were very much involved 9 years ago in the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act to strike down the walls of discrimination which had existed and exist even today in our society against those who have some disability. We have made monumental progress in terms of knocking down the walls of discrimination. 
   As I will show in a few moments, even though we have had some success in knocking down the walls of discrimination, we still see that many of those who have disabilities are unable to go back to work because of the loss of any health insurance, and it has been because of that particular dilemma that this legislation was developed. We will get into the sound reasons for doing so, 
    and the most compelling reason; and that is to let all Americans know that if someone has a disability it does not mean that they are not able to perform and live independently in so many instances, and be constructive, positive, and contributing members of our society. We will go through why and how this legislation does that. 
   I want to indicate at this time that the leadership of our colleagues--Senator ROTH on the Finance Committee and Senator MOYNIHAN on the Finance Committee--was essential in getting that legislation through. We worked very closely together. The legislation itself is really a reflection of their strong work and their strong commitment, as well as that of Senator JEFFORDS. 
   It seems to me this is the time to act. We will hopefully get some agreement by the leadership to call this legislation up. The appropriate way to have this legislation called up would be with our good colleagues and friends, Senator ROTH and Senator JEFFORDS, to offer this as independent legislation. We will move forward and pass it at that time. That is what I am hopeful we will be able to do. But quite frankly, we have been unable to get those kinds of assurances. 
   I think the delay in bringing this legislation to the floor has gone on long enough. We ought to be about the business of the substance of this legislation. We know there can be those who are opposed to it, or are concerned about it. But I believe we need a time for accounting. We need a time for yeas and nays. That is what this business is ultimately about. It is about choices. It is about priorities. It is about whether we are going to take action. 
   We strongly believe we should take action, and we should take action now. We have waited now some 2 1/2 weeks since we had the understanding that this was going to be called up. Then it was temporarily shelved and put aside. 
   We have waited and waited for those who have been concerned about it to express their concern. We have tried to work through some of their concern. One of their concerns is about the offsets. We tried to work through that, but it is time to take action. This is the vehicle by which we can at least get action by the Senate of the United States. I believe we should move ahead. 
   Former majority leader Bob Dole stated in eloquent testimony before the Finance Committee that this issue is about people going to work--``it is about dignity and opportunity and all of the things we talk about when we talk about being Americans.'' Senator Dole has been a strong supporter of this legislation, and we welcome his support for this program. 
   We know a large portion of the 54 million disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity to do so. The Nation is denied their talents and their contributions to our community. 
   These are the results of a Lou Harris 1998 poll of the 54 million Americans with disabilities: 
   Seventy-two percent of working-age people with disabilities who are not  working now say they want to work. There is a great desire for work by those individuals, but still they are effectively denied in a practical way the opportunity to do so. 
   Removing these barriers to work will help large numbers of disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. We are a better and stronger and fairer country when we open the golden door of opportunity to all and enable them to be equal partners in the American dream. For millions of Americans with disabilities, this bill can make the American dream come true. When we say ``equal opportunity for all,'' it will be clear that we truly mean all. 
   How large are the gaps? This chart is the comparison between persons with and without disabilities on ``indicator'' measures in 1998. 
   Employment: Working either full time or part time, persons with disabilities, 29 percent. Persons with no disabilities, approximately 80 percent. The gap between those with disabilities and without disabilities who work is some 50 percent. 
   If we look at the income for households, you will see that of those persons with disabilities who are working, many of them are working in low-income jobs--34 percent have incomes of $15,000 or less compared to only 12 percent of those persons with no disabilities. Again we find the extraordinary disparity. 
   It is long past time to banish the mind-set that the disabled are unable. In fact, they have enormous talents and abilities, and America cannot afford to waste an ounce of it. 
   For too long, Americans with disabilities have faced a series of unbearable penalties if they take jobs or go to work. They are in danger of losing their medical coverage, which can mean the difference between life and death. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits, even if they earn only modest amounts from work. No disabled American should face the harsh choice between buying a decent meal and buying the medication they need. 
   The Work Incentives Improvement Act will begin to remove these unfair barriers facing people with disabilities who are able to work and who want to work. 
   It will continue to make health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work or develops a significant disability while working. 
   It will gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits as income rises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so many workers with disabilities face today. We have the important demonstration program in here that will effectively see the phasing out of the kind of income these individuals are entitled to--the phasing out of 50 cents for every new dollar they make over a period of time. They would be able to increase their income, and we would see a diminution of the amounts actually being contributed by the States and Federal Government as they continue in the employment. 
   This would, obviously, be an incentive for them to move ahead on the economic ladder, rather than being the disincentive that it is now, which would have a termination of benefits which they receive once they move above $500, which effectively locks the disabled into part-time jobs and jobs that pay very little. 
   It makes a good deal of common sense. It places work incentive planners in communities rather than in bureaucracies, and helps workers with disabilities learn how to access employment services and support the services by help and assistance to the States and communities. The States and communities themselves would have some flexibility in being able to raise some fees in the administration of these programs. 
   We provide a very modest amount for that. 
   Finally, all Americans get a fiscally responsible bill. This is based on the Joint Committee on Taxation estimates which incorporate CBO estimates that S. 331 would cost $838 million over 5 years, to be offset by the bill's revenue provisions totaling $906 million, for a net savings of $68 million over the 5 years. This does not even begin to take into consideration two very important factors; that is, what will actually be paid in, in terms of taxes to the Federal Treasury, in terms of revenues that the taxpayers will pay, and also the basic savings that will be there under the Social Security trust fund. 
   This chart shows where we are. We have 7.5 million individuals that qualify for Federal participation in some disability program--individuals who are eligible for some kind of payment. One-half of 1 percent now are. If, out of the 7.5 million, we are able to get 210,000 working, we would save the trust fund $1 billion a year. That does not come through CBO or OMB because of the way the Budget Act works. This is the extrapolation we have in terms of working with the Social Security agency. It represents $1 billion saved with 210,000 working instead of the 70,000 that are working a year. Ours is $800 million over 5 years. 
   This makes a good deal of sense. We believe it is economically sound. These are savings we will have. When we hear about costs of the bill, these are the savings we will have. As I mentioned, it does not even take into consideration what will actually be paid in, in terms of taxes for those individuals, which will be certainly more than those figures. 
   We worked very assiduously with a lot of the different groups on this program. When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think of men, women and children who are disabled from birth. However, fewer than 15 percent of all people with disabilities are born with their disabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness can suddenly disable the healthiest and most physically capable person. This is enormously important. This legislation is not just for our fellow Americans that may be born with some disability, but for all Americans. 
   In the long run, this legislation may be more important than any other action we will take in this Congress. It offers a new and better life to large numbers of our fellow citizens. Disability need no longer end the American dream. That was the promise of the Americans with Disabilities Act a decade ago, and this legislation dramatically strengthens our fulfillment of that promise. 
   I will not take the time this afternoon to go through a diary I have, ``A Day in the Life of People Who Want To Work.'' We have broken down by States and included letters from individuals who have written about what this particular legislation means in terms of their lives today, how their lives would be changed, how their lives would be altered with this particular legislation. It is enormously powerful and moving. 
   If necessary, if we have to convince our colleagues about this legislation, I will take some time and go through some of the letters. 
   I will mention very briefly the human aspect of this legislation. This legislation is for Alice in Oklahoma who is disabled because of multiple sclerosis and receives SSDI benefits. She needs personal assistance to live and work in her community. But to do so, she must use all of her savings and half or all of her wages to pay for personal assistance and prescription drugs. As a result, she is left in poverty. 
   This bill is for Tammy in Indiana who has cerebral palsy and uses a wheelchair. She works part-time at Wal-Mart, but her hours are restricted because if she works too much she will lose her health benefits. Her goal of becoming a productive citizen is denied by the unfair danger of losing the health care she needs. 
   This is for Jay in Minnesota on SSDI who wants to work. However, the job he is qualified for offers no health care. If he accepts the job, he will join the ranks of the uninsured. 
   This bill is for Abby in Massachusetts who is only 6 years old and has mental retardation. Her parents are very concerned about her future and her ability to work and still have health insurance. Already she has been denied coverage by two insurance firms because of the diagnosis of mental retardation. Without Medicaid, her parents would be bankrupted by her medical bills today. If Abby eventually enters the workforce, she will have to live in poverty or lose Medicaid coverage under current law. Under this bill, all that would change. She and her parents will have a chance to dream of a future that includes work and prosperity, rather than a future of government handouts. 
   This bill is for many other citizens whose stories are told in this diary.  This diary alone should be enough to shock and shame the Senate into action. 
   Our goal in this legislation is to banish the stereotypes, to reform and improve the existing disability programs so that they genuinely encourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live independently and be a productive and contributing member of the community. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans. With this legislation, we are taking a giant step toward that goal. 
   A story from the debate on the Americans With Disabilities Act illustrates the point. A postmaster in a town was told he must make his post office accessible. The building had 20 steps leading to a revolving door at the entrance. The postmaster questioned the need to make such costly changes. He said, ``I've been here for 35 years and in all that time I have yet to see a single customer come in here in a wheelchair.'' As the Americans With Disabilities Act shows, if you build the ramp, people will come and they will find their field of dreams. This bill expands the field. 
   The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must be more accessible to all Americans, no matter how many steps stand in the way. That is our goal in this legislation. It is the right thing to do. It is the cost-effective thing to do, and now is the time to do it. For too long, our fellow disability citizens have felt left out and left behind. A new and brighter day is on the horizon for them and today we finally will make it a reality. 
   I will describe a few other reasons for the importance of this legislation, including the cost of this legislation and what is happening currently. I will refer to the work in the Work Incentive Improvement Act and a report. 
   7.5 million disabled receive cash payments from SSI and SSDI. Disability benefit spending totals $73 billion a year. That is what we are spending at the present time under this program--$73 billion a year, making disability programs the fourth largest entitlement expenditure in the Federal Government. If only 1 percent, or 75,000, of the 7.5 million were to become employed, Federal savings in disability programs would total $3.5 billion over the worklife of the beneficiaries. 
   Do we hear that? If we get to 1 percent, we will be effectively saving $3.5 billion over the life of those beneficiaries. That is if we just get to 1 percent, let alone the goal of those of us who believe in independent living. 
   I will quote from the General Accounting Office:  
   The two largest Federal programs providing cash and medical assistance for people with disabilities grew rapidly between 1985 and 1994, with the enrollment of working age people increasing 59 percent from 4 million to 6.3 million.  
   The figures I just read are the most current figures--7.5.  
   ..... the inflation-adjusted cost of cash benefits growing by 66 percent. Administered by SSA, DI and SSI paid over $50 billion in cash benefits to people with disabilities in 1994.  
   So we are up now to $77 billion. In 1994 it was $50 billion. Now, this last year, in a period of 4 years it is up to $77 billion. That is a $27 billion increase. The flow line of these expenditures is going right up through the roof without any further indication of effectively reducing their unemployment, improving the ability of these individuals--who want to work and who have the ability to work if they are able to continue with their health insurance--to be contributing members of the community. It can have a dramatic, significant impact in lowering the continued escalation in expenditures under this fund. 
   For those individuals here who fail to understand what we are doing, what is happening, I hope they will refer to an excellent GAO report.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In the GAO report is an analysis of this program. But they also looked at U.S. private and social insurance programs to find out, are there American companies that are trying to deal with this with employees, and are there other States trying to do it? 
   Look at this. We can look at the percentages of working-age persons with disabilities. We will see West Virginia is 12.6; then 11, in Louisiana; 10 in Maine; Oklahoma, 10.2; Oregon, 10. 
   Now, take the percent working and the percent not working. The percent working is 20 percent--24, 28, 23, 23. Maine has 37 percent working; Oklahoma, 34; and Oregon has 42 percent working--42 percent working. 
   Then we look at the percent not working--57 percent. Some other States are almost 80 percent. 
   Don't you think we ought to look at the States that have large numbers of people with disabilities who are working and find out how they are getting people to work? And find out what is not happening in States where they are not getting them to work? That is what we did in this legislation. What we are finding out is, in those States, in the private sector, they are maintaining the insurance aspects of the health care and also providing the financial incentives to be able to go to work. That is just in some of our States. 
   We are hopeful we can move with these incentives to get to every State. Some States are making dramatic improvements, and others are not. The lessons are very clear, and we have included that in the legislation. If we look at what is happening in other countries, in two countries we find the absolutely extraordinary results they have from having similar incentives and disincentives that we have tried to incorporate in this legislation and that are referred to by the GAO as being very successful. 
   I would like to believe the importance of this is to make sure those Americans with some disability are going to be included in the great American dream, that we decided as a nation we not only are not going to discriminate but we are going to encourage policies that will make it possible for those with disabilities to be part of the American dream. What we are attempting is to do it in ways that have demonstrated effectiveness. 
   The principal reasons they have been effective are along these lines. They have been happening because we have seen new medical technology which has been very helpful when carefully and effectively pursued. I think we all understand the costs of medical technology. In this particular area, there are some great opportunities for people, by the use of medical technology, to get back to work. It is working, and it is effective; it is cost effective. 
   We are also finding, for one reason or another--I will not take the time now--a number of those going on the disability rolls have been younger individuals than we were considering probably 20 years ago. 
   Another interesting corollary is, most of those individuals have a higher achievement in completion of high school and college, for reasons I will not bother taking up the time of the Senate with at this time. We are talking about younger individuals who are more adaptable for these training programs, newer kinds of technology out there, and where that is accessible, more effective training programs such as we passed last year with our one-stop shopping and incentive programs, with financial incentives in the private sector that are going to be effective programs getting people working. We have brought all of these elements together. We followed the examples that have been pointed out to us as effective and incorporated those in this legislation. 
   We believe this will have a dramatic and positive impact, most importantly on the ability of individuals to go to work and be useful and productive, constructive members of our society and live happier lives in their own personal situations and the members of their family, be more productive in the general economy, in what they are able to add to the economy, without these false disincentives out there, reducing the financial burden on the trust funds which are paying out to the community, and ultimately seeing a dramatic reduction in burden to the States' financial situation for funding as well as to the Federal Government. This, we believe, is a win-win-win situation all the way along the line. 
   I could take further time. I know there are others who want to speak to the underlying measure. But we believe very deeply in this legislation, which has been carefully thought through by individuals who will be most affected by it. That has been enormously important. Very often we draft and shape legislation in a way we think is best, but this is legislation that has emerged from the grassroots level. We understand the difficulty of getting everyone to agree to different proposals. 
   We have harmony among the community that represents 300 different organizations. It is an extraordinary initiative, an extraordinary result that is so powerful in terms of what we hope to achieve. 
   This is really a service to the country. We want the kind of America that is going to say to those individuals who are faced with some physical or mental challenges that we will make sure they will be able to participate to the extent their abilities, their interest, their courage, and their determination permit them. We want to eliminate or knock down those barriers which one way or the other inhibit their ability to move forward. 
   We have been attempting to do that in a number of ways, but there is nothing that is going to do more in opening up the dreams and the hopes of these individuals and their families than this piece of legislation. 
   The Americans With Disabilities Act is important in trying to eliminate discrimination against the disabled. The Work Incentives Improvement Act will do the job in terms of eliminating the significant financial disincentives out there that basically inhibit so many of our fellow citizens, who have the ability and dedication and commitment and desire, from moving forward. That is why this legislation is so important. 
   At another time, I will go through some of the other provisions of the legislation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. I like to believe there is a greater understanding and awareness of the challenges that disabled Americans have faced in more recent years than there had been for the first 200 years of our country. Over the last 8 or 10 years, we have had some important changes in attitude on these issues. 
   By and large, the Senator is correct that this has not been an issue that has been in the forefront of legislative or executive action.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. It was not that long ago when we had 5.5 million children who were disabled who never went to schools in our country. We have made some progress in opening up the schools of our country. We debated the issue of trying to give help and assistance to local communities. I am a strong supporter of it. I know the Senator from Nevada is. I know there are others on both sides of the aisle who feel that way as well. 
   We have made some progress on other issues. I cannot speak further without recognizing the good work of the Senator from New 
   Mexico in regard to mental illness. For many years, those afflicted by the challenges of mental illness were kept aside in our own communities, and in terms of debate and discussion, there has been a general reluctance to talk about some of their special needs. 
   The Senator is quite correct. The willingness to talk about these issues has been in a more recent time. I can even speak of that with regard to my own family with a sister who is mentally retarded and having seen the evolution and the changes which have taken place in how people react and respond to those who are mentally retarded. 
   We have come a long way, but the Senator is quite correct, by and large, these individuals and the communities are hard pressed with the day-to-day activities and do not have a great deal of time to come here, although I note both Senator REID and Senator DOMENICI would say that when they do come here and when they do speak, there are a few more eloquent voices and compelling voices for the cause of social justice.

   It is a great tribute not only to the athletes but to the parents, the teachers, to the volunteers, and States all over the country that have been supportive of that program. I know the Senator has been a supporter of the program, and I think any of those individuals who watch those programs cannot leave the field without feeling an extraordinary sense of inspiration. That is, I believe, enormously moving.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I will not take much time. 
   The Senator has it absolutely right. We built in the program the ability to provide the medical and some income for people who have the disabilities and said that if they make over $500, they lose the insurance and they lose the additional kind of insurance, that they would be able to receive income, and they are just dropped out. 
   Very few of the families can be assured they can get a job after a training program where they would be able to offset their total medical expenses if they are able to get health insurance. They probably are not able to get it because they have a disability. The fact of the matter is, the insurance companies, by and large, do not include them. 
   I have a son who lost his leg to cancer and is a very healthy young person, but there is not a chance in the world he can get insurance. He has insurance only as a part of a much larger group. That happens to individuals who have any kind of disability. So they are out behind the 8-ball. 
   What we are saying is, continue their health care. OK, we can phase out or eliminate their income. They would be willing to take a chance on that. They will go out and try to pull their own weight. They are glad to do it. They will do it, and they will do it very well. 
   They have a desire to do it and the ability to do it. We have provided these incentives and training programs to enable them to be more creative to do it. There are more examples in a number of the States about how to do it. There are a number of examples in different countries on how to do it. We are going to do it in ways that are financially responsible. 
   The Senator made an excellent statement. I thank him for his sponsorship, as well as the Senator from Nevada. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DOMENICI addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As the good Senator knows, we have such coverage for all Members of the Senate. Federal employees have it, over 11 million have it, and other groups have that as well. We find that it is suitable for Members of Congress and for the administration, other Federal employees. 
   I underline that I do not think we have health insurance worth its name if it doesn't meet the standard that the Senator from New Mexico has outlined here. I think it is basic and fundamental. There may have been troubles with the Clinton health insurance program, but the President has recently announced that he will issue an executive order to provide mental health parity. 
   I say to the good Senator, my friend--I have heard him speak eloquently, as well as our friend Senator WELLSTONE, and others speak on this issue--I pledge to him that I look forward to working with him. I think it is enormously important. I commend the Senator for what was initiated previously when we were dealing with this issue in related form on the Kassebaum-Kennedy legislation a few years ago. We want to see that and other legislation actually implemented. I commend him and look forward to working with him. 
   Finally, I would like to state my support for the efforts of my good friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator REID, who has long been a champion of the need for better and more comprehensive approaches to suicide prevention. Suicide claims over 30,000 lives each year in this country; it is the eighth leading cause of death overall and the third major cause of death amongst teenagers from 15-19. It is an issue clearly associated with mental health parity. If better access to mental health services were available for all persons who have psychiatric conditions, the suicide rate would be dramatically reduced. It is time to provide mental health parity and to prevent these unnecessary family tragedies. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague from Alaska, Senator TED STEVENS on reaching his 12,000th vote. He is a remarkable colleague and I admire the outstanding leadership that he has shown on so many issues. Senator STEVENS is a person of great integrity and energy and works tirelessly for his state of Alaska. I have worked closely with him on many occasions and it is with admiration that we celebrate his 12,000th vote. 
   His accomplishments as Chair of the Appropriations Committee are too numerous to list. Handling the nation's spending is a complex, difficult task, yet, Senator STEVENS handles this responsibility with finesse and great skill. 
   Senator STEVENS is active on a range of issues that are of great importance nationally and to his home state of Alaska. He is a great advocate for fishing families, a great protector of Native-Americans, and a leader on promoting quality health care and research. His leadership on national defense is also remarkable. 
   Senator STEVENS holds a special place in his heart for children and his advocacy on behalf of early education will help us achieve the nation's school readiness goals. He was one of the first in the Senate to recognize the importance of new brain research documenting the vital role of early stimulation during the first three years of life, and he is a leading advocate for early education. Working to ensure that every child reaches his or her full potential, Senator STEVENS has introduced legislation that will improve the quality and accessibility of early programs for millions of children under the age of 6. He is committed to making sure that children receive the educational boost they need to start school ready to read and ready to learn. With Senator STEVENS leadership, I know we will make school readiness a reality for every child in this country. 
   Senator STEVENS also recognizes the importance of the family and the central role that parents play in their children's lives. While others talk about putting families first, Senator STEVENS acts on that commitment by including funds on his appropriations bills for this purpose. Recently, he introduced an amendment to the Juvenile Justice bill that will provide essential funds to strengthen supports for parents. 
   Put simply, Senator STEVENS is a credit to Alaska, the Senate, and this country. He is a great Senator and a good friend. We are fortunate to be able to celebrate his 12,000th vote with him, and look forward to many more votes in the future from this great Senator from Alaska.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as you know, fuel and power logistics support are mission critical elements for the success of the Air Force ``Air Expeditionary Force Deployment'' concept. The Defense Department has long recognized that fuel cell power systems can reduce the logistics requirements for batteries and liquid fuels, and improve operational effectiveness of various military systems. The Air Force Research Laboratory is the original developer of a polymer membrane material that can improve performance and significantly lower the cost of fuel cells. Unfortunately, reductions in the FY 2000 Air Force Science and Technology budget threaten to terminate Air Force investments in fuel cell development. 
   I commend my good friend Chairman STEVENS and my good friend and colleague in the Senate, Senator INOUYE, the Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, for the Committee's efforts to adequately fund the Air Force's Science and Technology programs. 
   I believe that the Air Force should continue to pursue improvements to polymer processing technique and to transition the membrane material for fuel cell production. There are several specific missions and applications that will benefit from fuel cell technology including Air Expeditionary Force Deployment (AEFD), Aerospace Ground Equipment (AGE), Rapid Global Mobility (RGM) and battlefield computers that need to operate 16 to 32 times longer than heavy battery powered systems. In addition, future Air Force mission plans are based on space missions at or above the edge of the earth's stratosphere. In these missions fuel cells can play a major role in meeting the energy requirements and improving mission efficiency and effectiveness. 
   The commercial and military fuel cell market projections are significant--greater than $100 billion per year by the year 2006. Seldom is the opportunity for across the board dual use benefit for the government and commercial sector as vivid as it is for fuel cells. Chairman STEVENS, I'm sure that you will agree that the Air Force should pursue the prototype scale-up, optimization and full-scale demonstration of an advanced solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell that uses PBO based membranes.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today the Fenway Community Development Corporation in Boston is celebrating its twenty-fifth anniversary, and I congratulate the corporation on its impressive accomplishments. 
   The Nation's economy is currently enjoying the longest period of peacetime expansion in the nation's history. Today, more Americans than ever have access to quality education and productive jobs and careers. But that success is no cause for complacency. Too many of our fellow citizens and too many of our communities are not full participants in the nation's overall prosperity. For them, economic growth often means higher housing costs and pressures to move out of neighborhoods which have been their homes all their lives. 
   Twenty-five years ago, the Fenway Community Development Corporation was formed to do more to see that neighborhood development benefits the residents of the neighborhood. The Corporation stands proudly for the fundamental principle that local residents should enjoy the benefits of economic growth too, regardless of their incomes, and that neighborhood planning should always put people first. 
   Since 1973, the Fenway CDC has worked skillfully to improve the quality of life in the community, actively encouraging residents to participate in decisions that affect it. Under its leadership, residents from different cultures, age groups, and income levels have all come together for a better Fenway. I commend them for what they have done to empower people and strengthen the fabric of their neighborhoods. 
   A large part of this success comes from many activities to improve life in the Fenway. Protecting existing housing, actively seeking opportunities to develop affordable new housing, pursuing commercial development that meets the needs of the neighborhood--all of these are essential parts of the mission. 
   Other activities include homebuyer counseling--the afterschool programs and playground renovation for neighborhood youth through the Fenway Family Coalition--the computer training and job opportunities with local employers through the Walk to Work Program--and the Senior Task Force, which maintains affordable housing for low income elderly residents, as well as blood pressure screenings and recreation facilities available at the Peterborough Senior Center. All of these programs have contributed immensely to the quality of life in the Fenway neighborhood, and the Corporation deserve great credit for these achievements. 
   Fenway CDC is a respected leader of CDCs nationwide. I congratulate them for 25 years of skillful work and real results, and I know that the next 25 years will be just as successful.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will only take about 4 or 5. I believe that is what the Senator from New Jersey desires. But I have not heard from him this morning. I think we could at least present the amendment, and I will speak briefly. I am trying to get the Senator from New Jersey here at the present time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   This is an amendment on behalf of myself and Senators LAUTENBERG, BROWNBACK, GORDON SMITH, MOYNIHAN, SCHUMER, TORRICELLI, MIKULSKI, and KYL. This amendment states the sense of the Congress that UN Security Council sanctions against Libya should not be lifted until Libya meets all conditions specified in UN Security Council Resolutions 731, 748, and 883, and urges the Secretary of State to use all diplomatic means necessary to prevent sanctions from being lifted before these conditions are met. 
   On December 21, 1988, 270 people, including 189 U.S. citizens, were killed in the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 Flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. In 1991, Britain and the United States indicted two Libyan intelligence agents and sought their extradition from Libya to the United States or the United Kingdom to stand trial for this despicable act. Libyan leader Qadhafi refused to transfer the suspects, and the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Libya. 
   The sanctions in United Nations Security Council Resolutions 748 and 883 include a worldwide ban on Libya's national airline; a ban on flights into and out of Libya by other nations' airlines; a prohibition on supplying arms, airplane parts, and certain oil equipment to Libya, and a blocking of Libyan Government funds in other countries. 
   The Security Council demanded that Libya cease all support for terrorism and terrorist groups, turn over the two suspects, cooperate with the investigation and the trial, and address the issue of appropriate compensation for the victims' families before sanctions could be lifted. 
   Last month, after years of intensive diplomacy, a compromise was finally reached, and Colonel Qadhafi transferred the two suspects to The Netherlands, where they will be tried under a Scottish court, under Scottish law, before a panel of Scottish judges. The United Nations Security Council, in turn, suspended its sanctions against Libya that same day. 
   On or before July 5, the United Nations Secretary General will issue a report to the Security Council on the issue of Libya's compliance with the remaining conditions. I hope he will recommend that the sanctions against Libya should not be permanently lifted. 
   It is clear that Libya has only fulfilled one of the four conditions--the transfer of the suspects accused in the Lockerbie bombing--in the UN Security Council resolutions. Libya has not ceased its support for terrorist groups. The State Department's ``Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1998'' clearly states that Colonel Qadhafi ``continued publicly and privately to support Palestinian terrorist groups .....'' In addition, because the trial has not begun and is expected to last at least several months, it would be premature to conclude that Libya has fulfilled the other remaining conditions. 
   The amendment I am offering expresses our view that the United Nations Security Council should not permanently lift the sanctions against Libya, until Libya has fulfilled all of the remaining conditions in the Security Council resolutions. It also calls upon the Secretary of State to use all diplomatic means necessary, including the use of our veto at the U.N. Security Council, to prevent the Security Council from lifting sanctions against Libya until Libya fulfills all of the conditions. 
   The Secretary of State has steadfastly and commendably maintained a vigilant stand against Libya, and this amendment will provide the strong support of Congress for using all diplomatic means necessary, including the use of the veto, to block the lifting of the sanctions. 
   Mr. President, it would be a gross injustice to the Pan Am 103 families, who have suffered so much in this ordeal, to reward Libya for policies it has not fulfilled. We must all remain vigilant and make sure that justice is served in all of its aspects in the Lockerbie bombing trial. We must remain vigilant and make sure that Libya ceases--not just in words, but in deeds--its support for terrorist groups. 
   I know of no opposition to this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent my colleague, Senator LAUTENBERG, be able to retain his 5 minutes on this. 
   It is the intention, if I could ask the floor managers, to ask for the yeas and nays at the appropriate time for all the amendments. Am I correct?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the National Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2000. This past year has demonstrated once again how important it is for the nation to maintain a well-prepared military. There is no doubt that the Nation's armed forces are more active today than they were during cold war. Our servicemen and women are currently conducting combat operations in Kosovo and Iraq. They are serving as peacekeepers in Bosnia, and as humanitarian support personnel in Central America. All of this is taking place in addition to the day-to-day routine operations and exercises in which the military participates throughout the year in this country and in many other parts of the globe. 
   The Nation is also calling on its National Guard and Reserve units at an increased rate. This past year, Guard and Reserve units from Massachusetts were deployed in support of operation Northern Watch in Iraq, Hurricane Mitch relief in Central America, and most recently Operation Allied Force in the Balkans. Our country is proud of their service and grateful for the sacrifices that they, their families and their civilian employers are making for all of us. 
   Our armed forces continue to do all that is asked of them. This year, many of us in Congress have been concerned about the effects that these increased operations tempo are having on our service personnel and equipment. We have no doubt about the dedication and skills of our .14 million men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps who make our military the most capable fighting force in the world today. But there are increasing questions about whether they are receiving the full support they need to do their job well. 
   This bill addresses many of the current concerns about declining readiness, insufficient equipment, and inadequate recruitment and retention. It provides greater support for our military forces, while maintaining a realistic balance between readiness to take care of immediate needs, and the investments needed to develop and procure the best systems for the future. 
   The cornerstone of the Nation's military preeminence rests on many factors, but the most critical is its people. Without men and women willing to volunteer for military duty, the Nation would not be able to respond to crises around the globe as it does today. We need to have cutting-edge weapon systems, but we also need dedicated service members to operate these systems. It is imperative for us to provide effectively for our troops and their families. 
   Today's force is truly an all volunteer force. Its ranks contain well-educated professionals who have chosen to serve their country in the armed forces. We must treat them as professionals or we will lose them. 
   The bill provides a fully-funded and well-deserved 4.8% pay raise for military personnel, as well as expanded authority to offer additional pay and other incentives to critical military specialities. The bill also improves retirements benefits for those who are serving by addressing concerns with the current system and allowing servicemen and women to participate in a Thrift Savings Plan. 
   The bill also enhances the very successful Troops-to-Teachers Program. Troops-to-Teachers was established by Congress in 1993 and has enabled over 3,000 service men and women to go into the teaching profession. These teachers have filled positions in high-need schools in 48 states. The bill shifts the responsibility for this program to the Department of Education in order to see that it is coordinated as effectively as possible with our overall education reform initiatives. 
   Well over half of today's military is married. In many cases both parent are employed. The military also contains many single mothers and fathers. Each of these constituencies has unique characteristic and need that must be recognized so that we can encourage continued service and careers in the Nation's armed forces. 
   The bill contains a provision which I strongly support to authorize the Secretary of Defense to provide financial assistance for child care services and youth programs for members of the armed services. These expanded provisions will ensure that many more military families have access to adequate child care and worthwhile activities for their children. 
   The Nation's service men and women operate in a demanding and stressful environment that is being exacerbated by the increased operations of the last decade. One unfortunate result has been an increase in domestic violence involving military families. We have a responsibility to these families to help them cope more effectively with this problem. An important provision in this year's bill require the Secretary of Defense to appoint a military-civilian task force to review domestic violence in the military. In addition, the bill takes other steps to guarantee that the Services are more sensitive to this problem and take steps to prevent it. 
   This bill also moves on many fronts to address modernization requirements that have been deferred for too long. As the ranking member on the Seapower Subcommittee, I am pleased that this bill takes needed steps to ensure that the Nation's naval forces have the vessels and equipment they need to sustain naval operations throughout the world. 
   The bill authorizes the extension of the DDG-51 destroyer procurement for fiscal year 2002 and 2003 and increases multiyear procurement from 12 to 18 ships. The bill also authorizes the Navy to enter into a 5-year multiyear procurement contract for the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet. In addition, it increases the budget request for the Marine Corps' MV-22 Osprey tilt-rotor aircraft from 10 to 12. These are all strong steps in strengthening the readiness of the Nation's Navy-Marine Corps team. 
   Last year, the Defense authorization bill called for a 2 percent annual increase in military spending on science and technology from 2000 to 2008. Unfortunately, the Department's proposed Fiscal Year 2000 budget reduced spending on science and technology programs. The Air Force, alone, was slated for $95 million in cuts in science and technology funding. Such a decline would be detrimental to national defense, particularly when the battlefield  environment is becoming more and more reliant on technology. Fortunately, under the leadership of the Chairman of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Committee, Senator ROBERTS, this bill restores $70 million in Air Force Science and Technology funding, to ensure that sufficient scientists and engineers are available to conduct research to address the Defense Department's technology needs for the future. 
   One of the most important technology fields is in the area of cyber-security. The growing frequency and sophistication of attacks on the Department of Defense's computer systems are cause for concern, and they highlight the need for improved protection of the Nation's critical defense networks. This bill includes a substantial increase in research and development on defenses against cyber attacks. This increase will greatly improve the Department's focus on this emerging threat. 
   Existing threats from the cold war are also addressed in this legislation. The efforts to provide financial assistance to the former Soviet Union for nonproliferation programs such as the Nunn-Lugar Comprehensive Threat Reduction programs are essential for our national security. I commend the administration's plans to continue funding these valuable initiatives and the committee's support for them. 
   One of the greatest threats to our national security is the danger of terrorism, particularly using weapons of mass destruction. We must do all we can to prevent our enemies from acquiring these devastating weapons and from being able to conduct successful terrorist attacks on the Nation. Significant progress has been made toward strengthening the Nation's response to such attacks, but more must be done. This bill strengthens counter-terrorism activities and increases support for the National Guard teams that are part of this important effort. 
   I commend my colleagues on the committee for their leadership in dealing with the many challenges facing us on national defense. This measure is important to our national security in the years ahead and I urge the Senate to approve it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my deep concern over the kidnapping of Colombian Senator Piedad C&#243;rdoba de Castro. Senator C&#243;rdoba was abducted on May 21 by paramilitary forces under the command of Carlos Castan 6o. I urge the Government of Colombia to take all appropriate measures to obtain her safe release and to bring those responsible for this kidnapping to justice. 
   Senator C&#243;rdoba, as President of the Colombian Senate's Human Rights Commission, is a strong voice in Colombia for the promotion of human rights. She has also been a leader in efforts to bring peace to Colombia after fifty years of political violence. Senator C&#243;rdoba's role as a leading advocate of human rights and peace makes this crime particularly shocking.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to express my strong support for S. 303, the Satellite Home Viewers Act. This legislation will enable many more consumers in Massachusetts and across the nation to receive network signals by satellite. 
   The Act achieves a fairer balance between the interests of satellite TV firms, local broadcasters and cable firms. It reverses a federal court decision that has caused millions of satellite TV subscribers throughout the country, including in many rural areas of Massachusetts, to lose their access to network television stations. Consumers will be major winners with the passage of this legislation. It means greater choice, particularly to those in rural areas. 
   This legislation will also promote competition between the satellite and cable industries by enabling satellite providers to offer local broadcast signals in the same local market. In recent years, ``must carry'' rules have protected small broadcasters from being left by the wayside during the rapid growth of the cable industry. Similarly, this bill protects small broadcasters by requiring satellite carriers re-transmitting local signals to the local market to comply with the ``must carry'' rules by January 1, 2002. 
   Consumers everywhere will benefit from the passage of the Satellite Home Viewers Act. I commend Senator MCCAIN and Senator BURNS for their leadership in providing more choices and better service to consumers.

   Mr. KENNEDY. 
   Mr. President, it is a privilege to introduce President Clinton's proposal for reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the ``Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999,'' along with Senators DODD, DASCHLE, MURRAY, SCHUMER, LEVIN, and DORGAN. This is another strong step by the President to ensure that all children have the benefit of the best possible education. 
   Since 1993, President Clinton has consistently led the way on improving schools and making sure that all children meet high standards. 
   Today, as a result, almost every state has established high standards for its students. ``High standards'' is no longer just a term for academics experts and policy makers--it is becoming a reality for the nation's schools and students. 
   The recently released National Assessment of Title I shows that student achievement is improving--and that the federal government is an effective partner in that success. This result is good news for schools, good news for parents, and good news for students--and it should be a wake up call to Congress. We need to do more to build on these emerging successes to ensure that every child has the opportunity for an excellent education. 
   At dinner tables and boardrooms across America, the topic of discussion is education. As a result of the progress we have made the past few years, we can look at the education glass on the table and say it's ``half full''--not ``half empty'' as critics of public schools would have the country believe. 
   Since the reauthorization of Title I in 1994, a non-partisan Independent Review Panel of twenty-two experts from across the country has been overseeing the evaluation of the program. As the largest federal investment in improving elementary and secondary schools, Title I is improving education for 11 million children in 45,000 schools with high concentrations of poverty. It helps schools provide professional development for teachers, improve curriculums, and extend learning time, so that students meet high state standards of achievement. 
   Under the 1994 amendments to Title I, states were no longer allowed to set lower standards for children in the poorest communities than for students in more affluent communities. The results are clear. Students do well when expectations are set high and they are given the support they need and deserve. 
   Student achievement in reading and math has increased--particularly the achievement of the poorest students. Since 1992, reading achievement for 9-year- olds in the highest poverty schools has increased by one whole grade level nationwide. Between 1990 and 1996, math scores of the poorest students also rose by a grade level. 
   Students are meeting higher state standards. According to state-reported results, students in the highest poverty elementary schools improved in 5 of 6 states reporting three-year data in reading and in 4 out of 5 states in math. Students in Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Texas made progress in both subjects. 
   Many urban school districts report that achievement also improved in their highest-poverty schools. In 10 of  13 large urban districts that report three-year trend data, more elementary students in the highest poverty schools are now meeting district or state standards of proficiency in reading or math. Six districts, including Houston, Dade County, New York, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Francisco, made progress in both subjects. 
   Federal funds are increasingly targeted to the poorest schools. The 1994 amendments to Title I shifted funds away from low-poverty schools and into high-poverty schools. Today, 95 percent of the highest-poverty schools receive Title I funds, up from 80 percent in 1993. 
   In addition, Title I funds help improve teaching and learning in the classroom. 99 percent of Title I funds go to the local level. 93 percent of those federal dollars are spent directly on instruction, while only 62 percent of all state and local education dollars are spent on instruction. 
   The best illustrations of these successes are in local districts and schools. In Baltimore County, Maryland, all but one of the 19 Title I schools increased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The success has come from Title I support for extended year programs, implementation of effective programs in reading, and intensive professional development for teachers. 
   At Roosevelt High School in Dallas, Texas, where 80 percent of the students are poor, Title I funds were used to increase parent involvement, train teachers to work more effectively with parents, and make other changes to bring high standards into every classroom. Student reading scores have nearly doubled, from the 40th percentile in 1992 to the 77th percentile in 1996. During the same period, math scores soared from the 16th to the 73rd percentile, and writing scores rose from the 58th to the 84th percentile. 
   In addition to the successes supported by Title I, other indicators demonstrate that student achievement is improving. U.S. students scored near the top on the latest international assessment of reading. American 4th graders out-performed students from all other nations except Finland. 
   At Baldwin Elementary School in Boston, where 80 percent of the students are poor, performance on the Stanford 9 test rose substantially from 1996 to 1998 because of increases in teacher professional development and implementation of a whole-school reform plan to raise standards and achievement for all children. In 1996, 66 percent of the 3rd grade students scored in the lowest levels in math. In 1998, 100 percent scored in the highest levels. In 1997, 75 percent of 4th graders scored in the lowest levels in reading. In 1998, no 4th graders scored at 
   the lowest level, and 56 percent scored in the highest levels. 
   The combined verbal and math scores on the SAT increased 19 points from 1982 to 1997, with the largest gain of 15 points occurring between 1992 and 1997. The average math score is at its highest level in 26 years. 
   Students are taking more rigorous subjects than ever--and doing better in them. The proportion of high school graduates taking the core courses recommended in the 1983 report, A Nation At Risk, had increased to 52 percent by 1994, up from 14 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in 1990. Since 1982, the percentage of graduates taking biology, chemistry, and physics has doubled, rising from 10 percent in 1982 to 21 percent in 1994. With increased participation in advanced placement courses, the number of students that scored at 3 or above on the AP exams has risen nearly five-fold since 1982, from 131,871 in that year to 635,922 in 1998. 
   Clearly, the work is not done. These improvements are gratifying, but there is no cause for complacency. We must do more to ensure that all children have a good education. We must do more to increase support for programs like Title I to build on these successes and make them available to all children. 
   President Clinton's ``Educational Excellence for All Children Act of 1999'' builds on the success of the 1994 reauthorization of ESEA, which ensured that all children are held to the same high academic standards. This bill makes high standards the core of classroom activities in every school across the country--and holds schools and school districts responsible for making sure all children meet those standards. The bill focuses on three fundamental ways to accomplish this goal: improving teacher quality, increasing accountability for results, and creating safe, healthy, and disciplined learning environments for children. 
   This year, the nation set a new record for elementary and secondary student enrollment. The figure will reach an all-time high of 53 million students--500,000 more students than last year. Communities, the states, and Congress must work together to see that these students receive a good education. 
   Serious teacher shortages are being caused by the rising student enrollments, and also by the growing number of teacher retirements. The nation's schools need to hire 2.2 million public school teachers over the next ten years, just to hold their own. If we don't act now, the need for more teachers will put even greater pressure in the future on school districts to lower their standards and hire more unqualified teachers. Too many teachers leave within the first three years of teaching--including 30-50% of teachers in urban areas--because they don't get the support and mentoring they need. Veteran teachers need on-going professional development opportunities to enhance their knowledge and skills, to integrate technology into the curriculum, and to help children meet high state standards. 
   Many communities are working hard to attract, keep, and support good teachers--and often they're succeeding. The North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program has recruited 3,600 high-ability high school graduates to go into teaching. The students agree to teach for four years in the state's public schools, in exchange for a four-year college scholarship. School principals in the state report that the performance of the fellows far exceeds that of other new teachers. 
   In Chicago, a program called the ``Golden Apple Scholars of Illinois'' recruits promising young men and women into teaching by selecting them during their junior year of high school, then mentoring them through the rest of high school, college, and five years of actual teaching. 60 Golden Apple scholars enter the teaching field each year, and 90 percent of them stay in the classroom. 
   Colorado State University's ``Project Promise'' recruits prospective teachers from fields such as law, geology, chemistry, stock trading and medicine. Current teachers mentor graduates in their first two years of teaching. More than 90 percent of the recruits go into teaching, and 80 percent stay for at least five years. 
   New York City's Mentor Teacher Internship Program has increased the retention of new teachers. In Montana, only 4 percent of new teachers in mentoring programs left after their first year of teaching, compared with 28 percent of teachers without the benefit of mentoring. 
   New York City's District 2 has made professional development the central component for improving schools. The idea is that student learning will increase as the knowledge of educators grows--and it's working. In 1996, student math scores were second in the city. 
   Massachusetts has invested $60 million in the Teacher Quality Endowment Fund to launch the 12-to-62 Plan for Strengthening Massachusetts Future Teaching Force. The program is a comprehensive effort to improve recruitment, retention, and professional development of teachers throughout their careers. 
   Congress should build on and support these successful efforts across the country to ensure that the nation's teaching force is strong and successful in the years ahead. 
   The Administration's proposal makes a major investment in ensuring quality teachers in every classroom, especially in areas where the needs are greatest. It authorizes funds to help states and communities improve the recruitment, retention, and on-going professional development of teachers. It will provide states and local school districts with the support they need to recruit excellent teacher candidates, to retain and support promising beginning teachers through mentoring programs, and to provide veteran teachers with the on-going professional development  they need to help all children meet high standards of achievement. It will also support a national effort to recruit and train school principals. 
   In recognition of the national need to recruit 2.2 million teachers over the next decade, the Administration's proposal will fund projects to recruit and retain high-quality teachers and school principals in high-need areas. The Transition to Teaching proposal will continue and expand the successful ``Troops to Teachers'' initiative by recruiting and supporting mid-career professionals in the armed forces as teachers, particularly in high-poverty school districts and high-need subjects. 
   The proposal holds states accountable for having qualified teachers in the classroom. It requires that within four years, 95 percent of all teachers must be certified, working toward full certification through an alternative route that will lead to full certification within three years, or are fully certified in another state and working toward meeting state-specific requirements. It also requires states to ensure that at least 95 percent of secondary school teachers have academic training or demonstrated competence in the subject area in which they teach. 
   Parents and educators across the country also say that reducing class size is at the top of their priorities for education reform. It is obvious that smaller class sizes, particularly in the early grades, improve student achievement. We must help states and communities reduce class sizes in the early grades, when individual attention is needed most. Congress made a down-payment last year on helping communities reduce class size, and we can't walk away from that commitment now. 
   The Educational Excellence for All Children Act authorizes the full 7 years of this program, so that communities will be able to hire 100,000 teachers across the country. 
   We know qualified teachers in small classes make a difference for students. There is also mounting evidence that the President and Congress took the right step in 1994 by making standards-based reform the centerpiece of the 1994 reauthorization. In schools and school districts across the country that have set high standards and required accountability for results, student performance has risen, and the numbers of failing schools has fallen. 
   Nevertheless, 10 to 15 percent of high school graduates today--up to 340,000 graduates each year--do not continue their education. Often, they cannot balance a checkbook or write a letter to a credit card company to explain an error on a bill. Even worse, 11 percent of high school students never make it to graduation. 
   We are not meeting our responsibility to these students--and it is unconscionable to continue to abdicate our responsibility. Every day, children--poor children, minority children, English language learners, children with disabilities--face barriers to a good education, and also face the high-stakes consequences of failing in the future because the system is failing them now. 
   Schools and communities must do more to see that students obtain the skills and knowledge they need in order to move on to the next grade and to graduate. If students are socially promoted or forced to repeat the same grade without changing the instruction that failed the first time, they are more likely to drop out. Clearly, these practices must end. 
   The Administration's proposal makes public schools the centers of opportunity for all children--and holds schools accountability for providing this opportunity. 
   It requires schools, school districts, and states to provide parents with report cards that include information about student performance, the condition of school buildings, class sizes, quality of teachers, and safety and discipline in their schools. These report cards give parents the information they need to see that their schools are improving and their children are getting the education they deserve. 
   The proposal also holds schools and districts accountable for children meeting the standards. The bill requires schools and districts to end the unsound educational practices of socially promoting children or making them repeat a grade. States must collect data on social promotion and retention rates as an indicator of whether children are meeting high standards, and schools must implement responsible promotion policies. The proposal is designed to eliminate the dismal choice between social promotion and repeating a grade. It does so in several ways--by increasing support for early education programs, by improving early reading skills, by improving the quality of the teaching force, by providing extended learning time through after-school and summer-school programs, and by creating safe, disciplined learning environments for children. 
   Last year in Boston, School Superintendent Tom Payzant ended social promotion and traditional grade retention. With extensive community involvement, Mayor Menino, Superintendent Payzant, and the School Committee implemented a policy to clarify for everyone--schools, teachers, parents, and students--the requirements needed to advance from one grade to the next, and to graduate from a Boston public school. 
   The call for a new promotion and retention policy came primarily from middle and high schools, where teachers were facing students who had not mastered the skills they needed in order to go on to a higher grade. Now, all students will have to demonstrate that they have mastered the content and skills in every grade. If they fail to do so, schools and teachers must intervene with proven effective practices to help the students, such as attending summer-school and after-school programs, providing extra help during the regular school day, and working more closely with parents to ensure better results. In ways like these, schools and teachers are held accountable for results. 
   The Administration's proposal gives children who have fallen behind in their school work the opportunities they need to catch up, to meet legitimate requirements for graduation, to master basic skills, and meet high standards of achievement. A high school diploma should be more than a certificate of attendance. It should be a certificate of achievement. 
   Finally, the President's proposal helps create safe, disciplined, and healthy environments for children. Last year, President Clinton led a successful effort to increase funding for after-school programs in the current year. But far more needs to be done. 
   Effective programs are urgently needed for children of all ages during the many hours they are not in school each week and during the summer. The ``Home Alone'' problem is serious, and deserves urgent attention. Every day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are left alone after school. Juvenile crime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juveniles in Orange County, California, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile gang crimes occur on schools days and peak immediately after school dismissal. Children left unsupervised are more likely to be involved in illegal activities and destructive behavior. We need constructive alternatives to keep children off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
   We need to do all we can to encourage communities to develop after-school activities that will engage children. The proposal will triple our investment in after-school programs, so that one million children will have access to worthwhile activities. 
   The Act also requires school districts and schools to have sound discipline policies that are consistent with the Individual with Disabilities Education Act, are fair, and are developed with the participation of the school community. In addition, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools and Communities Act is strengthened to support research-based prevention programs to address violence and drug-use by youth. 
   In order to develop a healthy environment for children, local school districts will be able to use 5 percent of their funds to support coordinated services, so that children and their families will have better access to social, health, and educational services necessary for students to do well in school. 
   In all of these ways and more ways, President Clinton's proposal will help schools and communities bring high standards into every classroom and ensure that all children meet them. Major new investments are needed to  improve teacher quality--hold schools, school districts, and states accountable for results--increase parent involvement--expand after-school programs--reduce class size in the early grades--and ensure that schools meet strict discipline standards. With investments like these, we are doing all we can to ensure that the nation's public schools are the best in the world. 
   Education must continue to be a top priority in this Congress. We must address the needs of public schools, families, and children so that we ensure that all children have an opportunity to attend an excellent public school now and throughout the 21st Century. 
   President Clinton's proposal is an excellent series of needed initiatives, and it deserves broad bipartisan support. I look forward to working with my colleagues to make it the heart of this year's ESEA Reauthorization Bill.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which will at long last remove the unfair ban on privately-funded abortions at U.S. military facilities overseas. This amendment will right a serious wrong in current policy, and ensure that women serving overseas in the armed forces can fairly exercise their constitutionally-guaranteed right to choose. 
   This is an issue of fundamental fairness for the large numbers of women who make significant sacrifices to serve our Nation. They serve on military bases around the world to protect our freedoms. In turn, it is our responsibility in Congress to protect theirs. It is wrong for us to deny these women who serve our country with such distinction the same medical care available to all women in the United States. Women who serve overseas should be able to depend on military base hospitals for their medical needs. They should not be forced to choose between lower quality medical care in a foreign country, or travelling back to the United States for the care they need. Congress has a responsibility to provide safe medical care for those serving our country at home and abroad. 
   Without proper care, abortion can be a life-threatening or permanently disabling procedure. This danger is an unacceptable burden to impose on the nation's dedicated servicewomen. They should not be exposed to substantial risks of infection, illness, infertility, and even death, when appropriate care can easily be made available to them. 
   This measure does not ask that these procedures be paid for with federal funds. It simply asks that servicewomen overseas have the same access to all medical services as their counterparts at home. 
   In addition to the health risks imposed by the current unfair policy, there is also a significant financial burden on servicewomen who make the difficult decision to have an abortion. The cost of returning to the United States from far-off bases in other parts of the world can often result in significant financial hardship for young women. Servicewomen in the United States do not have to bear this burden, since non-military hospital facilities are readily available. It is unfair to ask those serving abroad to suffer this financial penalty. 
   If military personnel are unable to pay for a trip to the United States on  their own, they often face significant delays while waiting for available military transportation. Each week, the health risks faced by these women increase. If there are long delays in obtaining a military flight, the women may decide to rely on questionable medical facilities overseas. As a practical matter, these women in uniform are being denied their constitutionally-protected right to choose. 
   A woman's decision to have an abortion is a very difficult and extremely personal one. It is wrong to impose an even heavier burden on women who serve our country overseas. Every woman in the United States has a constitutionally-guaranteed right to choose whether or not to terminate her pregnancy. It is time for Congress to stop denying this right to women serving abroad. It is time for Congress to stop treating service women as second-class citizens. I urge the Senate to support the Murray-Snowe amendment and end this flagrant injustice under current law.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator for offering this amendment. I am very hopeful that the Senate will adopt it. 
   I strongly support this amendment, and I commend Senator KERREY'S leadership on this important issue of nuclear arms control. His proposal is a significant step in moving forward on the stalled process of nuclear arms reductions. Now more than ever, given the present climate of tension in the world, it is essential for the United States to reactivate arms control discussions with the Russians. It is also critical that we demonstrate to the international community our willingness to engage in continued nuclear arms reductions. 
   This initiative offers us a major opportunity to break the current impasse  that is preventing significant reductions in the stockpiles of nuclear arms. In addition, it can help to revitalize the START II debate in the Russian Duma, and move us toward greater cooperation on this critical global security issue. 
   At the Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Military Readiness on January 5, I pressed senior military officials about spending priorities in the armed services, and questioned the need for maintaining strategic forces at the START I level. In response to my inquiries, the Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. J.L. Johnson, agreed that he would prefer to reduce the number of Trident submarines from START I levels, and see some of the money currently used to maintain strategic forces at old levels reallocated to meet current and more critical needs. This amendment will give us the opportunity to do so in other parts of our strategic arsenal as well. 
   As Senator KERREY noted, history demonstrates the benefits of this kind of initiative in arms control, and the impact that can be made by a modest but significant gesture. In September 1991, President Bush ordered that 1,000 U.S. warheads scheduled for dismantling under START I be taken off alert, before that treaty was every ratified. This action resulted in a reciprocal response from President Gorbachev, who just one week later, designated thousands of Soviet nuclear warheads for dismantling and took several classes of strategic systems off alert. 
   Three years after the Senate ratified START II, we still have not moved closer to the goals in that important treaty. Russia has yet to ratify this treaty, and a move by the United States toward meeting our START II goals may encourage the Russian Duma to take up its ratification, and move us closer to the creation of START III. 
   This is an important time in our relationship with Russia. Earlier this year, we passed a bill calling for the creation of a National Missile Defense System, conditioned on an amended ABM treaty negotiated with Russia. The best way that we can more toward a new ABM treaty and work to improve global security is by demonstrating to our Russian allies that we are committed to arms control--and an effective way to demonstrate this commitment is by passing this amendment. 
   Moving closer to implementation of START II will also provide significant savings for the American taxpayer. This amendment will open the door to savings in the cost of upkeep for many unnecessary weapons. In addition, the tritium in these weapons can be recycled, eliminating the need for production of new tritium and the associated production costs. 
   This amendment is a constructive effort to breathe new life into the stalled arms control negotiations, move us closer to achieving the goals of START II, and send a strong signal to Russia and the international community about our commitment to these goals. It will strengthen our ability to cooperate with Russia to combat the growing threat of rogue nuclear states, and to build a more comprehensive global security system. Reducing our military stockpile, even to START II levels, will not impair our national security in any way. As Admiral Johnson explained to us last January, this amendment is in the best interest of the armed services, and it will help us to meet more critical readiness needs. 
   I hope this amendment will be accepted. I commend the Senator for initiating it. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to be a sponsor of this important bill, and I commend Senator MIKULSKI for her leadership on this legislation to close the critical gaps in our imported food safety laws. 
   Citizens deserve to know that the food they eat is safe and wholesome, regardless of its source. The United States has one of the safest food supplies in the world. Yet every year, millions of Americans become sick, and thousands die, from eating contaminated food. Billions of dollars a year in medical costs and lost productivity are caused by food-borne illnesses. Often, the source of the problem is imported food. 
   We've heard recently about the thousands of cases of illness from Cyclospora in raspberries from Guatemala. But this high profile case is by no means the only case. 
   In 1997, school children in five states contracted Hepatitis A from frozen strawberries served in the school cafeterias. Fecal contamination is a potential source of Hepatitis A, and the strawberries the children ate came from a farm in Mexico where workers had little access to sanitary facilities. 
   Earlier this year, cases of typhoid fever in Florida were linked to a frozen tropical fruit product from Guatemala. Again, poor sanitary conditions appear to be at the root of the problem. 
   Gastrointestinal illness has been linked to soft cheeses from Europe. Bacterial food poisoning has been attributed to canned mushrooms from the Far East. 
   The emergence of highly virulent strains of bacteria, and an increase in the number of organisms that are resistant to antibiotics, make microbial contamination of food a major public health challenge. 
   Ensuring the safety of imported food is a huge task. Americans now enjoy a wide variety of foods from around the world and have access to fresh fruits  and vegetables year round. In 1997, the Food Safety Inspection Service of the Department of Agriculture handled 118,000 entries of imported meat and poultry. The FDA handled far more-- 2.7 million entries of other imported food. Current FDA procedures and resources allowed for less than two percent of those 2.7 million imports to be physically inspected. Clearly, we need to do better. 
   The authority of the FDA is not sufficient to prevent contaminated food imports from reaching our shores. The Agency has no legal authority to require that food imported into the United States is prepared, packed and stored under conditions that provide the same level of public health protection as similar food produced in the U.S. Under current procedures, the FDA takes random samples of imports as they arrive at the border. The imports often continue on their way to stores in all parts of the country while testing is being done, and it is often difficult to recall the food if a problem is found. Unscrupulous importers make the most of the loopholes in the law, including substituting cargo, falsifying laboratory results, and attempting to bring a refused shipment in again, at a later date or at a different port. 
   The legislation we are introducing today will give the Secretary of Health and Human Services the additional authority needed to assure that food imports are as safe as food grown and prepared in this country. 
   It will give the FDA greater authority to deal with outbreaks of food-borne illness and to bar further imports of dangerous foods until improvements at the source can guarantee the safety of future shipments. This authority covers foods that have repeatedly been associated with food-borne disease, have repeatedly been found to be adulterated, or have been linked to a catastrophic outbreak of food-borne illness. 
   It will close loopholes in the law and give the FDA better tools to deal with unscrupulous importers. 
   It will authorize the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to target resources toward enhanced surveillance and prevention activities to deal with food-borne illnesses, including new diagnostic tests, better training of health professionals, and increased public awareness about food safety. 
   Too many citizens today are at unnecessary risk of food-borne illness. The measure we are proposing is designed to reduce that risk as much as possible, both immediately and for the long term. We know that there are powerful special interests that put profits ahead of safety, but Americans need and deserve laws that better protect their food supply. This is essential legislation, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to see that it is enacted as soon as possible.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this amendment, which will at long last restore the reputations of two distinguished military officers who were unfairly scapegoated for the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor by Japan at the beginning of World War II--Admiral Husband E. Kimmel of the United States Navy and General Walter C. Short of the United States Army. 
   This amendment gives us an opportunity to correct a serious wrong in the history of that war. Admiral Kimmel and General Short were the Navy and Army commanders at Pearl Harbor during the attack on December 7, 1941. Despite their loyal and distinguished service, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame for the nation's lack of preparation for that attack and the catastrophe that took place. 
   Justice for these men is long overdue. Wartime investigations of the attack on Pearl Harbor concluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the command of Admiral Kimmel and our land forces under the command of General Short had been properly positioned, given the information they had received, and that their superior officers had not given them vital intelligence that could have made a difference, perhaps all the difference, in America's preparedness for the attack. These conclusions of the wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to protect the war effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification for ignoring these facts. 
   I first became interested in this issue when I received a letter last fall from a good friend in Boston who for many years has been one of the pre-eminent lawyers in America, Edward B. Hanify. As a young Navy lawyer and Lieutenant J.G. in 1944, Mr. Hanify was assigned as counsel to Admiral Kimmel. 
   As Mr. Hanify told me, he is probably one of the few surviving people that heard Kimmel's testimony before the Naval Court of Inquiry. He accompanied Admiral Kimmel when he testified before the Army Board of Investigation, and he later heard substantially all the testimony in the lengthy Congressional investigation of Pearl Harbor that followed by the Roberts Commission. In the 50 years since then, Mr. Hanify has carefully followed all subsequent developments on the Pearl Harbor catastrophe and the allocation of responsibility for that disaster. 
   I would like to quote a few brief paragraphs from Mr. Hanify's letter of last September, because it eloquently summarizes the overwhelming case for long undue justice for Admiral Kimmel. Mr Hanify writes:  
   The odious charge of ``dereliction of duty'' made by the Roberts Commission was the cause of almost irreparable damage to the reputation of Admiral Kimmel, despite the fact that the finding was later repudiated and found groundless. 
   I am satisfied that Admiral Kimmel was subject to callous and cruel treatment by his superiors who were attempting to deflect the blame ultimately ascribed to them, particularly on account of their strange behavior on the evening of December 6th and morning of December 7th in failing to warn the Pacific Fleet and the Hawaiian Army Department that a Japanese attack on the United States was scheduled for December 7th, and that intercepted intelligence indicated that Pearl Harbor was a most probable point of attack. Washington had this intelligence and knew that the Navy and Army in Hawaii did not have it, or any means of obtaining it. 
   Subsequent investigation by both services repudiated the ``dereliction of duty'' charge. In the case of Admiral Kimmel, the Naval Court of Inquiry found that his plans and dispositions were adequate and competent in light of the information which he had from Washington--adequate and competent in the light of the information he had from Washington.  
   Mr. Hanify concludes:  
   The proposed legislation provides some measure of remedial Justice to a conscientious officer who for years unjustly bore the odium and disgrace associated with the Pearl Harbor catastrophe.  
   I have also heard from the surviving son of Admiral Kimmel. He and others in his family have fought for over half a century to restore their father's honor and reputation. As Edward Kimmel wrote:  
   Justice for my father and Major General Short is long overdue. It has been a long hard struggle by the Kimmel and Short families to get to this point.  
   No public action can ever fully atone for the injustice suffered by these two officers. But the Senate can do its part by acting now to correct the historical record, and restore the distinguished reputations of Admiral Kimmel and General Short.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support Senator WELLSTONE's amendment to require states to collect data on the employment, jobs, earnings, health insurance, and child care arrangements of former welfare recipients. 
   This information is essential. The most important indicator of welfare reform's success is not just declining welfare caseloads. It is the well-being of these low-income parents and their children after they leave the welfare system. We do not know enough about how they have fared, and states should be required to collect this information. Millions of families have left the welfare rolls, and we need to know how they are doing now. We need information on their earnings, their health care, and other vital data. The obvious question is whether former welfare recipients are doing well, or barely surviving, worse off than before. 
   The data we do have about former welfare recipients is not encouraging. According to a study by the Children's Defense Fund and the National Coalition on the Homeless, most former welfare recipients earn below poverty wages after leaving the welfare system. Their financial hardship is compounded by the fact that many former welfare recipients do not receive the essential services that would enable them to hold jobs and care for their children. The cost of child care can be a crushing expense to low-income families, consuming over one-quarter of their income. Yet, the Department of Health and Human Services estimates that only one in ten eligible low-income families gets the child care assistance they need. 
   Health insurance trends are also troubling. As of 1997, 675,000 low-income people had lost Medicaid coverage due to welfare reform. Children comprise 62 percent of this figure, and many of them were still eligible for Medicaid. We need to improve outreach to get more eligible children enrolled in Medicaid. We also need to increase enrollment in the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which offers states incentives to expand health coverage for children with family income up to 200 percent of poverty. it is estimated that 4 million uninsured children are eligible for this assistance. 
   In addition to problems related to child care and health care, many low-income families are not receiving Food Stamp assistance. Over the last 4 years, participation in the Food Stamp Program has dropped by one-third, from serving nearly 28 million participants to serving fewer than 19 million. But this does not mean children and families are no longer hungry. Hunger and undernutrition continue to be urgent problems. According to a Department of Agriculture study, 1 in 8 Americans--or more than 34 million people--are at risk of hunger. 
   The need for food assistance is underscored by he phenomenon of increasing reliance on food banks and emergency food services. Many food banks are now overwhelmed by the growing number of requests they receive for assistance. The Western Massachusetts Food Bank reports a dramatic increase in demand for emergency food services. In 1997, it assisted 75,000 people. In 1998, the number they served rose to 85,000. Massachusetts is not alone. According to a recent U.S. Conference of Mayors report, 78 percent of the 30 cities surveyed reported an increase in requests for emergency food in 1998. Sixty-one percent of the people seeking this assistance were children or their parents; 31 percent were employed. 
   These statistics clearly demonstrate that hunger is a major problem. Yet fewer families are now receiving Food Stamps. One of the unintended consequences of welfare reform is that low-income, working families are dropping off the Food Stamps rolls. Often, these families are going hungry or turning to food banks because they don't have adequate information about Food Stamp eligibility.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Senate has spent the past week attempting to clean up the mess that our Republican colleagues have made over the gun show loophole. Now, again we have a chance to do the job correctly, by closing the gun show loophole the right way, not the NRA way. 
   As they say in the circus, it's a big job cleaning up after a big elephant, especially when the National Rifle Association is the trainer of the elephant. 
   The first two attempts by our Republican colleagues to close the gun show loophole were a travesty. They left the loophole open, and they created new loopholes while they were doing it. 
   While the Senate dithers, the need grows greater. Gun violence has struck again at one of the nation's schools--this time at a school in a suburb of Atlanta. 
   Enough is enough. We will decide today whether the United States Senate is serious about closing the gun show loophole, or whether we will continue to allow young people to have almost unlimited access to guns. 
   The Lautenberg amendment will close this deadly loophole in our gun laws, and close it all the way, not just part of the way. 
   The Smith amendment only goes part way. It closes the loophole our Republican friends opened for pawn shops last week--but it leaves unchanged the other serious loopholes that put guns in the wrong hands at gun shows. 
   Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close another major loophole they created last week--the 24 hour loophole, which makes a farce out of the background checks on gun purchasers. 
   These background checks have kept thousands of guns out of the hands of criminals and others who have no business owning guns. But the NRA opposes that law, so it wants to undermine it in a way that will protect illegal transactions at gun shows. 
   The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole too. 
   Our Republican colleagues still refuse to close a third loophole they created last week, which makes it much more difficult for police to trace guns used by criminals. They have set up a new class of gun dealers called ``special registrants,'' who can sell as many guns as they want to anyone they want, without keeping the records needed to trace guns used in crimes. 
   The Lautenberg amendment closes this loophole, too. 
   Since the tragedy in Littleton, parents and children across the country have lived in fear that their school--their community--could be next. Now, it has happened in Georgia. On some days in recent weeks, parents have kept their children away from school in an effort to shelter them from violence. 
   Families cannot continue to live this way--in constant fear that their children and their school could be the next gun battleground. 
   There is only one way to close the gun show loophole, and that's to adopt the Lautenberg amendment. 
   In a few minutes, we will have two important votes. The Senate can act on the urgent needs of the American people, or it can continue to play ostrich--head in the sand, ignoring the national crisis of gun violence. 
   It is clear that the overwhelming majority of the American people want Congress to pass responsible gun control measures. Eighty-nine percent of the people say that it is important for this country to pass stricter gun control laws. 
   Now, we have the opportunity to get it right. Gun laws work. The facts speak for themselves. It is time--long past time--for the Senate to act, to say enough is enough is enough is enough. 
   I thank the Senator from New Jersey and hope his amendment will be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a significant provision in the 1999 Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill will enable the Justice Department to pay for the travel expenses of the Pan Am 103 families who wish to attend the upcoming Lockerbie bombing trial in The Netherlands this summer. Existing law prevents the Department from using federal funds to pay for this travel. 
   Under this provision, the Justice Department's Office of Victims of Crime will be able to use an existing reserve fund to pay for the transportation costs, lodging, and food at government per diem rates for immediate family members of the Pan Am 103 victims. The Department also plans to establish an 800 number and a web site to keep family members informed during the trial. In addition, the Department plans to establish a compassion center, staffed with counselors, at the base in The Netherlands where the trial will be held, in order to help the families cope with the emotional strains of the trial. 
   The families of the victims of this terrorist atrocity have been waiting for more than ten years for justice. They have suffered the deep pain of losing their loved ones, and that pain has been compounded by the Libyan Government's refusal for many years to surrender the suspects accused of the bombing. Now the suspects are finally in custody and the trial will begin soon. We can never erase the pain of the loss that the families have suffered, but we can enable them to attend the trial and see that justice is finally done. I commend the House and Senate conferees for including this important provision to help these long-suffering families.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, an important provision in the Statement of the Managers on the 1999 Kosovo Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Act recommends $13 million above the administration's request for the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. It also recommends $10 million more than the administration requested for the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund. 
   The conferees on this legislation have recommended these additional resources to help support a more effective human rights response to the Kosovo crisis. Many of us are deeply concerned over the escalation of human rights abuses in Kosovo since the breakdown of the Rambouillet negotiations. The additional funding for the War Crimes Tribunal will enable it to expand its investigative efforts to see that justice is done. 
   Justice Arbour has made a strong case that this funding is needed immediately for forensic investigative teams, mass grave exhumations, investigations, Albanian translators, equipment, and other associated costs. America is the strongest support of the War Crimes Tribunal, and it is essential for us to provide provide the additional resources the tribunal needs without delay to ensure that those responsible for the gross violations of international law in Kosovo are brought to justice. 
   I also strongly support the work of the State Department's Human Rights and Democracy Fund. The HRDF's ability to respond quickly to emergencies has enabled the Department to begin documenting mass executions, rape, deportations, and torture. Unfortunately, its resources are stretched thin as a result of the large scale of these atrocities. 
   the additional funds recommended by Congress for the HRDF will enable the State Department to enhance its ability to obtain information promptly and methodically from fleeing refugee victims and witnesses and provide the information to the U.S. Government, the War Crimes Tribunal, and the public to ensure that those responsible for these atrocities will be held accountable. 
   The funds will also enable the State Department to provide documents to refugees whose passports, identity papers, and property titles were stripped from them when Serb forces compelled them to leave Kosovo. Doing so will help counter President Milosevic's cynical policy of ``identity cleansing'' and facilitate the return of the refugees to their homes. The funds are also intended to enhance our government's efforts to ensure that victims receive proper counseling for the unconscionable trauma they have suffered. 
   I commend the conferees for making these additional resources available to achieve an effective human rights response on Kosovo.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I rise to support Senator HARKIN in his amendment to reduce juvenile crime by helping schools to maintain safe environments while ensuring that troubled students get the help they need. 
   Students who bring guns or other dangerous weapons to school should be removed. But they should also be provided with the appropriate interventions and services. 
   This amendment clearly supports the removal of a child from school who carries or possesses a weapon, including a child with a disability. 
   This amendment clearly supports an agency reporting a crime committed by a child, including a child with a disability, to the appropriate authorities. 
   This amendment clearly supports law enforcement and judicial authorities in exercising their responsibilities with regard to crimes committed by a child, including a child with a disability. 
   But this amendment, unlike the Frist-Ashcroft amendment, will ensure that immediate, appropriate interventions, including mental health services, are provided to a troubled child. 
   We know that when educational services for students are stopped, those students show increased drop out rates, increased drug abuse, and increased rates of juvenile crime and incarceration.  
   I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of the Harkin-Kennedy amendment. It will help to ensure that our schools remain conducive to learning and our communities remain safe.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support Senator KERRY's amendment on early childhood development. The nation's highest priority should be to ensure that all children begin school ready to learn. Our governors realized this a decade ago when they said that the country's number one goal should be to prepare all children to enter  school ``ready to learn.'' We aren't going to meet our school readiness goals by the year 2000, but we must do all we can to reach this objective soon. We cannot afford to let another decade pass without investing more effectively in young children's educational development. 
   As we debate how to prevent youth violence, it is gratifying that Senators on both sides of the aisle are recognizing the importance of investing in children while they are young. During these early, formative years, constructive interventions have the potential to make the greatest impact. Early learning programs--including pre-kindergarten, Early Head Start, Head Start, and other activities for young children--are building blocks for success. Scientific research confirms that in the first few years of life, children develop essential learning and social skills that they will use throughout their lives. 
   Quality early education stimulates young minds, enhances their development, and encourages their learning. Children who attend high quality pre-school classes have stronger language, math, and social skills than children who attend classes of inferior quality. Low-income children are particularly likely to benefit from quality programs. 
   These early skills translate into greater school readiness. First graders who begin school with strong language and learning skills are more motivated to learn, and they benefit more from classroom instruction. Quality early education programs also have important long range consequences and are closely associated with increased academic achievement, higher adult earnings, and far less involvement with the criminal justice system. 
   Investments in these programs make sense, and they are cost effective as well. Economist Steven Barnett found that the High/Scope Foundations' Perry Preschool Project saved $150,000 per participant in crime costs alone. Even after subtracting the interest that could have been earned by investing the program's funding in financial markets, the project produced a net savings of $7.16--including more than $6 in crime savings--for every dollar invested. 
   At risk 3 and 4 years olds in the High/Scope program were one-fifth as likely, by age 27, to have become chronic lawbreakers, compared to similar children randomly assigned to a control group. In other words, failure to provide these services multiplied by 5 times the risk that these infants and toddlers would grow up to be delinquent teenagers and adults. 
   Over 23 million children under 6 live in the United States, and all of these children 
   deserve the opportunity to start school ready to learn. To make this goal a reality, we must make significant investments in children, long before they ever walk through the schoolhouse door. Our children cannot wait, nor can we. 
   In March, Senator STEVENS and I introduced a bill, S. 749, cosponsored by Senators DODD, JEFFORDS, and KERRY, to create an ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' to improve funding for early education programs. This bipartisan bill provides states with $10 billion over 5 years to strengthen and improve early education programs for children under 6. By increasing the number of children who have early learning opportunities, we will ensure that many more children begin school ready to read. The ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' will provide each state with resources to strengthen and improve early education. 
   Governors will receive the grants, and communities, along with parents, will decide how these funds can best be used. Grants will be distributed based on a formula which takes into account the relative number of young children in each state, and the Department of health and Human Services will allocate the funds to the states. To assist in this process, governors will appoint a sate council of representatives from the office of the governor, other relevant state agencies, Head Start, parental organizations, and resource and referral agencies--all experts in the field of early education. The state councils will be responsible for setting priorities and approving and implementing state plans to improve early education. 
   One of the great strengths of the ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' is its flexibility. States will have the flexibility to invest in an array of strategies that give young children the building blocks to become good readers and good students. Essentially, our proposal does four things: (1) it enhances educational services provided by current child care programs and improves the quality of these programs; (2) it builds on the momentum of states like Georgia and New York, which are expanding their pre-kindergarten services; (3) it expands Head Start to include full-day, full-year services to help children of working parents begin school ready to learn; and (4) it ensures that children with special needs have access to as wide a range of these services as possible. 
   This legislation will give communities what they have been asking for--funding for coordinated services to ``fill in the gaps.'' Communities needs this so-called ``glue'' money to strengthen their early education services, and this approach will give them much needed support. As a result, many more children will benefit and begin school ready to learn, ready to reach their full potential. 
   The nation's future depends on how well today's children are prepared to meet the challenges of tomorrow. If we are serious about improving our children's lives, I urge my colleagues to support the Early Learning Trust Fund that Senator STEVENS and I will bring to the floor soon.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, during the debate and discussion here on the floor of the Senate in regard to the prosecution of Federal crimes, and also during the period of the Judiciary Committee, I think we ought to really set the record straight. The record was set straight in the Judiciary Committee by the Attorney General, but it has been misrepresented here on the floor of the Senate by those who ask why are we considering this amendment when we are not really prosecuting all the gun laws on the books with regard to this 
   and somehow suggesting that those of us who are concerned about the easy access of weaponry to children and criminal elements in our society really should pay more attention to the prosecutions and doing something to make it more difficult for children and for those who should not own the weapons to own them. 
   The fact is, overall firearms prosecutions are up. Although the number of Federal prosecutions for low-level offenders--persons serving sentences of 3 years or less--is down, the number of higher-level offenders--those serving sentences of 5 or more years--is up by nearly 30 percent in recent years. 
   At the same time, the total number of Federal and State prosecutions is up sharply. About 25 percent more criminals are sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992, 20,000 to 25,000. 
   As the Attorney General pointed out, those that ought to be handled at the local level are being handled by State prosecutors, and those that are more serious are being handled by Federal prosecutors. That record has been made in the Judiciary Committee. Maybe those who oppose this kind of common sense gun legislation get some kind of thrill out of misrepresenting the facts. The facts have been laid out by the Attorney General before the Judiciary Committee and they are as I have stated them, and as represented by the Justice Department. 
   By misrepresenting and saying total prosecutions by the Federal Government are down, they are telling half the story. They are not saying what is happening in State and local prosecutions. When you look at State prosecutions, local prosecutions, and Federal prosecutions, they are up, and up significantly. I think we ought to put that aside. 
   We are making worthwhile progress in the Senate on these gun control issues. I join in paying tribute to my colleagues--Senator LAUTENBERG, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, and others on both sides of the aisle--who have been advancing sensible and responsible and what I call common sense recommendations. That is what they are. They are common sense recommendations which, when put into effect, are going to reduce the opportunity for easy access to weapons which are too often used either accidentally or intentionally, perhaps even in the increased incidents of suicide, or purposely by children or young people in this country. 
   One of the most important measures, which is before us, is closing the gun show loophole and closing it not just part way but all the way. As was pointed out, last week the Senate failed twice to close that flagrant loophole, and the inadequate amendments adopted were riddled with so many loopholes of their own that the country was outraged by the Senate's hypocrisy. 
   Now, on the third try, we have a chance to do the job right and close the gun show loophole lock, stock, and barrel. 
   The gun show loophole is a hole below the waterline of our gun control laws. It makes a mockery of responsible gun control. Yet, the initial attempt by our Republican friends to close it was a travesty, as has been pointed out. 
   It left the gun show loophole wide open. It created a pawnshop loophole. It reduced background checks from 3 business days to 24 hours, including Sundays. It allowed the interstate sale of firearms, potentially undermining State laws across the country. It prevented gun tracing. And it created a sweeping immunity for gun sellers. 
   That action was the Senate at its irresponsible worst. It is time for us to stop buckling to the gun industry and do what is right. 
   There is a real chance that the tragedy in Littleton would never have happened without the easy access to guns that the gun show loophole supplies. 
   One incredible statistic summarizes the magnitude of the 
   problem we face. In 1996, the most recent year for which information is available, handguns were used to murder 9,390 people in the United States. 
   I might mention why it is difficult to get gun figures. We are using 1996 figures because the power of the NRA prohibits the Centers for Disease Control from collecting that information. The only way they can get the information is to look at the death certificates, and that is enormously costly and takes an incredible amount of time. We are prohibited--the country is prohibited--from actually having the most recent and accurate information about gun deaths. If it is not a problem, why does the National Rifle Association oppose us in having that kind of information? And they have opposed it. They prohibit us from getting that information, so we use the 1996 figures--9,390 people in the United States. 
   In countries with tough gun control laws, the firearm homicide rate is over 97 percent lower--97 percent. The number of handgun murders in 1996 were 2 in New Zealand, 15 in Japan, 30 in Great Britain, 106 in Canada, and 213 in Germany. The case for strong gun control is overwhelming. It saves lives. It  saves children. It saves whole communities. 
   Another shocking statistic makes the same point. Each day across America, 13 more children die from gunshot wounds. That is the equivalent of one Littleton each day, every day somewhere in America. 
   How can the Senate continue to play ostrich--head in the sand, ignoring this overwhelming need? How many more Littletons do we need? How many more wake-up calls will it take? When will we finally do what it takes to keep children safe and stop sleepwalking through crisis after crisis after crisis after crisis of gun violence? 
   If the Senate cannot even close the gun show loophole, we may well be condemning communities across the country to a future Littleton tragedy of their own. 
   It is wrong for the Senate to say that easy access to guns had nothing to do with what happened at Columbine High School. It is wrong for the Senate to whistle past the graveyard of Littleton. It is wrong for the Senate to pretend to make minor adjustments in the gun laws when gaping loopholes, like the gun show loophole, needs to be closed. It is wrong for the Senate to give the National Rifle Association a veto over the reforms that cry out to be taken in the wake of that tragedy. 
   Littleton shocked the conscience of the country, and it finally seems to have shocked the conscience of the Senate. It is clear that the Senate should return to the gun show loophole and try again to close it before more innocent lives are lost. And, like closing the gun show loophole, there are other urgent steps that need to be taken. 
   Gun laws work. The facts speak for themselves. It is long past time for the Senate to act to say enough is enough. 
   We know many examples of how tough gun laws, in combination with other preventive measures, are having a direct impact in reducing crime. In Massachusetts, we have some of the strongest gun laws in the country. There are tough restrictions on carrying concealed weapons. Local law enforcement has discretion in issuing the permits required by law, and an individual must show a clear need.  
   The minimum age for sale of handguns across the board is 21. 
   There are increased penalties for felons who possess firearms. 
   Adults are liable if a child gets an improperly stored gun and uses it to kill or injure himself or someone else. 
   Firearms must be stored with child safety locks. 
   We have a gun-free schools law. 
   We have enhanced standards for licensing of gun dealers. 
   A permit is required for private sales. 
   Saturday night specials are banned. 
   Lost or stolen firearms must be reported. 
   These are common sense requirements that save lives and impose no problem whatsoever for legitimate hunters and sports persons. 
   Look at what has happened in terms of firearm homicides in Boston. These figures are reflected across our Commonwealth. We have seen in 1993, 65; 62 in 1994; 64 in 1995; and then 39, 24, 26, 4. So far this year, there has not been a single youth homicide in 128 schools. Tough law enforcement, tough gun control, tough preventive action. That is what we stand for. And the results are out there. 
   When we compare States with strong gun laws to those that have weak gun laws, the differences are significant. 
   In 1996, for Massachusetts, the number of gun deaths for persons 19 years old or younger was 2 per 100,000. 
   In States that have the weakest gun laws, the numbers were significantly higher: 5.9 gun deaths per 100,000 in Indiana; 9.2 gun deaths per 100,000 in Mississippi; 5.1 gun deaths per 100,000 in Utah; 6.9 gun deaths per 100,000 in Idaho--2 gun deaths per 100,000 in Massachusetts. 
   It is clear that strong gun laws help reduce gun violence, yet when Democrats have proposed steps to take guns out of the hands of young people--proposals that would save lives--the Senate has too often said no. 
   The overwhelming majority of the American public wants to pass reasonable gun control measures. 
   The American people clearly want these common sense laws on the books, and they will just as clearly hold Congress accountable if we fail to act or only pretend to act. The lesson of the Senate's past failed attempts to close the gun show loophole is clear: The American people will hold us accountable if we refuse to act. Nothing concentrates the minds of Members of Congress like the knowledge that they are about to be hung out to dry at the next election. So let's concentrate on closing the gun show loophole and the other blatant loopholes in the Nation's gun laws. 
   Just finally, I put in the RECORD that the ATF has examined the number of crime guns traced during 1996 and 1997 to federally licensed firearm dealers and to federally licensed pawnbrokers. While 13 percent of the federally licensed dealers had one or more crime guns traced to them, 35 percent of the federally licensed pawnbrokers had one or more crime guns traced to them. 
   It seems that everything cries out for this particular amendment. Let's take action and do what is right for the children in America, the families in America, and to reduce violence in America. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 4 minutes. 
   Mr. President, this amendment is harmless, though I question how effective and useful it is. 
   It provides for some coordinated mental health services at the level. But there is already some limited mental health coverage in the underlying bill. And I find it interesting that the Senator from Missouri rejected our proposal to give SAMHSA the resources to really do the job. 
   The amendment provides for background checks on school employees. That's already allowable under current law. 
   It allows schools to require uniforms. There is nothing to prohibit that now. 
   It creates a Commission on Character. That is fine. 
   But if we really wanted to make a difference, we would fulfill the commitment made last year to reduce class sizes by hiring 100,000 new teachers. Teachers should not have to do crowd control. 
   If we really wanted to make a difference, we would help communities build new classrooms and schools and modernize their facilities. This means smaller classes and smaller schools, so teachers and school officials get to know the children they teach. You have heard of ``road rage.'' Well some schools have ``hall rage,'' where hallways are so crowded they actually increase violence in schools. 
   If we really wanted to make a difference, we would expand after school programs to attend to children in the afternoons--keeping them off the streets and out of trouble. Each day, 5 million children are left home alone after school, and that is unacceptable. 
   If you asked parents what is most important to reducing youth violence--uniforms or smaller classes--I am certain that smaller classes would win hands down. 
   If you asked parents what is most important--a character commission or after school programs--the after school programs would win hands down. 
   If you asked parents what is most important--to reiterate that you can conduct background checks on teachers or building more classrooms and better classrooms--the better classrooms would win hands down. 
   So I see nothing harmful in this amendment, but I hope we can get to the real issues that concern parents and communities--smaller classes, better schools, more after school programs. 
   I withhold the remainder of the time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, there is no need for this amendment. IDEA already contains provisions to ensure that schools are able to remove truly dangerous children from the classroom. But it also ensures that these children receive the services they need--not only educational services, but counseling, behavior modification, and other related services--so that their bad behavior will hopefully not happen again. This makes more sense than simply sending kids out of the streets, which is exactly what the Frist-Ashcroft amendment proposes to do. 
   The worst example of what happens when students are sent home without necessary services happened last year in Springfield, Oregon. When Kip Kinkle brought a weapon to school, he was immediately suspended. He went home with his gun, killed his parents, then returned to school and started firing. 
   The greatest protection a school can provide to its students and community is to be aware of the warning signs of danger and provide the services that can prevent the student from using violence. 
   Why would we want to strip those very protections from our schools and communities by amending IDEA to end all services to students with disabilities? In fact, why don't we have these protections in place regarding all children, not just those children served under IDEA? 
   Although several of our colleagues here today have pointed to all sorts of horror stories allegedly involving IDEA students, I would urge my colleagues to be get the facts straight.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are offering an amendment to the juvenile justice bill to authorize funding for the National Institutes of Health to carry out a broad-based initiative for basic research into youth violence. This research will look into the fundamental cause of such violence and will be linked to research on the most effective ways to prevent it. 
   Clearly, we must do more to enhance our understanding of the fundamental psychological, behavioral, and social factors that contribute to violence by young people.  
   NIH currently provides modest support for behavioral research related to violence, but the research is seriously under-funded in light of the obvious magnitude of the problem. In addition, the current funding is spread across many NIH Institutes and some important areas are not funded at all. 
   This coordinated initiative, relying on the Office of Behavioral and Social Sciences Research at NIH, will enable NIH to respond more quickly to the crisis of youth violence, eliminate the gaps in current knowledge, and focus more effectively on the important high priority questions that scientists in the field have identified. 
   Violence is also a public health problem, and it is as perilous as any epidemic. The tragic shooting rampage by the two students in Colorado shocked the country into a greater sense of urgency about youth violence. Many elements contribute to violent behavior, and it is seldom traced to any single cause. 
   These causes need to be better understood if we are to design effective methods for treatment and prevention. We also need a greater understanding of how to apply the knowledge that we already have. 
   More effective school, family and community prevention activities can be designed on the basis of what we learn from research and from the practical experience of clinicians, educators, and social scientists. The goal of part of this research effort will be to develop better organizational models of effective partnerships among scientists, public agencies, and community members. The research will also address the psychological impact of violence on the victims, since many perpetrators of violence were themselves victims of violence earlier in their lives. 
   Our proposal for greater NIH research is an essential part of the answer we are seeking to the tragedies of juvenile violence, and I urge the Senate to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we have been engaged over the last week in the important, and at times difficult, task of defining how the nation will address the problem of youth violence and crime. Our goal is to develop steps that will be more effective in protecting society against juvenile crime and enabling youth to become productive and successful members of our society. 
   We must also protect the rights of the men and women in the criminal system responsible for working with juvenile offenders. It is in the nation's interest to ensure that states which receive federal dollars for their juvenile justice programs administer these programs in a manner that protects the worker, the juvenile offender, and ultimately, the taxpayers and citizens. 
   This amendment will ensure that workers who provide juvenile justice services do not lose their jobs, their existing bargaining rights, or a loss of benefits if their program receives federal funds. 
   This is not a new concept. Since enactment of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act in 1974, Congress has recognized the importance of making sure that the rights of state workers are protected in juvenile justice programs funded with federal money. Current law provides that the distribution of federal funds for state juvenile justice programs will not displace workers, negatively reduce their wages, or impair existing collective bargaining agreements. 
   The intent of the current law, and of this amendment, is two-fold: to protect workers' rights, and to protect the safety of juvenile offenders. For almost 25 years, the law has protected the employment rights of tens of thousands of state workers in the court system and the juvenile justice system. These men and women, whose jobs are funded through grants to the states, are at the core of our juvenile justice system. They perform vital work, supervising and training troubled youths in the courts and in the parole system. Even with the protections under current law, and even when workers are covered by collective bargaining agreements, these are not high paying jobs. Salaries go from the high teens to the low thirty thousand dollar range. 
   The law also ensures the quality of the services provided by these workers. Protecting the rights of current, experienced workers maintains the stability of the workforce and ensures that well-trained, qualified personnel are staffing the juvenile justice system. If we are serious about protecting society against violent youth--if we are serious about rehabilitating young people and safely returning them to society, then we need well-trained and experienced workers and a stable workforce with adequate skills and training in our juvenile justice system. 
   This amendment will make sure that existing collective bargaining agreements, and the rights under those agreements, would not be disturbed when a state program receives a federal grant. The amendment will prevent displacement of current workers when a program receives a federal grant. For workers who are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement, this amendment may be the only job protection they have when their program is funded under a federal grant. 
   We all agree that the juvenile justice system must be improved. Let's also agree that preserving the existing rights of state juvenile justice workers, and preventing disruption of existing employment relationships, are essential components that must be part of an improved system. I urge my colleagues to vote for this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support GREGG's ``Partnerships for High Risk Youth'' amendment. This amendment establishes a national demonstration project to identify the most effective practices and programs for reducing youth violence. This initiative will provide 12 high-risk cities across the nation with funds to carry out local demonstration projects. These initiatives will help us learn much more about the best programs for reducing youth violence. Communities across the country will benefit from the knowledge. 
   The most successful violence prevention programs take a comprehensive approach to youth violence. The goal is to reach out to youth and their families on a variety of levels. Diverse groups--law enforcement, schools, mental health professionals, religious organizations, parents, and teachers--all need to join forces. This amendment supports this vital type of cooperation. The knowledge we gain will save lives. Communities across the country will be able to learn from these successful models and develop similar programs in their own towns and cities. 
   Boston has long understood the importance of community cooperation, and many of the ideas we have discussed have proven effective there. Boston's strategy is based on three strong commitments--tough law enforcement, heavy emphasis on crime prevention (including drug treatment), and effective gun control. Neglect of any one of these commitments undermines the whole strategy. 
   Several years ago, concerned groups in Boston joined forces to develop community-based solutions that made youth violence ``everyone's business.'' Successful partnerships have included the pairing of mental health professionals, police and probation officers and school administrators with clergy, community leaders, and even gang members themselves. Statistics show that this strategy works. During the period from July 1995 through December 1997, there was only one juvenile death in Boston that involved a firearm. 
   Boston's Ten Point Coalition has received national acclaim for its work with troubled youth. This is exactly the type of program that Senator GREGG's amendment will support. The Ten Point Coalition which was founded by Rev. Eugene Rivers, is an ecumenical group of clergy and lay leaders who are working to mobilize the community on issues affecting African-American youth--especially those at risk. The Coalition is committed to helping at-risk children reach their full potential, and it offers training, technical assistance, resource development, and networking opportunities to churches and other community groups interested in mentoring, advocacy, economic alternatives, and violence prevention. Its goal is to build a coalition of churches nationwide, united in their commitment to changing children's lives and reducing violence. 
   This amendment will help outstanding initiatives like this across the country, and I urge the Senate to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, for the past several days, we have debated the best practices and programs for preventing youth violence. We have disagreed on a number of issues including the need to restrict guns, invest in after-school care, and expand counseling services and mental health services for troubled youths and children. But there is one issue that members on both sides of the aisle agree on--parents play an important role in their children's lives. 
   Everywhere we look, children are under assault: from violence and neglect; from the break-up of families; from the temptations of alcohol, tobacco, sex, and drug abuse; from greed, materialism, and the media. These are not new problems, but in our time, they have become increasingly serious. Against this bleak backdrop, the struggle to raise children and to support families, emotionally as well as practically, has become more difficult. 
   Parents bear the first and primary responsibility for their sons and daughters--to feed them, to shelter them, to talk to them, to teach them to ride a bike, to encourage their talents, to help them develop physically and emotionally, and to make countless daily decisions that influence their growth and development. 
   Parents are the most important influence in their children's lives, but they are being pulled in many different directions. Healthy development depends on strong parental guidance. Spending time together is an essential part of building positive parent-child relationships. Yet time together is increasingly scarce. 
   Parents are eating fewer meals and having fewer conversations with their children. Between 1988 and 1995, a significant drop took place in parent-child activities. Sixty-two percent of mothers reported eating dinner with their child on a daily basis in 1988, but only 55% reported doing so in 1995. Fifty percent ate dinner with their child in 1988, but this rate dropped to 42% in 1995. 
   We need to support parents, not attack and blame them. Sylvia Hewlett and Cornel West said it best in the title of their recent book, ``The War Against Parents.'' That's exactly how it feels for many of today's parents. Like parents before them, they struggle to keep children at the center of their lives. But major obstacles stand in their way, undermining their efforts. 
   Over the course of the last thirty years, public policy and private decision-making have often tilted heavily against the activities that comprise the essence of parenting. A myopic government increasingly fails to protect or support parents, while the competitive forces in the marketplace are allowed to take up more and more time. We talk as though we value families but act as though families are a last priority. Sooner or later, worn-out parents get the message that devoting their best time to raising children is a lonely, thankless undertaking that cuts against the grain of other activities that are apparently valued more highly by society. 
   Last week, I spent time in Boston talking to students about violence and other issues affecting their lives. I asked them whether they felt their parents were too busy to talk to them--and 3/4ths of the students raised their hands. 
   Parents need to spend more time listening to children--and the nation agrees. A recent Newsweek poll asked, ``How important is it for the country to pay more attention to teenagers and their problems?'' Eighty-nine percent of those polled replied that it is very important. If parents are not raising their children, we need to worry about who is. 
   The wrong kind of parenting can cause problems as well. Inconsistent or overly harsh discipline, may lead children to develop aggressive behavior. Inconsistent discipline is often associated with poor behavior in school and at home. These children also tend to have more trouble establishing strong relationships with their family, their teachers and their fellow students. 
   Parenting and coaching classes can make a significant difference in avoiding such problems. A recent study published in the American Psychological Association's Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology found that mothers who participated in Head Start parenting programs showed a decrease in their use of harsh criticism and an increase in their use of positive and competent discipline. The children were happier and their behavior was more satisfactory than children whose mothers did not receive parenting education. 
   When parents have the skills to deal effectively with their children, they are less likely to be abusive. Unfortunately, too many parents lack these essential skills. Each year over 3 million children are identified as victims of abuse or neglect. The consequences are devastating. Traumatized children are more likely to have alcohol and substance abuse problems and learning problems. They are also more likely to be arrested as juveniles and to engage in abusive behavior toward their own children when they become parents.  
   We know that suffering abuse as a child is strongly related to subsequent delinquency and abusive behavior later in life. But improved parenting skills can help break this vicious cycle. Parenting support and education have been proven to reduce abuse. In the Prenatal and Early Infancy Project, high-risk mothers were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group received visits by specially trained nurses who provided coaching in parenting skills and other advice and support. The other group received no services. For those who received the assistance, child abuse was reduced by 80% in the first 2 years. 15 years after the services ended, these mothers had only one-third as many arrests, and their children were only half as likely to be delinquent. 
   Law enforcement officials also recognize the benefits of training parents. More than 9 out 10 police chiefs (92%) agreed with the statement, ``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more in programs to help children and youth get off to a good start'' by ``fully funding Head Start for infants and toddlers, preventing child abuse, providing parenting training for high-risk families, improving schools, and providing after school programs and mentoring.'' 
   These law enforcement officers are right. Parenting classes in conjunction with early education programs improve caregiver skills they also reduce crime dramatically and they reduce the likelihood of later delinquent behavior. A High/Scope Foundation study at the Perry Preschool in Michigan provided at-risk 3 and 4 year-olds with a quality Head Start-style preschool program, supplemented by weekly in-home coaching for parents. Two decades later years later, by age 27, those who had been denied the services as toddlers were five times more likely to be chronic lawbreakers. 
   A similar program in Syracuse provided child development and health services for at-risk infants and toddlers and parenting support for their mothers and fathers. The study found that kids denied the services were ten times more likely to be delinquent by age 16. 
   We pay a high price for abuse and neglect. In addition to its damaging psychological consequences, it is estimated that $22 billion is spent each year on services for abused children, their families, and foster care families. Investing in prevention programs, particularly parent support and education, will significantly reduce these abuse-related expenditures. 
   There is no question that investing in parents will pay-off. When we don't make this investment, we all pay more later, not just in terms of lives and fear, but also in tax dollars. 
   The ``Parenting As Prevention'' Act, which Senator STEVENS and I are proposing, will fund several initiatives that will improve parenting skills. 
   To identify the best parenting practices, a National Parenting Support and Education Commission will be established. The Commission will identify the most effective parenting practices, including the best strategies for disciplining children and youth, the best approaches for building integrity and character, and the best techniques for ensuring healthy brain development. 
   The Commission will also conduct a review of existing parenting support and education programs, and will provide Congress and the Administration with a detailed report of its findings. Perhaps, most important, essential parenting information will also be provided to parents--no new family will leave a hospital or adoption agency without information on how to best care for a baby. In Massachusetts, such an initiative is already underway. 
   Our amendment also supports the establishment of a grant program to strenghthen state initiatives for supporting and educating parents. Block grants will go directly from the Department of Health and Human Services to the states. Each state will establish their own Parenting Support and Education Council to award local grants. States will use their funds to establish support and education resource centers for parents and to strengthen support programs for children and teenagers. The grant program will support a wide variety of parental support initiatives including: home visitation for mothers of new babies; the distribution of parenting and early childhood development materials; the development of support programs for parents of young children and teenagers; respite care for parents of children with special needs; and the creation of a national toll free number that will offer counseling and referral services for parents. 
   Finally, our amendment will improve mental health services for violence-related stress. Regional centers around the country will be established to provide special training and research in psychological counseling and treatment. We know that the early years are essential to healthy development and that inadequate care during this critical period can have a devastating impact on future behavior. To reverse the impact of negative early experiences, regional centers on psychological and trauma response will identify the best practices for dealing with these problems. In the long run, successful early intervention is the best way to modify the culture of violence instilled in so many youth. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. Investing in parents and children is one of the best ways to prevent youth violence and we clearly need to do more in order to achieve this important goal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I want to first of all, thank my friend and colleague, Senator WELLSTONE, for offering this amendment and say that I welcome the opportunity to join with him and urge the Senate to accept this amendment, and to say that I think it is very basic and fundamental to the underlying purpose of the legislation, which is to try to deal with the challenge of juvenile violence in our country today. 
   Mr. President, the fact is that we should not have to be taking the time of the Senate on this amendment, because I am sure, as Senator WELLSTONE has pointed out, that this language which we are attempting to place into the juvenile justice bill is effectively the language that has been there since 1992. It was placed there as a result of extensive hearings that were held by Congress and the Senate--during that period of time--that showed the disparity of treatment between blacks and whites in the juvenile justice system. There is a range of different aspects of this particular provision. 
   I say at the outset that we will include in the RECORD a very comprehensive review on the constitutionality of this issue. It is 
   interesting to hear that argument raised at this particular time, because the language has been in effect since 1992 and not challenged on a constitutional basis. It has just been mentioned during the course of this evening. 
   But, Mr. President, we should not look at this particular undertaking really in the abstraction of just juvenile justice. What we have to understand is that we as a country inscribed  slavery in the Constitution of the United States, and we have been trying to free ourselves from that admonition for some 200 years. We fought a civil war over it. 
   Over the very recent times, with the leadership of Dr. King and many others in the late 1950s and 1960s, we began to make some very important progress in knocking down the walls of discrimination. But still those elements of bigotry exist. Why else would we have the greatest number of hate crimes against blacks in our society? That happens to be a fact. We don't like it. We don't want it. We all deplore it. We are going to try to address that with hate crimes legislation. It is not going to solve all of the problems, but we are going to at least try to recognize that this is an issue. 
   Why is it that even after all the legislation we have passed to try to have fair and equitable employment on the basis of an individual's value and what they can do in terms of their skills in doing a job, why is it that we still find those barriers out there to knock out blacks and Hispanics and individuals whose skin is not white? That happens to be the case. We don't have to make that case tonight on the floor of the Senate. 
   Why, in 1988, did we have to revisit the Housing Act that we passed in 1968? Because of the continuation of racism in housing. 
   To listen to the Senator from Utah, you would think, maybe we do have problems there, but we don't have any problems in juvenile justice. Where are the studies? What studies have they looked at? That is just absolutely preposterous. That is absolutely preposterous. It exists in each of these areas I have mentioned. It exists in the criminal justice system. It exists between individuals who are white and black, out there tonight on the interstate highways, where you have racial profiling and where the number of people who are pulled over because their skin is black is sometimes four, five, six, seven times what it is if someone else's skin is white--and done over a long period of time. They can't demonstrate any higher percentage of incidents of violations of the law, not in terms of the growth percentage, but just in the incidental percentages. You can make that case. That is happening everywhere. 
   We had provisions in the juvenile justice that say to communities that we hope you will be encouraged to try to see in the areas of juvenile justice what we might be able to do--to try to see if we can't stem some of this problem among the young people in our society. 
   Why should we always have to wait until this problem exists? Why can't we try to see what can be done in the early days of young people to see what progress might be made? 
   This has not been used as a way or device to terminate funding for any of the States. You can't say that. You can't demonstrate that. If we had a fair time to talk about this and to debate it, you would find that States are making important progress in many different areas to try to deal with fundamental and underlying causes in their various communities. That is what we want to encourage--quiet, competent, effective work that is being done that can have an impact in terms of trying to make our juvenile justice system fair and equitable for all of the young people in our society. 
   Mr. President, this issue is of such importance, to be brought back in the time of the evening with the limitations I think really does a disservice to the importance of it. But we are where we are. 
   Let me mention the particular quote from the director of our Massachusetts Department of Youth Services, Mr. Miller, a very thoughtful, distinguished leader in terms of understanding the problems of juvenile justice. This is what Mr. Jerome Miller wrote about the cumulative effect of decisions made throughout the juvenile justice process:  
   I learned very early on that when we got an African American youth, virtually everything, from arrest summaries to family history to rap sheets to psychiatric exams to waiver hearings as to whether he would be tried as an adult, the final sentence was skewed. The middle-class white youth sent to us was more likely to be dangerous than the African American teenager with the same label. Usually the white kid had been afforded competent legal counsel, appropriate psychiatric and psychological testing, been tried in a variety of privately funded options, and all in all had been dealt with more sensitively and individually at every level of the juvenile justice process. For him to be labeled dangerous, he usually had to have done something very serious, indeed. By contrast, the African American teenager was dealt with by stereotype from the moment the handcuffs were first put on, to be easily and quickly moved along to the most dangerous end of the violent/nonviolent spectrum, albeit accompanied by an official record meant to validate the series of decisions.  
   It goes on and on. 
   That is the state of the juvenile justice system in too many constituencies across this country. All this language does is remind us when we are talking about using the word ``justice,'' we are talking about equal justice, equal justice for blacks and browns in our system, equal justice for young people, equal justice for all. 
   Fundamentally, when we understand the problems we have in our society, to represent here on the floor of the Senate that somehow the juvenile justice system is an exception to all the kinds of challenges that we have in this Nation, fails, I think, the basic reason and rationality about what is going on in this country. It is not the accepted. 
   That is the effect of this, to try and not prescribe quotas, not get into the numbers game. That has never been part of the accusation on this provision, but just to hope that communities and States will, hopefully, develop a process and system that will be somehow more sensitive to the challenges we are facing as a country, as a community and in our States in juvenile justice. 
   This amendment cannot solve the problem and it won't even probably solve the majority of the problem, but perhaps because of it, there will be communities and there will be States that will have a truer system of justice for all the young people of this country. That is really what we ought to be undertaking and what we should be about. 
   The statistics on the treatment of minorities in the criminal justice system require an immediate response--especially the treatment of juveniles. I strongly support this amendment and I commend Senator WELLSTONE for his leadership. It deals with one of the most serious problems in current law--the disproportionate confinement of minority youths in state juvenile justice systems. In fact, the underlying bill will only make the problem worse, because it eliminates all references to ``minority'' or ``race'' and instead refers only to ``segments of the juvenile population.'' 
   In 1988, after extensive testimony concerning the significant over representation of minority youth in state juvenile justice systems, Congress amended the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act to require states to address this issue. In the 1992 amendments to the Act, disproportionate confinement became a core requirement, by linking future funding to a State's compliance with addressing this basic issue. 
   Under current law, states are required to do three things: (1) identify the extent to which disproportionate minority confinement exists in their states; (2) assess the reason that it exists; and (3) develop intervention strategies to address the causes. The law does not require and has never resulted in the release of juveniles. It does not require numerical quotas for arrest or release of any youth from custody based on race. In fact, no state's funding has ever been reduced as a result of non-compliance with this provision. 
   This issue has festered in the juvenile justice system for years. To pretend otherwise is to ignore the facts. Over the past 10 years, documented evidence shows that disproportionately occurs at all stages of the system: 
   African-American youth age 10-17 constitute only 15% of the U.S. population. But they account for 26% of juvenile arrests, 32% of the delinquency referrals to juvenile court, 41% of juveniles detained in delinquency cases, 46% of juveniles in secure corrections facilities, and 52% of juveniles transferred to adult criminal court after judicial hearings. 
   As these statistics indicate, the over representation of minority youth increases as juveniles become more and more involved in the criminal justice system. The result is that African-American youths are twice as likely to  be arrested and seven times as likely to be placed in a detention facility as white youths. 
   Black males are 6 times more likely to be admitted to state juvenile facilities for crimes against persons than white youths--4 times more likely for property crimes--and 30 times more likely for drug offenses. 
   Black youths are also much more likely to end up in prison with adult offenders. In 1995, nearly 10,000 juvenile cases were transferred to adult criminal court, and black youths were 50% more likely to be transferred than white youths. 
   A study of the juvenile justice system in California found that minority youth consistently receive more severe punishment than white youth, and are more likely to be incarcerated in state institutions than white youth for the same offenses. 
   A 1998 University of Washington study confirms the justice within the juvenile system Narrative reports prepared by probation officers prior to sentencing portrayed black juveniles differently from white juveniles. 
   Black youth offenders were perceived as having character defects--condoning criminal behavior. 
   White youth offenders were perceived as victims of bad circumstances. 
   For example, two 17-year-old boys, one black and one white, are charged with first degree robbery. Neither had a criminal history; both used firearms and were accompanied by two friends. Listen to the probation officers' evaluation of the two boys--keeping in mind that 99% of the time, judges follow the recommendation of probation officers: 
   For the African-American youth, the probation officer wrote:  
   This appears to be a pre-meditated and willful act by Ed. ....... There is an adult quality to this referral. In talking with Ed, what was evident was the relaxed and open way he discusses his lifestyle. There didn't seem to be any desire to change. There was no expression of remorse from the young man. There was no moral content to his comment.  
   For the white youth, the probation officer wrote:  
   Lou is the victim of a broken home. He is trying to be his own man, but ..... is seemingly easily misled and follows other delinquents against his better judgment. Lou is a tall emaciated little boy who is terrified by his present predicament. It appears that he is in need of drug/alcohol evaluation and treatment.  
   In 1993, Allen Iverson--who is the NBA's leading scorer and so far has led his team to the second round of the playoffs--was a senior in high school in Virginia. At the time, he was the top rated high school point guard and quarterback in the nation. One night, he and a group of other friends, all of whom were black, went to a local bowling alley and a racially-motivated fight broke out after a white kid directed a racial epithet toward Iverson. Although punches and chairs were thrown by both blacks and whites during the fight, no white kids were arrested or charged with a crime. Iverson, however, was convicted of ``maiming by mob'' and was sentenced to 15 years in prison with 10 years suspended. He was denied bail pending the appeal, even though felons convicted of more heinous crimes were routinely granted bail. 
   It was not until then-Governor Wilder granted Iverson partial clemency, that he was released from jail. He then went on to play basketball for John Thompson at Georgetown. He then left for the NBA where he became the first-round draft pick of the Philadelphia 76'ers. The only reason why Allen Iverson's case has a happy ending is because he is a star athlete. Otherwise, he would still be in jail like the thousands of other young black men who find themselves behind bars in much larger numbers than their white peers. 
   It is wrong to deny minority youth the right to fair treatment by the criminal justice system. Yet this legislation says to the African-American community, the Hispanic community and other minorities that Congress will continue to look the other way while minority youths are confined at disproportionately high rates by the current system. 
   What this bill says to minorities is that although we recognize that your children are more likely to be arrested than their white counterparts, we don't care, that although your children are being referred to juvenile court and adult court, at significantly higher rates than white youths, we're turning our backs on you. 
   It is essential for this legislation to retain fair requirements to deal effectively with this crisis. Current law does not require the release of juveniles. It does not require incarceration quotas. It does not require any other specific change of policy or practice. It does not take prevention money away from white youths and give it to minorities. 
   Disproportionate minority confinement is a serious problem requiring an ongoing and continuous effort to achieve a juvenile justice system which treats every youth fairly, regardless of race or background. 
   Examples of what the states are doing to address this challenge are numerous. In Pennsylvania, the State Commission on Crime and Delinquency provided funds to initiate prevention and intervention programs, including: 
   A drop-out prevention program; a program to help young minority females learn work and life skills; a program to decrease the delinquency rate and increase the level of school retention and success among targeted youth through life skills workshops, tutoring and homework assistance, physical fitness and sports, community service projects, and monthly parent group meetings. 
   By contrast, the underlying legislation encourages states to prosecute even more juveniles as adults. It allows records of juvenile arrests--not necessarily convictions--to be made available to schools, colleges and vocational schools. It requires school districts to mandate policies to mandate expulsion from school for regular possession of drugs, alcohol, or even tobacco. 
   The consequences of disproportionate minority confinement are harsh and unacceptable: 
   The Sentencing Project reported that 1/3 of all African-American males age 20-29 in the United States are under the jurisdiction of the criminal justice system--either in jail, in prison, on probation, or on parole. 
   The juvenile justice system often acts as a feeder system for minority youth into the adult criminal justice system. 
   In most states, the result of an adult felony conviction is the loss of voting rights. 1 in 7 of the 10 million black males of voting age are now either currently or permanently disenfranchised from voting-diluting the political power of the African-American community. 
   A significant impact of arrest or incarceration is often the reduction of future wage earning and employability. One study showed a 25% reduction in the number of hours worked over the next 8 years. 
   The truly tragic consequences of disproportionate minority confinement are removal of large numbers of potential wage earners, a disruption of family relationships and a growing sense of isolation and alienation from the larger society. These statistics only give us a small glimpse of the harsh consequences. They don't begin to tell the story of young black youth being targeted, harassed, intimidated, and treated differently because of their race. 
   The United Methodist Church has said that ignoring discrimination in juvenile sentencing *.*.* is `careless, callous, and discriminatory enforcement of law.' '' 
   Ed Blackmon, Jr., Mississippi State House of Representatives, has said the ``So many of these young people have great potential for overcoming their troubles, and becoming successful young men and women in their communities. However, with the absence of good legal representation, and families that are not `well-connected', they find themselves locked up, with very little hope.'' 
   Kweisi Mfume, President and CEO of the NAACP, has said, ``The fact that S. 254 eases the requirement that states address the disproprotionatly high numbers of children of color in juvenile detention facilities is, in itself, a crime.'' 
   Marian Wright Edelman, Founder of the Children's defense fun, has said ``With troubling reports of police brutality and racial profiling, Congress must continue to work with the states to ensure that the juvenile justice system affords our youth equitable and fair treatment, and not repeal the previous decade's worth of progress.''  
   This past weekend, in her address to the National Conference on Public Trust and Confidence in the Justice System, Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor emphasized the need for racial equality and better legal representation, and called for improvements in family and juvenile courts. She also cited a 1999 survey entitled ``How the Public Views the State Courts''. According to that survey, 70% of African-American respondents said that African-Americans as a group, receive ``Somewhat Worse'' or ``Far Worse'' treatment from the courts than whites. A substantial number of whites agreed with this assessment. 
   As Justice O'Connor so aptly stated, ``Concrete action must be taken'' to erase racial bias. 
   At the very least, we cannot offered to retreat from the requirements of current law that the states must recognize and address this festering problem. To do less is unacceptable. I urge the Senate to accept our amendment and do the right thing on this critical issue of racial justice.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the 1992 Carnegie Corporation report, ``A Matter of Time,'' called for a major national investment in after-school programs for youth. It said, ``Risk can be transformed into opportunity for our youth by turning their non-school hours into the time of their lives.'' 
   But, we have not done enough to give children the kind of opportunities they need after school. Just ask children if this is true. 
   Amy, age 14, said ``Sometimes there are so many things you can't do. I can't have company or leave the house. If I talk on the phone, I can't let anyone know I'm here alone. But I really think they've figured it out, you know.'' 
   Cindy, age 16, said, ``We need someone to listen to us--really take it in. I don't have anybody to talk to, so when I have a problem inside, I just have to deal with it myself. I wish there would be more adults that ask questions because that shows that they care and want to know more.'' 
   Each day, 5 million children, many as young as 8 or 9 years old, are left home alone after school. Children unsupervised are more likely to be involved in anti-social activities and destructive patterns of behavior. 
   We also know that juvenile delinquent crime peaks in the hours between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m. A recent study of gang crimes by juvenviles in Orange County, California, shows that 60 percent of all juvenile gang crimes occur on school days and peak immediately after school dismissal. 
   We need to do all we can to encourage communities to develop activities that will engage children and keep them off the streets, away from drugs, and out of trouble. 
   Crime survivors, law enforcement representatives, and prosecutors have joined together in calling for a substantial federal investment in after-school activities. Over 450 of the nation's leading police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, and leaders of local fraternal orders of police, which represent over 360,000 police officers, have called upon public officials to provide more after-school programs for school-age children. 
   Clearly, financial assistance is needed for such activities in states across the country. Too often, parents cannot afford the thousands of dollars a year required to pay for after-school care, if it exists at all. In Massachusetts, 4,000 eligible children are on waiting lists for after-school care, and tens of thousands more have parents who have given up on getting help. Nationwide, half a million eligible children are on waiting lists for federal child care subsidies. The need for increased opportunities is obvious and this amendment helps to meet it. 
   Senator BOXER's plan will triple the funds for the 21st Century Community Learning Center initative so that more than 1 million children each year will have access to safe and constructive after-school activities. It also strengthens the current program by including mentoring, academic assistance, and anti-drug, anti-alcohol, and anti-gang activities as allowable uses of the funds. 
   Additional federal support is essential for communities across the country. This year, the initiative was funded at $200 million. Over 2,000 applicants from across the country submitted proposals to the U.S. Department of Education for that assistance--but only 184 new grants could be funded. We must do more to meet the high demand for after-school programs across the country. 
   Communities are working hard to provide these after-school activities for children--but they can't do it alone. They want Uncle Sam to be a strong partner in the effort. 
   Boston's 2:00-to-6:00 After-School Initiative was created in 1998 to expand and enhance quality after-school programs across the city. It has already succeeded in increasing the number of school-based after-school programs by nearly 50 percent. A total of 43 programs now serve over 2,000 students. This year, Mayor Menino has pledged to open 20 more school-based programs. Boston and communities like it throughout the country deserve more assistance in meeting these needs. 
   Federal support under the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program is helping to meet these needs. Last year, Boston received $305,000 to help the Lewis Middle School and the Tobin Community Middle School in Roxbury, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Middle School in Dorchester to create after-school programs for children. 
   Springfield received $315,000 to expand their ``Time Out for Communities'' initiative that is helping the Springfield Public Schools to provide after-school programs to 15,000 students, in conjunction with the Springfield Libraries and Museums, the YMCA, Springfield College, and other organizations in the community. 
   Worcester received $3.6 million over 3 years to support ten community centers that will serve 4,000 students and 5,000 community members. The Worcester after-school program, called the ``Community Learning Centers for Worcester's Children of Promise,'' will provide a wide range of services, including academic support to help students meet state academic standards; drug and violence prevention programs; information on family health; day care for school-age children; tutoring and mentoring; access to technology for students and their families; summer activities; and adult education. 
   But much more needs to be done in Massachusetts and across the country, if we are going to keep children safe and help them succeed in school. 
   We know that after-school programs work. In Waco, Texas, students participating in the Lighted Schools program  have demonstrated improvement in school attendance and decreases in juvenile delinquent behavior over the course of the school year. Juvenile crimes have dropped citywide by approximately 10 percent since the program began. 
   The Baltimore City Police Department saw a 44 percent drop in the risk of children becoming victims of crime after opening an after-school program in a high-crime area. A study of the Goodnow Police Athletic League center in Northeast Baltimore found that juvenile arrests dropped by 10 percent, the number of armed robberies dropped from 14 to 7, assaults with handguns were eliminated, and other assaults decreased from 32 to 20 from 1995 to 1998. 
   In addition to improved youth behavior and safety, quality after-school programs also lead to better academic achievement by students. At the Beech Street School in Manchester, New Hampshire, the after-school program has improved reading and math scores of students. In reading, the percentage of students scoring at or above the basic level increased from 4 percent in 1994 to one-third in 1997. In math, the percentage of students scoring at the basic level increased from 29 percent to 60 percent. In addition, Manchester saved an estimated $73,000 over three years because students participating in the 
   after-school program avoided being retained in grade or being placed in special education. 
   One student in the Manchester program said, ``I used to hate math. It was stupid. But when we started using geometry and trigonometry to measure the trees and collect our data, I got pretty excited. Now I'm trying harder in school.'' 
   In Georgia, over 70 percent of students, parents, and teachers agreed that children received helpful tutoring through The 3:00 Project, a statewide network of after-school programs. Over 60 percent of students, parents, and teachers agreed that children completed more of their homework and the homework was better prepared because of their participation in the program. 
   One 7th-grade student from Georgia said, ``I just used to hang out after-school before coming to The 3:00 Project. Now I have something to do and my school work has improved!'' 
   In 1996, over half of the students who attended Chicago's summer program raised their test scores enough to proceed in high school. 
   As Mayor Daley of Chicago said, ``Instead of locking youth up, we need to unlock their potential. We need to bring them back to their community and provide the guidance and support they need.'' 
   We should do all we can to improve and expand after-school opportunities--the nation's children deserve no less. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, a recent article in the New York Times demonstrates the importance of clinical trials in treating cancer and the serious problems that patients and researchers are now facing because of the lack of adequate enrollment in these trials. 
   Clinical trials are the primary means of testing new therapies for serious diseases. In fact, these trials may be the only available treatment for patients whose conditions have failed to respond to conventional therapies. 
   The survey by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists discussed in the article found that less than five percent of cancer patients in the country are enrolled in clinical trials--although 20 percent are eligible to participate and would often receive better quality care if they did. As the article points out, ``Patients who participate receive at least state-of-the-art treatment and often get to take advantage of otherwise unavailable approaches.'' 
   Several barriers exist to enrolling patients in clinical trials. But a critical element is the increasing reluctance of HMOs and other managed care plans to allow their enrollees to participate in such trials or to pay the routine hospitals costs of their participation is a critical element. Until recently, health insurance routinely paid for the doctor and hospital costs associated with clinical trials. But managed care is reducing that commitment. Today, managed care plans often will not permit their patients to enroll in clinical trials, and they will not pay for their participation when they choose to do so on their own. 
   The American Association of Health Plans--the HMO trade association--has recognized that plans should encourage patients to participate in clinical trials, where medically appropriate. But, too often, there is little or no participation. 
   The decision to enter a clinical trial should be made by the treating physician and the patient. Yet the survey showed that only about half of eligible patients are even told such trials are available.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to join with Senator DASCHLE in expressing our heartfelt thoughts to the members of her family. Meg Greenfield put up an extraordinary fight against cancer for a very long period of time and did so with incredible bravery and extraordinary elegance, style, and class. 
   For the past two decades, she was the editor of the editorial page at The Washington Post, and in her long and brilliant career, the editorial page set an unsurpassed standard of excellence on all the great issues of the day in the nation's foreign and domestic policy. 
   She earned a Pulitzer Prize and many other honors during her outstanding career. For a quarter century, her extraordinary columns in Newsweek Magazine were a consistent voice of insight and reason that we looked forward to and learned from. 
   I had the opportunity to visit her just about 2 weeks ago. She was always immensely understanding and respectful of the political process. She admired those who were part of the political process in the finest sense, and believed that those who were really committed to public life could make a difference in our society. 
   She was a hopeful, idealistic person who wrote with great clarity, great eloquence, and great passion about the state of our nation. She established a high standard by which political leaders of both parties could try to measure themselves. 
   She made an extraordinary difference with her life. She had scores of friends and was highly regarded and respected in her business. To those who knew her and respected her, she was a giant in the writing press. A graduate of Smith College, Meg Greenfield became one of the greatest women and greatest journalists or our time, and we will miss her very much.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator COCHRAN in sponsoring the ``Digital Education Act of 1999.'' I commend him for his leadership in improving technology for children and families, so that more children come to school ready to learn. 
   In the early 1990's, Dr. Ernest Boyer, the distinguished former leader of the Carnegie Foundation, gave compelling testimony to the Senate Labor Committee about the appallingly high number of children who enter school without the skills to prepare them for learning. Their lack of preparation presented enormous obstacles to their ability to learn effectively in school, and seriously impaired their long-term achievement. 
   In response, Congress enacted the Ready-to-Learn program in 1992, and two years later its promise was so great that we extended it for five years. Because of the Department of Education and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the Ready-to-Learn initiative became an innovative and effective program. By linking the power of television to the world of books, many more children have been enabled to become good readers much more quickly. 
   Many children who enter school without the necessary basic skills are soon placed in a remedial program, which is costly for school systems. It is even more costly, however, for the students who face a bleaker future. 
   Today, by the time they enter school, the average child will have watched 4,000 hours of television. That is roughly the equivalent of four years of school. 
   For far too many youngsters, this is wasted time--time consuming ``empty calories'' for the brain. Instead, that time could be spent reading, writing, and learning. Through Ready-to-Learn television programming, children can obtain substantial education benefits that turn T.V. time into learning time. 
   As a result of Ready-to-Learn television, millions of children and families have access to high-quality television produced by public television  stations across the country. Tens of thousands of parents and child-care providers have learned how to be better role models, to reinforce learning, and to be more active participants in children's learning from programs funded through Ready-to-Learn. 
   For many low-income families, the workshops, books, and television shows funded through this program are a vital factor in preparing children to read. These programs help parents and child-care providers teach children the basics, preparing them to enter school ready to learn and ready to succeed. 
   Ready-to-Learn provides 6.5 hours of non-violent educational programming a day. These hours include some of the best programs available to children, including Arthur, Barney & Friends, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, The Puzzle Place, Reading Rainbow, and Sesame Street. 
   One of the most successful aspects of Ready-to-Learn is that it helps parents work more effectively with their children. Parents who participate in Ready-to-Learn workshops are more thoughtful consumers of television, and their children are more active viewers. These parents have more hands-on activities with their children, and they read more often with their children. They read less often for entertainment, and more often for education. They take their children more often to libraries and bookstores. 
   The workshops provided by the Ready-to-Learn program are considered the best of their kind. It also brings needed literacy services to parents and children at food distribution centers, homeless shelters, employment centers, and supermarkets. 
   Many of the innovations under Ready-to-Learn have come from local stations. WGBH in Boston is one of the nation's leaders in public broadcasting. It created the Reading Rainbow, and Where in the World is Carmen San Diego, which are leaders in educational programming across the country. 
   Last year, WGBH hosted 34 Ready-to-Learn workshops in Massachusetts. 1,100 parents and 265 child-care providers and teachers attended. These parents and providers in turn worked with 3,400 children, who are now better prepared to succeed in their schools. 
   WGBY of Springfield is the mainstay of literacy services for Western Massachusetts. This station trained 250 home day-care providers, who serve 2,500 children. A video lending library makes PBS materials available to teachers to use in their classroom. 
   Workshop participants receive training on using children's programs as the starting point for educational activities. Participants receive free books. For some, these are the only books they have ever owned. They receive the PBS Families magazine, in English or Spanish, and they also receive the broadcasting schedules. Each of these resources builds on the learning that begins with viewing the PBS programs. 
   Through partnerships with the Massachusetts Office of Child Care Services and community-based organizations such as Head Start, Even Start, and the Reach Out & Read Program at Boston Medical Center, Ready-to-Learn trainers are reaching many low-income families with media and literacy information. 
   In Worcester, the Clark Street Developmental Learning School offers a family literacy program that uses Reading Rainbow or Arthur in every session with families. In addition, the school has now expanded its efforts to create an adult literacy center in the school. Many of the parents involved in the Ready-to-Learn project now attend the adult education program there. 
   Similar successes are happening across the nation. Since 1994, the sponsors of Ready-to-Learn workshops have given away 1.5 million books. Their program has grown from 10 television stations in 1994 to 130 television stations today. They have conducted over 8,500 workshops reaching 186,000 parents and 146,000 child care providers, who have in turn affected the lives of over four million children. 
   The ``Digital Education Act of 1999'' we are introducing today will continue this high-quality children's television programming. Equally important, it will take this valuable service into the next century through digital television, a powerful resource for delivering additional information through television programs. 
   The Digital Education Act will also increase the authorization of funds for Ready-to-Learn programs from $30 million to $50 million a year, enabling these programs to reach even more families and children with these needed services. 
   The Digital Education Act also authorizes $20 million for high-quality teacher professional development. Building on the success of the MATHLINE program, the bill will expand the program to include materials for helping teachers to teach to high state standards in core subject areas. 
   Participating stations make the teachers workshops available through districts, schools, and even on the teachers' own television sets. In this way, at their own pace, and in their own time, teachers can review the materials, observe other teachers at work, and reflect on their own practices. They can consider ways to improve their teaching, and make adjustments to their own practices. Teachers will also receive essential help in integrating technology into their teaching. 
   Teachers themselves are very supportive of the contribution that television can make to their classrooms. 88% of teachers surveyed in 1997 by the Corporation for Public Broadcasting said that quality television used in the classroom helped them be more creative, 92% said that it helped them be more effective in the classroom. 
   Finally, the Act will create a new ``Digital Education Content Collaborative,'' with an authorization of $25 million. Its goal is to stimulate quality content and curriculum through video and digital programs that will enable students to meet high state standards. Local public telecommunications agencies will create the programs, so that teachers can teach more effectively to the state standards and assess how well children are learning. 
   Again, I commend Senator COCHRAN for his leadership, and I urge my colleagues to join us in support of this important legislation, so that many more children can come to school ready to learn.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we are introducing a bill that will require all private insurers to provide coverage for screening tests for colorectal cancer. More than 56,000 Americans die from colon cancer each year and we know that the vast majority of these tragedies could have been prevented by early detection and treatment. 
   Millions of Americans are at risk of contracting colon cancer during their lifetime. Persons over age 50 are particularly vulnerable, and so are family members of those who have had this illness. Effective treatments are well-established for this disease, but it must be detected early in order for the treatment to be successful. 
   Unfortunately, fewer than 20 percent of Americans take advantage of the routine screening tests that can identify those who have the disease or who are at risk. Too many physicians fail to recommend or even mention it. The cost of screening those at risk is minor compared to the savings gained by reducing the overall costs of treatment, suffering, lost productivity, and premature death. 
   As many colon cancer survivors have told us, early recognition and treatment are essential to winning this battle. Over 90% of people who have been  diagnosed as a result of these screening tests and then treated for this cancer have resumed active and productive lives. 
   People on Medicare already have the right to these screening tests. The legislation we are introducing today will extend the same benefit to everyone else who has private insurance coverage. Under our proposal, coverage for screening tests will be available to anyone over age 50, and also to younger persons who are at risk for the disease or who have specific symptoms. The type of tests and frequency of tests would be determined by the doctor and the patient. This is a very reasonable and cost-effective measure that is essential to prevent thousands of unnecessary deaths. 
   Our bill has already received support and endorsements from all the major gastrointestinal professional organizations, the American Cancer Society, the American Gastroenterological Association, the Cancer Research Foundation of America, the American Society for Gastrointestinal Endoscopy, the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, STOP Colon and Rectal Cancer Foundation, the United Ostomy Association, the Colon Cancer Alliance, Cancer Care, Inc., and the American Association of Homes and Services for the Aging. 
   A companion bill is being introduced in the House with the bipartisan leadership of my respected colleagues, Congresswomen LOUISE SLAUGHTER and CONNIE MORELLA. They have rightly emphasized that this disease is one that affects women as much as men. I look forward to working with them and my colleagues here in the Senate to get this very important protective legislation passed.

I know the Senator from Utah, the Senator from Connecticut--I see the Senator from California has some inquiries. I would like to be able to speak as well. I would like to see that we have an opportunity for each of these Members before we get to 12:30. That is my only concern.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, since we have had the measure on the juvenile crime bill before us, this is really the first opportunity we have had to deal with one of the compelling aspects of reducing violence, not only in our schools but in our communities. We are talking about youth violence. We have had debate and discussion on how we can help schools, how we can help parents, and how we can help teachers. We have also considered, under the Leahy proposal, a series of different strategies to effectively use law enforcement to reduce violence. 
   Now, we really begin the debate about the proliferation and availability of guns in our society. There are many who choose not to talk about this particular issue, but, hopefully, we will have an opportunity to debate and have votes. We will find out who in this body is serious about trying to reduce the availability and accessibility of guns whose only purpose is not for hunting, but for killing and maiming individuals. 
   It is particularly important that we have this discussion about children. Every single day, 13 children die because of the use of guns--almost the equivalent of Littleton, every single day. We know that when we reduce the availability and accessibility of guns, it extends children's lives and the lives of others. 
   I have just a few moments now. I will, later in the course of the debate, clearly demonstrate, how the United States compares to other countries in terms of the incidence of violence and the incidence of violence and the utilization of guns. 
   One of the most extraordinary examples we have seen in recent times is what has happened in my own city of Boston. But before discussing Boston's success, I think it is important to understand the weakness of the Craig proposal. This proposal fails to meet the minimum standards of doing anything about guns because, as has been pointed out, this is a completely voluntary program. Those who are not interested in participating, will not participate in the program. It fails to meet the minimum standard of responsibility in dealing with the loophole which the Senator from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, has identified. 
   If we are going to do something about gun shows, the Lautenberg amendment is the way to do it. I think any fair reading or listening to the debate will reveal that the Craig amendment fails, and fails abysmally, in reducing the availability and accessibility of guns. 
   Mr. President, how much time remains?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in my 2 remaining minutes, I want to mention what has happened with the use of firearms in homicides for those 16 and under in Boston, MA. In 1990, we had 10; in 1995, we only had 2. In 1998, we had 4. In 1999, for youth homicides in Boston, MA, in 128 schools, zero so far. Zero so far. Something is working. Something is working. 
   What is working is tough gun laws--and I will have a chance to go into greater detail on that later in the debate--tough law enforcement, effective programs in the schools, and working with children and parents to respond to some of the underlying causes, and the needs of children. 
   It is that combination, but it is also effective because we have tough gun laws. 
   The Lautenberg amendment is a downpayment on the things that are important in reducing violence. Many say here: This is a complex issue, and therefore we can't really solve the problem. What the Lautenberg amendment and other amendments say is, we can reduce the incidence of violence in our society and we will miss that opportunity if we fail to adopt them. 
   This is about saving children's lives. That is what this proposal is about, and a number of other proposals. We should be willing to accept this in an overwhelmingly positive way. The Lautenberg amendment does something; the Craig amendment fails the minimum standard.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
   I was listening to my good friend from Tennessee talking about what we need to do, that we need to give more time for research and evaluation of where we are in terms of violence among young people in this country. 
   Quite frankly, I would invite our colleagues and Members of Congress--Members of the Senate in this instance--to look at what has happened up in my own home city of Boston, MA, in recent years. 
   In Boston, Mr. President, we have had a dramatic strengthening of various gun laws in recent years, stricter enforcement of existing laws, and the implementation of very important programs in terms of help and assistance for the students, the teachers, and the parents, and the schools. 
   We have had the community police men and women working in the schools, working with the superintendents, working with the parents, working with the children. 
   There has been the development of support groups for the children. There has been the development of violence prevention and mediation programs; an important 2 to 6 program; an afterschool program which is so important  in terms of helping and assisting children in the afternoon with their various academic endeavors so when the children do go home in the late afternoon and see their parents--in most situations both of whom have been working hard--they will have quality time with them. 
   It is an effective approach. We are not here to suggest this will be the only approach. I am not here to suggest that there shouldn't be additional reviews or studies. But as we look at the various challenges we are facing today, we shouldn't just throw up our hands and say because there are so many things to do, we can't do anything at all. There are important things that we can do. 
   The Senate has made some judgments on some of those recommendations--those which have been offered by Senator ROBB, Senator LEAHY, and others during the course of the last day or so. Now we are beginning a debate on another, I think, extremely important provision. That is the accessibility and the availability of these weapons, particularly to children, in our society. 
   It is uncontrovertible that various societies that deny easy access and easy availability of these weapons do not have the kind of homicide records we have seen in the United States. Industrial nations that have strict restrictions on the access and availability of weapons see a fraction of the number of homicides that we have seen. There is a direct correlation. We have seen that ourselves over the years. 
   We have had leadership from our colleagues, including Senator FEINSTEIN, Senator LAUTENBERG, and others here on the development and the support of the Brady bill. We have made important progress. In my own State of Massachusetts, we have made significant progress in a variety of ways regarding gun laws. 
   This chart describes firearm homicides by all ages in recent years in Boston. We see the dramatic reduction: 1993, 65; 1994, 62; 1995, 64; 1999, 4. It seems to me it would be worthwhile to look and listen to those who are out there in the streets, in the schools, in law enforcement, who have witnessed this kind of result. We hear a great deal of postulating and theorizing about what may be done or what should be done, but we have a very practical example in this chart of what has been done and what is being done. So far in this particular year, with 128 schools, we have not had a single homicide in Boston, MA. 
   The school lots of the city of Boston were fire zones, not too many years ago, but we have made important progress. One of the most important reasons is the gun laws that have been passed. 
   The age for juvenile possession of handguns in Massachusetts is 21--it is 18 nationwide--but it is 21 in my State of Massachusetts. We enacted the cap law, a law that says we are going to hold individuals who have weapons in their homes responsible, so that there will be a separation of the gun from the ammunition. We hear a great deal of talk about the second amendment, about responsible Americans. We say that is fine; we will hold you responsible. You are going to store your gun separate from your ammunition. If you don't and there is a crime, we are holding you responsible. 
   That has had an important impact. There have been 16 States that have adopted similar laws, and we are beginning to see important progress made. 
   In Massachusetts, we have a waiting period for handgun purchases. We have a State ban on all assault weapons, and we have yet to hear from any hunters that they need to have assault weapons to go out in the woods and hunt deer. We have effectively halted 
   all assault weapons, and that has been an important addition. 
   We have barred private sales of guns between individuals avoiding, circumventing the background checks. 
   We have insisted we will have safety locks on the guns that are sold in Massachusetts. We have the technology for a gun safety lock to prevent children up to maybe 4 years of age from pulling the trigger of a handgun. Why aren't we putting those requirements into the legislation? 
   We have important, strict, provisions in terms of reporting stolen weapons. 
   Those are the kinds of measures we have passed in Massachusetts. I don't see how anyone can make the case that they provide much hindrance to individuals who want to exercise their right to go out and hunt. I don't see how those measures inhibit that opportunity. 
   We are seeing, not only in the city of Boston, similar results in other cities around our Commonwealth. Something is working; something is happening. We are saying, let us try to find what is working, what is happening, what is tried and tested. We are not going to solve all of the problems, but we are going to reduce the number of youth homicides. We can see very clearly from this chart we are talking about 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 children who are alive today that would not be alive, I daresay, unless those steps had been taken. These are positive bottom-line results. 
   We are going to see various amendments offered by Members on this side of the aisle--whether it is the Lautenberg amendment on the gun shows; whether it is the Durbin amendment; or whether it will be Senator BOXER and Senator FEINSTEIN offering amendments that have been along the lines of what has been proven and tested here. And I doubt very much we will have much success. 
   The American people ought to pay close attention to this debate. We will have votes this afternoon. And hopefully, we will have the important votes on these issues tomorrow. We need to listen to the American people on these issues. We are talking not just about a policy on education. We are not talking about a health policy. We are not talking about an environmental policy. We are not talking about a defense policy. We are talking about whether there are steps that can be taken, by this body, that will make a difference in terms of the lives of children in our society. 
   We can do it. We demonstrated it. We should do it. And we ought to be able to accept it here in the Senate during the course of this debate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with my friends and colleagues, the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH; and the Senator from Vermont, Mr. JEFFORDS; and my colleague from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, in urging the Senate to move ahead with this excellent piece of legislation which has been described by the Senator from Delaware and which I will summarize at the conclusion of my remarks. 
   Once in a while the Members of this body get together and try to exercise a judgment which is going to have an important and dramatic impact on improving the quality of life of the people of this country. This is such an undertaking. The reason it is so powerful is because it reflects the best judgment of the disability community in its entirety--not only those who are affected by some particular kind of challenge--it has the input of parents; it has the input of the medical profession, both the doctors, nurses and the caretakers; it has the input of those who have worked in this field for many, many years. 
   It is the result of the extraordinary work over a period of some 18 months, tireless work of the members of the community--not Democrat or Republican, not just the four of us here today, but so many others on our committees and off our committees who are so strongly committed toward providing this kind of opportunity for those who have a disability to participate in the economy in our country. 
   This body took monumental steps a number of years ago when we passed the Americans With Disabilities Act. However, we were reminded after the passage of that act that we were no longer going to permit discrimination against those with disabilities in our country, those who had the ability to be able to perform in the areas of employment. That was a major, major step forward. What we found out very quickly is that there was another barrier for those who had disabilities. That was the fact that if individuals who had disabilities could work, wanted to work, were able to gain entry into the employment in the country, they were going to lose because of the cutoff in terms of cash payments or lose, in terms of their medical health and assistance, the kind of help and assistance in terms of health care and in terms of their income that would put them at enormous risk. 
   What was worked out in this amendment and in this legislation understands that. That effectively says to those who have a disability or a challenge that they can go on out and be a part of the American dream, a part of the American economy, and that we are working in a process that will continue to make the health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work or develops a significant disability while working, and it will gradually phase out the loss of cash payments as the incomes rise, instead of the unfair sudden cutoff which so many workers with disabilities face today. It will give people with the disabilities greater access to the services they need to become successfully employed. 
   I think many in this body and across the country think that ``disabled'' applies to individuals who are born with some disability. In fact, this occurs in only about 15 percent of those who are disabled. 
   This is a challenge that is out there every single day, for every member of this body, for every citizen in this  country. We are an accident away from having the kind of physical or 
   mental challenge where we could even be affected or impacted by this legislation. Just look at the number of people in the workforce every single year who experience hazards and difficulties. Accidents happen. 
   This is not just dealing with something in the past, this is something about America today and America in the future. We have the expanding economy, the growing economy which is offering such hope and opportunity for millions of Americans with the exception of those who have some kind of disability. With this legislation, we are guaranteeing now for the first time, one, that they will not be discriminated against in terms of employment; second, that they will be able to get the training, be able to gain the employment, and be able to have useful, productive, and contributing lives and be part of the whole process and system. That is the kind of opportunity this legislation means for so many of our citizens. 
   I thank all who have been a part of this, including the leadership of Senator JEFFORDS, who has been strongly committed to this legislation, and our Human Resource Committee, that has worked so hard in the development of the legislation, so many of the other members of our committee, Republican and Democrat alike, and to the members of the Finance Committee, the chairman, who I have mentioned--Senator ROTH, who has been enormously committed to it--and our colleague and friend, Senator MOYNIHAN. This has passed virtually unanimously in our Human Resources Committee, it has that degree of support; and 16 to 2 in the Finance Committee. 
   We ought to be about the business of calling this legislation up, considering it and passing it. Every day that goes by we are denying these opportunities to individuals; every day, every week, every month that goes by. We have been through the legislative process. I daresay the four of us are prepared to agree, as we have uniquely so in other situations, on sort of a ``no amendment'' strategy. We feel, since we have tried to gain input from so many of those who have been involved in this process, this legislation could pass in a relatively short time, in the time of a couple of hours, and still it would reflect the best judgment of so many of those in so many different parts of the country. 
   We are strongly committed. With the overwhelming support we have, 73 Members reflecting every possible viewpoint in the Senate, and the overwhelming need, this is legislation that needs to pass, should pass, must pass. I hope we can do it in the next few days. It should not take much time. The disability community deserves it. 
   Mr. President, to reiterate, I strongly support the Work Incentives Improvement Act, and I urge Senator LOTT to bring the bill to the floor and allow the Senate to complete action on this important bipartisan legislation before the Memorial Day recess. Last month, under the impressive leadership of Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN, the act passed in the Senate Finance Committee by a 16-2 vote. Today, 75 Members of the Senate stand behind this bill, which removes the barriers that present so many of our citizens with disabilities from living independent and productive lives. 
   As former Majority Senator Bob Dole stated in his eloquent testimony to the Finance Committee, ``this is about people going to work--it is about dignity and opportunity and all the things we talk about, when we talk about being an American.'' 
   We know that a large proportion of the 54 million disabled men and women in this country want to work and are able to work. But they are denied the opportunity to do so. Removing barriers to work will help disabled Americans to achieve self-sufficiency. It will also contribute to preserving the Social Security Disability Trust Fund. 
   For too long, Americans with disabilities have faced unfair penalties if the take jobs and go to work. They are in danger of losing their medical coverage, which could mean the difference between life and death. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits, even if they earn only modest amounts from work. Too often, they face the harsh choice between buying a decent meal and buying their medication. 
   The Work Incentive Improvement Act will remove these unfair barriers facing people with disabilities who want to work. 
   It will continue to make health insurance available and affordable when a disabled person goes to work, or develops a significant disability while working. 
   It will gradually phase out the loss of cash benefits as income rises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so many workers with disabilities face today. 
   It will give people with disabilities greater access to the services they need to become successfully employed. 
   Many leaders in communities throughout the country have worked long and hard and well to help us reach this milestone. They are consumers, family members, citizens, and advocates. They see everyday that the current job programs for people with disabilities are failing them and forcing them into poverty. 
   They have spent many months helping to develop effective ways to right that wrong. And to all of them I say, thank you for helping us to prepare this needed legislation. it truly represents legislation of the people, by the people and for the people. 
   When we think of citizens with disabilities, we tend to think of men and women and children who are disabled from birth. But fewer than 15 percent of all people with disabilities are born with their disabilities. A bicycle accident or a serious fall or a serious illness can disable the healthiest and most physically capable person. 
   This legislation is important because it offers a lifeline to large numbers of our fellow citizens. A disability need not end the American dream. That was the promise of the Americans With Disabilities Act a decade ago, and this legislation dramatically strengthens our commitment to that promise. 
   We know that disabled citizens are not unable. Our goal in this legislation is to reform and improve the existing disability programs, so that they do more to encourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live independently, and be a productive and contributing member of their community. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all. 
   The road to economic prosperity and the right to a decent wage must be more accessible to all Americans. That is our goal in this legislation. For too long, our fellow disabled citizens have been left out and left behind. This bill is the right thing to do, and it is the cost effective thing to do. And now is the time to do it. 
   I especially commend Senators JEFFORDS, Senator ROTH, and Senator MOYNIHAN for their bipartisan leadership on this legislation. Now is the time to enact this long overdue legislation and free up the enterprise, creativity, and dreams of millions of fellow Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will speak briefly in support of the Robb amendment. Later, I intend to participate in the debate on the Robb amendment and other provisions underlying the legislation. 
   Over the next few days, we will have the opportunity to consider how we can best respond to the anxieties and concerns of 
   families and children across  this country. In the wake of the tragedies that have affected a number of our schools over the past few years, it is appropriate that the Senate consider violence and its impact on children and families. 
   As we begin this debate and discussion in the Senate, we should understand that, in just a few days, we cannot develop a silver bullet capable of responding to all of the complex issues raised by the tragedies that have occurred in Colorado, Paducah, and other communities and other schools across this country. 
   But even having noted that these are complex issues, we have to ask ourselves: Can we at least evaluate some things that have been done in the fairly recent past that have been helpful to students, that have been helpful to parents, that have been helpful to schools, and that have been helpful to communities? Quite clearly the answer to this is yes. 
   I am not one of those who says that we don't have all the answers and, therefore, we don't have any of the answers. No one could say that, coming from the City of Boston where we have seen dramatic reduction in youth homicide and youth violence in the country. It has been within the last probably 4 years. Boston has approximately 128 schools. We had only one youth homicide involving a firearm during a 2.5 year period. 
   As we look at the underlying bill in terms of youth violence, it is appropriate that we also look at the current record to see if there are some ideas that might be of some value and some use. 
   I think issues dealing with the media--perhaps the various excessively violent video games and others are going to take some time, but these are issues that we must consider. We have a chance to see what has been working out there, and to see whether those efforts should be supported, perhaps enhanced, and if they can be shared in other parts of the country. That is what we are trying to do with the Robb amendment. 
   There are two important parts to this amendment. One is to establish a resource center that will be a place where either parents or schools or school districts or communities are able to go to find out what is working in other communities around the country. 
   It will be an evaluation of information. It will have a collection of what is working in urban areas and what is working in rural communities, and what the results have been and how communities utilize these efforts. 
   There have been a number of efforts. Some might be particularly appropriate to Boston. Others might be different and better suited in terms of dealing with the problems in Pocatello. There may be some development of efforts that have involved law enforcement, some that have involved the schools, some that have involved the parents, some that have involved the students in terms of mentoring, programs of reconciliation. A number of different initiatives that are out there may just have some application in terms of different schools across the country, and those communities might be interested. 
   In the Robb amendment, we have a proposal for this clearinghouse that will be a resource available to schools, a resource available to communities, a resource available to parents, a resource that will be available to students who have responsibility in their schools, a resource that will be available to the law enforcement officials. It will have other functions such as having available individuals who might be able to respond if there is an immediate danger of violence. This all makes a good deal of sense. 
   A second provision of the Robb amendment deals with the resources that are out there within the community, within the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services, and the Department of Education. It is called the Safe Schools/Healthy Students initiative. This was developed in a nonpartisan effort to try to bring together a number of different programs that have a positive impact on reducing youth violence which the schools will be able to draw upon. This program includes aspects to develop a safe school environment, including partnerships with the local law enforcement; it includes aspects to enhance security measures for those schools where it is necessary; it includes aspects to redesign school facilities to get into smaller school units where teachers know the names of every student in the school, and every student knows the name of every teacher. 
   We have this program being implemented in a number of different communities. In Boston it is being developed in a number of different schools. It has been tried and is being utilized in a number of different communities. It is very interesting and exciting, and we have seen positive results. 
   Prevention programs and early intervention, in terms of alcohol and drugs--bringing in the mental health, preventive treatment and intervention services that exist in the SAMHSA program which deals with mental health and assistance and targeting help and assistance for children--have been particularly effective. 
   We know almost a third of all the children who go to the schools in the inner city of Boston, for example, come from completely dysfunctional homes--either with substance abuse or violence, and these children are facing the most extraordinary set of circumstances. We have to understand being young, being a child, and being at school today is no picnic. They are faced with enormous challenges. We don't have, generally, health care centers in these schools; a few of them do, but not many. The importance of mental health counselors, psychologists and nurses working with the early childhood psychological, social and emotional development services have been included in the second phase of this program. This was basically the result of a very extensive review done by the Department of Justice working with HHS, and the Department of Education, and the resulting recommendations. 
   This evaluation shows that this kind of approach, with law enforcement and the preventive aspect, has provided some very important help and assistance to the schools. 
   I look forward to working with a number of our colleagues--Senator BOXER, Senator SCHUMER, Senator DURBIN, Senator LAUTENBERG, Senator FEINSTEIN and others--in terms of responsible ownership regarding weapons. I think that is certainly very important. We ought to expect responsibility in terms of manufacturers making safe guns. We ought to expect dealers are not going to sell to adolescents. We have to expect responsibility of parents in storing their guns separate from the ammunition. We will keep rapid automatic weapons out of the hands of children, extend the Brady bill, and include the background checks at the gun shows. We will have a chance to debate all of those. 
   We can reduce the occasions when these violent impulses reflect themselves in the use of weapons. One of the most disturbing factors is the continued growth and explosion of youth suicides. Handguns are too easily accessible and available. We will have a chance to debate some of those issues. 
   It comes back to the recognition that the first responsibility for all of these matters rests in the home and with the parents, or with a single parent, working to provide the guidance to children who need guidance. 
   What we see in this chart is very disturbing, a gradual decline of the time mothers are spending with their children. This is the percentage of time parents eat dinner with their children from ages 5 to 17 every day. We see the gradual decline in terms of the time mothers are spending with their children; and also the time fathers are spending. The fact is, generally speaking, in the last 15 years there is a third less quality time being spent with parents. Some of that is the result of people working harder and working longer in order to maintain their own income, a tragic reality for those at the lower economic line that have to work one, two, or even three jobs--receiving minimum wage--in order to keep the family together. It is very difficult to see how those people are able to spend any time at all with their family. Some of that is the result of choice, some of that is out of necessity. 
   On this chart is the percentage of parents in the home who have private talks with their children ages 5-17 almost every day. The number has been cut in half by fathers, and there is an important reduction in terms of the  mothers. Again, we are talking about parental responsibilities. 
   This is a blowup of ``A Guide To Safe Schools''. Every school in America has a copy of this particular publication. It was sent out by Secretary Riley and Secretary Reno. It contains a variety of early warning tips for the parents. It has a whole page of action steps for the students. It has suggestions for parents. It has suggestions for teachers. It has suggestions for school boards. It has a series of ideas: what to look for, what to do, early warning signs--it is enormously comprehensive. 
   It is the result of the work of a number of different organizations that came together and spent weeks and months in developing this publication. If anyone would take the time to go through it, it has an enormous wealth of information from which those involved in schools across the country can benefit. It is a very, very instructive and positive document. It is a guide for schools, students, parents, about some of the concerns they might have. 
   We may never fully understand the complex factors that led Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to kill 13 members of the Columbine High School community, but there is one thing we do know--we must do more to prevent future tragedies. The deaths that have occurred at the hands of young people in Littleton, Colorado, Jonesboro, Arkansas, Pearl, Mississippi, and other communities, are national tragedies. They are also a call to action--a call that America must answer. 
   We have a responsibility to listen to our constituents, to answer the calls for help by our children, and do more to protect the health and welfare of the nation's youth. Children may make up one-eighth of the population, but they are 100 percent of our nation's future. 
   We know that there is no single, simple solution to this complex problem. The mindless, heartless cruelty in Littleton is symptomatic of the problems that exist in communities throughout America, and we need to find more effective ways to deal with them. 
   This latest tragedy is another wakeup call to the nation. We have an opportunity to work together to prevent youth violence, and reduce the likelihood of future tragedies like Littleton. We can do more to make schools safer. 
   We know that school violence is a continuing festering problem. In 1996, 5 percent of all 12th graders reported being injured with a weapon during the previous 12 months while they were at school. Another 12 percent reported that they had been injured at school in an incident that did not involve a weapon. An increasing number of students report feeling unsafe at school, and avoid one or more places at school for fear of their own safety. Clearly, children cannot learn in this kind of environment. 
   We need to ask difficult questions about our society, the media, parenting, peer pressure, and other social forces. We have a shared responsibility as parents, teachers, role models, and concerned, caring adults, Fifty million school children are now in their formative years. We need to think about what kind of society we want these children to grow up in. 
   In too many cases, television is raising far too many of the nation's children. On a daily basis, close to 20 percent of 9-year-olds watch 6 or more hours of television. Much of what they see is a steady stream of violence and aggression that is presented as legitimate and justified entertainment. By the time children leave elementary school, they will have seen 8,000 murders and more than 100,000 other acts of televised violence. Violent video games which glorify killing are increasingly popular. 
   The negative influences of violent programming and violent video games are growing stronger, because positive influences--families, schools, churches, synagogues, and communities--are becoming weaker. Parents are the most important influence in their children's lives, but they are being stretched to the limit. We know the importance of strong parental guidance and support for healthy development. Spending time together is a basic ingredient for building strong parent-child relationships. Yet time together is increasingly scarce. 
   Research indicates that parents are eating fewer meals and having fewer conversations with their children. Between 1988 and 1995, a significant drop took place in parent-child activities. Sixty-two percent of mothers reported eating dinner with their child on a daily basis in 1988, but only 55 percent reported doing so in 1995. Fifty percent of fathers ate a daily dinner with their child in 1988, but this rate dropped to 42 percent in 1995. 
   Parents and families want to spend more time together, but there simply aren't enough hours in the day. We must pursue initiatives to give parents the opportunity to spend more time with their children, and ensure that all parents have the skills they need to be strong mentors, role models, and caregivers for their children. We should support family-friendly work policies and flexible work hours, so that parents can eat dinner with their children, and talk to their children. 
   Yesterday, I spent time in Boston talking to students about youth violence and the tragedy in Colorado to try and get some insight into what is going on with our youth. I asked them for a show of hands of how many of them feel that their parents are too busy to talk to them--over 3/4 ths of the students raised their hands. 
   This is lack of communication is unacceptable and the American people agree. A recent Newsweek poll asked ``How important is it for the country to pay more attention to teenagers 
   and their problems.'' 89 percent of those polled replied that it is very important. If we as parents are not raising our children, then we must worry about who is. 
   In the coming days, we will have a unique opportunity to begin to reverse the culture of youth violence. There are no quick fixes to this problem--no easy solutions. We need a long-term strategy, and we must work together to find appropriate remedies. To meet this challenge, we must consider provisions that (1) promote healthy children and youth in safe communities; (2) help parents with parenting skills from birth through adolescence; (3) equip teachers and school officials with tools to intervene before violence occurs; (4) give law enforcement the tools needed to keep guns away from children; and (5) promote responsible media programming for children and youth. 
   There are also immediate steps that we can take. Congress has a responsibility to act, to stop allowing the NRA to dictate what is right and what is wrong on guns. Surely, without threatening the activities of honest sports men and women, we can agree on ways to make it virtually impossible for angry children to get their hands on guns. We can give schools the resources and expertise they need to protect themselves, without turning classrooms into fortresses. We can make gun dealers responsible for selling guns to adolescents, and make gun owners responsible for locking up firearms in their homes. We can insist that gun manufacturers be smart enough to develop ``smart'' guns with effective child safety locks. We can do more to dry up the interstate black market in guns. We can crack down harder on assault weapons. 
   Surely, we can take sensible steps like these to reduce the tragedy of gun violence. America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns--and it is a national disgrace. When we see and hear what gun violence has done to the victims in Pearl, MS--West Paducah, KY--Jonesboro, AR--Edinboro, PA--Fayetteville, TN--Springfield, OR--and now Littleton, CO, we know that action is urgently needed. 
   Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more effectively from guns, and to achieve greater responsibility by gun owners, gun dealers and gun manufacturers. The greatest tragedy of the Columbine High School killings is that these earlier tragedies did not shock us enough into doing everything we can to prevent them. By refusing to learn from such tragedies, we have condemned ourselves to repeat them. How many wake-up calls will Congress and the nation continue to ignore? 
   We can act now to provide communities and schools with more information and resources to prevent these tragedies. We can provide the training needed to recognize the daily warning signs, long before actual violence occurs. Last year the Departments of Education and Justice jointly created a  ``Guide to Safe Schools--Early Warning: Timely Response.'' This guide has extensive helpful information to assist parents, children, schools, and communities in keeping children and young people safer. The guide tells what to look for, and what to do. It lists Characteristics of Schools that are Safe and Responsive for all children. It has Tips to Schools, Tips to Parents, and Tips to Children. 
   This guide is part of an overall effort to make sure that every school in the nation has a violence prevention plan in place. This guide is available to every school, every parent, and every community leader. You can download it from the Internet if you go to www.usdoj.gov, and click on to ``early warning, timely response'' 
   We also need to invest in services that ensure Safe Schools and Healthy Students. That means quality after-school programs, accessible mental health services for youth, and grassroots models that successfully target youth violence. Results occur when there is a cooperative effort. 
   Boston has a remarkable program that has enabled the city to go from July 1995 to December 1997 with only one juvenile death that involved a firearm. This program works because it involves the entire community--police and probation officers, community leaders, mental health providers, and even gang members themselves. The strategy is based on three components: (1) tough law enforcement; (2) heavy emphasis on crime prevention (including drug treatment); and (3) effective gun control. 
   The Safe Schools/Healthy Students Initiative can make such initiatives a reality in many more communities. This cooperative effort by the Departments of Education, Justice, and Health and Human Services draws on the best practices of the education, law enforcement, social service, and mental health communities to achieve a realistic framework for communities to prevent youth violence. 
   We must answer the call that children across the nation are so desperately making. We have the knowledge, the skill, and the resources to make a difference. 
   The nation's children need us. And they need us now. We cannot afford to let them down. If we are to remain the strongest and fairest nation on earth, we must deal with these festering problems. We cannot afford to abandon children to despair and depression. We can no longer allow children to have virtually unrestricted access to guns. We must reduce the tide of violent images washing over children on a daily basis. We must lead this nation into the next century by providing a safe, secure, and gun free environment for children to grow and learn and thrive. 
   Our mission is clear. Let us work together to save our children, and by so doing, we will save our nation too.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, as the Senator from Virginia has pointed out, this particular proposal reflects a total of less than a billion dollars. It will be another $722 million. It has in it the National Resource Center for School Safety and it also has the Safe Schools and Healthy Students Program. 
   There are Members of this body who think the solution to the challenges we are facing in our schools can be solved by putting more kids in prison and keeping them there. That may be the view of some Members of this body, but it is not the view of those law enforcement officials who are working in school districts across the country who are making meaningful progress. 
   We have not heard from those people in the Judiciary Committee because they have not been asked to testify. We ought to at least be willing to look at the results of some of the cities and communities across this country that have reduced violence, not only in schools, but in the communities and ask them what has worked. That might be a useful test around here for a change. That is just what Senator ROBB and I have done. We have asked what has worked, and we have tried to make a recommendation to this body about programs that work, that are supported by students, supported by parents, supported by teachers, and supported by law enforcement officials. 
   If this body does not want to invest in those programs, if it thinks that we can just provide more cops and they are going to provide the answers to the problems in our schools, vote this amendment down. But if you want to look at the experiences of cities and communities like we have seen in our own city of Boston where there has been only one youth homicide with a gun in the last 2 1/2 years in 128 schools--that is the record--these are the programs that are working. It is very easy to listen to our colleagues talk about bureaucracy, saying: we don't want to have programs; we don't want to deal with all these other issues; let's just throw them in jail and throw away the key. 
   One of the most profound comments I heard yesterday in the Jeremiah Berg School in Boston, MA, is one of common sense and one that everybody in this body understands: You either pay for it early on or you pay for it later on. That is the question: Are we going to support those programs that are tried and tested and are working in our schools and working in our communities, or are we going to say, no, we are just going to dismiss them because they deal with mental health, because they deal with violence protection, because they deal with mediation, because they deal with things that are happening in schools that can make a difference in reducing violence. 
   The proposal we have offered, with the Leahy proposal and the one that Senator ROBB has suggested, tries to combine those 
   programs that are going to be effective in law enforcement, as well as those that are going to be supporting children. 
   I have heard a number of young people in the last several days say, ``We are not interested in someone telling us and yelling at us. We want parents and we want our teachers to talk with us, to listen to us and to give us an opportunity to work with counselors to provide for some of the needs of people in our schools and in our communities.'' 
   This particular amendment is targeted. It is based on an evaluation of programs that are working. The Safe Schools and Healthy Students Program provides for 50 school districts. We have expanded it to 200. I think we can expand it further. 
   One may say, why 200? Because that is the judgment we made based upon the quality of applications we have had in the Justice Department. That is how we reached these figures. 
   I reject the arguments made by the Senator from Utah about this program. I reject the suggestion that we are going to solve all these problems just by law enforcement alone, because that is the alternative. I think that is a viewpoint that has been demonstrated to be a vacant attitude based upon where the progress has been made in recent times in the communities that have done something about youth violence. 
   I hope we will accept the Robb amendment. I withhold the time. How much time do we have?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I once again thank Senator WELLSTONE and others who have spoken on this. I just want to share with the Members of this body what has been happening in my home community with the implementation of the kinds of programs we have supported here, the programs that have been recommended by the chiefs of police in my town and in towns across the country. 
   Here we have the firearm homicides of people under 24 years of age in Boston: 51 in 1990; 38 in 1991; 27 in 1992; 35 in 1993; 33 in 1994; 32 in 1995. Then, with the implementation of these programs in the Robb amendment, in 1996, down to 21; 7 in 1997; 16 in 1998; and one in 1999. 
   Are we going to take what is working, what has been requested by law enforcement officials, what is demonstratively effective, or are we going to listen to the same old voices that say what we have to do is spend more time in locking up kids? That is the choice. 
   We need to say we are going to invest in and provide the kinds of programs that are supported by teachers, parents, schools, and law enforcement officials--programs that are effective and working. That is what the Robb amendment has done, and that is what it will do. It deserves the support of the Members. 
   We reserve our time. 
   Mr. ROBB addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join in commending our colleague from Delaware on reaching this major milestone in his brilliant Senate career. 
   For nearly three decades, he has done an outstanding job serving the people of Delaware and the Nation in the Senate. He has been an effective leader on a wide range of issues in both domestic policy and foreign policy. 
   It has been a special privilege for me to serve with our distinguished colleague on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and I particularly commend his leadership over the past quarter century on the many law enforcement challenges facing the nation. It is a privilege to serve with Senator BIDEN--and I am sure he will compile an equally outstanding record on his next 10,000 votes.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the combination of Medicare payment cuts and the growth of managed care has become a devastating one-two punch against many of the nation's most respected academic health centers. A front-page article in today's New York Times documents what is happening. Teaching hospitals across the country are losing money and facing the prospect of cutting back the research, the teaching and training, and the advanced medical care that have made American medicine the envy of the world. These centers are also major safety-net institutions that provide extensive care for the uninsured. 
   Every American depends for quality health care on doctors trained in the nation's teaching hospitals. Research conducted at these hospitals is the basis for much of the astounding progress that we are making in medical science, and these institutions are indispensable in bringing advances in the laboratory to the bedside of the patient. For the most serious and intractable illnesses, teaching hospitals are the caregivers of last resort. They have the newest and most sophisticated equipment. The physicians who practice there are on the cutting edge of new treatments, and they see the largest number of such cases. 
   It would be an American tragedy if, as a result of short-sighted Medicare payment policies and equally short-sighted pressures for HMO profits, academic health centers are forced to  close their doors or to curtail the research, training, and advanced care that make them such indispensable components of modern American health care.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we are introducing a bill to bring mental health and substance abuse treatment services into the next century. I commend Senator FRIST for his effective leadership on this issue. We have worked closely together on this important legislation to define the types of mental health and substance abuse treatment and services research that deserve to be funded, and to improve the process of accountability for clinical outcomes. 
   The bill also contains a number of provisions to address the alarming increase in violence in our schools and communities and the traumatic consequences of such violence. The legislation emphasizes a number of programs to prevent and reduce the impact of mental disorders and substance abuse in children and adolescents. 
   The tragic events in Colorado earlier this month are a reminder of how much more we need to help families, to protect children, and to make our schools and communities safer. 
   This legislation provides new support for children who are witnesses and survivors of domestic and community violence. Too often, these children are at great risk for long term psychological problems, including developmental delays, psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety or depression, and even the risk that these traumatized individuals will grow up to become perpetrators of violence themselves. 
   Another major feature of this bill is the attempt to address a number of concerns that were not apparent when we established the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in 1992. We need to do more to help states identify the kinds of assistance that are most relevant to the persons they are currently serving and to do so in the most efficient and effective ways. Our bill accomplishes this by streamlining the services, and helps assure that the right services are going to those who most need them. 
   We also intend to address the needs of persons with both mental disorders and substance abuse. We must give greater priority to programs that support the mental health and substance abuse treatment needs of patients in primary care clinics. 
   I look forward to working closely with my colleagues to enact this legislation. We know that we can deal more effectively with the serious problems of substance abuse and mental illness, and enable far more of our fellow citizens to lead fulfilling and productive lives.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, one of America's greatest leaders for our cities and metropolitan areas over the past half century has been Robert C. Wood. 
   All of us who know Bob Wood have enormous respect for his ability, his leadership, and his brilliant service to the country. He was an outstanding Under Secretary and Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for President Lyndon Johnson in the 1960's, and he pioneered the development of many of the nation's most important programs to enhance the vitality of our cities and improve the quality of life in metropolitan areas across the country. 
   In Massachusetts, we have special respect and affection for Bob Wood because of all that he has done for our state, especially for his service as a past chairman of the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority and as a past Superintendent of the Boston Public Schools, and also for his brilliant academic leadership both at M.I.T. and the University of Massachusetts.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, John Hume's career is surely one of the most distinguished in Irish history, or in any nation's history, and all of us in America who care about Ireland are greatly in his debt. Last week, this distinguished leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party celebrated 30 years of public service. His accomplishments are many, as was recognized last year when he shared the Nobel Peace Prize for extraordinary leadership in producing the Good Friday Peace Agreement. One detail about that prize speaks volumes about John Hume--he donated the entire cash prize to charities in Northern Ireland.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican ``lockbox'' proposal is deeply flawed, and does not deserve to be adopted. It does nothing to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. In fact, it would do just the reverse. This legislation actually places Social Security at greater risk than it is today. It would allow payroll tax dollars that belong to Social Security to be spent instead on risky privatization schemes. And, because of the harsh debt ceiling limits it would impose, this plan could produce a governmental shutdown that would jeopardize the timely payment of Social Security benefits to current recipients. 
   It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the ``lockbox.'' Their statements convey the impression that they have taken a major step toward protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their proposal would not provide even one additional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it extend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even one more day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. At best, that is all their so-called ``lockbox'' would do.  
   By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 trillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next 15 years. By doing so, the President's budget would extend the life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050. 
   There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do with the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt reduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have been required to pay interest on the national debt will become available each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes those debt savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. Since it is payroll tax revenues which make the debt reduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social Security. I wholeheartedly agree. It is an eminently reasonable plan. But Republican Members of Congress oppose it. 
   Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources to fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even effectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used to pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a trapdoor in their ``lockbox.'' Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified ``reform'' plans. This loophole opens the door to risky schemes to finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, there will be nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to fund future Social Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future. 
   A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent any such diversion of funds. A genuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The Republican ``lockbox'' does just the opposite. It actually invites a raid on the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   The Social Security reform proposal put forth by Chairman ARCHER and Congressman SHAW earlier this week demonstrates that the real Republican agenda is to substitute private accounts for traditional Social Security benefits. That plan would spend the entire Social Security surplus on tax credits to subsidize private accounts. There would be no money left for debt reduction, and thus no debt service savings which could be used to help fund future Social Security benefits. In fact, their plan will ultimately require either enormous new borrowing or drastic program cuts to continue funding the private accounts after the Social Security surplus is exhausted. These costly tax credits would go to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefiting the most affluent workers. Low and middle income workers would receive little or no net benefit from the Archer plan. Their retirement security would not be enhanced at all. 
   Placing Social Security on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priority, not further enriching the already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. Without it, half the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. 
   To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to strengthen Social Security, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert dollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other purposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future Social Security benefits.'' 
   The proposed ``lockbox'' poses a second, very serious threat to Social Security. By using the debt ceiling as an enforcement mechanism, it runs the risk of creating a government shutdown crisis. The Republicans propose to enforce their ``lockbox'' by mandating dangerously low debt ceilings. Such a reduced debt ceiling could make it impossible for the federal government to meet its financial obligations--including its obligation to pay Social Security benefits to millions of men and women who depend upon them. The risk is real. It is fundamentally wrong to put those who depend on Social Security at risk in this way. 
   The ``lockbox'' which proponents claim will save Social Security actually imperils it. As Treasury Secretary Rubin has said, ``This legislation does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, while potentially threatening the ability to make Social Security payments to millions of Americans.'' 
   While this ``lockbox'' provides no genuine protection for Social Security, it provides no protection at all for Medicare. The Republicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care that they have completely omitted Medicare from their ``lockbox''. 
   By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 15% of the surplus to Medicare over the next 15 years. Those new dollars would come entirely from the on-budget portion of the surplus. The Republicans have adamantly refused to provide any additional funds for Medicare. Instead, they propose to spend the entire on-budget surplus on tax cuts disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest Americans. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to reject this ill-conceived proposal. It jeopardizes Social Security and ignores Medicare. It is an assault on America's senior citizens, and it does not deserve to pass.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, Senator LEAHY and I are introducing the Crime Victims Assistance Act. For too long, our criminal justice system has neglected the hundreds of thousands of victims of crime whose lives are shattered by violence or threats of violence each year. 
   Clearly, the rights of victims deserve better from our criminal justice system. Too often, the system does not provide adequate relief for victims of crime. They are not given basic information about their case--such as the status of the case, scheduling changes in court proceedings, and notice of a defendant's arrest, bail status and release from prison. 
   Victims deserve to know about their case. They deserve to know about hearings and other court proceedings. They deserve to know when their assailants are being considered for parole. And they certainly deserve to know when their attackers are released from incarceration. 
   But there is a right way and a wrong way to protect victims' rights. The wrong way is to amend the Constitution. One of the guiding principles that has served the nation well for two hundred years is that if it is not necessary to amend the Constitution, it is necessary not to amend it. 
   We have amended the Constitution only 17 times in the two centuries since the adoption of the Bill of Rights. We should consider such amendments only in rare instances, when the enactment of a statute is clearly inadequate. 
   The right way to protect victims' rights is by statute, not by constitutional amendment. One of the most obvious provisions of such a statute is additional resources for courts and prosecutors. These resources can be used to establish better notification, provide better training to deal with victims' needs, and to take all the other steps required to see that the criminal justice system deals fairly with the victims of crime. If Congress is truly committed to victims rights, we can act quickly by statute. 
   Senator LEAHY and I are proposing a victims rights statute--not a constitutional amendment, because we believe it accomplishes the needed goals. It provides protection for victims now--this year. We do not have to wait for a constitutional amendment that may take years for the States to ratify. 
   Chief Justice Rehnquist also opposes amending the Constitution. He has specifically stated that a statute, rather than a constitutional amendment, ``would have the virtue of making any provisions in the bill which appeared mistaken by hindsight to be amended by a simple act of Congress.'' 
   Crime victims must be treated with dignity, compassion and understanding. Being victimized by crime is traumatic enough. We must do all we can to see that victims of crime are not victimized again by the criminal justice system. 
   At the federal level, the system has become more victim friendly. I am  proud to have sponsored the Sentencing Reform Act of 1994, which vastly expanded the authority of the courts to order defendants to pay restitution to the victims. Subsequent laws have given victims the right to be heard at sentencing. 
   This legislation we are introducing today assures victims of a greater voice in decisions on the detention and prosecution of criminals. 
   It contains a series of provisions to assist victims of state crimes, and to ensure that victims participate in the criminal justice process to the maximum extent. For example, it provides grants to fund victim-witness advocate positions. It provides training for judges, prosecutors, and law enforcement. It establishes our ombudsman programs. 
   Legislation on victims' rights deserves high priority in this Congress. I urge the Senate to act swiftly to accomplish the goal we share of genuine protections for victims rights.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, our former colleague in the Senate from Arkansas, David Pryor, has a new mission, and I believe that all of us will be greatly inspired by his commitment and dedication. 
   During the spring term this year, Senator Pryor has been a fellow at the Institute of Politics in the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. Last week, touched by the tragic plight of the hundreds of thousands of refugees from Kosovo, he left for Tirana, Albania to be a volunteer with the International Rescue Committee, which is dedicated to easing the plight of the refugees.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, communities across America will observe Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome Awareness Day this Saturday, May 1. Guillain-Barr&#233; Syndrome, or GBS, is a paralyzing disorder that can strike any person, regardless of age, gender, or background. Victims often face months of hospital care and long-term disabilities can result. 
   For many years the GBS Foundation International has been renowned for its worldwide leadership in the battle against GBS, and I welcome this opportunity to commend the Foundation for all it has done. The Foundation, established in 1980, provides an effective support network for patients and their families. It also provides educational materials, funds medical research, and conducts symposia.

   Mr. KENNEDY. In April and May, we have the supplemental conference report, Kosovo funding, Y2K, Ed-Flex, safe-deposit lockbox, budget reform, FAA, Commerce-Justice-State appropriations; financial modernization, flag burning, bankruptcy, satellite users, water resources, State Department authorization, DOD authorization. 
   Mr. President, do you know what is not on that? Any possible opportunity to debate an increase in the minimum wage. 
   We were effectively shut out from any opportunity last year. 
   We raised the issue, and we had to follow a similar process to bring that issue before the Senate. We were denied that opportunity. It is a very simple and fundamental issue of fairness and equity to those who are some of the hardest workers in America--11 million hard-working Americans, who go to work every single day, who work 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, and at the end of the year bring home what is less than a poverty wage in the United States of America. 
   Forty-five Members of the Senate have asked this body for an opportunity to address this issue so that we can have economic justice for the workers of this country, and what has been the response? Is there any opportunity to look down the road and say, ``In another week, or 2 weeks, or 3 weeks, you will have that opportunity''? No. The answer is no, you cannot have an opportunity to raise the minimum wage. You cannot even bring that to floor of the Senate. 
   I have heard a lot of talk about courtesy and about how bills are made here. What about courtesy toward the hard-working men and women who are making a minimum wage, who cannot put bread on the table or pay their rent? Or, courtesy toward the proud working woman we heard from just yesterday who said that she has been unable to go to see her two daughters in the last 3 years because when you make the minimum wage, you cannot afford to take a bus across the country to see them. How about courtesy to them, Mr. Leader, how about courtesy to them? Don't they count? Shouldn't they be on the agenda? 
   Mr. President, I find these arguments rather empty in trying to establish priorities here. I am sympathetic to trying to reach out with legislative solutions to the problems we have before us, but we have been denied any opportunity to do anything about these 11 million Americans earning the minimum wage. 
   And it is not only on the issue of the minimum wage. Last year we brought up an issue that is on the minds of every working family in this country, and that is the Patients' Bill of Rights--a very fundamental idea--that the medical profession, and not an accountant in the insurance companies, ought to be making the decision affecting families. That is the heart of the Patients' Bill of Rights. And we were denied the opportunity to consider it on the basis of the merits. We were denied the opportunity to even have a hearing. 
   I hope all of those voices that were out here talking about ``undermining the spirit of the Senate'' will go back and talk to the chairmen of those various committees and say: Give them a hearing, report a bill out, get it to the floor of the Senate, so we can make sure that we are going to have clinical trials available to women who have breast cancer or to children who have other dreaded diseases; to make sure people are going to have a specialist when they need it; to make sure people are going to be able to get treated at the nearest emergency room; to make sure, if someone has some particular illness or sickness, they are going to get the right prescription drugs, not just what is on an ordinary formulary. 
   It is not very complicated, not very revolutionary, not very dramatic. It is not our agenda, not the Democratic agenda. It is the agenda of 100 agencies of doctors, nurses, and consumers of this country who say this is what we need to protect your children, to protect your wives, and to protect your loved ones. 
   But where is it on this agenda? Where do we have the opportunity to debate these issues? Where do we even have the opportunity to say that we will be willing to enter into a time agreement, say, 3 days? We take days and weeks on some issues around here, but are not even given the opportunity to have time-limited debate on these issues, which are of such vital importance to the men, women, and children of this country. 
   Just tell us, majority leader, when we can debate these issues. Give us Mondays and Fridays when we are not voting. Give 
   us those days when the Senate has not been working. We will take any time. We will take Mondays and Fridays. We will take nighttimes. We will take any time. But give us the time, and put these issues on the agenda, because they are on the agenda of every family. 
   But no. We are denied the opportunity to debate these issues: ``It is not on our agenda, Senator. Don't insult us on our side by trying to bring this measure up on the floor of the Senate this afternoon. Don't inconvenience the majority that have an agenda here this afternoon. No, you cannot speak, Senator; you cannot speak here this afternoon on your particular amendment. No, no, we are not going to let you do that.'' 
   Mr. President, it is the best reason I know why we ought to change this body, why we need men and women in this body who are going to say that an increase in the minimum wage is deserved. An increase in the minimum wage is a women's issue--Sixty percent of those recipients of the minimum wage are women. It is a minority issue--nearly 4 million African-American and Hispanic workers would benefit from an increase in the minimum wage. 
   Mr. President, this is something that cries out for fairness. The American people support it. But, no, we cannot even debate the issue. 
   I am beginning to believe that the majority refuses to bring it up because they do not want to vote. We know what is going on, all the whispers: ``Don't let them bring up the minimum wage on the basis of the merits because it's going to be painful for us.'' 
   But how much pain does it cause those individuals who are trying to provide for their families tonight? How much pain are they going through? 
   Still, we heard words on the floor this afternoon about courtesy to the body. We were told about this is not the way of doing business, this is not how laws are made. I was reminded by another Republican leader, we ought to be showing good faith, that this is a tragedy but that it is irrelevant material. 
   You tell the 11 million people who are trying to survive on the minimum wage that this is what has happened to their purchasing power. 
   We have heard in the wake of the Littleton tragedy about the importance of parents spending time with  families. When you are working two or three jobs at the minimum wage, how much time do you have to spend with your children? That is the testimony these people are giving. They do not have the time to spend with their children. 
   Do you know what the payroll for the United States of America is a year? It is $4.3 trillion. Do you know what the impact of this increase in the minimum wage would be? It would be three-tenths of 1 percent of that, and we hear that it is going to add to the problems of inflation, that we are going to throw a lot of people out of work. Mr. President, $4.3 trillion, and we are talking about 50 cents a year for more than 11 million people. Come on. 
   If you do not want to vote for it, do not vote for it. Let's take it to the American people and see who they want to represent them. But no. Just read the schedule. No matter how much we try, Senator DASCHLE has not been able to bring those measures before the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Let me make a final comment, and then I will be glad to yield. 
   Mr. President, I underscore my support for Senator DASCHLE. I mentioned very briefly yesterday in our Democratic caucus that just before I came to the Senate, you did not get a vote in the Senate unless you got the nod from the majority leader. 
   But something took place in the 1960s. We had a movement within this Nation to strike down the walls of discrimination. People said, ``This is an important issue.'' The two places these issues were debated and considered were the federal court--the 5th Circuit--and the Senate. The debate on the war also took place in the Senate--and later, on the environment, disability rights, and other issues of crucial importance to our country. The Senate has been the repository for debate about the Nation's concerns. 
   One thing that every Senator understands is that everyone is equal in this body. So I cannot accept what the majority leader is saying: ``I make the decisions on this agenda. And no one else.'' That isn't what this body is about. 
   The Senate Democratic leader, Senator DASCHLE, indicated in a very positive and constructive way his willingness to try to work with the majority. This is the way it has been for 36 of the 37 and a half years I have been here--when Democrats have been in the majority and when Republicans have been in the majority. But never in that time have we had the leadership saying that one Senator is a lesser Member of this body than another. And that is what is being said, when a Member is denied the opportunity to raise important issues of conscience or of concern to their constituency. 
   They may be able to deny that opportunity on a particular measure. They may be able to prevent someone from speaking for 2 1/2 hours, as they did today. They may eat up another hour of time, as they did this afternoon by having a live quorum. That is all part of this process. You can play this nice or you can play it rough. 
   I like to believe, as someone who takes a sense of pride in being able to work together with Members on both sides of the aisle, that we have been able to make a difference. That is what the Senate should be about. But if they are going to play it the other way, let them just understand that we can play it that way too. 
   I suggest my colleagues go back and read the little book by Jim Allen. Senator Allen had this place tied up for 7 months--an individual Member of the Senate. If they are not going to work this out in a way that respects individual Members, they cannot expect Members to respond in the positive tradition of this great institution. 
   Every Member on both sides of the aisle wants to honor that tradition. That is what I want to see. Hopefully we can, through the leadership of Senator DASCHLE and Senator LOTT, proceed in that way for the remainder of this session. 
   I am glad to yield.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I know there may be some who differ, but I think we could pass the minimum wage and the Patients' Bill of Rights and the Y2K in a relatively short period of time and do the country's business. As it is we cannot do the country's business, as the Senator has pointed out, if we can never even reach the minimum wage or the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   In the meantime, we are told by my good friend from Arizona--I wish he were here--that he is frustrated because we have not had an amendment all week. Well, you know what he is saying? ``We haven't had an amendment that the majority can agree to all week.'' He said right here on the floor, ``We haven't had an amendment all week.'' Well, the rest of that sentence is: ``that he will permit, to be offered.'' 
   That is not what this place is about. I really am quite surprised that a Member of the Senate would interpret the rules that way.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct. An opportunity to debate the prescription drug issue is also important to our senior citizens. I know the Senator is home just about every weekend, and I am sure that when he meets with senior citizens they raise, in an almost unanimous chorus, their concerns about prescription drugs. I daresay they think we ought to be addressing that issue in the Senate. 
   When I go home and meet with workers, they are concerned about the minimum wage, they are concerned about the Patients' Bill of Rights, they are concerned about prescription drugs. Sure, the legislation before us is important, but then I look at this agenda and wonder, where are the issues the people at home care about? 
   It is important that we have the opportunity to debate and discuss these issues. We are denied that opportunity now.

   these issues, and others that are important to our colleagues, their day on the floor of the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Let me answer very specifically on the time-sensitive aspect. If we do not increase the minimum wage now to 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year, next year the real value of the $5.15 minimum wage will be $4.90. So they are going to be worse off. Even with the 50 cent increase, as the Senator can tell from this chart, we are still below what we were during the 1960s, all during the 1970s, and up through the 1980s, in terms of purchasing power. This last increase was supported by Republicans and Democrats alike. 
   Yes, this is time sensitive, because the people who are living on the minimum wage are not just holding where they are, they are going down. This is at a time when our nation is experiencing the greatest economic prosperity in the history of the world. But we evidently don't have time to debate and act on this. 
   I yield to the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. KENNEDY. As mentioned earlier, it is not just today that we have been refused an opportunity to debate it. I have in my hand what the leadership has provided as the schedule for all of April and all of May. We are coming to the end of April now, but there are still several items that haven't been finished in April, and all of May. And nowhere on this do we have any indication that we will have the opportunity to debate either a minimum wage increase or a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   If the Senator remembers, we were denied the opportunity to debate both of those issues at the end of last year as well, and we received assurances from the majority leader that the Patients' Bill of Rights would be considered in an early part of this session. We have had the markup in our Health and Education Committee, but still there is no priority on that particular issue. 
   So the Senator is right. Not only can we not consider that today, but it doesn't seem that it will be possible for consideration at any time in the foreseeable future.

   Mr. KENNEDY. No, it is not, Senator. You have identified something which is enormously important and that is the increasing evidence that the smaller the schools--schools where every schoolteacher knows the name of every child in the school, and knows the parents--and the smaller the classrooms, the greater the reduction in incidences of hall rage, and other types of school violence. This, it seems to me, would be worthy of debate and discussion. If we spent some time, knowing that we will debate that, went back to our States and listened to schoolteachers and parents for a few days and then came back and talked about these types of issues, perhaps we could do something that might be useful.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I heard the majority leader. There are many Members who, obviously, agree with the majority leader and share the sentiments expressed here on the floor of the Senate a few moments ago in the moments of silence, and the very superb prayer of the chaplain in reaching out to those families. However, there are Members who want to at least consider some legislation dealing with responsibility in the area of firearms. 
   Is the leader now indicating to Members he will give us the opportunity to have some debate on those measures, and other measures, as well, within a period of 2 weeks? Measures that could help and assist parents, families and schools. Measures that are balanced and permit Members to reach across the aisle to try and work out bipartisan approaches? Could the majority leader indicate now whether we will have that opportunity and give assurance to the American people that the subject matter which is No. 1 in the minds of all families and children across this country--at least we will have the opportunity in the U.S. Senate to debate some proposals and to reach resolutions of those.

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield for a moment, with those assurances, I have worked with a number of our colleagues--they may have differing views--and I think the assurances of the majority leader that the Senate would have an opportunity to debate legislation with regard to the limitations on weapons and also support and assistance for families and schools, and that we will have debate and resolution of some of those measures, then, I think at least I will look forward to that opportunity. 
   I think with the assurance of the majority leader--I know the Senate Democratic leader wanted to talk to colleagues--it is my certain belief the Democratic leader would support the majority leader in that undertaking. I think the message will go out this afternoon to families across the country that the Senate of the United States--hopefully, in a bipartisan way--will give focus and attention to different ideas, recommendations and suggestions of Members of this body,  and hopefully from others, to try to see what we can do not only about the problems of the schools but the inner cities and other communities affected by guns, as well.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Republican lockbox proposal is deeply flawed, and does not deserve to be adopted. It does nothing to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund for future beneficiaries. In fact, it would do just the reverse. This legislation actually places Social Security at greater risk than it is today. It would allow payroll tax dollars that belong to Social Security to be spent instead on risky privatization schemes. And, because of the harsh debt ceiling limits it would impose, this plan could produce a governmental shutdown that would jeopardize the timely payment of Social Security benefits to current recipients. 
   It is time to look behind the rhetoric of the proponents of the lockbox. Their statements convey the impression that they have taken a major step toward  protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their proposal would not provide even one additional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it extend the solvency of the Trust Fund by even one more day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. At best, that is all their so-called lockbox would do. 
   By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 trillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next 15 years. By doing so, the President's budget would extend the life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation, to beyond 2050. 
   There is a fundamental difference between the parties over what to do with the savings which will result from using the surplus for debt reduction. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have been required to pay interest on the national debt will become available each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes those debt savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. I wholeheartedly agree. But the Republicans refuse to commit those dollars to Social Security. They are short-changing Social Security, while pretending to save it. 
   Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every budget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By using the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next 15 years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every budget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Sensible fiscal management now will produce enormous savings to the Government in future years. Since it was payroll tax revenues which make the debt reduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social Security. 
   That is what President Clinton rightly proposed in his budget. His plan would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for all future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable plan. But Republican Members of Congress oppose it. 
   Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide any new resources to fund Social Security benefits for future retirees, it does not even effectively guarantee that existing payroll tax revenues will be used to pay Social Security benefits. They have deliberately built a trapdoor in their lockbox. Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used instead to finance unspecified reform plans. This loophole opens the door to risky schemes to finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. If these dollars are expended on private accounts, there will be nothing left for debt reduction, and no new resources to fund future Social Security benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts in the future. 
   A genuine lockbox would prevent any such diversion of funds. A genuine lockbox would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The Republican lockbox does just the opposite. It actually invites a raid on the Social Security Trust Fund. 
   Republican retirement security reform could be nothing more than tax cuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefiting their wealthy friends. Placing Social Security on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priority, not further enriching the already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security retirement benefits for more than 50 percent of their annual income. Without it, half the Nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. 
   To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to strengthen Social Security, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert dollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other purposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future Social Security benefits.'' 
   The proposed lockbox poses a second, very serious threat to Social Security. By using the debt ceiling as an enforcement mechanism, it runs the risk of creating a government shutdown crisis. The Republicans propose to enforce their lockbox by mandating dangerously low debt ceilings. Such a reduced debt ceiling could make it impossible for the Federal Government to meet its financial obligations--including its obligation to pay Social Security benefits to millions of men and women who depend upon them. The risk is real. 
   The misguided debt ceiling proposal would create a Sword of Damocles which could fall at any time with the slightest miscalculation. If the Congressional Budget Office's economic projections are slightly off, if there is an economic downturn and unemployment rises, if the on-budget surplus is not quite as large as anticipated--any of these events could cause the sword to fall. The proposal is so extreme that it could trigger a shutdown crisis even if the level of debt was declining, merely because it was not declining as quickly as projected. The Government shutdown provoked by irresponsible Republican tactics in 1995 taught us the danger inherent in 
    taking such risks. Yet, the current debt ceiling scheme seems to suggest that the Republican elephant's memory is failing. 
   There would be many innocent casualties of a new government shutdown. It is ironic that many of those who would be harmed most by a shutdown are the elderly and disabled citizens dependent on Social Security. If the debt ceiling is reached, the government would be unable to issue their benefit checks. The law is very clear. The President would have no discretion. Social Security benefits could not be paid. 
   The sponsors of the lockbox claim that the legislation protects Social Security benefits by making them a ``priority'' for payment. However, that will not solve the problem. Once the debt limit has been reached, payment priorities will be irrelevant. The debt ceiling will prevent all payments from being made. There will be no money to pay any obligation of the federal government--including Social Security benefits. 
   Those advocating this harsh bill will also claim that Congress would never allow Social Security recipients to go without their checks for long. However, this bill would require a super-majority to raise the debt ceiling so that the checks could be issued. Getting the necessary votes would take time. I believe even a few days would be too long for us to ask the elderly and disabled to wait. For many Social Security recipients, that monthly check is a financial lifeline. They need it to buy food and prescription drugs, to pay the rent, and for other necessities of life. They can't afford to wait while Congress debates. This legislation, if enacted, would make Social Security recipients potential pawns in a future debt ceiling crisis. That may not be the sponsor's intent, but it could very well be the result. It is fundamentally wrong to put those who depend on Social Security at risk in this way. 
   The lockbox which proponents claim will save Social Security actually imperils it. As Treasury Secretary Rubin has said, ``This legislation does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund, while potentially threatening the ability to make Social Security payments to millions of Americans.'' 
   While this lockbox provides no genuine protection for Social Security, it provides no protection at all for Medicare. The Republicans are so indifferent to senior citizens' health care that they have completely omitted Medicare from their lockbox. 
   By contrast, Democrats have proposed to devote 15 percent of the surplus to Medicare over the next 15 years. Those new dollars would come entirely from the on-budget portion of the surplus. The Republicans have adamantly refused to provide any additional funds for Medicare. Instead, they propose to spend the entire on-budget surplus on tax cuts disproportionately benefitting the wealthiest Americans. 
   According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if we do not provide additional resources, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25  years will require benefit cuts of almost 11 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. Keeping it solvent for 50 years will require cuts of 25 percent. 
   The conference agreement passed by House and Senate Republicans earmarks the money that should be used for Medicare for tax cuts. Eight-hundred billion dollars are earmarked for tax cuts--and not a penny for Medicare. The top priority for the American people is to protect both Social Security and Medicare. But this misguided budget puts Medicare and Social Security last, not first. 
   Democrats oppose this ``lockbox'' because we want real protection for Social Security and Medicare. Our proposal says: save Social Security and Medicare first, before the surpluses earned by American workers are squandered on new tax breaks or new spending. It says: extend the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund, by assuring that some of the bounty of our booming economy is used to preserve, protect, and improve Medicare. 
   Our proposal does not say no to tax cuts. Substantial amounts would still be available for tax relief. It does not say no to new spending on important national priorities. But it does say that protecting Medicare should be as high a national priority for the Congress as it is for the American people. 
   Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren know, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are already stretched to the limit--and often beyond the limit--to purchase the health care they need. Because of gaps in Medicare and rising health costs, Medicare now covers only about 50 percent of the health bills of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent of their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--almost as large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have risen to 29 percent. Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, senior citizens have to choose between putting food on the table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. This problem demands our attention. 
   Those on the other side of the aisle have tried to conceal their own indifference to Medicare behind a cloud of obfuscation. They say that their plan does not cut Medicare. That may be true in a narrow, legalistic sense--but it is fundamentally false and misleading. Between now and 2025, Medicare has a shortfall of almost $1 trillion. If we do nothing to address that shortfall, we are imposing almost $1 trillion in Medicare cuts, just as surely as if we directly legislated those cuts. No amount of rhetoric can conceal this fundamental fact. The authors of the Republican budget resolution had a choice to make between tax breaks for the wealthy and saving Medicare--and they chose to slash Medicare. 
   I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to reject this ill-conceived proposal. It jeopardizes Social Security and ignores Medicare. It is an assault on America's senior citizens, and it does not deserve to pass.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I join with others who rise today to express our great sense of sorrow to those families and all of those who have experienced the loss and suffering in Littleton, CO. 
   Our hearts go out to the children and their families and all the victims of this latest senseless school tragedy. In the days and weeks to come, we will learn much more about how and why it could have happened--and why it happened again, after the fair warning we have had from similar tragedies that shocked the nation so deeply in recent years. 
   This terrible tragedy has scarred the Nation and reminded us, once again, about the fragile nature of the young children in our country who are going off to school every day. It reminds all of us that we have an important responsibility to do everything we can to give children the support and love they need, to help them as they walk the path of adolescence into maturity. 
   Obviously, the schools are an extremely important element in that development. But we know nothing replaces the home, nothing replaces a parent, nothing replaces those members of the family or friends who are loving, caring, and encouraging. Those who offer firmness in establishing guidelines and guideposts for children as they develop. So all of us are very mindful of those tragedies that are being experienced even while we meet here, of the tears that are being shed, and the struggle of many of those young children for their lives, even as we meet here today. 
   There is a certain poignancy since we are meeting on education legislation. It is important legislation. It is worthwhile of passage. But I think all of us today are remembering Jonesboro, AR; Notus, ID; Springfield, OR; Fayetteville, TN; Edinboro, PA; West Paducah, KY; and Pearl, MS. Now we have Littleton, CO. All of those communities have been affected by violence in their community schools. 
   Perhaps reviewing the kinds of acts of violence that take place in schools, they do not appear to be overwhelming in total numbers, as we might think of total numbers. I think all of us are enormously moved and touched by these human tragedies, because, of course, all of us believe young children have such hope and promise and opportunity to live in our communities and in our country. Children offer so much to their families and to their loved ones. To see the violence snuff out innocent lives is a factor, a force in all of our souls that rings heavily. 
   So, all of us here in the Senate reach out to those families. 
   Mr. President, in reading through the newspapers in my own city of Boston today, there were some rather interesting articles which I will just mention here on the floor of the Senate, and then I will take time to address the measure that is at hand.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Let me just mention a few quotations. This is one of the participants:  
   ``It's getting a little crazier and a little more frequent. It seems to be the boundaries between reality and fantasy are decreasing more and more,'' said Dr. Bernard Yudowitz, a forensic psychiatrist. 
   ``As young people project themselves in virtual relative movies and arcades and get their heads into that, life becomes virtual reality, which is not reality,'' he said. 
   Combine that with the age-old traits of teenagers--strong urges, feelings of aggression and a sense of omnipotence--and you have a dangerous mix Yudowitz said. He said the feeling of omnipotence allows teens to ignore consequences to themselves and others. 
   ``It (adolescence) can be a fun and creative time. But you need a context to provide boundaries,'' he said. * * * * * 
   The real issue is what's causing this behavior, and the fact is kids who pull the trigger have problems getting along with their peers.'' 
   Working parents and school officials don't pay enough attention to the social competence of children. And when children become social outcasts, they're more susceptible to dark media messages. 
   ``A normal, adjusted child who watches violent programming will come away with a different message than a child who lacks the social skills to get along with his peers.'' ``They feel violent programs are in fact endorsing revenge.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Then it continues on with some very constructive suggestions, from Mr. Rosenthal, who is a co-founder of Stop Handgun Violence, talking about responsibility, responsibility with regard to the availability of weapons. He is talking about the responsibility of parents who own guns to make sure the guns are securely locked and kept separately from ammunition, so no weapon is left loaded and accessible to children in a house; the responsibility of both manufacturers and dealers to prevent the proliferation of guns that are sold to children directly and on the black market, and that too easily get into the hands of gangs and the criminal element. These are important responsibilities that adults must meet. They are not going to be a cure-all. They are not going to be an end-all. 
   But they are a beginning. A beginning to provide a measurement of responsibility. We want responsibility from young people, from children, and we want responsibility from others as well who have the access and the ability to see that either weapons are available or not available to children. 
   We have 14 children die every single day from gun violence. None of us this afternoon have come up with a silver bullet to resolve all of these kinds of problems, but we ought to be able to take some measured steps to make some difference. It is not going to be enough to just shed tears, because they are empty tears, unless we are prepared to take some actions on these measures.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to my friend from Missouri speak about a particular provision about guns which he offered to the legislation and which was retained in the ED-Flex conference report. I am also reminded that there was a very close referendum in his home State, only decided 53-47, on whether a felon could purchase and carry a concealed weapon--even allowing a felon to carry that weapon onto school grounds. The National Rifle Association said yes, they should be able to do that. There is a similar measure in Colorado itself, right now it is ready to be voted on by the state legislature. We will soon enough see statements from the National Rifle Association supporting this law--urging that criminals ought to be able to have concealed weapons, even though they have committed felonies, that for their own self-protection they can carry those weapons anywhere, even into a school--come on now. Come on now. We cannot solve all the problems here, but we can reduce the access and the availability in these kinds of circumstances. We ought to at least ask ourselves, How hard is the National Rifle Association going to press on these measures? How many times do we have to be reminded about the tragic consequences these measures can have? 
   The good citizens of Missouri rejected that law. It is the first time we have had a referendum, and it was rejected by the public. 
   I am not here to describe what the position of the Senator was on that issue, but it does seem to me that to pass a law that says someone who has committed a felony--they could have been convicted of a felony like domestic violence--is permitted to go out and buy and carry a concealed weapon is not moving us in the right direction. 
   I hope as my good friends and colleagues have mentioned--Senator SCHUMER, Senator DURBIN and others who will speak on this--that we will be able to at least present to the Senate some recommendations which really demand responsibility from those who have access to keep those guns safely away from children. 
   It is interesting to me that this body has voted to effectively prevent the Centers for Disease Control from accurately calculating the number of injuries from gun violence because of the power of the National Rifle Association on the floor of the Senate and the House of Representatives. They do not want to know how much gun violence is out there. We do not let the Centers for Disease Control, using all their capabilities, even tell us how big the problem is. 
   Today, as we sit in the Senate, the Consumer Products Safety Commission has the ability to provide safety for toy guns for children so that the ends will not break off and a child will not gag or choke. But virtually all protections available to the Consumer Products Safety Commission for real guns that can be used against the citizens have been taken away. Isn't that extraordinary? The Consumer Products Safety Commission can issue regulations on toy guns for your children but not real guns that can kill you. Why? Because of the power of the National Rifle Association. 
   Mr. President, I hope people around the country who are sharing the grief of those families understand that there are no 
   magic bullets to resolve these issues, but we can take some steps and we should take some steps to do something about it. I believe in requiring responsible actions by manufacturers who produce guns to have safety locks so that they will not discharge and kill  children if they are dropped and cannot be fired by a child who takes the gun without parental supervision, and requiring other safety provisions so they can only be used by those who purchase the weapon. 
   There are all kinds of technology available which add maybe a few dollars to the cost of those weapons, but can greatly improve the safety of the guns with just a little responsible action by the manufacturers, by the dealers, and by the gun owners. Hopefully, we can get their support for legislation that can at least reduce access and availability of weapons to children who are going to school. I hope we will be able to do that. 
   I think we can give the assurance that we will have an opportunity to debate those issues in this Congress, hopefully very soon, with or without the hearings in the Judiciary Committee; preferably with, but, if necessary, without. I do not think those measures are so difficult and so complex that the Members of this body cannot grasp them. We can have some accountability in the Senate on those measures. 
   Mr. President, on the underlying legislation, I urge my colleagues to support the ED-Flex conference report. We will have many opportunities over the course of this session to improve and expand the partnership with States and local communities to strengthen public schools across then nation. 
   I commend Senator FRIST and Senator WYDEN for their leadership on the ED-Flex Partnership Act of 1999. And, I commend Chairman JEFFORDS, Congressman GOODLING, and Congressman CLAY for their leadership in making education a priority in this Congress. 
   To date, the Federal Government has been a limited partner in supporting elementary and secondary education. However, we have made a substantial investment increasing the accessibility and affordability of college for all qualified students. For elementary and secondary education, the Federal Government provides 7 cents out of every dollar at the local level. The ED-Flex legislation is not going to provide an additional nickel or dollar to any school district. 
   In 1994, when Senator Hatfield offered, and I supported, an amendment to provide that ED-Flex program for 6 pilot states. Then we expanded the program to 6 more states so that there are currently 12 ED-Flex pilot States. The conference report today is simply an expansion of that program. 
   Mr. President, some may say, why don't we give complete flexibility to the local community? Communities need additional support. We know that the primary responsibility for the education of the nation's children remains within the local community, the local school boards, teachers, and parents, and with help and assistance from the States, and some help and assistance from the Federal Government. 
   When we first passed title I--I was here when we did it--we did not provide the kind of statutory protections and accountability that we have today, many of which can be waived under ED-Flex. And what do you know? Five years later, they were using the title I programs to build swimming pools and buy shoulder pads for football players in local communities. It did not ensure that the neediest children who had the greatest needs were served and served well. So we amended the law to ensure that federal support for education was targeted on the neediest students and used on targeted purposes. 
   There is an appropriate role for greater flexibility--with accountability--and we recognized that in the 1994 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. The ED-Flex Partnership Act is a worthwhile step towards improving public schools. By giving states the authority to waive certain statutory and regulatory requirements that apply to federal education programs, we hope to support and enhance state and local education reforms that will help all children reach high standards of achievement. 
   Families across the nation want Uncle Sam to be a partner in improving education. Parents are impatient about results. They want their communities, states, and the federal government to work together to improve public schools. In fulfilling our federal responsibility, we must continue to ensure that greater flexibility is matched with strong accountability for results, so that every parent knows their children are getting the education they deserve. 
   The ED-Flex conference report meets that goal by including strong accountability measures. Flexibility and accountability must go hand-in-hand in order to ensure that we get better results for all students. 
   If states are going to accept federal resources paid for by public tax dollars, we must ensure strong accountability. In the ED-Flex Conference Report, the House and the Senate maintained our commitment to serving the neediest and poorest children to help improve their academic achievement. Senator WELLSTONE worked hard to ensure that we retained these targeting provisions. 
   We have retained the amendment of my friend and colleague from Rhode Island, Senator REED, that insisted that we ensure that parents have a strong role in the waiver process and that they are going to be a strong partner in the educational decisions that 
   affect their children. I commend Senator REED. 
   The conference report also helps see that increased flexibility leads to improved student achievement. Accountability in this context means that states must evaluate how waivers actually improve student achievement. Open-ended waivers make no sense. Results are what count. The Secretary of Education has the power to terminate a state's waiver authority if student achievement is not improving. States must be able to terminate any waivers granted to a school district or participating schools if student achievement is not improving. If the waivers are not leading to satisfactory progress, it makes no sense to continue them. 
   I also commend Senator MURRAY for her work to ensure that our downpayment on hiring 100,000 new teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades I retained. We will have an opportunity in this session to come back to the broader issue about whether it is going to be a matter of national priority that we continue our commitment to reducing class size. This commitment is one of President Clinton's most important initiatives on education. The Senate-passed bill would have undermined it, and the decision by the conferees to retain it is a significant victory for the nation's schools and students. 
   But, these accomplishments are not enough. More--much more--needs to be done to make sure that every community has the support it needs to implement what works to improve their public schools. We must do more to meet the needs of schools, families, and children, so that all children can attend good schools and meet high standards of achievement. 
   We should do more to help communities address the real problems of rising student enrollments, overcrowded classrooms, dilapidated schools, teacher shortages, underqualified teachers, high new teacher turnover rates, and lack of after-school programs. These are real problems that deserve real solutions. 
   We should meet our commitment to reducing class size over seven years. We should help recruit more teachers. We should improve and expand professional development of teachers. We should expand after-school programs. We should help ensure all children have access to technology in the classroom. And we should rebuild and modernize school buildings. 
   ED-Flex is a good bipartisan start by Congress to meeting all of these challenges. My hope is that these other proposals to address critical issues will also receive the bipartisan support they deserve, so they can be in place for the beginning of the next academic year this fall. Improving education is clearly one of our highest national priorities. Investing in education is investing in a stronger America here at home and around the world, and I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides to address the critical education issues facing communities across the country. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I was visiting today with the leader in the House of Representatives, Congressman GEPHARDT, and we talked about education. He spoke very knowledgeably about a school he visited in Harlem, NY, that has had significant success in improving academic achievement of students. He pointed out that this school had been a school with 2,000 students. Overcrowding and discipline were a problem  that was impeding the academic success of its students. They decided to divide it into 10 schools of 200 students each. 
   The point is that the head mistress at that particular school was asked--as everyone asks--What is really the secret? Of course, we all know that there is no one answer to improving education. But this one course of action was one that both Leader GEPHARDT and I found very persuasive. By reducing the size of the school and classrooms, every teacher in that school knew the name of every student in that school; and every student in that school knew the name of every teacher. And every teacher in every class knew the parents by name of every one of their students and had a relationship with every one of those parents. They were then able to effectively reach students and academic achievement and discipline improved. They were able to develop a spirit and a sense of family in an area where students feel many kinds of pressures. Students were given the support, love, attention, discipline, and firmness, they needed to get results. 
   So, Mr. President, if we, as a society generally and as a people individually, offer our prayers for those families who have been affected and as a country begin to try to look at some of the issues that are presented by these tragedies in an important way, then perhaps even the extraordinary clouds that are over this, and particularly in Colorado, might part just briefly so some sunshine might come in and we may do better for our children in the future. 
   I commend and thank all the staff members for their skillful assistance on this ED-Flex legislation: Susan Hattan, Sherry Kaiman, and Jenny Smulson of Senator JEFFORDS' staff; Townsend Lange and Denzel McGuire of Senator GREGG's staff; Lori Meyer and Meredith Medley of Senator FRIST's staff; Suzanne Day of Senator DODD's staff; Elyse Wasch of Senator REED's staff; Greg Williamson of Senator MURRAY's staff; Bev Schroeder and Sharon Masling of Senator HARKIN's staff; Lindsay Rosenberg of Senator WYDEN's staff; and Connie Garner, Jane Oates, Dana Fiordaliso, and Danica Petroshius of my own staff. 
   I also commend the skillful work of the House staff on the conference committee, including Vic Klatt, Sally Lovejoy, Christy Wolfe, and Kent Talbert of the House Committee's Republican staff; Melanie Merola of Representative CASTLE's staff; Mark Zuckerman, Sedric Hendricks, and Alex Nock of the House Committee's Democratic staff; Charlie Barone of Representative MILLER's staff; and Page Tomlin of Representative PAYNE's staff. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment and then I am prepared to yield back my time. I guess the Senator from Minnesota still wants to address the Senate. I yield myself a moment. 
   In my absence, our chairman has indicated that we will move forward and have some hearings about violence in schools for our Committee on Education and Human Resources. I commend him for being willing to undertake that. I think that could be enormously important. 
   I do not think at the outset we are expecting the magical solution, but I do think that we probably will get some very constructive ideas. 
   I can remember it wasn't long ago that several Members of the Senate got together with the Attorney General and some of the parents from schools that had seen this kind of violence in the recent past. The parents had a number of ideas and recommendations and suggestions. I think doing this in the formal setting of a committee hearing so that we will have the record and have it kept and make it available to our colleagues perhaps will be one of the most important things that we undertake in our committee--and we have many important things to undertake. 
   I thank the chairman of the committee for his willingness on that and indicate that we are all looking forward to cooperating and working very closely with the Chair in every way that we possibly can to hold meaningful hearings and perhaps to help not just the families, but to help our country come to grips with at least the role of the school in this whole process of young people's development and what we might be able to suggest that might be a constructive and useful idea. 
   We will not have all the answers, but maybe we will have some. I think with that kind of commitment today, many of us feel at least the Senate is attempting to deal with this in an important way. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator JAY ROCKEFELLER and I are introducing the Access to Rx Medications in Medicare Act. This legislation will add a long overdue benefit to Medicare--coverage of prescription drugs. Medicare is a promise to senior citizens. It says ``Work hard, contribute to Medicare during your working years, and you will be guaranteed health security in your retirement years.'' But too often that promise is broken, because of Medicare's failure to protect the elderly against the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   Our legislation will provide every senior citizen or disabled person with Medicare coverage for up to $1,700 worth of prescription drugs a year, and additional coverage for those with very high drug costs. Medicare will contract with the private sector organizations in regions across the country to administer and deliver the new coverage. Beneficiaries in traditional Medicare will select an organization to provide them with the benefit. Beneficiaries enrolled in Medicare+Choice organizations will receive coverage through their plan. Seniors who have equivalent or greater coverage through retiree health plans can continue that coverage or enroll in the new program. The bill will also required private Medigap plans to include supplemental coverage. 
   Fourteen million beneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage. Millions more have coverage that is unaffordable, inadequate, or uncertain. The average senior citizen fills 18 prescriptions a year, and takes four to six prescription drugs daily. Many of them face monthly 
   bills of $100, $200, or even more to fill their prescriptions. The lack of prescription drug coverage condemns many senior citizens to second-class medicine. Too often, they decide to go without the medication essential for effective health care, because they have to pay other bills for food or heat or shelter. These difficult choices will only worsen in the years ahead, since so many of the miracle cures of the future will be based on pharmaceutical products. 
   This legislation is a lifeline for every senior citizen who needs prescription drugs to treat an illness or maintain their health. It assures that today's and tomorrow's senior citizens will be able to share in the medical miracles that we can expect in the new century of the life sciences. It addresses the greatest single gap in Medicare--and the one that is the greatest anachronism in Medicare today. 
   When Medicare was first enacted in 1965, its coverage was patterned after typical private insurance policies at the time--when only a minority of such policies covered prescription drugs. Today, prescription drug coverage is virtually universal in private plans, but Medicare is still caught in its 1965 time warp. 
   This legislation has been carefully developed to respond to the legitimate concerns of the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry. We have consulted with many leading firms on the development of this plan, and we believe that the industry will work with us to refine it and enact it. The most profitable industry in America has a strong interest in assuring that the miracle cures it creates are affordable for senior citizens. 
   Prescription drug coverage under Medicare will not come cheaply, and I intend to work with my colleagues in Congress to find the fairest way to pay for this benefit. It may well be necessary to allocate a portion of the budget surplus to defray the cost. The hard work of American families has created the surplus. Assuring it should be as high a priority for the Congress as it is for the American people. We know that improper or inadequate use of prescription drugs now costs Medicare an estimated at least $20 billion annually in avoidable hospital and physician costs. Clearly, a well-constructed prescription drug benefit can achieve large savings by reducing these avoidable costs. The bottom line is that there are many possible ways to pay for this benefit. A consensus on the best financing will develop as Congress considers this issue. 
   This legislation is literally a matter of life and death for millions of elderly and disabled citizens served by Medicare in communities throughout America. It is time for Congress to listen to their voices, and the voices of their children and grandchildren, too.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, Rosa Parks is an enduring symbol of freedom, dignity, and courage for our time and for all time, and she eminently deserves this Congressional Gold Medal. 
   Her momentous decision to quietly and peacefully defy her community's segregation laws nearly half a century ago was a defining moment for the entire civil rights movement in the United States and in many other lands as well. On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Mrs. Parks was a 42 year old seamstress returning home on a city bus after a long and tiring day at work. She refused to give up her seat and move to the back of the bus as the law required, and America would never be the same again. 
   Because of her quiet, simple, eloquent act of courage, she was arrested and fined. As news of her arrest spread, thousands of African Americans in the city quickly rallied to her cause, and four days later, on December 5, 1955, the famous Montgomery Bus Boycott was launched. 
   It took a year, but the Supreme Court declared the Montgomery segregation law unconstitutional. On December 21, 1956, thanks to her unyielding demand for equal justice, Rosa Parks and the African Americans of Montgomery were free to ride on the city buses as full and equal citizens. 
   The Montgomery Bus Boycott touched the conscience of the nation, and focused the attention of citizens across America on the evils of segregation, discrimination, and the notorious Jim Crow laws. The power and justice of the civil rights movement could not be denied. In the decade that followed, Congress enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1964, and America took giant steps toward fulfilling the promise of equal justice under law and full constitutional rights for all Americans. 
   For her historic act of peaceful civil disobedience, Rosa Parks is often called the ``Mother of the Civil Rights Movement.'' She changed the course of  America history, and made us a stronger, better, and freer nation. All Americans owe her a deep debt of gratitude for bringing us closer to our ideals, and I am proud to support this bill to award her the Congressional Gold Medal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today's New York Times contains an excellent article by William L. Hamilton on the city of Northampton in Massachusetts and the remarkable revitalization that has taken place in the city in recent years. Northampton is also the subject of a soon-to-be published book, Home Town, by Tracy Kidder, in which the author captures the spirit and essence of community that has turned this former small mill town into the cultural, historic and economically revitalized city it is today. 
   I also commend the woman responsible for much of this successful revitalization, Mayor Mary Ford. For the past 8 years, Mayor Ford has brought a new spirit to the city with her many successful initiatives. Northampton's schools are renovated, its streets are safer, its water is cleaner, its housing is more affordable, and its roads are more accessible. 
   Mayor Ford has also demonstrated impressive leadership in making Northampton a leading cultural center of Western Massachusetts. The city is home to the Massachusetts International Festival of the Arts, Paradise City Arts Festival, the Northampton Film Festival, and the newly restored historic Calvin Threatre. 
   Mayor Ford is on the front lines every day, making an important difference in the lives of families in Northampton, and she's done a remarkable job. The people of Northampton and all of us in Massachusetts are proud of her outstanding leadership, and we commend her for making Northampton the vital city that it is today. Well done, Mayor Ford, and keep up the great work!

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last week the hemisphere lost one of its greatest leaders on human rights with the death of Raul Cardinal Silva Henriquez of Chile. 
   The Cardinal was a great man, and one of the great voices for freedom and justice of our time and of all time. He was a brave and holy man whom many of us were proud to call a friend. The poet Yeats said: 
 Think where man's glory most begins and ends, And say my glory was I had such friends.  
   Most of all, the Cardinal was a friend to all those who needed friends the most--the oppressed, the frightened, the lost, the ``disappeared.'' He sheltered the homeless, but he also sheltered those who had homes but dared not go to them. During the dark days of Chile's recent history, when the flame of democracy was nearly extinguished, and the noble concepts of freedom and human rights considered subversive ideas by those in power, this courageous man of God would not be silent. 
   Now, God has called home his good and faithful servant, and we understand that. Only God could still that strong and powerful voice. His enemies may have hoped to silence him through all those years, but they dared not. 
   I first meet the Cardinal in the 1970's, shortly after the coup that stifled democracy in Chile. He had come to Washington, and I had been holding hearings here in the Senate, year after year, to try to shine some sunlight into the darkness of the human rights abuses in his land. He asked if we could meet privately, away from the glare of publicity, and we did so, at a friend's home. As we sat and drank tea, he spoke directly and intensely about human rights in his country, without anger, and with insight and determination. 
   In those years, he had created the Committee for Peace, an ecumenical movement of Catholics, Protestants, and Jews dedicated to providing relief to the victims of human rights abuses. 
   Later, defying the Pinochet regime, he formed the Vicarage of Solidarity, to provide legal assistance for the victims of the abuses, and to protect the lawyers who championed their cause. Without the protective mantle of the Cardinal and the Church, these organizations would almost surely have been snuffed out. Because of him, many people found the courage to speak out and to continue the long battle for democracy. 
   We met several more times over the years. When I visited Chile in 1986, the government refused to meet me. But the people, led by the Cardinal, welcomed me, and I will never forget that inspiring and deeply moving reception. 
   At another time and place, the poet Gabriela Mistral wrote about the wife of a prisoner:  
   From the house I grieve, to the fiery thimble of his dungeon, I fly back and forth like a living shuttle, like one who knows no other path, until at last the walls open, and let me pass through iron, pitch and mortar.  
   The Cardinal heard the cry of women like that, and their men. Chile's Ambassador to the U.S., Genaro Arriagada, was one of those who, because of the Cardinal, found the courage to resist. His ``No'' campaign the 1980's led finally to the shining moment in the National Stadium in  Santiago in 1990. None of us who were in the stadium that day will ever forget it. 
   President Aylwin had already accepted the sash of office, a symbol of the restoration of freedom and democracy that so many, including the Cardinal, had worked for so long and so well to achieve. 
   In the stadium, which had been the darkest symbol of fear, imprisonment and despair, a beautiful tribute occurred. A young girl walked across the infield, while the great stadium scoreboard scrolled the names of the disappeared. Their families danced to a song about freedom in Chile. When President Aylwin spoke at sunset, thousands of candles burned, and fireworks lighted up the sky above the jubilant crowd. The celebration lasted for hours--and it continues to this day. 
   Many profiles in courage made that glorious day possible. But no one did more to make it possible than that strong, brave man of God, our friend, Raul Cardinal Silva Henriquez. May he rest in eternal peace.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senator JEFFORDS, Senator DODD, Senator LANDRIEU, and I are proposing legislation to expand and improve quality child care across the country. The provisions are intended to support the full range of child care choices that parents make, including the decision to provide stay-at-home care. 
   Child care is one of the most pressing challenges facing the nation. The need to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of child care is indisputable. Across the country, 13 million children under age 6 spend all or part of their day in child care. 
   Every child deserves high quality care. We know that child development, especially in the early years, is dependent on safe, reliable care that offers stable relationships and intellectually stimulating activities. Child care that fulfills these goals can make all the difference in enabling children to learn, grow, and reach their full potential. This bill will help improve the quality and safety of care by establishing a competitive grant program to help states improve the quality of their care. 
   The bill also gives new incentives to businesses to assist in the care of their employees' children and to strengthen the quality of care. Businesses will be permitted a tax deduction for donations of equipment, materials, transportation services, facilities, and staff time to public schools and care providers. Employers who contribute to the child care arrangements of their employees will receive a tax credit of 50 percent of their expenses up to $150,000 a year ($250,000 a year with respect to three or more facilities in different locations) in allowable employee-related child care expenses such as the construction or renovation of facilities and employee subsidies. 
   The quality of care can also be improved by giving the public more information about the caliber of the programs in their community. Working parents deserve to know that their children are not just safe, but well cared for. Our bill will provide that reassurance by improving parents' access to the information they need to make informed decisions about the selection of child care. Establishing a more effective system for distributing public information will make it easier for parents to select care with confidence, and will also encourage care providers to improve their services. 
   Raising children is expensive, in and of itself, and families who place their children in out-of-home care face the additional burden of obtaining quality child care. Millions of families cannot afford the child care they need in order to raise, protect, and teach their children. Full-day care can easily cost up to $10,000 per year--often as much as college tuition for an older child. Too often, the high cost of quality care puts it out of reach for many working families, particularly those earning low wages. These parents--working parents--constantly must choose between paying the rent or mortgage, buying food, and providing the quality care their child needs. 
   Our bill provides support to all families with children, whether they rely on out-of-home care or not. It increases the Dependent Care Tax Credit (DCTC) by raising the amount of allowable expenses to $3,600 for one dependent and $6,000 for two or more, and by permitting educational programs and third party transportation to count as allowable expenses. 
   Affordable child care is in particularly short supply for young children and for children who need care during nontraditional hours, such as during the late afternoon and evening. As more and more parents leave welfare for work, the demand for this type of care will continue to increase. The General Accounting Office estimates that under the welfare reform rules requiring more parents to work, the supply of child care will meet only 25 percent of the demand in many urban areas. We must ensure that the necessary support systems, such as child care and health care, are in place so that low-income parents can successfully move from welfare to self-sufficiency. 
   Our bill addresses these concerns by increasing the authorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act from $1 billion to $2 billion a year. It requires states to improve the way in which subsidy rates are determined. Parents will have a choice of child care providers, not just the least expensive care. Seventy percent of the CCDBG funds are set aside for non-welfare-related low-income working parents. The bill also contains a new state grant program to encourage the development of quality child care programs during non-school hours. 
   It is long past time for Congress to give child care the high priority it deserves. This bipartisan bill addresses the serious challenges confronting millions of families with children, and I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this significant initiative.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support the Education Improvement Act of 1999, introduced today by Senator SMITH and Senator KERRY, and I am proud to be a sponsor. It is a major initiative to improve the nation's public schools and address the serious problems they face, such as the shortage of teachers and the lack of after-school programs. These are real problems that deserve real solutions. 
   Education must continue to be a top priority for this Congress. Few other issues are as important to the nation as ensuring that every child has the opportunity for a good education. 
   Last year, with broad bipartisan support, Congress made substantial investments in the nation's public schools to reduce class size, expand after-school programs and improve the initial training of teachers. But more needs to be done. States and local communities are making significant progress toward improving their public schools, but they can't do it alone. The federal government must lend a helping hand. 
   We must do more to meet the needs of public schools, families, and children. We need to expand early childhood education programs, and meet our commitment to reducing class size, modernizing school buildings, improving the quality of the nation's teachers, and provide more opportunities for after-school programs. 
   The bill addresses these important issues in innovative and very promising ways. The proposed ``Excellent Principals Challenge Grants'' will give school principal the support they need to be effective school leaders. Principals are the bridge between the school and the school boards, and the children and families in the community. More needs to be done to make sure that principals receive the training they need to become effective school administrators. Every child should have the opportunity to attend a school with a well-trained teacher and a well-trained principal. 
   When it comes to education, the nation's children deserve the best help we  can give them. I commend Senator KERRY and Senator SMITH for making this strong commitment to improving the nation's public schools.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this resolution, which will at long last restore the reputations of two distinguished military officers in World War II--Admiral Husband E. Kimmel of the United States Navy and General Walter C. Short of the United States Army. 
   This resolution gives us an opportunity to correct a grave injustice in the history of that war. Despite their loyal and distinguished service to the nation, Admiral Kimmel and General Short were unfairly singled out for blame as scapegoats after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, which caught America unprepared. 
   In fact, wartime investigations of the attack on Pearl Harbor concluded that our fleet in Hawaii under the command of Admiral Kimmel and our forces under the command of General Short had been properly positioned, given the information they had received. However, as the investigations found, their superior officers had not given them vital intelligence that could have made a difference, perhaps all the difference, in their preparedness for the attack. These conclusions of the wartime investigations were kept secret, in order to protect the war effort. Clearly, there is no longer any justification to ignore these facts.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I urge my Senate colleagues to support the Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act in order to restore the benefits unfairly eliminated by the 1996 welfare law. 
   In 1996, Congress passed a so-called welfare reform law that drastically restricted the ability of legal immigrants to participate in public assistance programs. For the first time in history, legal immigrants were cut off from most federal aid. The law barred them from food stamps, SSI, and other benefits. It banned them for 5 years from AFDC, Medicaid, and other programs and gave states the option to permanently ban them from these programs. 
   These provisions have had a devastating effect on immigrant families. Elderly and disabled immigrants were notified that they would be turned out of nursing homes or cut off from disability payments. Some even took their own lives, rather than burden their families. Far too many human tragedies have resulted from the law. 
   Fortunately, many Members of Congress realized that the provisions had gone too far, and we passed legislation in the past two years to restore benefits for many. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 and the Agricultural Research Act of 1998 restored eligibility for Medicaid, SSI and Food Stamps for hundreds of thousands of legal immigrants. 
   Nevertheless, many immigrants who came here legally are still suffering from restrictive provisions that remain in effect. The Fairness for Legal Immigrants Act is needed to bring back this safety net for immigrants who fall on hard times, especially those who are in great need, such as pregnant women, children, the elderly, the disabled, the poor, and victims of abuse. 
   The Act will permit states to provide Medicaid to all eligible legal immigrant pregnant women and children. It will permit states to extend Medicaid to ``medically needy'' legal immigrants who are disabled but not on SSI. It will permit states to cover legal immigrant children under CHIP, if they are also providing Medicaid coverage for legal immigrant children. 
   For legal immigrants who arrived before August 1996, the Act will restore SSI eligibility for those who are elderly and poor, but not disabled by SSI standards. It will also restore food stamp eligibility to all legal immigrants who have not yet had their eligibility restored, primarily parents of poor children. 
   For legal immigrants who arrived after August 1996, the Act will restore SSI eligibility for those who become disabled after reaching the United States. Finally, the Act will exempt post-August 1996 legal immigrants who are victims of domestic or elder abuse from the five-year ban on Medicaid and welfare assistance, and restore their eligibility for SSI and food stamps. 
   These reforms are essential in order to fulfill our obligation to those who legally entered our country. Many of them are family members of American citizens. They play by the rules, pay their taxes, and deserve a fair chance to become citizens and build new lives for themselves and their families in America. 
   I urge the Senate to support this important legislation, and I look forward to its early enactment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today marks the completion of a year-long public education effort called the First Family Pledge Campaign to increase awareness of the need for organ donation and to increase the number of people willing to be organ donors. 
   The campaign has focused primarily on the need to discuss organ transplantation within the family. Open family discussion is essential to ensure that each person's commitment to become an organ donor is understood and honored by family members. As part of that campaign, my wife Vicky and I agreed to become organ donors, and to discuss the issue in our family. 
   The campaign for organ donation has been an excellent opportunity to recognize the success of organ transplantation in saving lives, and Congress should be proud that it has helped to  support this achievement. Fourteen years ago, we created the National Organ Transplant Program. Our goal was to do all we can to see that organ failure is not a death sentence and make it possible for many more Americans to return to good health. We have had significant success. More than 20,000 Americans--men, women and children--now receive life-saving organ transplants each year. But more needs to be done. 
   Too many Americans die while waiting for organ transplantation. More than 60,000 Americans are waiting for organ transplantation. Every day, 55 of those people have an organ transplant. And every day, 10 others die because they did not have timely access to an organ. While there are differences of opinion about how an organ distribution system should be designed, it is clear that the overriding problem is a shortage in the availability of healthy organs. 
   In 1997, there were more than 9,000 organ donors. Nearly 4,000 of those donors were living relatives who were willing and eligible to give an organ--a kidney or part of a liver--to a family member in need. But transplantation of this type is not an option for many in need. 
   Each year, approximately 5,000 persons donate organs upon death. These acts of generosity are saving the lives of countless others. Transplantation of a cornea can restore sight. Transplantation of a kidney means life without dialysis. And transplantation of a heart, lung or liver means the difference between life and death. Studies show that more than 10,000 individuals each year could become organ donors after their death, and some estimates are as high as 15,000 each year. 
   The reasons that an individual does not become an organ donor vary. In some cases, the donation may conflict with religious or personal beliefs. But in far too many cases, the reason is simply lack of awareness of the need, or misunderstanding of the process. 
   In building the national organ donation and transplantation system, we have taken great care to ensure that individuals and families are not coerced into decisions to donate their organs. We have a strong shared commitment to respect personal and religious beliefs. Congress has made it illegal for organs to be sold--another measure to ensure freedom of choice. The Secretary of HHS has proposed a rule to encourage donation by training hospital personnel to explain the process. This rule, which I support, specifies that only trained hospital personnel are permitted to approach families of potential organ donors. But the most effective measure to increase organ donation is open discussion, long before a time of crisis. Families need to explore their beliefs and opinions, make personal commitments, and have an opportunity to honor the beliefs and commitments of loved ones who die. 
   In closing, I commend the First Family Pledge Campaign for all it has done to encourage and support these important efforts. Congress must continue to pursue legislation and policies to assure that all Americans in need have access to life-saving transplantation. Adequate funding is essential to support these services. We need to be sure that the distribution system is fair and effective. And we need to continue our nationwide efforts to educate the public about the need for and value of organ donation.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I strongly support the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. Its goal is to provide disadvantaged women with the opportunity to obtain the training and counseling necessary to become successful small business owners. 
   Today, the Nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving. Small business has become the engine that drives the economy. America's 23 million small businesses employ more than 50 percent of the private workforce, generate more than half of the nation's gross domestic product, and are the principal source of new jobs in the U.S. economy. The increase in the number of small businesses owned by women has significantly contributed to the overall success of small business. 
   Between 1987 and 1996, the number of women-owned firms has grown by78 percent. Employment in women-owned firms more than doubled from 1987 to 1992, compared to an increase of 38 percent in employment by all firms. For women-owned companies with 100 or more workers, employment has increased by 158 percent--more than twice the rate for all U.S. firms of similar size. Women entrepreneurs are taking their firms into the global marketplace at the same rate as all U.S. business owners. 
   Today, women are starting new firms at twice the rate of all other business and own nearly 40 percent of all firms in the United States. These 8 million firms employ 18.5 million people--one in every five U.S. workers--and contribute $2.3 trillion to the economy. The Small Business Administration has created programs, such as the women's business centers, which have been very effective in promoting woman business ownership. We must ensure that these programs continue to receive strong support in Congress. 
   The Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 will provide the  funds necessary to continue this successful program. It will allow women's business centers that have completed five year funding to apply for additional funding, and it will also increase the authorization for FY 2000 and FY 2001 from $11 million to $12 million a year. Our goal is to help sustain existing centers, while continuing to create new centers. 
   I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation, and I look forward to its early enactment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support the Lautenberg motion, which would instruct the budget conferees to reserve all Social Security surpluses for Social Security, and for no other purpose. This is what Senate Republicans promised to do in the budget debate just last month. Now, just three weeks later, we are hearing disturbing reports that they are poised to renege on their pledge. The Republican conferees are contemplating a new raid on Social Security. In a move which would reflect a new level of cynicism, the Republican leadership is cutting a trap door in their so-called ``Social Security lock-box.'' Those dollars were raised by payroll taxes expressly dedicated to financing Social Security benefits. However, the Republicans now want to allow that money to be used for any type of ``retirement security'' plan. I hope such reports are wrong. But I fear they might be accurate. 
   This would open the door to risky schemes that use the Social Security surplus to finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts. A genuine ``lock-box'' would prevent any such diversion of funds, but not the Republican version. A genuine ``lock-box'' would guarantee that all those dollars would be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The ``lock-box'' in this budget apparently does not. 
   It is bad enough that the budget passed by Senate Republicans three weeks ago did not provide even one additional dollar to pay Social Security benefits to future retirees, that it did not extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund by one more day. To our Republican colleagues, I say: ``If you are unwilling to strengthen Social Security, at least do not weaken it. Do not divert dollars which belong to the Social Security Trust Fund for other purposes. Every dollar in that Trust Fund is needed to pay future Social Security benefits.'' 
   The Republican ``retirement security'' scheme could be nothing more than tax cuts to subsidize private accounts disproportionately benefiting their wealthy friends. Placing Social Security on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priority, not further enriching the already wealthy. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security retirement benefits for more than 50 percent of their annual income. Without it, half the Nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. 
   It appears that the Republicans may be planning to take these Social Security dollars and to use them instead to finance more tax cuts in the guise of ``retirement security.'' If this occurs, there will be no debt reduction. There will be no strengthening of the Social Security Trust Fund to meet the demands of the baby boomers' retirement. Every one of those payroll tax dollars belongs to Social Security, and should be used solely to strengthen the Trust Fund. If our Republican colleagues have no ulterior motive, the wording of the Budget Resolution should state that principle unambiguously. When instead we see language as vague and open-ended as ``retirement security,'' suspicions are understandably raised. If this gaping trap door is not eliminated, the American people will know that the Republican ``lock-box'' is nothing more than a cynical magician's trick. The millions of senior citizens who depend on Social Security will know that the Republican majority has abandoned them once more.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I want to take a moment to review the motion to instruct very quickly for the benefit of the Members so they have a keen awareness and understanding of exactly what this motion is to the conferees. This motion is to instruct the conferees to include in the conference report the provisions that would allow the targeted tax relief for low- and middle-income working families which has been presented here during the course of the debate on the budget; and, two, to preserve a sufficient portion of the projected non-Social Security surplus to extend significantly the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund and modernize and strengthen the program. We are effectively asking that there be the allocation of resources to extend the solvency of the Medicare program. 
   I think the percentage that we had identified earlier during the course of the debate on the budget was 15 percent. What we have indicated here is that it would be important to extend the solvency of the trust fund before using any of the budget surplus to pay for the tax breaks which would give most of the benefits to the wealthiest Americans by enacting new spending above the levels in the Senate-passed version of the budget resolution. 
   Effectively what this instruction is, Mr. President, is very easy to understand. It says given the size and the significance of the budget surplus that we want to have the sufficient allocations of resources for the protection of Medicare. In an earlier instruction on this particular measure, we included an instruction to have sufficient funding set aside for the solvency of the Medicare trust fund before we provide any tax cuts or tax breaks for the American people. That is basically and fundamentally the issue. 
   We in this body make choices and make decisions. This is certainly one of the most important ones that we will make, not only for just this year, but for future years. We are saying, given the kinds of resources that we have available, that we are going to do two things with regard to this instruction; that is, to set aside sufficient resources for the solvency of the Medicare program, and be serious about taking the steps to ensure that there will be the changes in the Medicare program that are responding to the particular needs of the Medicare program.  
   Certainly there are a number of ideas about how we can strengthen the Medicare program. I think one of the most important is the addition of a prescription drug proposal. The President of the United States, in his speech to the American people on the State of the Union, indicated that one of his high priorities with the restructuring of the Medicare system would be for a program to meet the prescription drug needs of the elderly people in this country. 
   We want to make sure that we are going to have sufficiency in terms of the savings of the projected surpluses, and that then we will have an opportunity in the remainder of this Congress for the Congress to work its will on the floor of the Senate. I hope that one of the first areas of priority would be in the area of prescription drugs. 
   As has been pointed out on many different occasions, when the Medicare issue was debated in 1964 it lost narrowly here in the Senate in the spring of that year. It became a primary issue in the 1964 election. There was an extraordinary resonance across the country about the importance of Medicare. There were 18 Members of the Senate that voted one way in 1964 and another way in 1965. They had heard the voices of the elderly people in this country in support of the Medicare program. When we adopted the Medicare program we did not include prescription drugs for one very basic and fundamental reason, and that is because about 95 percent of the private programs at that time did not include prescription drugs. Now they do. The need is out there. 
   We will have an opportunity to do it, and it will be greatly 
   strengthened with this kind of an instruction to the conferees. If we are able to set aside the kind of surplus that was included in the President's recommendations and included in this instruction, then we will know that we will have a sound Medicare system. The Medicare program will have greater solvency, and we will be able to deal with alterations and changes in the Medicare system. And, hopefully, we will be able to address the prescription drug issue. 
   This issue is so basic and so fundamental that it is really the question of a priority. Do we think having broad kinds of tax cuts for the American people is preferable to ensuring the financial security and solvency of the Medicare system? That is the issue that is incorporated in this particular instruction. It is as basic and fundamental as that. Do you believe that with the scarce but sufficient resources that are in the various surpluses that we are going to say let's put a priority on Social Security and Medicare? This instruction says we are going to give the priority to Medicare. And many of us who are supporting this also give high priority when we are going to have that financial security to make sure there is going to be a prescription drug provision. 
   I see my friend and colleague. I would be glad to yield for a question.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator has made an excellent point and one which I agree with completely. If you look at a profile of who the Social Security recipient is, it is a person that is living alone, $12,000 in income, a woman 76 years of age who has at least one chronic disease and is paying some 19 percent of her income in out-of-pocket health care costs. That is 19 percent out of $12,000--paying that percent of her income out of pocket for health care. If the Senator understands the amount that is being paid out of pocket by even those today that are getting Medicare, it is just about what it was at the time of the enactment of Medicare. 
   So for those that say, well, we really do not have to have this instruction, we are going to be able to consider the Commission's recommendations, that will effectively require $688 billion over the next additional 12 years to get the kind of economic stability that would be included in our particular instruction. And that is only going to be able to be achieved with higher copays, or higher premiums, or higher deductibles. It is going to come out of the pocket or the pocketbook of that senior citizen. I don't understand how we can do that.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is correct in terms of the size of the Medicare population and correct in terms of allocating these additional resources for Medicare. Let's understand that the amount that we are talking about effectively is money that is being paid in by working families. Those are resources that are being paid in by those working families. All we are saying is that we believe those working families' interests should be protected with the previous instruction on Social Security and this instruction on Medicare before we provide tax breaks for individuals who are not participants in paying into the system like the workers have been in terms of the Medicare system and Social Security. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will use that remaining time so we can move along, then ask for the yeas and nays in accordance with the leadership proposal, and vote. 
   Mr. President, according to the trustees' report on the Medicare trust fund, this particular measure will add some 7 years to the Medicare trust fund. Now it will be--instead of 2008, in the most recent figures it is 2015. With 15 percent, as we talk about, a substantial increase, it will provide the stability and solvency of the trust fund to the year 2027. That is what this amendment does. 
   If we do not take this action, then, if we look over a 25-year period, it is going to mean benefit cuts of 11 percent in 25 years, 25 percent in 50 years, and 31 percent in 75 years, to make up for the shortfall. 
   It seems to me, given the special circumstances, we ought to protect Social Security and protect Medicare. We still have resources, even after that, for individual accounts, as the President suggested--close to $500 billion for individual accounts, for savings and for investment for individuals--and we also have resources that will be available for a tax cut. 
   But let us say, with regard to Medicare, we are going to provide these additional resources and we are going to commit them to our Medicare system and then in this Congress we are going to get about the possibility of making the alterations or changes in our Medicare system, primarily in the area of enhancing prescription drugs, and also other changes that will strengthen the Medicare system even further. This is a sound, prudent investment. 
   Finally, the greatest percentage of the surplus was paid in by working families. Working families often become dependent primarily on Social Security and Medicare as they age. Some of them get some pensions from companies they have worked for. But if you look over what is happening, even in terms of the pensions, they are gradually being cut back. They are gradually being reduced every single year. Medicare and Social Security are the rocks on which our elderly and seniors really depend. We have an opportunity to go on record on that measure here today with this amendment, and I hope the Senate will accept it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. My friend and colleague, as we could expect, explained correctly what this motion effectively does. If you vote in favor of the motion, effectively you are saying you are not going to use any of the surpluses of the Federal budget for the Medicare system, No. 1, because that is the recommendation of the Commission. And secondly, before we get overly excited about a reserve fund on the prescription drugs, just read page 90 of the report and you will see that the trust fund is not utilized until there is significant extension of solvency for Social Security. That is defined as 9 or 12 years. That comes to either premium increases or cost benefits of some $686 billion. So it is never going to go into effect. 
   I am all for having an existing fund. But this isn't it. It is right here on page 90, the requirements for the fund.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this motion is very simple. It says to devote a portion of the surplus--not all of it, just some of it--to saving Medicare before using it for a tax cut or new spending. This policy is supported by Alan Greenspan and by 100 leading economists because it makes economic sense and because it makes sense for Medicare. 
   My friend across the aisle has talked at length about how much he and his party care about Medicare, but that budget resolution does not devote one thin dime of new resources to Medicare beyond those required by law. This vote is a test: Tax cuts versus Medicare. That is the issue.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay tribute to an extraordinary young man from Blandford, Massachusetts. Kyle Mangini is a 13-year-old Boy Scout who, while on vacation with his family, saved his 16-year-old cousin, Santiago Garcia, from drowning. 
   Santiago was swimming and suddenly began to drown, sinking to the bottom of the pool. Kyle saw his cousin and immediately realized that he was in great danger. He leaped into the pool and pulled his older, much larger cousin out of the water. 
   Kyle's quick reaction saved precious seconds and probably saved Santiago's life. Santiago was successfully resuscitated by an emergency medical technician. It was Kyle's lifesaving training as a Boy Scout that prepared him for the emergency. Had it not been for Kyle's brave and timely rescue, his cousin Santiago could have suffered serious brain damage or death.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am interested in asking, is there anything in this proposal of the Senator from Delaware that will provide the additional funding for Medicare, as we are attempting to move forward, to try to bring about the reforms? These two members of the Budget Committee are here. I am interested in understanding, as we are trying, in the final hours of the budget debate, to make sure the budget is going to have the additional 15 percent so that we can put it on a sound financial basis. I am wondering if there is any indication in this proposal that the Senator from Delaware wants to make sure of the financial security of Medicare before tax cuts, before we are going to go ahead with tax cuts. Is there anything in this resolution I have just received--maybe the Senator from North Dakota or the Senator from New Jersey can show me anyplace in here where this resolution says, all right, let's move ahead with the reform of Medicare before we go ahead and provide these major tax cuts. Is there anything in this resolution that the ranking minority member can tell the membership? 
   That is really what I think has been the heart of the debate of the proposal of the Senator from North Dakota and others--that we are going to put in place a sound, solid solvency for the Medicare system before we go to tax cuts. And now that we have a new resolution, I am just wondering whether this resolution says we are going to defer the tax cuts, we are going to make sure of the financial stability of the Medicare system and move toward perhaps even a consideration of the Breaux proposal as we consider reforms in the future.

I ask the author of the proposal whether there is any provision in this part that says we are going to defer tax cuts for wealthy individuals, across-the-board tax cuts that are mentioned in the report of the budget--that we are going to defer that until we get Medicare on a sound financial basis? Is there any reference to that in the proposal? Or if we accept this proposal, is it still the position that we are still going to go ahead and have the tax cuts now in the budget?

Or are you going to recommend that we defer the tax cuts until we have the kind of hearings the Senator has suggested and really shape a proposal to put Medicare on both a sound fiscal basis and also to deal with some of the inadequacies of Medicare, like the prescription drug issue?

   Mr. KENNEDY. If I could just ask, because I see others on their feet, on page 2 of the proposal, at the bottom, line 22 says, ``The President's budget framework does not devote 15-percent budget surpluses to the Medicare Program.'' 
   This has been the intention of the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from North Dakota. It is a goal I support--that we provide at 15 percent. The Senator's resolution says it does not devote the 15 percent. Would the Senator tell us whether he would support the 15-percent allocation? He has it in the resolution, saying that the Federal budget does not devote the 15 percent. Does the Senator want us to devote that 15 percent, or not?

I find it somewhat difficult to understand how the IOUs can be used for a tax cut of some, I guess, $778 billion but cannot be used for the Medicare trust system. 
   I have in my hand, from the Office of the Actuary of the Department of Health and Human Services in his submission to the Finance Committee--he is the chief actuary for HHS, and I will make this part of the RECORD--but it says, under this budget proposal, referring to the President's proposal, it would postpone the exhaustion of the trust fund for an estimated 12 years. 
   I guess we have Members of the Senate saying these are IOUs and you are not going to really do anything by getting that kind of IOU for the Medicare trust fund. Here we have the chief actuary for HHS saying exactly the opposite, that it will extend it to the year 2020. I fail to follow the logic, where you have the IOUs and they are going to be used by our majority, our Republican friends, for tax breaks for wealthy individuals. I wonder if he can help clarify this dichotomy for me?

   Mr. KENNEDY. As I understand it, and the Senator could correct me--maybe this is better directed to the Senator from Louisiana--even with the Commission's recommendation--according to the Commission's own report, that will only extend the solvency of the Medicare system 3 to 4 years, on the one hand, even if we went ahead. 
   I am not disputing that there may be recommendations filed by the Commission that may be worthwhile. But on the one hand we have the opportunity to extend it 12 years under the transfer. On the other hand, even if we accept the Medicare Commission, it is only 3 or 4 years. 
   So as I understand the position of the Senator, we ought to have the longer extension, we ought to consider the Breaux commission report, and then move ahead and take what steps we need to take in order to strengthen and improve the program, which would certainly include the prescription drugs. 
   I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over these past 2 days, we have had some good debates and discussions about what is in the budget, and also what is not in the budget; and the particular emphasis and thrust of these various debates and discussions have been primarily on the issues of Medicare and Social Security. 
   The thrust of the amendment that I offer today, on behalf of myself and others, is targeted on the issue of Medicare. It basically gives an opportunity for the Senate of the United States to say we are going to deal with the shortfalls in terms of the financial situations in Medicare prior to the time that we are going to consider a tax cut for wealthy individuals in this country. That will be the real choice for the Members here--whether we are going to say that at least meeting the financial obligations of Medicare comes before the tax breaks for wealthy individuals. 
   As we have seen over the past 2 days, there is broad agreement that we not only need to provide financial security for the Medicare system, but we are also going to have to deal with the serious kinds of changes in the Medicare system. One of the important changes, I believe, is to put in place an effective prescription drug benefit for the elderly. 
   In 1965, I remember being on the floor of the Senate when this issue came up. At that time, most health care plans did not include a benefit program for prescription drugs. At that time, we were attempting to follow what was a generally agreed benefit program. We did that. We did not include prescription drugs. Now prescription drugs are part of about 98 percent of all of the private company programs. We want to make sure we have an effective prescription drug benefit, not only because most companies have that benefit, but because of the enormous need our elderly have for getting prescription drugs at reasonable prices, and also because as we have all seen the breakthroughs in the use of prescription drugs in relieving suffering, illness, and sickness. 
   So it is very simple, Mr. President. We are saying, let's move toward what has been recommended by the President, what we have referred to in general debate on other Social Security and Medicare issues, that before we are going to expend, over the 10-year budget period, $778 billion in tax cuts, we will put aside some $320 billion over the 10-year period in order to meet the financial needs of Social Security. That is basically what this amendment is all about.  
   The fact is, Mr. President, if you look through the budget recommendation that has come from the Budget Committee, there is not one single penny in this budget resolution, in addition to current services, being put aside for the protection and the continuity of the Medicare system--not one, not a single penny. There will be references out here during the course of the debate that we have put aside $190 billion, which is a new infusion of resources. That really represents current services. If you didn't do that, you would be having cuts in existing Medicare benefits. That $190 billion, over the 10-year period, which is referred to by the Budget Committee members, is just the current services program. To say we are going to keep what we are currently providing in the Medicare system, that has been understood and recognized. 
   Secondly, there is a reference by some on the Budget Committee that, well, we have an additional $100 billion that can be used at some time for the Medicare system. But as we have seen over the course of the debate, those funds are also being designated, on the one hand, for natural disasters. It has been pointed out by members of the Budget Committee that they average about $9 billion to $10 billion a year over a 10-year period. There is the $100 billion. When our Budget Committee friends are asked how we are going to deal with the issues of natural disasters, the response is that we have the $100 billion in there to deal with natural disasters. If Budget Committee members are asked how are we going to provide additional funds for Medicare, they say, well, we have a $100 billion reserve that can be used for Medicare. Then when 
   they are asked, well, where in this program is there a prescription drug benefit, they say, oh, haven't you seen the part of the Budget Act that is going to provide for prescription drugs? This is the most overutilized $100 billion that we can possibly imagine. 
   As I pointed out in the RECORD, we will not see any of those funds realized, really, for the first 5 years. There is effectively a deficit in the first year of more than $6 billion, and effectively zero for the next 4 years is returned. So none of those funds are going to be available to try to deal with Medicare or any of these other issues for at least 5 years. Mr. President, what we are saying is that the money is out there. 
   The other point that is made and has been recently debated is, you really can't get the 15 percent of the budget surplus earmarked for Medicare because it will be IOUs. I think my friend and colleague from North Dakota addressed that issue in the earlier debate and discussion. I found it interesting that they can use the IOUs for tax breaks, but they cannot use IOUs for Medicare. Clearly, you can use it for Medicare. That is what we are attempting to do. 
   The vote will be very clear: whether we, on the one hand, are going to set aside the $320 billion--over the 10-year period--of the $778 billion and say we are going to do that first. After we set aside that $320 billion, there will still be $458 billion that will be remaining. 
   There is a difference in this body on whether that money should be used for the Republican tax cuts or whether we ought to use $273 billion out of that for the President's tax cuts. We can debate that at another time. But there will still be a generous amount of resources available there for tax reduction. 
   This amendment assures that we put priorities first. That is a very simple and fundamental concept--that is, whether we are going to put tax breaks first or whether we are going to be putting the protection of Medicare first. That is the choice. That is the issue that will be before the Senate. Without this particular amendment, we are not going to provide the needed financial resources in time for the preservation of Medicare. 
   Now, Mr. President, I think it is important to realize who those funds we are talking about really belong to. The amounts I am talking about--$320 billion in this amendment, or the GOP tax cut, $778 billion--those are basically the revenues that have been paid in by hard-working men and women in recent years. They have been paying into the Medicare system as well as into Social Security. That reflects the resources of hard-working men and women that are paid into the Federal Government. The question now is whether those resources that effectively have been paid in by working families, we are asking whether we ought to use those resources to protect the Medicare system, or whether they ought to be used for tax breaks for wealthy individuals. I don't think there is really a question about what the answer would be. This amendment gives the opportunity to do so. That is what we are attempting to do. 
   Now, Mr. President, let's look at who these people are. The average Medicare recipient's income is $10,000 a year, is 76 years old, lives alone, has one or more chronic diseases, and is paying 19 percent of their income primarily for prescription drugs. 
   That is the profile across this Nation of the Medicare recipient. When we talk about Medicare recipients on the higher end of the level, we are talking about individuals who are getting $25,000. But the overwhelming number of Medicare recipients are below the $12,000 or $13,000 level. We now asking in the Senate whether we are going to protect the health care system which they depend on prior to granting the tax break. That is the issue. We couldn't be clearer. 
   As this chart shows, 80 percent of the Medicare expenditures are used for recipients with annual incomes of $25,000 or less. These are not individual incomes, these are household incomes. So you have 60 percent with $15,000 or under, you have 21 percent with $25,000 or under. Effectively, 80 percent of all the expenditures are in that area--families, individuals, elderly people, or elderly couples, who have worked hard, paid into the system. 
   As we have heard, the Medicare system has serious challenges, serious problems. No one denies that. The issue is, given the fact that the system is going to face ``financial instability''--to use it lightly--by the year 2008, should we effectively put in place, as the President has, the recommended resources that will stabilize that to the year 2020, and then move ahead and implement the kinds of recommendations? That is the issue. These are hard-working retirees who have devoted their lives to this country, built this country, and they depend upon the Medicare system for their livelihood. 
   If we do nothing at all, what will the alternatives be? If we are going to try to keep the Medicare system functioning to the year 2020 without this, there will be $686 billion necessary in benefit cuts or premium hikes for these elderly people. If we do nothing at all, we are going to have to collect that amount in benefit cuts or premium hikes. Those aren't my figures, those are the figures that have been given by the Commission, by the Budget Committee, by the independent actuaries, by the trustees. Those are the choices. 
   I doubt if there will be a clearer opportunity for us to go on the record on the issue of priorities. The budget items are issues of national priorities, where we as the elected membership of the people feel the priorities ought to be. We are saying to those who are going to support this amendment that we believe the priority ought to be to provide financial security and stability for the Medicare system to the year 2020 before we give tax breaks to wealthy individuals. It is as simple as that. 
   Mr. President, I yield such time as the Senator from North Dakota might want.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to express my admiration and respect to my friend and colleague from Indiana on his maiden speech. It is an important speech because it deals with the economic future of our Nation. He brings a perspective to this issue as someone who has been an effective Governor and has had a broad reputation, not only in his State but throughout the country, as someone who understands the economics of his State well and has a reputation as a skilled Governor, making sure his State prospered and the benefits were going to go to the people. 
   Now he speaks in the Senate as we are making a judgment, at a very important, critical time, given the change in our financial situation with the size of the surplus, and he has given us a great deal to think about. It is quite clear from his statement he has given it a good deal of thought. 
   I thank him for his statement.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this $686 billion is the amount that we would like and the President would like to have out of the surplus to fund the Medicare trust system so that it will be financially stable to the year 2020. That is what it represents. 
   Under the budget proposal of the majority, if you are not going to allocate this 15 percent of the surplus for the Medicare system, you are going to have to have $686 billion in cuts or premium increases. 
   That is not what I am saying; that is what the Medicare trustees have said. 
   To conclude, basically what we are saying, let us go ahead, prior to the tax cut, take the 10-year budget, take $320 billion of what the Republicans are intending to use for a tax cut, and use it to put the Medicare system on a sound financial system. That is it. Put the protection of Medicare first, prior to a tax cut. That is what this vote is about.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, over the course of the past 2 days of debate, we have seen that there really are no additional funds in this budget proposal before the Senate for the preservation of the financial security of Medicare. But there are proposals for a tax cut of $778 billion over the period of the next 10 years. 
   This amendment says we will take $320 billion of the amount that is reserved for the tax cut and use it for the financial security of Medicare. Effectively, we are saying, with the surplus, which represents the pay-ins by hard-working Americans--hard-working Americans--that we are going to use that money for the preservation of Medicare, and then we can move ahead and really reform Medicare, and give that a priority over tax cuts which are currently in the budget. 
   It is a simple question. Are we going to favor financial stability and security of Medicare or are we going to favor tax cuts? I say we can do both, but let us do the financial security of the Medicare system first. That is what this amendment is all about.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Thirty minutes. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself 7 minutes. 
   As has been pointed out by our friends and colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the importance of providing resources and help and assistance to local communities and then having a degree of flexibility within those communities is basically a concept which this body has gone on record supporting as long as we have some accountability for those funds. That is incorporated in the amendments which I cosponsored with Senator Hatfield in 1994, providing States with flexibility, and now we see that legislation is in conference with the House of Representatives. 
   We did not have the resolution of our friends until just a few moments ago, but after a quick look at the sense-of-the-Senate, I urge our colleagues on this side to support it. The point that I think is always well worth 
   understanding is that education is basically a local responsibility as has been pointed out by the two speakers on the other side of the aisle. Only about 5 to 6 cents out of every dollar that is spent locally comes from the Federal Government. The rest is raised locally and by the States. So whatever success or failure we have out there in local communities obviously is attributable to the local communities. 
   We have had some success. We have other challenges. What I think the American people want today is a partnership between the local community and the State and the Feds to try to enhance academic achievement. What we have heard from those schoolteachers and what we have heard from parents and what we have heard from students is a series of recommendations. They had talked about smaller class size, better trained teachers, afterschool programs. They talked about technology in the classroom and some other recommendations--literacy programs as well. That is what they have been telling us, and we have developed legislative proposals to respond to those ideas. 
   I point out for the benefit of the RECORD that currently, according to the Department of Education--and I will include their study in the RECORD--95 cents of every dollar is actually appropriated for local schools, 95.5 percent of the Federal funds actually go to local districts; a half of 1 percent stays at the Federal level, 4 percent stays at the State level. 
   So, this is a pretty good indication that whatever we do--and it is very modest when you look at the Nation--it is getting to the community. We can always do better with what we are providing there, but we are, at least with regard to getting the funds into the local communities, doing pretty well, I think. It is certainly better than the kind of bureaucracy that exists at the State level. 
   Having said that, we will have an opportunity this afternoon to do something which I consider to be very significant in the area of education--a real choice. The proposal we have today indicates the importance of supporting local desires and local interest in the community, and I am certainly going to recommend we all support that. But, later on this afternoon, we will have a measure which the Senator from Connecticut and I will send to the desk, and which we will vote on, which will say: Let's really do something, provide some additional resources to help assist those local communities. 
   It is all nice and well to agree to a resolution that, as this resolution does, encourages further flexibility at the local level. We are going to embrace and support that. But we will have an opportunity this afternoon to say the following: Before we have the tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals, let us go ahead and fully fund the IDEA program at 40 percent. 
   We heard a great deal of debate about that in the earlier debate on education. Now, this afternoon, we will have an opportunity to fully fund, at 40 percent, the IDEA program--the special needs programs of help and assistance for the local communities that have special needs children--and meet for the first time our responsibility of funding it at 40 percent, prior to the time we have tax breaks for the wealthy. That will be 
   the significance of the vote on our amendment this afternoon. We will say that we will support a program for smaller class size from K-3, we will support the afterschool programs, we will as a result of this particular amendment see an expansion of the Pell grants and an expansion of the work/study programs, and we will see an expansion of the Head Start programs. 
   We are effectively saying, instead of $778 billion in tax breaks, we are going to take $156 billion of that over the next 10 years and put it where it will make a difference for children in our country at the local level, in the local community--in smaller class sizes, in helping and assisting in modernizing buildings, in upgrading the skills of our teachers, in effective afterschool programs, in additional technology, in helping and assisting in bringing the Pell Program up to date in a more effective way, and in work/study programs which in many instances are used to expand literacy training and fund the literacy program. 
   It will be very easy later on this afternoon when we vote on this; the choice will be very clear. After all the pronouncements, all the speeches, all the declarations, all the press releases, this afternoon this Senate will have an opportunity to say we are, over the next 10 years, going to have the most serious support for local improvement, raising the standards of education, that we will have had in the last 35 years. That will be before the Senate this afternoon in our amendment. 
   There still will be ample resources, over $500 billion, that will be available for the tax breaks. 
   So I hope when the time comes we will have the support of those who have been speaking in support of local schools and districts involving parents, involving local decisions. I hope we are going to have their help and their support. Do they want to really put their vote where their voice has been and where their press releases have been in  supporting education? Or are they going to vote and say: We will do that at another day, but I am going to vote for tax breaks for wealthy individuals? That is the choice. That will be the choice when the Senate considers the amendment that Senator DODD and I will introduce at the first available opportunity.

I do not remember a consent request that we set that aside. I have been sitting here, Senator DODD has been sitting here, ready to debate the Ashcroft amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. May I ask a question, please? On this trust fund, the reserve fund, on page 90, which describes the fund, there are also the words that the committee report would not allow the reserve to be funded by the intergovernmental transfers. That would be the part that the President talked about--any of the funding from the surpluses. And then, on page 90, it indicates that you can't have the funds from other revenues, as it talks about being adjusted for legislation that extends the solvency of the fund. 
   How are we going to extend the solvency without additional funds in order to trigger this program? You have the solvency mentioned, and 9 years and 12 years. We don't want to create a program that says we are going to do something on prescription drugs and then, on the other hand, which says we are only going to do it if we extend solvency, and then we don't have additional funds to extend solvency. I am interested in what kind of a commitment or promise this is really going to be.

That is prohibited without the use of transfers of new subsidies from the general fund. And it also talks about prohibition of intergovernmental transfers. 
   Can the Senator tell us how she foresees the solvency being worked out, if it isn't going to be higher premiums, or reduced benefits?

   Virtually every children's group and every education group understands that this is our best opportunity in this Congress to really make a downpayment in terms of the partnership among local, State, and Federal in terms of enhancing academic achievement and accomplishment in the schools across our country. 
   We have a chance now to fulfill our commitments that we have all made in statements and speeches and press releases to do something now. That is what this vote is about. It says we will fund these programs before we go for tax breaks for wealthy individuals. That is the choice. It is as clear as can be. That is what the issue is. We are hopeful that we will get strong support for that program. 
   Mr. President, I yield what time remains to my colleague and cosponsor, Senator DODD.

That is what the issue is. I am interested in what the Governors say, but I care most about those parents who are supporting this program. Every child group, every education group supports it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in the budget there is $778 billion for 10 years for the reduction in taxes. The amendment offered by myself and Senator DODD is very simple. Effectively, it takes $156 billion of that, first, to fully fund IDEA; to fully fund the smaller classrooms; and to take the remaining funds, which is $43 billion that can be used for afterschool programs, for technology, for Pell grants, for Work-Study Programs, and for other education programs. 
   Effectively, we are saying this is the best opportunity that we have had in a generation to continue a partnership between local, State and the Federal Government in the areas of education. We have a real opportunity to do so. We believe that we can still leave 80 percent of the tax cut. We are taking 20 percent of the tax cut to fully fund IDEA, to meet our commitments, and to also fully fund the smaller classroom. 
   This is supported by school board associations, the school administrators, parent/teachers, the disability rights, the Consortium of Citizens with Disabilities, and the Federation of Children with Special Needs. It is supported by all of those groups in the best interests of the future of our country. I hope it is accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is a sense of the Senate that we ought to go on record for an increase in the minimum wage. This Nation is having unprecedented prosperity. We have the lowest unemployment that we have had in 30 years, the lowest rates of inflation. Still, we have 11 million minimum-wage workers. And a minimum-wage working family of three is still $3,000 less than the poverty income for a family of three. 
   This is an issue that affects women. It is an issue that affects children. It is an issue that affects families. No one in the United States of America who works for a living ought to live in poverty. 
   We hope now to have a sense of the Senate that we will increase the minimum wage 50 cents this year and 50 cents next year. That is what the Daschle amendment does, and this is a sense of the Senate to support it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, earlier this month, under the impressive bipartisan leadership of Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN, the Finance Committee approved the Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 by a 16-2 vote. This important legislation sends a strong message that all Americans with disabilities have access to the affordable health care they need in order to work and live independently. 
   The Jeffords amendment endorses that legislation as part of the budget resolution, and will put the Senate on record that now is the time for barriers that prevent disabled people from obtaining employment to come down. 
   Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is now enjoying, people with disabilities continue to struggle to live independently and become fully contributing members of their communities. We need to do more to see that the benefits of our prosperous economy are truly available to all Americans, including those with disabilities. Children and adults with disabilities deserve access to the benefits and support they need to achieve their full potential. 
   Large numbers of the 54 million Americans with disabilities have the capacity to work and become productive citizens but they are unable to do so because of the unnecessary barriers they face. For too long people with disabilities have suffered from unfair penalties if they go to work. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits if they accept a paying job. They are in danger of losing their medical coverage, which may well mean the difference between life and death. Too often, they face a harsh choice between eating a decent meal and buying their needed medication. 
   The goal of the Work Incentives Improvement Act is to reform and improve existing disability programs so that they do more to encourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live independently, and be productive and contributing members of their society. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all. 
   It is a privilege to be part of this bipartisan effort with Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ROTH, Senator MOYNIHAN, and sixty-six other Senate colleagues. Work is a central part of the American dream, and it is time for Congress to give greater support to disabled citizens in achieving that dream. This legislation is the right thing to do, it is the cost effective thing to do, and now is the time to do it. I urge the Senate to make this commitment a part of the budget resolution.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are well on our way to doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health. Scientists are discovering new cures and developing new therapies for previously incurable and untreatable illnesses on a regular basis. Breakthrough medications are modern medical miracles that allow people with previously crippling conditions to lead normal lives. Yet too many of our nation's elderly citizens are denied access to these life-saving and life-improving therapies because they lack basic coverage for prescription medications. 
   Today I am introducing the ``Prescription Drug Fairness for Seniors Act of 1999,'' the Senate companion bill to H.R. 664, introduced in the House last month by Representatives TOM ALLEN, JIM TURNER, MARION BERRY, HENRY WAXMAN, and sixty-one other House Members. This legislation responds to the need for affordable prescription drugs for senior citizens by requiring pharmaceutical companies to make the same discounts available to senior citizens that are offered to their most favored customers. Prescription drugs represent the largest single source of out-of-pocket costs for health services paid for by the elderly. The Prescription Drug Fairness Act will provide significant benefits to elderly citizens struggling to pay for the prescription drugs they need. 
   This Act represents one important way to improve senior citizens' access to affordable medications. Other steps are necessary as well to deal with the overall prescription drug crisis facing millions of elderly citizens. I plan to introduce legislation soon that will offer additional protections. Providing fair access to prescription drugs for senior citizens is a high priority, and I hope to see quick action by Congress on this critical issue this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator BOXER, Senator DURBIN, and Senator SCHUMER in introducing the Children's Gun violence Prevention Act of 1999. 
   The continuing epidemic of gun violence involving children demands action by Congress. The School tragedies in Arkansas, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Kentucky, and Mississippi in the last year are still very much in the nation's mind and on the nation's conscience. We deplore the senseless injury and loss of life, the families torn apart, and the communities in fear. 
   Sadly and tragically, the horrific shootings of last year do not tell the whole story. The fact is: We are losing 13 children every day in this country to gunshot wounds. Think about that--13 children die every single day because of guns. We must do more--much more--to prevent this senseless loss of children's lives. 
   We require aspirin bottles to be child-proof. We know how to make handguns child-proof too--and it is long past time we did so. 
   The legislation we propose today is an important step in meeting our responsibility for the safety of children. We can take common sense, reasonable steps to keep children safer from gun violence by developing and using cutting-edge technology and by educating families and communities about preventing gun violence involving children. 
   This legislation will help all of us to deal more responsibly with this festering crisis. Under this proposal, gun owners must take responsibility for securing their guns, so that children cannot use them. Gun dealers must be more vigilant in not selling guns and ammunition to children. Child-proof safety locks must be used. Other child safety features for guns must be developed. 
   America does more today to regulate the safety of toy guns than real guns--and it is a national disgrace. Practical steps can clearly be taken to protect children more effectively from guns, and to achieve greater responsibility by parents, gun manufacturers and gun dealers. This legislation calls for such steps--and it deserves to be enacted this year by this Congress.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators STEVENS, DODD, JEFFORDS, KERRY and I are introducing legislation to create an Early Learning Trust Fund. With this legislation, we intend to improve the availability and quality of early learning programs so that all children can begin school ready to learn. 
   This is a truly bipartisan bill, and it is a privilege to be working closely with Senators of both parties on this issue that is so critical to the nation's future--the education of our children. Senator STEVENS' knowledge of childhood development and brain research is outstanding, and his commitment to this issue is impressive. He understands the impact that early education can have on a child's development. Senator KERRY shares this interest as well. His work on the importance of brain development during the early childhood years has helped educate the Senate on this issue. Senator JEFFORDS' long standing interest in education and school readiness is exemplary. I have great respect for his leadership as Chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee on education and many other issues to improve the well-being of children. Senator DODD's leadership on the Subcommittee for Children and Families has been outstanding. He has always been a champion for children's issues and we are proud to have him as a cosponsor of this legislation. 
   Over 23 million children under 6 live in the United States, and all of these children deserve the opportunity to start school ready to learn. In order for them to do so, we must make significant investments in children, long before they ever walk through the schoolhouse door. 
   Recent brain research documents the importance of the first few years of life for child development. During this time, children develop essential learning and social skills that they will need and use throughout their lives. 
   For children to reach their full potential, they must begin school ready to learn. Ten years ago, the nation's governors developed a set of educational goals to improve the quality of education in the United States. The number one goal was that by the year 2000, all children should enter school ``ready to learn.'' While it is no longer possible to meet this objective by the year 2000, we must do all we can. We cannot afford to let another decade pass without investing more effectively in children's educational development. 
   Quality early education programs help children in a number of ways, and have a particularly strong impact on low-income children, who are at the greatest risk of school failure. Children who attend high quality preschool classes have stronger language, math, and social skills than children who attended classes of inferior quality. 
   These early skills translate into greater school readiness. First graders who begin school with strong language and learning skills are more motivated to learn to read well, and they benefit more from classroom instruction. Quality early education programs also have important long range consequences, and are closely associated with increased academic achievement, higher adult earnings, and far less involvement with the criminal justice system. 
   Research consistently demonstrates that early education programs improve school readiness. But too many children have no access to these programs. Sixty-one percent of children age 3-5 whose parents earn $50,000 or more a year are enrolled in pre-kindergarten classes. But, only 36% of children in the same age group in families earning less than $15,000 are enrolled in such classes. Clearly, many children are not receiving the educational boost they need to begin school ``ready to read, ready to learn, and ready to succeed.'' 
   Our bill provides 10 billion dollars over five years to states to strengthen and expand early education programs for children under 6. By increasing the number of children who have early learning opportunities, we will ensure that many more children begin school ready to learn. 
   The ``Early Learning Trust Fund'' will provide each state with funds to strengthen and improve early education. Governors will receive the grants, and communities, along with parents, will decide how these funds can best be used. The aid will be distributed based on a formula which takes into account the total number of young children in each state, and the Department of Health and Human Services will allocate funds to the states. To assist in this process, governors will appoint a state council of representatives from the office of the governor, relevant state agencies, Head Start, parental organizations, and resource and referral agencies--all experts in the field of early education. The state councils will be responsible for setting priorities, approving and implementing state plans to improve early education. 
   States will have the flexibility to invest in an array of strategies that give young children the building blocks to become good readers and good students. States may use their funds to support a wide range of activities including: (1) strengthening pre-kindergarten services and helping communities obtain the resources necessary to offer children a good start; (2) helping communities make the best use of early learning programs to ensure that their resources are used most effectively; (3) ensuring that special needs children have access to the early learning services they need to reach their full potential; (4) strengthening Early  Head Start to meet the learning needs of very young children; and (5) expanding Head Start to include full-day, year-round services to help children of working parents begin school ready to learn. The specific strategy that states decide to adopt is not the central issue--improving school readiness is the central issue. And this bill will give states the flexibility and funding they need to achieve this goal. 
   Children and families across the country will benefit from the Early Learning Trust Fund. Massachusetts has more than 480,000 children under the age of 6, and a significant number will be helped by this legislation. Far too many children are currently on waiting lists today for assistance like this. We cannot tell these children, ``Wait until you grow up to receive the education you deserve.'' 
   Those on the front lines trying to meet these needs in their communities will receive reinforcements. For example, in Massachusetts, the Community Partnerships for Children provide full-day early care and education to 15,300 three- and four-year-olds from low-income families. The Early Learning Trust Fund will expand and strengthen exemplary initiatives such as this. 
   Investment in early education is strongly supported by organizations across the country, including the Children's Defense Fund, the National Governors' Association, Fight Crime: Invest in Kids, the National Association of Child Care Resource and Referral Services, the National Association for State Legislatures, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children. These organizations agree that investments in children in the early years not only make sense, but make an enormous difference.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 15 minutes. 
   First of all, I want to express appreciation to the members of the Budget Committee and, in particular, to our ranking minority member, Senator LAUTENBERG, for the work that he and our other colleagues did in developing a series of positions in the Budget Committee. I will address one of those this morning and refer to another which I hope, over the course of the next couple of days, to come back to. 
   I think those who are interested in the Nation's priorities, as reflected in the Budget Committee, should read the transcript of the discussion and debate. I had the opportunity to do so. I think they will get a very clear indication, as a result of that review, as to exactly what the priorities were for the Democrats in the budget consideration, which was the preservation of Social Security and the preservation of Medicare. 
   During the course of debate and discussion, it becomes quite clear--and also by the votes--as to those who are strongly committed to that program. Over the next several hours, we will have a chance to move beyond the rhetoric and into the details of the budget itself. That is going to be quite revealing, Mr. President, because we will have a clear opportunity to make a judgment at the end of these 3 or 4 days as to the very strong position that has been taken by the Democrats in the preservation of Social Security and also the strong commitment that we have in the preservation of Medicare. 
   I know there are those who have said, ``We have a certain amount of funds  that have been allocated within this budget for Medicare; all we are waiting for is the President to make some judgment, make some recommendation.'' The President has made the most important recommendation, and that is to allocate 15 percent of the surplus to preserve the Medicare Program through the year 2020, some 12 additional years of security for the Medicare Program. 
   That will be the longest period of time of solvency for the Medicare system since the enactment of Medicare. I will take a few moments later on in the day to comment further on this when we talk about the particular amendment that I will offer, but we have seen over the history of Medicare where there have been interventions for the preservation of Medicare to continue it and continue it in a financially sound way. 
   Now we have heard the President of the United States say we ought to allocate the resources that are going to preserve this for another 12 years and give it the greatest solvency we have had in the history of the Medicare Program, and then let's get about trying to put in place the kind of reforms that will be 
   sound, taking into consideration the various recommendations that have been made by the Medicare Commission, a few which make sense and others with which I take serious issue. We will have an opportunity to examine those. 
   I hope our Republican friends--who virtually have been silent in proposing Medicare recommendations, other than to use the 15 percent that the President has recommended and allocate it for tax breaks for wealthy individuals--I hope that they will, during the time that we are out here at least, review with us what their recommendations are, what their proposals are, what their solutions are, rather than constantly harp on the President. He has taken a giant step forward in the allocation of solvency for the Medicare system, and he has also indicated, now that the Medicare Commission has reported, that he will make future recommendations. 
   If we were to accept the recommendations of our Republican friends, there will be very little in the till at the end of the day to provide protections for our senior citizens. That, I think, is a glaring, glaring loophole in this budget proposal, and one which I know the ranking member of the committee, Senator LAUTENBERG, will address with an amendment and Senator CONRAD with another excellent amendment. And I will offer an amendment, along with others, to give focus and attention to these issues. 
   There will be a very clear indication, hopefully at the end of the day, as to what really are the priorities for this body in terms of the future of the Medicare system. 
   Every budget is a statement of national priority. Every budget is really the investment in the future, but the year 2000 budget is extremely important, not just because it is the first year of the new millennium, but this budget will determine whether the large surplus will be used wisely for the benefit of all or squandered on tax preferences that disproportionately benefit the few. 
   The President, in his program, after the preservation of funding for Social Security and Medicare, also targeted tax programs that others will address later in the course of this debate. I think those are in areas of very special needs--providing assistance to families with the disabled, child care, and other areas. We will have a chance to review those. They all recognize what is urgent and of great importance, and that is the preservation of Social Security, the preservation of Medicare, and then the targeted tax cuts. 
   This budget will determine whether Medicare will offer the protections that are so essential for senior citizens in the years ahead. This is the budget that will determine whether we keep medical care in Medicare. 
   The Republican budget resolution is a thinly veiled assault on Medicare and I think an affront to every senior citizen who has earned the right to affordable health care through a lifetime of hard work. It is a proposal to sacrifice the future of Medicare in order to finance the tax cuts for the wealthy. 
   Equally as serious is the Republican attempt to privatize Medicare, to misuse the current financial problems of Medicare as an excuse to turn the program over to the tender mercies of the private insurance companies. Of course, there is where the problem started in the 1960s. 
   This is the same extreme agenda the Republicans pursued unsuccessfully in 1995, 1996, and it was an agenda rejected by President Clinton and Democrats in Congress and the American 
   people, but now our Republican friends are at it again. 
   According to the most recent projections of the Medicare trustees, if we do nothing else, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will require benefit cuts of almost 20 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. 
   The President's plan makes up most of that shortfall, without any benefit cuts, by investing 15 percent of the surplus in Medicare. This investment avoids the need for any benefit cuts in Medicare for at least the next 21 years. It also gives us the time to develop the policies that can reduce the Medicare costs without also reducing the health care that the elderly need and deserve. 
   But Republicans in Congress have a different agenda for the surplus. They want to use it to grant the undeserved tax breaks for the wealthiest individuals and corporations in our society regardless of what happens to Medicare. Republicans on the Budget Committee had a clear opportunity to preserve, protect and improve Medicare. All they had to do was adopt the President's proposal for investing the 15 percent of the surplus in Medicare. 
   Instead of protecting Medicare, they use the surplus to pay for billions of dollars in new tax breaks. You do not need a degree in higher mathematics to understand what is going on here. The Republican budget, I believe, is Medicare malpractice. 
   Every senior citizen knows and their children and grandchildren know, too, that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are already stretched to the limit, and sometimes beyond the limit, to purchase the health care they need. The out-of-pocket payments by those over 65 now is almost the same percent of what it was prior to the time of the passage of Medicare. They just cannot afford to have the significant and sizable increases that would be assumed if we are not going to provide this 15 percent. Because of the gaps in Medicare and the rising health care costs, Medicare now covers only 50 percent of the health bills of senior citizens. 
   On average, senior citizens spend 19 percent of their limited income to purchase the health care they need, a larger proportion of what they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. Many have to pay more as a proportion of their income. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have risen to 29 percent--29 percent, Mr. President. 
   Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, too many senior citizens have to choose between putting food on the table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. 
   The typical Medicare beneficiary is a single woman, 76 years old, living alone, with an annual income of approximately $10,000. 
   She has one or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. Yet, we want to cut her Medicare benefits in order to pay for tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   These are the women who will be unable to see a doctor, who will go without needed prescription drugs or without meals or heat, so that wealthy Americans, earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year, can have additional thousands of dollars a year in tax breaks. This is the wrong priority. And America knows it is the wrong priority--even if Republicans in Congress do not. 
   We all recall that 4 years ago Republicans in Congress also tried to slash Medicare to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. They tried to slash Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $240 billion in tax cuts for wealthy individuals and corporations. We all remember. It was not that long ago. 
   Mr. President, under the GOP proposal, senior citizens would have seen their premiums skyrocket an additional $2,400 for elderly couples over the budget period. The deductible that senor citizens pay to see a physician would have doubled. The Medicare eligibility age would have been raised to 67. Protections against extra billing by doctors would have been rolled back.  
   I can remember the debates we had on that, Mr. President, where you effectively have double billing, where they go on and they take what they get from Medicare, and then they send you another bill on top of that. We spent a long time to address that particular issue. And now it would be reopened again. 
   Under the guise of preserving Medicare, Republicans had proposed to turn the program over to private insurance companies and force senior citizens to give up their family doctors and join HMOs. But President Clinton and Democrats in Congress stood firm against these regressive proposals, and they were not enacted into law. 
   Now the Republicans on the Finance Committee and Ways and Means Committee are at it again. They are already drafting new so-called reforms for Medicare. No details have been revealed, but the funds already earmarked for tax breaks for the wealthy under the Republican budget mean there is no alternative to harsh cuts in Medicare. 
   As we debate these issues this week, the Republican response is predictable. They will deny they have any plans to cut Medicare. They will talk about $190 billion additional over the period of time. The $190 billion they will say they are giving additional. That is just to keep the program going. If you cut any of that, you are providing additional kinds of cuts in Medicare. That is what the budget figures themselves show. 
   Mr. President, they will deny they have any plans to cut Medicare. The American people will not be fooled. They know that the President's plan will put Medicare on a sound financial footing for the next 2 decades without the benefit cuts, tax increases, and raising the retirement age. 
   They also know the Republican plan will take the surplus, intended for Medicare, and squander it on the tax breaks. They know that the Republican plan for Medicare benefits means benefit cuts for the elderly, not the honest protection of our senior citizens. 
   This week the Democrats will offer amendments to assure this year's budget protects Medicare, not destroys it. Under our proposal, all the funds the President has proposed to earmark for Medicare will be placed in the Medicare trust fund. 
   Our proposal will assure the solvency of Medicare for the next 21 years without benefit cuts or tax increases or raising the retirement age. Republicans will have a chance to vote on whether they are sincere about protecting Medicare. The vote on our proposal will test whether they care more about senior citizens or tax breaks. 
   The Republicans also try to confuse the issue. They will say it is wrong to put the surplus into Medicare. I say the workers of this country are the ones who earned this surplus. They want to use it to protect and preserve Medicare. 
   Our Republican friends say that dedicating 15 percent of the surplus will not solve Medicare's financial problems beyond 2020. That is true. But assuring the solvency of Medicare for the next 21 years is a giant accomplishment and a clear statement of our national priorities, and it gives us time to develop longer-term programs that will bring down Medicare costs while protecting beneficiaries. 
   If we fail to dedicate the surplus to Medicare, the only alternative is harsh benefit cuts and steep payroll tax increases to make up the resources that our Democratic plan provides. The choice is clear. Congress must act to preserve the Medicare benefits that seniors depend on.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I have listened over the course of the presentations earlier this morning about how the Republican budget is going to try and solve the problems in Medicare and also with regard to prescription drugs, and how inadequate the President's program has been in terms of resolving Social Security and Medicare. I am glad to hear the interpretations of my good friends on the other side. 
   The fact of the matter is, the President's program, in allocating the resources for Social Security with 62 percent of the surplus, has been basically endorsed by eight Nobel laureates in economics and over 100 economic professors, along with Alan Greenspan. If you listen to our colleagues out here, you would think it was a nondescript program. But the fact is, it is a solid program. It is a sensible program and a responsible program. 
   The chairman of the Budget Committee talks about all the money that is going to be there in Social Security. He talks about how they are going to add $190 billion to Medicare. They have to have it. They are not adding any money. That is what the cost of the program is going to be in the outer years. They do not dare cut back on that program. That is necessary for the very existence of the program over that period of time. 
   So when they come out and say, ``We're adding all of this money and protecting the Medicare program,'' that is poppycock; otherwise, they would have to justify further cuts in the program. These are the best estimates for a continuation of the program at the present rate. That is all. 
   They have this wonderful other program that they talk about that is going to be available. I just refer our colleagues to the Budget Committee report for the concurrent resolution on the budget, and look on page 4, at about the middle of the page, about ``Additional On-Budget Surpluses.'' They talk about:  
   It is estimated, at this time, that nearly $133 billion in on-budget surpluses could result if the resolution were ..... implemented.  
   That has been revised to $100 billion. Now, listen--listen--to this fund that is going to be there. At one moment it is for prescription drugs and at another moment it is for Medicare and at another moment it is for the transition to Medicare reform and at another moment it is for national disasters. Look what they say:  
   These additional funds, if estimates prove accurate, would further retire debt held by the public or could be made available to assist funding of any transition costs to implement reforms in the Medicare programs that would significantly extend the solvency of that program through a reserve fund mechanism adopted by the Committee. Alternatively, the on-budget surplus projected by the resolution could be needed for funding unexpected disasters and emergencies over this period.  
   It does not even refer to prescription drugs. It does not even mention it. You talk about double counting--you can come over to page 90, and you will see how they double count it over there. We will come back to that. You tie up that fund in terms of prescription drugs in such a way you will not even get an 
   aspirin out of this particular proposal, Mr. President. 
   I just want to point out that they talk about the fund that they are going to have with the $100 billion surplus. It may be for emergencies. The Budget Committee knows you average $9- or $10 billion a year in that particular program. But if we look at the payout for the budget--and I just refer you to the budget, S. Con. Res. 20. 
   Look on page 5, look at line 18. For the year 2000, is there going to be anything in there for Medicare? No. It is $6 billion in debt. How about line 19, fiscal year 2001? Anything in there for Medicare transition? Anything in there for prescription drugs? Anything in there for emergencies? Zero. What about line 20, for the fiscal year 2002? Zero. What about for fiscal year 2003? Zero. What about for fiscal year 2004? There is $2,899,000,000. Isn't that something? This is their program for saving Medicare. This is their program, their own figures. 
   If I have ever heard something that makes absolutely no sense--how can any member of the majority in the Budget Committee stand up on this floor and say that they have anything worthwhile in here to protect Medicare? 
   I say to the Senator, it is $686 billion. Even if you use the whole $100 billion, it is $686 billion you are going to need over 15 years, so you do not have enough in here to even begin to save Medicare. All we are trying to get is honesty in budgeting. 
   Under the Democratic program, we take all 15 percent and set it aside. You can make these debatable points that, well, you can't really transfer the funds. Of course you can't. You have to change the law to be able to do it. But we understand what is being done out here, Mr. Chairman and Senators. We understand what is being done. We are allocating and indicating what our priorities are. And we are going to save Social Security on the one hand, and we are going to use that 15 percent for Medicare. And we are not going to use this $100 billion that does not provide a single cent for 5 years and can be used either for disasters or for any other program that has been outlined in the Budget Committee's report. 
   That is not saving Medicare. The amendment of the Senator from New Jersey, Senator LAUTENBERG, does the job. And the amendment of Senator CONRAD does the job. We will also have an opportunity to offer something that will do it. 
   So Mr. President, I think it is worthwhile going beyond the rhetoric and giving our Members a chance to look through both the report and the legislation to try and find out who really is interested in preserving Medicare. The votes that are going to be offered here later this afternoon, starting with Senator LAUTENBERG's, and Senator CONRAD's, will give us an opportunity to do that. 
   The principle set forth in the Lautenberg amendment goes to the heart of this budget debate: We should not liquidate the surplus by enacting tax cuts before we solve the significant financial problems facing Social Security and Medicare. I wholeheartedly agree. Placing Social Security and Medicare on a firm financial footing should be our highest budget priorities. The surplus gives us a unique opportunity to extend the long-term solvency of those two vital programs without hurting the vulnerable elderly who depend upon them. We should seize that opportunity. Two-thirds of our senior citizens depend upon Social Security retirement benefits for more than fifty percent of their annual income. Without it, half of the nation's elderly would fall below the poverty line. These same retirees living on fixed incomes rely upon Medicare for their only access to needed health care. For all of them, this budget does absolutely nothing. It does not provide one new dollar to support Social Security or to support Medicare. It squanders the historic opportunity which the surplus has given us. 
   On the subject of Social Security, the Republican budget is an exercise in deception. The rhetoric surrounding its introduction conveys the impression that the Republicans have taken a major step toward protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their budget would not provide even one additional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees. Nor would it extend the life of the Trust Fund by one more day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. That is all their so-called ``lockbox'' does. By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute $2.8 trillion new dollars of the surplus to Social Security over the next fifteen years. By doing so, his budget would extend the life of the Trust Fund by more than a generation to beyond 2050. 
   Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide new revenue to extend the life of the Social Security Trust Fund, it does not even effectively guarantee that the existing payroll tax revenues will be used to pay Social Security benefits. In essence, there is a trap door in the Republican ``lockbox''. Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used to finance unspecified ``reforms''. This opens the door to risky schemes that would use the Social Security surplus to finance private retirement accounts at the expense of Social Security's guaranteed benefits. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts. A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent  any such diversion of funds, but not the Republican version. A genuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those dollars would be in the Trust Fund when needed to pay benefits to future recipients. The ``lockbox'' in this budget does not. 
   While the Republicans claim that they too support using the surplus for debt reduction, they are still unwilling to use it in a way that will help save Social Security for future generations. There is a fundamental difference between the parties on how the savings which will result from debt reduction should be used. The federal government will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars that would have been required 
   to pay interest on the national debt will become available each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes those debt service savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. So do I. But the Republicans refuse to commit those dollars to Social Security. Their budget does nothing to increase Social Security's ability to pay full benefits to future generations of retirees. 
   Currently, the federal government spends more than 11 cents of every budget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By using the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next fifteen years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every budget dollar by 2014; and to zero by 2018. Such prudent fiscal management now will produce an enormous savings to the government in future years. Since it was payroll tax revenues which made the debt reduction possible, those savings should in turn be used to strengthen Social Security when it needs additional revenue to finance the baby boomers' retirement after 2030. Rather than paying interest to bond-holding investors today, our plan would use that money to finance Social Security benefits tomorrow. 
   This is analogous to the situation of a couple with young children and a mortgage. They know they will have a major expense fifteen years down the road when their children reach college age. They use their extra money now to pay down their home mortgage ahead of schedule. As a result, in fifteen years the mortgage will be greatly reduced or even paid off. Thus, the dollars that were going to pay the mortgage each month will become available to finance college for the children. In the same way, the federal government is reducing its debt over the next fifteen years, so that it can apply the savings to Social Security when the baby boomers retire. 
   That is what the President's budget proposes. It would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for all future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable plan. But Republican members of Congress oppose it. 
   During the budget debate, the Republicans will proclaim that this year, unlike last year, Social Security tax dollars are not being used to pay for their tax cut. This year they are not proposing to loot billions of dollars from the Social Security Trust Fund. Undeniably a step in the right direction. But hardly sufficient progress. They are still unwilling to use the surplus to save Social Security, still unwilling to use surplus dollars to extend the ability of the Social Security Trust Fund to pay full benefits to future generations. 
   Sadly, the Republican response to the financial problems facing Medicare is the same. The crisis facing Medicare is much more severe than the financial problems facing Social Security. Medicare will become insolvent in less than a decade unless we take decisive action to extend it. President Clinton's budget would do that. It would devote fifteen percent of the surplus, nearly $700 billion, over the next fifteen years to financially strengthening Medicare. As a result, it would have sufficient resources to fully fund current health care benefits to at least 2020. This would give us the time which is necessary to gradually reform the program in a way which will protect the elderly beneficiaries who depend upon it. However, the Republicans 
   rejected this initiative to save Medicare. Their budget will not extend the life of the Medicare Trust Fund for one day. I will have a great deal more to say later in the debate about the harm that this budget will do to Medicare. 
   The budget Republicans have brought to the floor does not provide one new dollar to finance Social Security or Medicare benefits. What it does provide is nearly $800 billion new dollars for tax cuts over the next decade. Tax cuts, not strengthening Social Security and Medicare, is their first priority. Budgets speak louder than words. The Republican budget tells us much more candidly than their rhetoric where the GOP's real commitment lies. 
   The Republican budget would devote $778 billion to tax cuts during the next ten years--before fixing Social Security, and before funding Medicare for the next generation. Those who wrote this budget were not thinking about the two-thirds of our senior citizens who rely on Social Security retirement benefits for more than half their annual income. They clearly were not thinking of the elderly who depend on Medicare for their only access to health care. The pleas of the elderly have fallen on deaf ears. 
   When the Republicans wrote this budget, they had a very different group of people in mind. While the budget itself does not specify the precise form of tax cut, the Republican leadership has already called for a 10% across-the-board tax rate cut. Such a tax cut would disproportionately benefit the nation's highest-income taxpayers. The Treasury Department's analysis of this proposal shows that the top one percent of earners would receive 35% of the benefits. The top twenty percent of earners would receive 65% of the benefits. By contrast, approximately 45 million Americans would get no benefit at all. 
   While an across-the-board income tax cut may sound fair at first hearing, it would in fact be grossly inequitable. Under the Republican leadership's proposal, sixty percent of American taxpayers would share just nine percent of the total tax savings, an average of less than $100 per person per year. Clearly, the Republicans are not thinking about the needs of working families and their elderly parents. 
   This amendment offered by Senator LAUTENBERG would set us on a different, more responsible course. It would prevent using the surplus to fund tax cuts until we have solved the financial problems facing Social Security and Medicare. This approach would preserve the resources which are needed to guarantee the long-term solvency of these two historic programs without harming future beneficiaries. It is the right thing to do.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute 15 seconds. 
   Mr. President, I want to direct the chairman's attention to page 90 of the report. Here is the reserve fund for Medicare and the prescription drugs. I hope that anyone who believes we are really establishing a reserve fund in here for prescription drugs will take a little time to read it. We don't have the time to do so right now. 
   The point I want to make is this: When my good friend from New Mexico is talking about the $190 billion that is going to Medicare, as I mentioned, that is what will be necessary to just continue the program without any kind of adjustment. Then they have this $100  billion out there. In this report they say it can be used for prescription drugs, it can be used for disaster relief, it can be used for anything. Any time I hear someone come over and talk about a particular subject, it seems that they are using the same $100 billion for that particular purpose. 
   Now back to page 90 and restrictions placed here in terms of prescription drugs. There is absolutely no reason to expect there will be a prescription drug provision under this particular provision that has been added in the budget legislation. We will have an opportunity later in the afternoon to debate it, but there is nothing here to guarantee the availability of even one additional dollar for Medicare.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Even if they use the $100 billion, what part of the Medicare deficit would that make up? 
   It is my understanding that would not even begin to make a downpayment in terms of the financial insecurity of the Medicare trust fund. Could the Senator address that issue? Because I agree with the Senator, it has been pointed out by those on the other side about how much they have done for Medicare when, as the Senator has pointed out, there is not one additional cent, not one new cent. They are going to fund the program with $190 billion which would be expended on the Medicare for current services. But not one additional cent. 
   But even if they allocated the $100 billion for Medicare, given what the Medicare trust fund trustees have indicated was going to be a deficit of some $686 billion, how significant would that really be in terms of giving a guarantee to our elderly people in this country?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Could I ask the Senator to open up the copy of S. Con. Res. 20 to page 5? As I understand it, as you go down to lines 18, 19, 20 and 21, under the Republican budget, even for that fund that has been designated, $100 billion as I read that, there would be a deficit in the year 2000 of $6 billion; in fiscal year 2001 it is zero; in 2002 it is zero; in 2003 it is zero; and in 2004 it is only $2.8 billion. 
   So even under the proposal that our friends talk about, there will not be any funds available, as I understand this, for the next 
   5 years. So, whether you are talking about disaster relief or inadequate funding for Medicare, even with the kind of restrictions that have been put on this fund that might be used for prescription drugs, we are talking about 5 years where there really is not anything there. 
   Am I correct?

   Mr. KENNEDY. I know the time has moved along, so I will just take a moment. If I understand the Senator's amendment effectively, what will be the situation under your amendment with regard to the continued solvency of the Medicare system? As I understand it, besides strengthening Social Security, one of the purposes was to extend solvency of the Medicare system in order to permit time to consider sensible reforms. Will the Senator just tell me this: Under the Conrad amendment, what is the life expectancy of the Medicare system, and what would it be without the Conrad amendment under the budget resolution that is now before the Senate?

   The net tax cut in the Committee-reported resolution can accommodate a substantial tax cut package (the contents of which will be determined by the tax-writing committees), which may include across-the-board cuts in tax rates.......  
   The sentence does continue and list others, but it lists, No. 1, across-the-board tax cuts. Is that the kind of tax cut, if we were moving in that direction, the Senator believes would be the fairest to working families and to small farmers and the smaller business men and women of this country?

   If we do not do what is included in the Conrad amendment, if we are looking at the financial security of Medicare to the year 2020, is it the understanding of the Senator that we would have to somehow find $686 billion that would either have to be a combination of tax increases or benefit cuts in order to reach the $686--in order to ensure that the Medicare trust fund would be financially sound by 2020, if we do not accept the Conrad amendment?

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to congratulate our friends and colleagues from Maine and from Oregon for their focus on the issue of prescription drugs. I look forward to the proposal that we are going to have tomorrow. 
   I am looking through the reserve fund language now. There are a number of constraints on the reserve fund. For example, before that reserve fund can be triggered, there has to be the guarantee that there is going to be financial solvency for Medicare from anywhere from 9 to 12 years, without any revenues from the President's program or other sources. 
   I wonder how we could possibly meet that requirement without having dramatic and significant cuts in the Medicare program. I welcome the opportunity to have a reserve fund that can really do the job on this issue. I welcome the chance to work with our colleagues to make sure that it is done. Hopefully, we can do it in a way that is going to be meaningful, because we do not want to represent that we are making significant progress in the area of expanding access to prescription drugs without really doing so. 
   I know the Senators from Maine and Oregon are really interested in the substance of it. I know they want to do the right thing. The current proposal is unacceptable, but I look forward to supporting efforts to make sure that we get a substantial downpayment to provide prescription drugs in Medicare this year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, Senator DODD and I offer this amendment to do more to help working families secure quality child care. 
   Child care is one of the most important challenges facing the Nation. The need to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of child care is indisputable. Every day, millions of parents go to work and entrust their children to the care of others. An estimated 13 million children under 6 years old are regularly in child care. 
   Every working parent wants to be sure that their children are safe and well cared for. Yet child care can be a staggering financial burden, consuming up to a quarter of the income of low-income families. Child care can easily cost between $4,000 and $10,000 for one child. But about half of all young children live in families with incomes below $35,000. And two parents working full-time at the minimum wage earn only $21,400. These parents--working parents--constantly must choose between paying their rent or mortgage, buying food, and being able to afford the quality care their children need. 
   Existing child care investments fall far short of meeting the needs of these parents and their children. Today, 10 million low-income children theoretically qualify for services under current Federal child care programs. But because of lack of funding, only one in ten of these children actually receive it. The need is great and a ratio like that is unacceptable. 
   Making sure that all children receive quality care especially in the early years, is one of the best possible investments in America's future. We know the enormous human potential that can be fulfilled by ensuring that all children get adequate attention and stimulation during the first three years of life. Quality child development increases creativity and productivity in our workforce. There is less need for remedial education and less delinquency. Safe, reliable care offers stable relationships and intellectually stimulating activities. Child care that fulfills these goals can make all the difference in enabling children to learn, grow, and reach their potential. If we are serious about putting parents to work and protecting children, we must invest more in child care help for families. 
   President Clinton has put families first by giving child care the high priority it deserves. Senate Democrats have proposed an increase in our commitment to child care by at least $7.5 billion in mandatory spending over the next 5 years, almost doubling the number of children served from 1 million to 2 million in 2005. 
   The benefits from investing in children are substantial and many. A lifetime of health costs are lower when children are supervised, educated about their health, and taught to develop healthy habits. Parents' productivity improves when they know that their children are well cared for. Education costs decrease when children enter school ready to learn. By expanding child care and child development programs, we invest in children, their future, and the country's future. 
   Yet this budget resolution allots no funds for increased child care and development programs. In fact, the Republican budget slashes funds for critical programs for children. It denies 100,000 children the Head Start services that help them come to school ready to learn. It makes it impossible to reach the goal of serving a million children in Head Start by 2002. The message contained in the budget resolution is clear--children are not a priority. 
   The Nation's children and families deserve a budget that invests in the right priorities--not the priorities of the right wing. This Republican budget makes children a non-priority--and gives high priority to an $800 billion tax cut for the wealthy. Those priorities are wrong for children, wrong for Congress, and wrong for the Nation. 
   Now, when we have a large national surplus and a strong economy, it is time to invest in our most valuable resource--our children. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, few individuals have made a greater contribution to the cause of peace in Northern Ireland than our friend and former Senate colleague, Senator George Mitchell. His leadership was indispensable in helping the political leaders of Northern Ireland achieve the historic Good Friday Peace Agreement of 1998. 
   Last Wednesday, on St. Patrick's Day, President Clinton presented Senator Mitchell with the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom. In accepting the award, Senator Mitchell demonstrated again why he has been so vital to the peace process. He spoke directly and movingly to the political leaders on both sides of Northern Ireland, many of whom were in the White House audience. He reminded them of how far they had come in their search for peace. He urged them to resolve the current difficulties and enable the peace agreement to continue to be implemented. 
   As he said so eloquently, ``History might have forgiven failure to reach an agreement, since no one thought it possible. But once the agreement was reached, history will never forgive the failure to carry it forward.''

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this week we will have the budget for the Nation before the Senate for consideration. I want to speak now on that budget, and give special focus and attention to the concerns I have about how that budget was put together and its particular implications with regard to Social Security and to Medicare, and also with regard to other domestic priorities. Then I will express my concern on the priority that the Republican budget has given to tax cuts and how that relates to the Nation's priorities and to the Nation's needs. 
   Mr. President, the Republican FY2000 budget resolution fails to meet the nation's priorities. 
   It claims that it will extend the solvency of the Social Security Trust Fund. In reality, it would prevent President Clinton's proposed transfer of surplus funds to protect this important program for future generations. 
   The Republican budget claims that it will set aside money for Medicare. In reality, it squanders those funds to pay for a tax cut for the rich. 
   The Republican budget claims that it will improve education. In reality, it slashes funds for critical programs like Head Start, job training, and student aid to pay for increases in education. 
   On the subject of Social Security, the Republican budget is an exercise in deception. The rhetoric surrounding the budget itself conveys the impression that the majority have taken a major step towards protecting Social Security. In truth, they have done nothing to strengthen Social Security. Their budget would not provide one additional dollar to pay benefits to future retirees, nor would it extend the life of the trust fund by even one day. It merely recommits to Social Security those dollars which already belong to the Trust Fund under current law. That is all their so-called ``lockbox'' does. 
   By contrast, President Clinton's proposed budget would contribute 2.8 trillion new dollars of the budget surplus to Social Security over the next 15 years. By doing so, his budget would extend the life of the trust fund by more than a generation--to beyond 2050. 
   Not only does the Republican plan fail to provide the new revenue to extend the life of the Social Security trust fund, it does not even effectively guarantee that the existing payroll tax revenue will be used to pay Social Security benefits. In essence, there is a trapdoor in the Republican lockbox. Their plan would allow Social Security payroll taxes to be used to finance unspecified ``reforms''. This loophole opens the door to schemes to privatize Social Security by turning it over to the tender mercy of the private insurance industry. Such a privatization plan could actually make Social Security's financial picture far worse than it is today, necessitating deep benefit cuts. 
   A genuine ``lockbox'' would prevent any such diversion of funds. A genuine ``lockbox'' would guarantee that those payroll tax dollars would be used to protect Social Security, not undermine it. 
   While the Republicans claim that they, too, support using the surplus for debt reduction, they are still unwilling to use it in a way that will help save Social Security for future generations. There is a fundamental difference between the parties on how the savings  which will result from debt reduction should be used. The Federal Government will realize enormous savings from paying down the debt. As a result, billions of dollars which would have been required to pay interest on the national debt will become available each year for other purposes. President Clinton believes those debt savings should be used to strengthen Social Security. I wholeheartedly agree. But the Republicans refuse to commit those dollars to Social Security. Their budget does nothing to increase Social Security's ability to pay full benefits to future generations of retirees. Again, they are short-changing Social Security while pretending to save it. 
   Currently, the Federal Government spends more than 11 cents of every budget dollar to pay the cost of interest on the national debt. By using the Social Security surplus to pay down the debt over the next 15 years, we can reduce the debt service cost to just 2 cents of every budget dollar by the year 2014 and to zero by 2018. Such prudent fiscal management now will produce an enormous savings to the Government in future years. Since it is payroll tax revenues which made the debt reduction possible, those savings should, in turn, be used to strengthen Social Security when it needs additional revenue to finance the baby boomers' retirement. 
   Rather than paying interest to bond-holding investors today, our plan would use that money to finance Social Security benefits tomorrow. This is analogous to the situation of a couple with young children and a mortgage. They know they will have a major expense 15 years down the road when their children reach college age. They use their extra money now to pay down their home mortgage ahead of schedule. As a result, in 15 years the mortgage will be greatly reduced or even paid off. Thus, the dollars that were going to pay the mortgage each month will be available to finance college for their children. In the same way the Federal Government is reducing its debt over the next 15 years so that it can apply the savings to Social Security in the future. 
   That is what the President's budget proposes. It would provide an additional $2.8 trillion to Social Security, most of it in debt service savings, between 2030 and 2055. As a result, the current level of Social Security benefits would be fully financed for all future recipients for more than half a century. It is an eminently reasonable plan, but Republican Members of Congress oppose it. 
   The budget Republicans have brought to the floor does not provide one new dollar to finance Social Security benefits. What it does provide is nearly 800 billion new dollars for tax cuts over the next decade. Tax cuts, not strengthening Social Security, is their first priority. Budgets speak louder than words. The actual Republican budget tells us much more candidly than their rhetoric about the GOP's goal of tax cuts at the expense of Social Security. 
   Mr. President, in addition to claims of extending the solvency of the Social Security trust fund, this budget would prevent the President's proposed transfer of surplus funds to protect important programs for future generations. The Republican budget claims that it will set aside money for Medicare, but in reality it squanders those funds to pay for a tax cut. This is unacceptable. Even worse is the Republican attempt to privatize Medicare--or use the crisis in Medicare financing that their budget will create as an excuse to promote their extreme agenda of slashing Medicare benefits and turning over the program to private insurance companies. 
   This is the same agenda that Republicans pursued unsuccessfully in 1995 and 1996, and it was the agenda rejected by President Clinton and Democrats in Congress and the American 
   people. But now our Republican friends are at it again. 
   According to the most recent projections of the Medicare Trustees, if we do nothing else, keeping Medicare solvent for the next 25 years will require benefit cuts of almost 20 percent--massive cuts of hundreds of billions of dollars. The President's plan makes up that shortfall, without any benefit cuts, by investing 15 percent of the surplus in the Trust Fund. This investment avoids the need for any benefit cuts for at least the next 21 years. It also gives us time to develop policies that can reduce Medicare costs without also reducing the health care that the elderly need and deserve. 
   But Republicans in Congress have a different agenda. They want to use the surplus to grant undeserved tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans--and then use the Medicare shortfall as an excuse to slash the program and turn it over to private insurance companies. 
   Republicans on the Budget Committee had a clear opportunity to preserve, protect and improve Medicare. All they had to do was to adopt the President's proposal for investing 15% of the surplus in Medicare. Instead of protecting Medicare, they use the surplus to pay for billions of dollars in new tax breaks for the wealthy. You don't need a degree in higher mathematics to understand what is going on here. 
   Because the Republican budget does nothing to preserve and protect Medicare, their proposals add up to billions of dollars in Medicare cuts. 
   Every senior citizen knows--and their children and grandchildren know, too--that the elderly cannot afford cuts in Medicare. They are already stretched to the limit--and sometimes beyond the limit--to purchase the health care they need today. Because of gaps in Medicare and high health care costs, Medicare now covers only about 50% of the health care costs of senior citizens. On average, senior citizens spend 19% of their limited incomes to purchase the health care they need--almost as large a proportion as they had to pay before Medicare was enacted a generation ago. Many senior citizens have to pay even more as a proportion of their income. By 2025, if we do nothing, that proportion will have risen to 29%. Too often, even with today's Medicare benefits, the elderly have to choose between putting food on the table, paying the rent, or purchasing the health care they need. 
   The typical Medicare beneficiary is a single woman, seventy-six years old, living alone, with an annual income of approximately $10,000. She has one or more chronic illnesses. She is a mother and a grandmother. These are the women whose benefits Republicans want to cut to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. These are the women who will be unable to see a doctor, or will go without needed prescription drugs, or who will go without meals or heat, so that wealthy Americans earning hundreds of thousands of dollars a year can have additional thousands of dollars a year in tax breaks. 
   This is the wrong priority--and Americans know it is the wrong priority, even if Republicans in Congress do not. 
   We all recall that four years ago, Republicans in Congress also tried to cut Medicare to pay for new tax breaks for the wealthy. They sought to cut Medicare by $270 billion to pay for $240 billion worth of tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals and corporations. Under their proposals, senior citizens would have seen their premiums skyrocket--an additional $2,400 for senior couples over the budget period. The deductible that senior citizens pay to see a physician would have doubled. The Medicare eligibility age would have been raised to 67. Protections against extra billing by doctors would have been rolled back. Under the guise of preserving Medicare, Republicans also proposed to turn the program over to private insurance companies, and force senior citizens to give up their family doctors and join HMOs. But President Clinton and Democrats in Congress stood firm against these regressive proposals, and they were not enacted into law. 
   Now, Republicans on the Finance Committee and House Ways and Means Committee are at it again. They are already drafting new Medicare ``reform'' plans. No details have been revealed. But the funds already earmarked for tax breaks for the wealthy under the Republican budget proposal means that there is no alternative to the harsh cuts in Medicare. No wonder so many senior citizens believe that G.O.P. stands for ``Get Old People.'' The Republican elephant never learns. 
   As we debate these issues this week, the Republican response is predictable. They will deny that they have any plans to cut Medicare. But the American people will not be fooled. They know that the President's plan will put Medicare on a sound financial footing for the next two decades--without benefit cuts, without tax increases, and  without raising the retirement age. They also know that the Republican plan will take the surplus intended for Medicare and squander it on new tax breaks for the wealthy. They know that the Republican plan for Medicare is benefit cuts and additional burdens on the elderly, not the honest protection our senior citizens deserve. 
   This week, Democrats will offer amendments to assure that this year's budget protects Medicare, rather than destroying it. Under our proposals, all of the funds the President has proposed to devote to Medicare will be put into the Medicare Trust Fund. Our amendments will assure that Medicare will be solvent for the next 21 years, without benefit cuts or tax increases or raising the retirement age. Republicans will have a chance to vote on whether they are sincere about protecting Medicare--and the vote on our amendments will test whether they care more about senior citizens or the wealthy. 
   The choice is clear. The Congress must act to preserve the benefits that senior citizens have earned, instead of granting new tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. 
   Just as important as preserving and protecting Medicare is improving it. And the most important single step we can take to improve Medicare is to provide prescription drug coverage for senior citizens. Medicare is a compact between workers and their government that says, ``Work hard, pay into the system when you are young, and Medicare will provide health security in your retirement years.'' But that commitment is being broken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. 
   When Medicare was enacted in 1964, coverage of prescription drugs by private insurance was not the norm--and Medicare followed the standard practice in the private insurance market. Today, ninety-nine percent of employment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug coverage--but Medicare does not. Medicare is caught in a 35 year old time warp--and too many senior citizens are suffering as a result. 
   Too many seniors take half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't fill needed prescriptions--because they simply cannot afford the high cost of prescription drugs. In 1983, before the most recent surge in drug costs, one in eight senior citizens said they sometimes had to choose between prescription drugs and food on the table. Too many elderly Americans are paying twice as much as they should for the drugs they need, because they are forced to pay the full price, while other Americans pay less because their health plans grant discounts. 
   As a result, too many senior citizens are ending up hospitalized--at immense cost to Medicare--because they are not receiving the drugs they need or are not taking them correctly. As we enter the new century, pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for more and more diseases--but senior citizens will be left out and left behind if we do not act. 
   The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the support of the American people, Congress is on its way to the goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health to support additional basic research, so that scientists can develop new therapies to improve and extend the lives of senior citizens and all citizens. 
   These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All patients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, the nation's largest insurer, does not cover out-patient prescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy price for this glaring omission. 
   Up to 19 million Medicare beneficiaries are forced to fend for themselves when it comes to purchasing these life-saving and life-improving therapies. They have no prescription drug coverage from any source. Other Medicare beneficiaries have some coverage, but too often it is inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable. 
   Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the elderly for health services. The average senior citizen fills an average of eighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six prescriptions daily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of $100 to $200 or more. Some of the newer drugs that can produce miraculous results for those who can afford them cost $10,000 a year or more. 
   Misuse of prescription drugs results in preventable illnesses that cost Medicare an estimated $16-$20 billion annually, while imposing vast misery on senior citizens. What are needed are effective ways to encourage proper use. Large savings to Medicare will result if physicians, pharmacists and senior citizens are better educated about identifying, correcting, and preventing these problems. 
   Too often, elderly Americans skimp on their medicine--they take half doses or otherwise try to stretch their prescription and to make it last longer. This is not right. And it doesn't have to happen. If the prescription drugs they need are covered by Medicare, needless hospitalizations will be avoided and physician visits will be reduced. 
   The Senate Budget Committee recognized the need for prescription drug coverage by adopting a reserve fund for this coverage. But the Committee reserve fund is hedged with unacceptable conditions that could retard rather than enhance the cause of ensuring a meaningful drug benefit. The Congress can do better--and it must. 
   The provision in the budget resolution does not actually provide funds for a prescription drug benefit. Instead, it allows a prescription drug benefit to be enacted if certain conditions are met, but those conditions are far too limited. 
   Senior citizens need a drug benefit more than the wealthy need new tax breaks. Every senior citizen understands that--and so do their children and grandchildren. 
   Finally, it is vital that we continue to make investments in education programs that serve Americans of all ages. The Republican budget claims it will improve education. In reality, it slashes funds for critical programs like Head Start, job training, and student aid to pay for increases in education. It is vital that we continue to make investments in education programs which serve Americans of all ages. The Nation's children and families deserve the opportunity for a good education throughout their lives. 
   Student performance is rising across the nation by many indicators. The federal-state-local partnership is working--we shouldn't do anything to undermine it. Instead, we should do more to accelerate positive change. 
   Student achievement is improving. Performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress has increased, particularly in reading, math, and science--critical subjects for success in learning. Average reading scores increased from 1994 to 1998 in 4th, 8th, and 12th grades. U.S. students scored near the top on the latest international assessment of reading, with 4th graders outperforming students from all other nations except Finland. Average performance in math has improved since 1978, with the largest gains made by 9-year-olds. Between 1992 and 1997, the combined verbal and math scores on the SAT increased by 15 points. 
   Students are taking more rigorous subjects than ever--and 
   doing better in them. The proportion of high school graduates taking the core courses recommended in the 1983 report, A Nation At Risk, had increased to 52 percent by 1994, up from 14 percent in 1982 and 40 percent in 1990. Since 1982, the percentage of graduates taking biology, chemistry, and physics has doubled, rising from 10 percent in 1982 to 21 percent in 1994. With increased participation in advanced placement courses, the number of students who scored at the highest levels on AP exams has risen nearly five-fold since 1982, from 132,000 in 1982 to 636,000 in 1998. 
   But too many students in too many schools in too many communities across the country fail to achieve that standard. More children need to come to school ready to learn. More children need modern schools with world-class teachers. More students need opportunities for after-school programs. And more qualified students should be able to afford to go to college. 
   The Republican budget proposal is a welcome improvement over past years. Previous Republican plans drastically cut funding for education. In one of their first acts as the majority party in 1995, Republicans rescinded education funding by $1.7 billion and proposed to abolish the Department of Education.  In subsequent years, they proposed to cut education by $3.9 billion and $3.1 billion. With the strong leadership of President Clinton, these cuts were never enacted, and Federal funding for education has steadily increased. 
   Republicans have finally begun to listen to the American people on education. The Senate Republican FY2000 Budget Resolution increases funding for elementary and secondary education by $2.6 billion over a freeze. But that increase in elementary and secondary education comes at an unacceptable and irresponsible cost. The Republicans proposed a reasonable increase in funding for elementary and secondary education, but at the same time they cut funding for critical programs like Head Start, job training, and aid for college students by at least 10 percent in FY2000 and by more than 20 percent in FY2004. 
   It is wrong to rob Peter to pay Paul, and it is wrong for the Republicans to propose this irresponsible budget. 
   It is irresponsible to increase funding for elementary and secondary education programs in order to improve the Nation's public schools and slash funding that helps young children and college students. 
   It is irresponsible to deny 100,000 children Head Start services that help them to come to school ready to learn. 
   It is irresponsible to eliminate 73,000 summer jobs and training opportunities for low-income young people. 
   It is irresponsible to jeopardize funding that helps make college more accessible and affordable for all qualified students. 
   It is irresponsible to ignore the needs of communities that need help in modernizing their school buildings. Schools across the nation face serious problems of overcrowding. Antiquated facilities are suffering from physical decay, and are not equipped to handle the needs of modern education. Across the country, 14 million children in a third of the nation's schools are learning in substandard buildings. Half the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take over $100 billion just to repair existing facilities nationwide. 
   It is irresponsible to do nothing to see that key education priorities will be met, such as reducing class size, improving teacher recruitment and training, expanding after-school programs, and ensuring strong accountability for how federal education dollars are spent. 
   Mr. President, a nation's budget is a reflection of its priorities. The nation's children and families deserve a budget that invests in their priorities--not the priorities of the right wing. Clearly, this Republican budget contains the wrong priorities for the nation's future. It gives priority to large tax cuts for the wealthy, instead of saving Social Security and Medicare, and at the expense of programs for college students, young children, and young adults. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided budget. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. HOLLINGS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am very concerned about a number of provisions in the supplemental appropriations bill. 
   First, I strongly oppose the offsets included in this bill, which will take money away from programs that help the most vulnerable Americans. 
   Before I discuss the specific offsets, let me begin with a reminder--emergency supplemental funds do not need to be offset. This is the law and it is grounded in the understanding that Congress needs to act expediently when disaster strikes. Emergencies are just that, emergencies, and they require swift action and the ability to release funds quickly. We do not need offsets to provide essential assistance to Central America, our farmers, or U.S. steel workers. 
   Nevertheless, a series of offsets have been proposed that will hurt the most vulnerable Americans, low-income children and families and immigrants. Included in their offset package, are proposals to defer $350 million in Temporary Assistance to Needy Funds (TANF), a $285 million cut in the Food Stamp Program, and a $25 million recision in INS programming which will reduce INS' ability to provide immigration benefits and services. A $40 million cut in INS border enforcement is also being proposed. 
   Taking from one poor, vulnerable community to pay for the needs of another is unacceptable. We must draw the line here to prevent the raiding programs that help poor children and families. 
   In 1996, when the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act (PRWORA) was passed, Congress gave states the authority and flexibility to design their own unique  programs to help low-income families move from welfare-to-work. The TANF program provides fixed block grants to the states totaling approximately $16.5 billion annually. TANF is a new program that supports a wide array of services. States are using their funds to assist needy families, strengthen job preparation, and promote self-sufficiency. Across the country, states and social service agencies are developing and implementing the best strategies to move their clients from welfare to self-sufficiency. 
   In addition to giving states the authority to develop their own assistance programs for low-income families, Congress also gave them the power to carry forward unobligated TANF funds for future use. States were expressly given the ability to tap into unspent funds at any point during the five-year block grant period, to optimize flexibility and meet their own unique needs and circumstances. In FY98, states obligated or spent 84% of the total federal funds received. Nineteen states have obligated 100% of their FY98 TANF funds. 
   The Republican Leadership seems to have confused ``unobligated'' with ``unneeded.'' Nothing could be further from the truth. There are a variety of reasons why some states have unobligated funds. Many states have specifically set aside part of their funds in a ``rainy day'' account. This reflects wise planning. The strong economy and low unemployment rates which we are currently enjoying may not last forever. These states will be prepared because they have set aside sufficient funds to protect themselves if the economy turns downward. 
   Other states have experienced large caseload declines but 
   require further state legislative action to reprogram funds from cash assistance to other investments, such as child care and job training, which promote work and end dependency. Other states have proceeded slowly because they chose to engage in careful planning and needs assessment research before embarking on innovative new efforts to move people from welfare to work. Now, they are ready to utilize their funds, and now the feds are trying to take back these funds. 
   Let me also point out that unobligated funds are not surplus funds. These funds are essential to the overall success of welfare reform. Many of the families remaining on welfare face substantial barriers to employment including lack of educational and workforce skills, substance abuse, domestic violence, and disability. States anticipate that greater investments will be required if families are going to successfully transition from welfare-to-work. As an increasing number of families with infants and young children move into the work force, the need and competition for child care, particularly during evening hours, will continue to expand. Without assistance, many states will not be able to provide needed services to low-income families. 
   Now, just a few years after dramatically overhauling the welfare system, the Republican Leadership wants to take $350 million in unobligated TANF funds to offset some of the expenses incurred by the Emergency Supplemental Act. This is unacceptable. Congress told states to spend their money carefully, to engage in thoughtful long-term planning, and that they could keep their unobligated funds, and here we are two years later, changing the rules of the game. 
   The Republican Leadership also wants to take $252 million from the Food Stamp Program base appropriations level. Senate appropriators contend that these funds would otherwise be unspent. Once again, the Republicans are taking a short-sighted approach. First, assuming these funds are unspent, they are not unneeded. The current base appropriations level provides an important cushion to meet unanticipated need. Second, recently released statistics on hunger and undernutrition suggest that we need to reinvest in food assistance programming. Hunger is still an urgent problem. The recent decline in food stamp use from 28 million to under 19 million does not mean that hunger is no longer a significant concern. Just a few weeks ago the Urban Institute reported that one-third of America's children are in families grappling with hunger and food insecurity. 
   We cannot let this happen. We cannot take any more money from programs that help children and needy families. Furthermore, Congress must uphold its commitment to the states--federal money pledged to the states should not be taken away, especially when emergency funding is available without offsets. 
   Another disturbing aspect of the Supplemental is the inclusion of the Hutchinson Medicaid Amendment. This issue does not belong in an emergency appropriations bill. If approved, the long-term cost to Medicaid of this amendment would be approximately $140 billion. No serious consideration has been given to the enormous impact that could have on national health policy. Instead of being used to deter youth smoking and to improve the nation's health, the language in the Committee bill would permit states to use these federal Medicaid dollars to pave 
   roads, to build prisons and stadiums, and to fund state tax cuts. Those are not appropriate uses for Medicaid dollars. Congress has a vital interest in how those federal dollars are used. 
   Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states comes from the federal government. The cost of Medicaid expenditures to treat people suffering from smoking-induced disease was at the core of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the federal government could legally demand that the states reimburse Washington from their settlements, I believe the states should be allowed to keep one hundred percent of the money. However, the federal share must be used by the states for programs that will advance the goals of protecting children and enhancing public health which were at the heart of the litigation and are consistent with the purposes of Medicaid. That would be an eminently fair and reasonable compromise of this contentious issue. 
   While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the tobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related illness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed the basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, every state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid liability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures heavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national settlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the dollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be divorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their recoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a clear and compelling interest in how the federal share will be used. 
   States should be required to use half of the amount of money they receive from the tobacco industry each year (the federal share) to protect children and improve public health. At least thirty-five percent of the federal share would be spent on programs to deter youth smoking and to help smokers overcome their addiction. This would include a broad range of tobacco control initiatives, including school and community based tobacco use prevention programs, counter-advertising to discourage smoking, cessation programs, and enforcement of the ban on sale to minors. Three thousand children start smoking every day, and one thousand of them will die prematurely as a result of tobacco-induced disease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without question, our highest priority for the use of these funds. Reducing youth smoking would, of course, result in a dramatic savings in future Medicaid expenditures. The state settlements provide the resources to dissuade millions of teenagers from smoking, to break the cycle of addiction and early death. We must seize that opportunity. 
   The remainder of the federal share should be used by states to fund health care and early learning initiatives which they select. States could either use the additional resources to supplement existing programs in these areas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to improve public health and promote child development. 
   Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease and early death. It has consumed an enormous amount 
   of the nation's health care resources. Finally, resources taken from the tobacco companies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, for example, use a portion of this money to help  senior citizens pay for prescription drugs, or to provide expanded health care services to the uninsured. Funds could be used to support community health centers, to reduce public health risks, or to make health insurance more affordable. 
   For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as future smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based upon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health risks of smoking. It is particularly appropriate that resources taken from this malignant industry be used to give our children a better start in life. States could use a portion of these funds to improve early learning opportunities for young children, or to expand child care services, or for other child development initiatives. 
   Congress has an overwhelming interest in how the federal share of these dollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be used for road repair or building maintenance. They should be used by the states to create a healthier future for all our citizens, and particularly for our children. 
   These problems with the supplemental need to be fixed. Congress shouldn't let emergency assistance get bogged down by these extraneous provisions. A clean supplemental should be approved as quickly as possible so that this aid can go out quickly to those in greatest need.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator, and the Chair. 
   Mr. President, let me just add my voice in support of the Specter-Harkin amendment. Basically, as we all know, the States have waived the Federal Medicaid rights. So they understand that there are Federal interests. I think it is pretty understandable to all of us, because we understand how the Medicaid Program was established. 
   The really compelling interest that was successful in the States that brought about the settlement in the first place related to the health hazards that individuals were afflicted with. This seems to me to be an eminently fair and reasonable balance between the Federal interests and the State interests. It seems to be focused in the areas of health care, and also the prevention of smoking. I think that is basically what the families of this country want. It makes a good deal of common sense. It is consistent with what this whole battle has been about, and this is a well targeted, well thought out, and a very compelling amendment to be able to do so. 
   One of the most disturbing aspects of the Supplemental is the inclusion of the Hutchinson Medicaid Amendment. This issue does not belong in an emergency appropriations bill. If approved, the long-term cost to Medicaid of this amendment could be as high as $125 billion. No serious consideration has been given to the enormous impact that cost could have on national health policy. Instead of being used to deter youth smoking and to improve the nation's health, the language in the committee bill would permit states to use these federal Medicaid dollars to pave roads, to build prisons and stadiums, and to fund state tax cuts. Those are not appropriate uses for Medicaid dollars. Congress has a vital interest in how these federal dollars are used. 
   Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states comes from the federal government. The cost of Medicaid expenditures to treat people suffering from smoking-induced disease was at the core of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the  federal government could legally demand that the states reimburse Washington from their settlements, I believe the states should be allowed to keep one hundred percent of the money. However, the federal share must be used by the states for programs that will advance the goals of protecting children and enhancing public health which were at the heart of the litigation and are consistent with the purposes of Medicaid. That is what the Specter-Harkin amendment would accomplish. I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of it. It is a fair and reasonable compromise of this contentious issue. 
   While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the tobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related illness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed the basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, every state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid liability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures heavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national settlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the dollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be divorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their recoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a clear and compelling interest in how the federal share will be used. 
   In exchange for a waiver of the federal claim, states should be required to use half of the amount of money they receive from the tobacco industry each year to protect children from tobacco and improve the nation's health. If the funds are used in that way, this investment will dramatically reduce future Medicaid expenditures. 
   Under the Specter amendment, at least twenty percent of a state's recovery would be spent on programs to deter youth smoking and to help smokers overcome their addiction. This would include a broad range of tobacco control initiatives, including school and community based tobacco use prevention programs, counter-advertising to discourage smoking, cessation programs, and enforcement of the ban on sale to minors. Three thousand children start smoking every day, and one thousand of them will die prematurely as a result of tobacco-induced disease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without question, our highest priority for the use of these funds. The state settlements provide the resources to dissuade millions of teenagers from smoking, to break the cycle of addiction and early death. We must seize that opportunity. 
   An additional thirty percent would be used by states to fund health care and public health programs which they select. States could either use the additional resources to supplement existing programs in these areas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to improve health services. 
   Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease and early death. It has consumed an enormous amount of the nation's health care resources. At long last, resources taken from the tobacco companies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, for example, use a portion of this money to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs, or to provide expanded health care services to the uninsured. Funds could be used to support community health centers, to reduce public health risks, or to make health insurance more affordable. 
   For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as future smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based upon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health risks of smoking. It would be particularly appropriate for resources taken from this malignant industry to be used to give our children a healthier start in life. 
   Congress has an overwhelming interest in how the federal share of these dollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be used for road repair or building maintenance. They should be used by the states to create a healthier future for all our citizens. 
   I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for yielding this time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the past year has seen far-reaching developments which bring the dream of peace in Northern Ireland closer than at any time in our lifetimes. 
   Today, the Friends of Ireland in Congress is releasing its annual St. Patrick's Day Statement. The Friends of Ireland is a bipartisan group of Senators and Representatives opposed to violence and terrorism in Northern Ireland and dedicated to a United States policy that promotes a just, lasting and peaceful settlement of the conflict, which has taken more than 3,100 lives over the past 30 years.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, on balance, I believe this legislation deserves bipartisan support. There is a clear need to do more to protect our country from the threat of missile attacks. This bill avoids most of the problems of previous versions and is consistent with our responsibility to continue working with Russia to reduce the immense threat from their nuclear arsenal. 
   The bill declares that it is the policy of the United States to deploy a limited national missile defense system as soon as it is technologically possible, but it also stresses that it is the policy of the United States to continue to negotiate with Russia to reduce our nuclear arsenals. 
   There is no doubt that the United States is facing a growing threat to our country and our interests from rogue nations that possess increasingly advanced missile technology. We must prepare for these threats more effectively by making greater investments in research and development to produce a missile defense system able to defeat these threats.  
   But, before we decide to actually deploy such a system, we must ask ourselves the following questions: 
   What is the specific threat we are countering with this system? 
   Will the system be effective? 
   What impact will the deployment of the system have on the nuclear arms reduction and arms control agreements we currently have with the Russians? 
   What will be the cost of the system? 
   The Rumsfeld Report in 1998 clearly demonstrated the growing missile threat from rogue nations. In spite of international agreements to control the spread of missile technology, these nations are resorting to whatever means it takes to acquire this capability. Because of this growing threat, we must do more to decide whether a defense is practical and can deliver the protection it promises. 
   Many of us continue to be concerned that the step we are about to take could undermine the very successful nuclear arms reduction treaties and other arms control agreements that we have with Russia. Our purpose in developing a limited national missile defense system is not directed at Russia. It is intended to protect our country against the growing missile threat from rogue nations. 
   Russia's strategic nuclear force would easily overpower the limited missile defense system that is currently proposed. But the fact remains that the United States and Russia are parties to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Without changes to that treaty, our ability to fully test and deploy this defense system cannot occur. 
   The ABM Treaty is also the foundation for the SALT I and SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaties, which paved the way for the START I and START II treaties. The Russian Duma is again preparing to debate the ratification of the START II treaty, and will do so when Russian Prime Minister Primakov returns from his visit to the United States. President Clinton has already sent a delegation to Russia to discuss changes in this treaty. We must work closely with the Russians to make mutually acceptable changes to the ABM Treaty in order to accommodate a missile defense system. The ABM Treaty is simply too important to abandon. 
   We also need to work with Russia to develop a joint early warning system, so that false launch alarms can be avoided. We need to strengthen the Cooperative Threat Reduction programs at the Department of Defense. We need to strengthen the Nuclear Cities programs and the Initiaitve for Proliferation Prevention program at the Department of Energy so that we can reduce the danger that nuclear material will end up on the hands of rogue nations or terrorists. 
   Finally, we must continue to strengthen other counter-terrorism programs. It is far more likely that if terrorists use nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons against Americans at home or abroad, they will be delivered by conventional mathods rather than by a ballistic missile launch from another country. These threats must weigh at least equally--if not more heavily--in our defense decisions. 
   These are very important defense decisions that go to the heart of our national security. I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that we counter these threats in the most effective ways in the years ahead.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this timely resolution and its tribute to the courage and vision of the political leaders of Northern Ireland who have given that land an extraodinary opportunity for peace. 
   By signing the historic Good Friday Peace Agreement last April, leaders such as John Hume, David Trimble, Gerry Adams, and others launched a new era of peace and reconciliation for all the people of Northern Ireland. And I commend as well the indispensable contributions to the peace process by President Clinton, our former Senate colleague George Mitchell, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern of Ireland and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Great Britain. 
   The goal of the peace process is to end thirty years of violence and bloodshed in Northern Ireland, reduce divisions between Unionists and Nationalists, and build new bridges of opportunity between the two communities. Through this process, they have committed themselves to finding the needle of peace in the haystack of violence--and they are finding it. When those of lesser vision urged a lesser course, the leaders in Northern Ireland acted boldly. They tirelessly dedicated themselves to the pursuit of peace, and they made difficult political choices to bring their noble vision of a peace agreement to reality. 
   As we all know, there are still miles to go before the victory of lasting peace is finally won. But because of what they accomplished, there is better hope for the future. They have made an enormous difference, perhaps all the difference, for peace. Their achievement in the Good Friday Peace Agreement has changed the course of history for all the people in Northern Ireland. 
   The task now facing all of us who care about this process is to build greater momentum for full implementation of the Agreement. There has been welcome recent progress. Last month, the Northern Ireland Assembly approved the designation of the Northern Ireland Departments and the group of cross-border bodies. Last week, Britain and Ireland signed historic treaties for closer ties. Prisoners have been released. The British have reduced their troop levels to the lowest point in twenty years. We are also heartened by the establishment of the Human Rights Commissions. 
   Full implementation of the Agreement offers the best way forward and the best yardstick to judge the policies and actions of all involved. The goal of peace is best served by prompt action on the Agreement. Those who take risks for peace can be assured of timely support by President Clinton, Congress, and the American people.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join in this tribute to our friend and colleague, Senator BOB KERREY. 
   The Nation's highest award for bravery in combat is the Congressional Medal of Honor. Since its creation in 1861, 3,400 Medals of Honor have been awarded to America's bravest Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, and Coast Guardsmen for heroic action in battles from the Civil War to Somalia. Our colleague BOB KERREY is one of these brave American heroes. 
   Senator KERREY was awarded the Medal of Honor for risking his life above and beyond the call of duty during the Vietnam War. The leadership and courage demonstrated by this young, 25-year-old SEAL team leader during intense and ferocious combat are nothing short of extraordinary. These events occurred thirty years ago this month, but the same courage and leadership can be seen everyday in his work in the United States Senate. 
   I welcome the opportunity to commend Senator BOB KERREY on this auspicious anniversary, and I commend him as well for his outstanding service to the Senate and to the people of Nebraska and the nation. He's a hero for our time and for all times, and I'm proud to serve with him in the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join Senator SPECTOR, Senator WYDEN, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator SMITH in introducing the Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999. This bill has the support of the Department of Justice, constitutional scholars, law enforcement officials, and many organizations with a long and distinguished history of involvement in combating hate crimes, including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, the Anti-Defamation League, the Human Rights Campaign, the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force, the National Organization for Women Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and The Consortium for Citizens with Disabilities Rights Task Force. 
   Congress has a responsibility to act this year to deal with the festering problem of hate crimes. The silence of Congress on this basic issue has been deafening, and it is unacceptable. We must stop acting like we don't care--that somehow this fundamental issue is just a state problem. It isn't. It's a national problem, and it's an outrage that Congress has been A.W.O.L. 
   Few crimes tear more deeply at the fabric of our society than hate crimes. These despicable acts injure the victim, the community, and the nation itself. The brutal murders in Texas, Wyoming, and most recently in Alabama have shocked the conscience of the nation. Sadly, these three crimes are only the tip of the hate crimes iceberg. We need to do more--much more--to combat them. 
   I'm convinced that if Congress acted today, and President Clinton signed our bill tomorrow, we'd have fewer hate crimes in all the days that follow. 
   Current federal laws are clearly inadequate. It's an embarrassment that we haven't already acted to close these glaring gaps in present law. For too long, the federal government has been forced to fight hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back. 
   Our bill does not undermine the role of the states in investigating and prosecuting hate crimes. States will continue to take the lead. But the full power of federal law should also be available to investigate, prosecute, and punish these crimes. 
   The Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 1999 addresses two serious deficiencies in the principal federal hate crimes statutes, 18 U.S.C. &#167;245, which applies to hate crimes committed on the basis of race, color, religion, or national origin. 
   First, the statute requires the government to prove that the defendant committed an offense not only because of the victim's race, color, religion, or national origin, but also because of the victim's participation in one of six narrowly defined ``federally protected activities'' enumerated in the statute. These activities are: (A) enrolling in or attending a public school or public college; (B) participating in or enjoying a service, program, facility or activity provided or administered by any state or local government; (C) applying for or enjoying employment; (D) serving in a state court as a grand or petit juror; (E) traveling in or using a facility of interstate commerce; and (F) enjoying the goods or services of certain places of public accommodation. 
   Second, the statute provides no coverage for hate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. Together, these limitations prevent the federal government from working with state and local law enforcement agencies in the investigation and prosecution of many of the most vicious hate crimes.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly support this resolution, and I urge the Senate to approve it. I oppose the unilateral declaration of an independent Palestinian state. Such a provocative action would violate the letter and the spirit of the peace process in the Middle East, and could well be an irreparable blow to that process. 
   The issue of an independent state is clearly one of the most critical issues in the peace process, and just as clearly, it is an issue that must be negotiated by the parties themselves. 
   I hope very much that Chairman Arafat will be successful in resisting the pressure he is under to take this irresponsible action. The peace process is too important, and the parties have come too far, to allow this to happen. 
   It is very important for all of us in the United States who care about peace in the Middle East to make our views clear on this fundamental issue. I commend the Senate leadership of both parties for enabling the Senate to go on record today in strong opposition to any such unilateral declaration.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I yield myself 6 minutes, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, in the last 3 or 4 weeks, we have heard our majority leader on three different occasions indicate that the most important issue we are going to address in the early part of this session was education. Over the period of the last 6 days, we have tried to debate a number of the ideas that we have on this side of the aisle, and certainly there ought to be the opportunity to debate amendments from the other side of the aisle as well. 
   We have tried to do that, but have been effectively closed out from that opportunity.  
   I would like at this time, to read a statement by Senator PATTY MURRAY, who, because of a death in the family, will be unable to be here to make this representation in the final few minutes of consideration before we go into a series of votes--the most important being the time-sensitive issue of smaller classes for grades K through 3. This is what Senator MURRAY says:  
   Mr. President, I want to express how deeply disappointed I am. The Senate had a tremendous opportunity to work together to make a tangible difference in our children's lives and their futures. But instead, Republicans have chosen the path of partisanship and division. 
   Last October, the Senate reached a bipartisan agreement to reduce class size and improve teacher quality. Republicans and Democrats worked together to reach a compromise that is sending funds to local school districts this July. We did it because we knew it was the right thing to do. That simple fact has not changed in the last 5 months. 
   So I am absolutely baffled about why we could not reach this agreement again. The Senate's failure to pass this amendment was irresponsible and inexcusable. 
   The Senate Republicans have broken their promise to teachers, to parents, and worst of all, to children in the first, second, and third grades across the country. 
   The Senate Republicans are hoping that this issue will just fade away, but the education of our children is far too important for me to allow that to happen. I will be back for as long as it takes to get them to recognize they cannot continue to stall. Until they take real steps to reduce the class size, Mr. President, the Republicans owe the children of this country an explanation.  
   This is what we heard last fall. At that time, leading Republicans in Congress hailed the class size agreement. House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY said, ``We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered a way to pay for them,'' effectively supporting the first year of getting smaller class sizes. Republican Congressman BILL GOODLING, Chairman of House Education Committee, declared that the Class Size Reduction Act was ``.....a real victory for the Republican Congress but, more importantly, a huge win for local educators.'' Senator SLADE GORTON said the same thing about the Class Size Reduction Act, representing the Republicans in negotiation on education, ``On education, there s been a genuine meeting of the minds involving the President and the Democrats and Republicans here in Congress.......'' 
   Now before the Senate we have the amendment of the Senator from Washington, to fulfill that commitment--which Republicans were taking credit for 5 months ago--and we are being denied this opportunity. 
   We will have a chance this afternoon to vote on it. This is the time, today is the day, where the U.S. Senate can go on record for smaller class sizes in grades K-3. Today--today is the day to do it. 
   I say to my good friend from New Hampshire, all of us are very concerned about our nation's children. We, on this side, do not yield that there is anyone who is more concerned about those needy children in our local communities. The fact of the matter is that his battle is not with us--it is with the Republican leadership that supported this program 5 months ago. 
   Special ed educators all over this country are supporting the Murray amendment. Why? Because they think you can serve special needs children in many different ways, not just in targeting money for a particular funding program, but in smaller classes. We put that in the record. So we reject this idea that we are pitting one group of children against another, which effectively is what the Republican amendments are doing. 
   Mr. President, today in just 8 minutes we will start a series of votes. They are on amendments that can make a major difference in student achievement. They are supported by parents, local school boards, principals, and teachers all across this Nation for smaller class size, expanding after-school programs, reducing drop out rates, and ending social promotion. We have a chance on the floor of the U.S. Senate, to take votes and declare that we want action in those areas. That is what we are trying to do. We have been trying to do it for 6 days and have been denied that through parliamentary mechanisms of our Republican friends. 
   I hope those Americans who care so deeply about those issues know how important it is to the children of this country. It is intuitive. Every parent knows if you have a child in a smaller class the child is going to do better. We have an opportunity to do something about that and I hope this afternoon we will have a strong vote in support of the Murray amendment--the children in this country deserve it. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, last year we made a bipartisan agreement to support the hiring of additional teachers. We had a $500 million increase in IDEA and $1 billion increase in terms of the teachers, including special needs teachers. 
   Communities need funds both for IDEA and smaller classes--and for other top priorities too. We can reduce class size and give children with disabilities a better education. There is no reason to choose one or the other--both are priorities and both can be met. 
   Every local community in this country is trying to decide whether they are going to hire additional teachers within the next few weeks. If we say now we are going to accept the Lott amendment, you are emasculating this particular provision, which the local communities have been basing their judgment on, and saying, no, that isn't what you are going to do, you are going to have to come up with a new kind of a program. 
   If we make a commitment to a local community that permitted them to hire general teachers or special needs teachers, I daresay one of the principal reasons that the special needs community supported this amendment last year was because we added that specific provision. We are saying let us, let the local communities live out the bipartisan commitment that we made to them 5 months ago. They can make that local judgment depending upon the needs of the community. 
   How can you have greater flexibility than that--rather than overturn the whole proposal that was out there and dump this on the school committees that are all finalizing their budgets in the next few weeks? 
   I hope that the amendment would not be accepted.

   ..... to carry out effective approaches to reducing class size with highly qualified teachers to improve educational achievement of both regular and special needs children.  
   That is defined as ``providing professional development to teachers, including special education teachers and teachers of special-needs children.......'' We already have it. The local school communities are committed to making their own judgment and decision. Why are we turning that all over, Mr. President, now in the final hours of this? It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The special needs community supported that amendment last year.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this is the Murray amendment. Senator MURRAY is not here today, due to a death in the family, otherwise, she would be making the presentation at this particular time. 
   Basically, the Murray amendment builds on what was agreed to in the budget last October by providing 6 years of funding. It gives certainty to school boards all across the country that we are making a national commitment to see smaller class size in schools all across the Nation. 
   In the President's budget, there is $11 billion that is effectively allocated for this particular purpose. It follows the pattern that was agreed to last year that states if a particular district has already achieved 18 students, they can use the funds for professional enhancement or for special needs children. That is why it has the support of the special education community. 
   This amendment has the wholehearted support of all the school boards, of all the parent-teacher organizations, of the school teachers and local authorities across the Nation. It is a major national effort to try to get smaller class sizes. 
   We are going to need 2 million teachers over the next 10 years. This is only going to provide 100,000, but it will make sure that they are well-qualified teachers. It will place support the early grades, which ought to be our priority. I hope it will be accepted. 
   It also includes, Mr. President, the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution shall include an annual increase for the IDEA part B and funding so that the program can be fully funded within the next 5 years. So, we are committed to that as well. And it also says these increases shall not come at the expense of the other education programs. 
   If you support this amendment, you are also supporting a commitment to fund the IDEA over the period of the next 5 years. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to make it crystal clear that I am not in favor of amending IDEA in any significant way, now or in the near future. In the last Congress, members of both the House and the Senate worked hard to bring all sides together to reauthorize IDEA. Now, Congress owes children and families across the country the most effective possible implementation of this legislation. 
   The amendments enacted in 1997 were the product of comprehensive, bipartisan negotiations involving Congress and the Administration, with extensive public input. The final product involved compromises on many sensitive and complex issues, and it has been widely recognized as a significant improvement of this landmark legislation, to protect the rights of 6 million children to a free, appropriate public education. The Department of Education moved quickly to propose regulations, and the final regulations are expected this Friday. 
   In many communities, schools are only just beginning to use the tools that are available to them under current law in cases where disciplinary action is warranted for a disabled student. Schools have broad power to develop and implement behavioral intervention plans for children with disabilities, and to use early intervention in ways that can avoid the need for disciplinary actions at all. 
   The 1997 changes in the law and the implementation of the regulations under it must be given a chance to work. At this point, it is clearly premature to make substantive changes in the statute. The goal of this Congress should be to give all children the educational opportunity to pursue their goals and dreams. We should not prematurely undermine the implementation of this landmark legislation. 
   Mr. President, for the reasons outlined earlier, we were prepared to move towards a voice vote. 
   There is one change in terms of the IDEA regulations. There will be some IDEA regulations with regard to discipline that have been included in this amendment that are generally not objectionable. However, since it does effectively undermine the previous agreement, I hope it would not be accepted.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to vote for the Jeffords substitute to the Ed-Flex bill today because it is a small step forward in improving the federal, state, and local partnerships in education. It helps to guarantee that accountability goes hand in hand with flexibility, and that increased flexibility will in fact lead to improved student achievement. 
   But I'm concerned that we are not fulfilling the 7-year commitment we made only a few months ago to help communities reduce class size. It makes no sense to take a small step forward by passing Ed-Flex, and a giant step backward by breaking the class size commitment. 
   The National Parents and Teachers Association, the American Federation of Teachers, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and the National Education Association strongly oppose the Lott Amendment, because it undermines the commitment to class size reduction that was approved with broad bipartisan support only a few months ago, and because it pits class size reduction against helping disabled children.  
   Congress made a specific promise last fall to help schools hire 100,000 new teachers over the next seven years to reduce class size. We should keep that promise, not undermine it, and not put it in competition with IDEA. 
   School districts can't choose to do what is right for some children and not for others. They must--and do--serve all children. They need a federal helping hand to make sure all children get a good education. We should not force communities to choose between smaller classes and students with special needs. Pitting one child against another is wrong. We should meet our commitment to improving education for all children. 
   Nothing is more important on the calendar of schools right now than their budgets. Over the next few weeks, schools across the country will be making major decisions on their budgets for the next school year. And in many of these communities, the budgets are due by early April. In Memphis, school budgets are due on March 22. In Fayette County, Kentucky, school budgets are due on March 31. In Boston, Savannah, Las Vegas, and Houston, school budgets are due in the first week of April. In San Francisco, they are due by April 1. In Council Bluffs, Iowa, school budgets are due April 15th. In Altoona, Pennsylvania, school budgets are due in April. 
   Communities can't do it alone. They want the federal government to be a strong partner in improving their schools--not sit on the sidelines--and certainly not break its promises to help. 
   The Senate should not turn its back on our promise to help communities reduce class size in the early grades. We need to act now, so that communities can plan effectively for the full seven years. No school can hire teachers one year at a time. That makes no sense. Communities want to reduce class size--and they need to be sure that Congress will do its part to help them over the long term, as we promised. 
   I intend to vote for the final Ed-Flex bill to move this defective legislation to the next stage, where I hope we can reach a satisfactory compromise. 
   Clearly we should not break promises to communities. We should make commitments and keep them. And I will oppose a conference report that includes any provisions to undermine our commitment to reducing class size. 
   I will continue to work to make sure that we meet our commitments to helping communities give all children a good education. The nation's future depends on it. 
   I want to thank the leaders, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE, for their courtesy and I want to congratulate my friend and colleague, the chairman of the committee, on his work, too.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are about to take our third and fourth cloture votes this week, the first on whether we will meet our 7-year commitment to help communities reduce class size and the second on whether we will prematurely end this education debate. 
   While our Republican friends continue to block action on critical education issues for the sixth day in a row, communities are struggling to make decisions about their school budgets--they need and expect our help. 
   We have an excellent opportunity to deal with key education issues that have been clear for many months--reducing class size, recruiting more teachers, expanding afterschool programs, bringing technology into the classroom, reducing dropout rates, modernizing school buildings. No bill on the Senate Calendar right now is more important than education. 
   Nothing is more important on the calendar of local schools than their budgets. Over the next three weeks, schools across the country will be making major decisions on their budgets for the next school year. In many of these communities, the budgets are due by early April. In Memphis, school budgets are due on March 22. In Fayette County, KY, school budgets are due on March 31. In Boston, Savannah, Las Vegas, and Houston, school budgets are due the first week of April. In San Francisco, they are due April 1; Council Bluffs, IA, school budgets are due April 15. In Altoona, PA, school budgets are due in April. 
   This is why the Murray amendment is so important to consider, so that schools will be able to say, yes, we want to use this money for new schoolteachers, for smaller class size, because we know for the next 6 or 7 years, there will be a continuing commitment and enough resources to be able to do it. 
   The Senate should keep its promise that schools will be able to hire 100,000 new teachers over the next 7 years to help them reduce class size. Communities can't do it alone. They want the Federal Government to be a strong partner in improving their schools. We can't sit on the sidelines or allow this debate on education to stay in gridlock. 
   A teacher from Kansas wants action by Uncle Sam. He writes:  
   Even here in Kansas, many teachers struggle to provide their students with a quality education because they have so many students to reach. We have waited for years for the State legislature to do something, but they haven't. Now is the time for the Federal Government to step in and help. Your support for this bill will speak loudly to myself and other teachers that you truly believe in public education. Please help reduce class size in our country.  
   A teacher from Maine writes:  
   It is becoming more and more necessary to reduce class sizes to address the individual needs of a wider variety of students........Please support the initiative to hire more teachers to reduce class sizes in U.S. public schools.  
   A parent from North Carolina writes:  
   I am a parent with 2 children in a public school and one that will enter school soon........I am very well aware of the critical need for additional classroom teachers. Our children, our future, and our Nation depend upon a strong public school system.  
   Mr. President, last year when we signed onto the first year on reducing class size it was done in a bipartisan way. Listen to what House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY said:  
   We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them. And when the President's people were willing to work with us so that we could let the State and local communities use this money, make these decisions, manage the money, spend the money on teachers where they saw the need, whether it be for special education or for regular teaching, with freedom of choice and management and control at the local level, we thought this good for America and good for the school children. We were very excited to move forward on that.  
   That was what the majority leader, DICK ARMEY, said about that agreement--just 5 months ago, Mr. President. That is why we find it so difficult to understand why we can't at least get to the point of consideration on this measure. 
   Senator SLADE GORTON said about the Class Size Reduction Act:  
   On education, there's been a genuine meeting of the minds involving the President and the Democrats and Republicans here in Congress........It will go directly through to each of the 14,000 school districts in the United States, and each of those school districts will make its own determination as to what kind of new teachers that district needs most, which kind should be hired........We've made a step in the direction that we like. We never were arguing over the amount of money that ought to go into education. And so this is a case in which both sides genuinely can claim a triumph.  
   The Murray amendment is a continuation of what was agreed to last year, in which both sides claimed triumph, and there was a movement made towards smaller classrooms. That is what the issue is that we will be voting on at 1. 
   The Senate should not turn its back on our promise to help communities reduce class size in the early grades. We should meet our commitment to parents, students and communities, and we should meet it now. 
   We need to act now, so communities can act effectively for the next 7 years.  Senator DASCHLE has made a reasonable proposal for an up-or-down vote on a limited number of amendments with limited time agreements.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are in the process of trying to work through some kind of arrangement where we can address a reasonable number of amendments, on both sides. I do not want to characterize how close we are to it, but we are moving towards a vote at 1:30. It is really a question of whether the leadership and the other Members are inclined to do so. 
   On the one hand, I find it quite objectionable to have to get into a situation where those in the minority are going to have to go hat in hand to the majority and say: Look, we are going to be limited to these number of amendments in order to get our amendments considered. The rules of the Senate permit us to offer amendments until there is a determination by 60 Members of this body to terminate or close off debate. Then there is also an opportunity for follow-on amendments, if they are germane. 
   We are in a situation, nonetheless, where there are some negotiations being worked out and being addressed. We are inviting Members on both sides to give their reactions on it. It is a process which is done here in this body, and we will see what the outcome is. 
   Barring that, we will be moving towards the vote on cloture on the Murray amendment, which we have talked about during these past days. It is a very simple amendment. It is a continued authorization for the next 6 years on class size for the earliest grades, K through 3. We had, as I mentioned earlier in the day, made an agreement which had broad bipartisan support. I read into the RECORD the very strong support for that measure when we worked it out just a few months ago, when the Republican majority leader, DICK ARMEY, said:  
   We were very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way to pay for them........We were very excited to move forward on that.  
   This is the Republican majority leader in the House of Representatives. We also have included statements where the Republican chairman of the House committee, Mr. GOODLING, stated similar kinds of expressions of favorable consideration. 
   Now we are faced without the opportunity to consider this amendment. That is basically unacceptable, Mr. President--particularly when communities across this country have to submit their budgets, which includes the hiring of teachers for this coming September, in only a few weeks. If schools want to take advantage of this year's teachers and the follow-on teachers, they have to be able to make a judgment. Schools, communities and school boards are all inquiring about this funding--the school boards in particular. They are in such strong support of this funding--the school board associations, the parents associations, the principals associations, the teachers associations. They want a degree of certainty--what rules do they have to play by. That is why this legislation is so important. 
   The GAO report states that when they asked local directors and principals and superintendents of schools what were the three things that they wanted most, they said: First, additional funding--no surprise. Secondly, they said, tell us about additional programs that can benefit the children. Thirdly, we want information on how to run the school. That is in the GAO report, not, ``No. 1, we just want the Ed-Flex.'' 
   We are for Ed-Flex. I want to see accountability, and we have made some progress. The House is dealing with that issue this afternoon--they took some language and, I think, made some important progress in terms of accountability. The fact is, Mr. President, that the No. 1 issue on school boards all across this country is plain and simple: Are we going to move ahead and give the kind of continued authorization for this legislation so we can get smaller class size for the next 3 years, or aren't we? 
   At 1:30, we have the chance to vote on that issue here in the U.S. Senate. We can vote in favor of cloture, which effectively ties that particular provision into the legislation--it can still be modified, if the amendments are germane. Then we take the next step to go to the conference. That is what is really before us and why this vote is of particular importance and significance. 
   I see 1:30 has arrived--my friend and colleague from Tennessee is on his feet. We will either vote, which I am glad to do, or accede to the majority leader, if he has a request. 
   Mr. FRIST addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, just to review 7% of the Federal budget goes to educational programs--the role of the Federal Government is exceedingly limited. 
   So let's think for a moment what this is all about. This is a rifle shot program, Title I primarily. You have the Eisenhower Program, which is the teaching of math and science and the technology. Those together are maybe, $700 million nationwide, but that is a targeted program to the neediest children. 
   Now, 90 percent of the waivers today go out of the formula providing the targeted help and assistance to the neediest children. That is why there is some caution about what is being included in the Ed-Flex. There have been attempts by my colleagues--Senator WELLSTONE and Senator REID--and myself to make sure that we are going to get flexibility at the local community level to serve the neediest children, but not to do what we did 25 years ago and build swimming pools and buy football equipment--because the local people know best about how to spend the money. That is what happened 25 years ago, Mr. President. Many of us are not prepared to say we are going to recognize that as a matter of national policy. 
   The most underserved children in this country need to be a part of our whole process in the education system. And they need additional kinds of help and assistance in terms of math, reading and other programs. We are going to have a limited amount of resources spread nationwide--2 to 3 cents out of every dollar locally--but it is going to go to the neediest children. 
   It is important to understand what the debate is about. We want some flexibility in that local community if they are going to use these resources and use it more creatively to help and assist those children. That is where Ed-Flex makes some difference. But if you look where the waivers have been, they have not been, with all respect to my colleague from Oregon, creating smaller class size. That is not where the GAO report has been. 
   It is moving past the formula from 50 percent to 43 percent. Under certain circumstances they have received the funds before and want to try and still carry forth the substance of the legislation because it is getting the most of  it, in terms of the neediest children for schoolwide programs. 
   With all respect, that is what this debate is about. It is not a big sack of dough we are sending out there. The local community needs the additional resources and they can raise it or the States can. This is where the Targeted Resources Program developed some 35 years ago. 
   I might say that the most important analysis of the effectiveness of this program has been in the last 2 weeks where we have the report on Title I which shows that there is measurable student improvement and advancement, with a series of recommendations. Part of the recommendations are what? The smaller class size, afterschool programs. 
   We come back to a situation where we are being denied that opportunity to vote. We welcome the chance to see this move ahead. As I have mentioned and pointed out in a lead editorial today--we want a situation like we have in Texas where they have a described measurable goal; they measured the results of their investment against those goals, and they made progress on it. That is a very substantial and significant kind of improvement over what we are talking about here today. I kind of wonder why we are not going that way--I would like to see us go that way. However, that issue has been defeated in an earlier Wellstone amendment. We think there is still enough justification to provide support for this proposal. 
   Let's not confuse this legislation, Ed-Flex, with doing something about smaller class size. We are talking about $11.4 billion--$11.4 billion additional dollars--in local communities for smaller class size. There is not a nickel in this bill for smaller class size, not a nickel. So if we are concerned about smaller class size, the effort that we ought to be making here today should be in support of the Murray amendment. That is the one Senator MURRAY has advanced to the Senate, spoken to the Senate, pleaded with the Senate. She has been our leader on this issue. Hopefully, we can make some progress on this issue. 
   I know time is moving along. I want to certainly cooperate with the leaders, but at some time we will have to have some evaluation.

   But we also want to deal with smaller class size, and the Republican leader, DICK ARMEY, said only five months ago, ``We are very pleased to receive the President's request for more teachers, especially since he offered to provide a way for them. We are very excited to go forward with that.'' And Chairman GOODLING made similar statements. 
   We are now put in this situation where we are told that we cannot consider that, we have to just go ahead with Ed-Flex--we can't consider what the Republicans agreed to in a bipartisan way. 
   I have listened to those who say let's put partisanship aside. We would like to put partisanship aside--we would like to follow on with what DICK ARMEY and Chairman GOODLING said. They supported this proposal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, we are here today to propose legislation to protect the privacy of personal medical information in our rapidly changing health care system. Today, video rental records have greater protection than sensitive medical information. Last month, we learned that the University of Michigan Medical Center posted information from thousands of patient records on the Internet, without any password protection or other safeguards. In many other cases, individual patients have been harmed by improper release of their private medical records. 
   The legislation that Senator DASCHLE, Senator LEAHY, Congressman MARKEY, and I are introducing today--the Medical Information Privacy and Security Act--puts patients first, while allowing for legitimate uses of medical information to improve health care. 
   Congress recognized the need to act to protect the privacy of medical information when we passed the Kassebaum-Kennedy Act in 1996. That legislation contained a provision requiring Congress to pass legislation on the issue by August of this year. If the deadline is not met, the Administration has the power to act by regulation. 
   The measure we are introducing ensures strong protections nationwide. It also allows individual states to take additional action. Stronger state laws are not pre-empted. 
   The goal of these protections is to safeguard the confidential relationship between patients and physicians. Patients concerned about their privacy are less likely to disclose important information to their physicians. A recent survey by the California HealthCare Foundation found that one in six adults has taken steps to protect their personal medical information, such as providing inaccurate information in their medical history, or asking physicians not to include certain information in their medical records. 
   Our legislation recognizes the fundamental right of patients to limit disclosure of personally-identifiable medical information. We have balanced that right with the needs of providers and health care plans to use medical information to improve patient care. Our proposal does not force patients to sign a blanket authorization in order to receive care. Instead, it contains a flexible framework that can be modified to fit different situations. 
   Medical research is essential for progress against disease. But it is also essential for patients to have confidence that research is beneficial, not an invasion of privacy. In genetic testing studies at the National Institutes of Health, 32 percent of eligible people who were offered a test for breast cancer declined to take it, because of concerns about loss of privacy and the potential for discrimination in health insurance. 
   Currently, most federal health research is governed by the ``Common Rule'', which includes evaluations by Institutional Review Boards in order to protect patients involved in the research. Our proposed legislation strengthens the privacy provisions in the ``Common Rule,'' and extends those protections to all health research. 
   These issues are important, and I am optimistic that Congress will act in time to meet the August deadline. We have a responsibility to enact strong protections for privacy in all aspects of health care, and now is the time to act.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation which will insure that the federal share of the state Medicaid settlements negotiated with the tobacco industry is used by the states to prevent youth smoking, to improve health care, and to promote child development. Fifty-seven cents of every Medicaid dollar spent by the states comes from the federal government. The cost of Medicaid expenditures to treat people suffering from smoking-induced disease was at the core of state lawsuits against the tobacco industry. While the federal government could legally demand that the states reimburse Washington from their settlements, I believe the states should be allowed to keep one hundred percent of the money. However, the federal share should be used by the states for programs that will advance the goals of protecting children and enhancing public health which were at the heart of the litigation and are consistent with the purposes of Medicaid. That would be an eminently fair and reasonable compromise of this contentious issue. 
   While there were a variety of claims made by the states against the tobacco industry, the Medicaid dollars used to treat tobacco-related illness constituted by far the largest claim monetarily, and it formed the basis for the national settlement. As part of that settlement, every state released the tobacco companies from federal Medicaid liability, as well as state Medicaid liability. Medicaid expenditures heavily influenced the distribution formula used to divide the national settlement amongst the states. In light of these undeniable facts, the dollars obtained by the states from their settlements cannot now be divorced from Medicaid. States are free to use the state share of their recoveries in any way they choose. However, Congress has a vital interest in how the federal share will be used. 
   My legislation would require states to use half of the amount of money they receive from the tobacco industry each year (the federal share) to protect children and improve public health. At least thirty-five percent of the federal share would be spent on programs to deter youth smoking and to help smokers overcome their addiction. This would include a broad range of tobacco control initiatives, including school and community based tobacco use prevention programs, counter-advertising to discourage smoking, cessation programs, and enforcement of the ban on sale to minors. Three thousand children start smoking every day, and one thousand of them will die prematurely as a result of tobacco-induced disease. Prevention of youth smoking should be, without question, our highest priority for the use of these funds. The state settlements provide the resources to dissuade millions of teenagers from smoking, to break the cycle of addiction and early death. We must seize that opportunity. 
   The remainder of the federal share would be available for states to use to fund health care and early learning initiatives which they select. States can either use the additional resources to supplement existing programs in these  areas, or to fund creative new state initiatives to improve public health and promote child development. 
   Smoking has long been America's foremost preventable cause of disease and early death. It has consumed an enormous amount of the nation's health care resources. Finally, resources taken from the tobacco companies would be used to improve the nation's health. A state could, for example, use a portion of this money to help senior citizens pay for prescription drugs, or to provide expanded health care services to the uninsured. Funds could be used to support community health centers, to reduce public health risks, or to make health insurance more affordable. 
   For years, the tobacco companies callously targeted children as future smokers. The financial success of the entire industry was based upon addicting kids when they were too young to appreciate the health risks of smoking. It is particularly appropriate that resources taken from this malignant industry be used to give our children a better start in life. States could use a portion of these funds to improve early learning opportunities for young children, or to expand child care services, or for other child development initiatives. 
   Congress has a compelling interest in how the federal share of these dollars is used. They are Medicaid dollars. They should not be used for road repair or building maintenance. They should be used by the states to create a healthier future for all our citizens, and particularly for our children.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I want to take just a moment of the Senate's time to share with our family in the Senate a rather sad occasion that has taken place. Last evening, at about 7:15, after we had recessed, I had a call from our friend and colleague from the State of Washington, Senator MURRAY, the principal proponent of our smaller class size amendment, who told me that her father-in-law had passed away yesterday. She had been on the floor all day. She returned after a very full day here on the floor leading us in this discussion on the question of smaller class size to learn that her father-in-law, Albert Murray, at the age of 80, had passed on. He had been a small business man for many years. He lived in Seattle and was very much involved in the community in a range of different activities to ensure that that  community was going to be a better community. 
   The Murray family is a very close-knit family. They are an extended family. I had the opportunity to meet many of them at the time Senator MURRAY was initially sworn in here to the U.S. Senate. 
   She left last evening to return to the State of Washington to be with members of the family. I know all of us send our thoughts and prayers to Senator MURRAY, her husband Rob, and the entire Murray family. We are thinking about her and are mindful of her loss. 
   Mr. President, I yield myself such time that I might use.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today we will vote again on whether to end this debate on education--prematurely, I believe--or do our part to help communities meet critical educational needs. After a very limited 2-day debate on education last week, the majority leader filed cloture to end debate on the bill. The next day he filed the same cloture motion to force a second vote on whether to end the debate. The first cloture motion was defeated yesterday; the second cloture motion will be defeated today. I believe we should stop playing procedural games and vote on amendments that are critical to communities across the Nation. 
   Republican intentions are clear. They do not want a debate on education. They do not want a vote on the critical educational issues facing the Nation's communities: reducing class size, recruiting more teachers, expanding afterschool programs, bringing technology into the classroom, reducing dropout rates, modernizing school buildings. And there is a shared responsibility in all of these areas between the local communities, the States, and the Federal government as well. Parents and communities have a central concern about ensuring that their children are going to be adequately trained as they move towards the new century. 
   We have an opportunity to do something about it, and we have, as we have demonstrated over the course of this debate, compelling evidence that each of these particular programs can really make a difference in children's achievement and growth, scholastically, in their local communities. No bill on the Senate calendar right now concerns more important issues than education. 
   These issues are important and timely. We start off this session with a very thin calendar. We have the time and we have the ability, as we have said on a number of different occasions. Under the leadership of Senator DASCHLE on this side of the aisle, we are prepared to agree to a small number of amendments with strict time limits that could ensure a speedy conclusion to those amendments, even, probably, during the day today. We can all work together to reach a bipartisan consensus on education now, because the Nation's schools and children cannot. 
   Some Republicans insist that they won't agree now to any amendments which affect the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, but that position is untenable. The pending Ed-Flex bill directly affects the largest ESEA program, title I. It also affects a number of the other programs included in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act--the Education Technology, the Eisenhower Professional Development, and the Safe and Drug Free Schools programs. Yet we are now considering Ed-Flex long before it is ready for action. 
   We should also be able to consider other vital education issues, too. Ed-Flex is a good idea, because it gives States more flexibility in implementing Federal programs. It makes them accountable for how well Federal aid is used to improve the schools. It goes back to the initiative of our good friend from the State of Oregon, Senator Hatfield. I joined him in offering the initial Ed-Flex in 1994. I offered it as an amendment to Goals 2000, to permit another group of States to do so. I know this program. I support this program. 
   We have strong support for the Ed-Flex concept on this side of the aisle as well as the other side of the aisle. We want to make sure, when we provide scarce resources, that the local communities, when they get the scarce resources, are able to show how the changes in the education programs will enhance student achievement. That is what we are interested in. Families are interested, local communities are, States are; we should be as well. We are trying to give the assurance to families across the country that accountability would be a part of Ed-Flex. 
   Ed-Flex, as I mentioned, is a good idea, but flexibility and accountability mean little if we do not give communities the support they need to implement school reform strategies that work. If you take the time to read the General Accounting Office review of Ed-Flex, what springs out at you is what the GAO report stated was the greatest desire for the local communities. What they asked for was additional funding for education programs. That makes sense. Second, they wanted to know if there were other opportunities to enhance academic achievement. Third, they were looking for help and assistance in how to run their schools more efficiently and effectively. 
   Those are pretty reasonable ideas and ones that I think all of us can understand. That is what they were looking for, and we are attempting to try to assist with these other ideas that different Members have talked about over the period of the past few days to try to help the local communities. 
   Last year, with broad bipartisan support, the Congress made a substantial investment in improving the Nation's public schools. We increased funding for IDEA by $500 million. We increased funding for afterschool programs by $160 million. We increased funding for title I by $300 million. And we made a $1.2 billion investment in reducing class size in the early grades. Those were done with bipartisan support, including the commitment to reduce class size, the amendment that Senator MURRAY has championed in the Senate not only this year but last year as well. 
   Much more remains to be done. Good ideas to improve education deserve our strong support. We need to do more to help communities hire additional teachers and reduce class size. We need to support State efforts to raise academic standards and support communities and teachers who are helping children meet those standards. We need to modernize school buildings and repair crumbling facilities. We had the GAO report which estimated it will cost $120 billion just to bring classrooms across this country up to standards. Many communities in urban and in rural areas just cannot afford to take on that particular challenge themselves. We have ideas about how we can assist local communities, not with a handout, but to help them ease the kinds of financial pressures on that local community in order to bring their school buildings and classrooms up to speed. 
   That is a very important concept, partly because without doing so it is more difficult for the children to learn. We find even in 
   the city of Boston that when the temperature goes down to 15 to 20 degrees, 15 schools close down because their heating systems are not adequate. Automatically, 15 schools close down. There is an effort being made in the local community--the greatest increase in a school budget in terms of education, I think, of any major urban area in the country--but still it is taking time. 
   We can help in this area. It is not only important in terms of the physical facility, it is important in the message we send to the children. Every parent, when they see their child go off in the morning, is talking to that child about paying attention during the course of the day, working hard, doing his or her homework, getting extra help and assistance if it is needed. Every parent is to instill in them the value and the importance of education. But if the child walks into a classroom and it is dilapidated and not functioning or does not have an electronic system to hook up the various new kinds of technology, we are sending a very powerful, very simple message to those children. The parents may be talking about the value and importance of education, but we, as a society, are not prepared to put the resources into it to ensure that those children will go to a first-rate school. That is the message, and that is powerful.  
   That is happening every single day in communities all across this country--certainly in many of the older communities and in many of the poorer rural communities across this country--where we do not have the kind of facilities that all of us would hope we might have for the children of this country. It is a very important message, and we are attempting to do something about it. We are not going to answer the whole problem, but we are going to offer a helping hand for local communities. Trying to provide some help and assistance in terms of school construction makes a good deal of sense. 
   Much more remains to be done. Good ideas to improve education deserve our strong support. We need to do more to help communities hire additional teachers, reduce class size, support State efforts to raise academic standards, and support communities and teachers who are helping children to meet those standards. 
   We talk about content standards. An increasing number of States have adopted content or performance standards. That is very important, so that parents will know what their children are learning and how they are doing. We need to end social promotion, but, when we do that, we are going to make sure there will be the kinds of support facilities out there for children who have not been able to keep up, to keep them from falling further behind. 
   We have different examples of where that is taking place--in Chicago, where children who are falling behind are getting extra assistance during the schoolday, or even after school, or over the course of the weekend, or during vacations, or during the summer--maintaining high standards for children, but also trying to get assistance for those children who need it. It makes sense. That is what we are trying to bring attention to. 
   We need to modernize the buildings, as I mentioned. We need to expand the afterschool programs--for the 7 or 8 million children between the ages of 8 or 9 and 14 who go home in the afternoon to empty houses, who may spend their time watching television, if the parents are fortunate, or otherwise involved in antisocial behavior, if they are not--to try to develop programs that are going to work with the schools or with nonprofits. 
   We have different ways of approaching this, modest amounts of resources in the President's budget to try to do so. We can encourage those children to be involved in afterschool programs, to enhance their academic ability and achievement and perhaps give those children a chance to spend some quality time with their parents. Rather than the parents coming home, finding the child has been watching television, and saying, ``Go up to your room to do your homework,'' parents can provide the kind of climate and atmosphere which is going to be profamily. 
   This is a profamily issue, Mr. President. We have seen the amount of success that it has. Last year, when we had $40 million in afterschool programs, we had $500 million in applications. That is from the local communities. What we are doing now is trying to build that up to cover more than a million children, and that will send a ripple all across this country to develop after school programs. We do not intend to do all that is required in terms of after school, but we can demonstrate, by the success of these programs, how they have impacted children and families to build the kind of local support for the enhanced programs.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator is absolutely correct. Perhaps the Senator wants to put in the RECORD the excellent letter that has been sent to all of us from some 450 police chiefs, sheriffs, prosecutors, and leaders of police organizations in strong support of your amendment for the after school program. It reviews what has been happening in local communities to demonstrate their reasons for their strong support. Just as the Senator has mentioned, it has had an important and significant positive impact on reducing juvenile crime. 
   I can tell you in Boston, MA, we went 2 1/2 years without a youth homicide--virtually unheard of for any major city of this country. And if you talk to Paul Evans, who is our police chief up there, the first thing he will talk to you about are the after school programs. He will talk about other programs in terms of trying to penetrate gangs, and he will talk about working with teachers and social service offices in terms of identifying the real trouble makers, and a variety of different other efforts, but he will lead off his list with the after school programs. It is just as the Senator has stated. This has an important, positive impact in reducing juvenile crime. 
   We are talking about preventing antisocial behavior, whether it is in terms of crime, or more dangerous kinds of activity, namely juvenile violence. This is very important.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I say to the Senator, let me respond in this way. I had placed in the RECORD the statement by our majority leader at the National Governors' Conference just at the end of February where he said:  
   Now when we bring the education issues to the floor ..... there will be some amendments and some disagreements, but--and the leadership meeting that we had yesterday afternoon, I said, ``That's great. Let's go to the Senate floor, let's take days, let's take a week, let's take two weeks if it's necessary. Let's talk about education.''  
   Here we had effectively, on Friday afternoon of last week, debate, but because of parliamentary means the opportunity for amending the legislation was closed out. Yesterday--yesterday --as the Senator might have heard, we could not call off quorum calls in order to amend the bill or to bring up an amendment. We were effectively told that unless it was cleared it with the majority, they were not going to permit amendments to be offered. Fortunately, we were at least able to find a way to try and get a vote on the Murray amendment, which we will vote on tomorrow. 
   Then we were, of course, absolutely mystified as to why the leadership included in the Ed-Flex this very complex bank reform legislation that has absolutely nothing to do with education--absolutely nothing. They added that and refused to permit an orderly process of consideration of amendments on which, as the Senator from California and others have pointed out, we would be willing to enter into a reasonable time limit. 
   The Senator from New Mexico, Senator BINGAMAN, has an amendment that has been passed with strong Republican support in the past. He indicated he would be willing to have one-half hour of debate, 15 minutes to a side. Other Senators have been willing to do so as well. Senator MURRAY was willing to do so, so we could move this process along, not that we should not have at least a fair opportunity to permit some of our colleagues to be able to express their own views, both for and against. But the Senator is quite right. We are effectively being told that even though the legislation is technically before the Senate, that we are closed out from having the opportunity to offer amendments and have the Senate dispose of those amendments, and that is obviously troublesome. 
   It works, as the Senator knows, in a strange way. We have had a deadlock for these past days, but there is nothing that is going to preclude Senator MURRAY from offering her amendment on some other piece of legislation. That is what, evidently, some of our people here must understand--that you just cannot do it at this place in the Senate calendar. You might be able to squeeze it out in the last few days of a session, but you cannot do it at this time. 
   We are going to see these amendments at one time or other, and I imagine earlier rather than later. So it has always seemed to me to make the most sense to do it in a responsible way, and that is in debating this with an underlying amendment on education rather than trying to work the process to have an amendment on a different item.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Senator, if I might just raise some conclusions that have been reached by this independent evaluation of title I that is directly relevant to the issue which the Senator wanted to address. This is the final report of ``National Assessment'' of title I. It just came out last week. In the summary, it points out: ``Recent research on effective schools has found that using extended time learning in reading and mathematics''--this is the afterschool model; not all afterschool models, but many of the afterschool models. More so, now, I think, as a result of this excellent report. 
   And it talks about the recent study of schools in Maryland:  
   Researchers found that the most successful schools were seeing constant academic gains as a result of the extended day programs.  
   This is just what the Senator is talking about. This is the ``National Assessment.'' 
   I mentioned before, there is $500 million in requests. We have an important increase in the President's budget paid for. The Senator is just trying to get the authorization so the communities will know this program is alive and well and going to be continued over the period of time. That could be done in a very short order. 
   If there are those here opposed to it, why not express your views and then vote in opposition to it? Effectively, the good Senator is being denied at least any opportunity to be able to advance that--advance it, let the Senate finally vote on it--being denied that in spite of the fact that in this excellent review about what has been successful and what has not been, this is right on point to the Senator's initiative, and that, I 
   think, is one of the reasons we are very frustrated. 
   We take a Banking Committee bill. Here we are on education. The timing was set by the majority leader and the majority. They are the ones who set the agenda. They are the ones who called up this bill. 
   Now we find out they are effectively foreclosing or have foreclosed. We are still hopeful that the Senator would be able to offer the amendment. 
   While the Senator is here, I just mention the kind of support we have on the class size amendment. We will have an opportunity to vote on that cloture tomorrow. Various groups have supported that, including the National Parent Teacher Association, the National School Boards Association, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Council of Chief State School Officers, the American Association of School Administrators, the Council of Great City Schools, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of State Directors of Special Education. 
   That is interesting, special education; we heard a great deal about the importance of special education. Here is the association that is the primary spokesman for special education, and they are talking about the importance of this, and for very good reason. We have to fund both--that is our position--the IDEA and also this program for having smaller class sizes and having a well-trained teacher in every classroom. When we have the teacher quality, the well-trained teacher, they can identify early in their development the children who are going to have the special needs. If they are spending time with them in reading, they can find out whether that child needs the other kind of attention. Then you can locate and identify these needs much earlier, and we also can find out if they can provide that help and assistance to them, for example, in literacy. It may very well reduce or eliminate the need for special education. 
   There is support from this association in terms of school construction. They find out that the children with disabilities will benefit from buildings with appropriate physical access to buildings, buildings that are well equipped to handle modern technologies which so many with disabilities need to get a good education. And they find out that the afterschool programs, including Children With Disabilities, Stay Off the Street, Out of Trouble, help them get the academic help they need and desire. 
   That is what we are saying. Help all the children. We are also helping those with special needs. We are committed to trying to get additional funding in the area of special needs. 
   I remind our colleagues that under the constitutions of the States, the States have the responsibility for educating every child. We set as a goal that we would pick up 40 percent. I am strongly committed toward doing so. We will have an opportunity before too long to offer amendments to move us in that direction. We hope we will get as much support on that issue when we offer those amendments as we have had in terms of an opposition to trying to do the kind of things that the Senator from California has identified.

   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator makes a good point. Not that that is always the best practice, but certainly in this case it is. Secondly, for example, child care programs in the military versus non-military programs, are quantitatively better because, very interestingly, the amendment that we adopted for child care for the military was actually the one that came out of our Labor and Human Resources Committee and had protections and guarantees in terms of quality and training for the personnel who are going to work with those children. 
   When we had it on the floor of the Senate, it was effectively undermined, in terms of those protections, in an attempt to get it passed. 
   Now they will go on out and ask, ``Why are the military ones better?'' It is very plain and simple. You can look at the history of the support of those programs here. At the time they called the roll, 94 to 6 we were prepared to give protections, because it was an add-on for the protection of the military--94 to 6. I remember it very clearly, because I offered the amendment. 
   When Senator DODD, who is a real leader in these children's programs, battled to develop programs for needy working families on this, it was significantly undermined. 
   The military understands smaller class sizes, as they do child care, and they are moving in that direction because they are able to do so.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in just half an hour the Senate will vote on the second cloture motion to terminate debate on the Ed-Flex bill, and then tomorrow we will have two more cloture votes. It is our position that these cloture votes are completely unnecessary--what we would like to be doing here this afternoon and in the course of tomorrow is voting on education policy. 
   We were given assurances by the majority leader at the annual National Governors Association Conference that we would have the debate for 1 or 2 weeks. Now the minority leader has proposed limiting our side to just five different amendments, and we would be glad to have a number of amendments on the other side. We are glad to enter into time limits. There is no reason we cannot end the whole education debate tomorrow. 
   We have no assurance--none--from the majority leader, none from the chairman of the Health and Education Committee, that we will have another vehicle before the end of this year to debate education. This may very well be the only opportunity that we have. Why not have a reasonable time to debate and discuss the issues that are before the Senate in education, primarily the issue of class size reduction from grades K to 3, which is enormously important and very successful in terms of enhancing student performance. What about the afterschool programs? What about enhancing the effort to terminate school dropouts? The range of different, important policy issues--all we want to be able to do is debate them. We are being denied that by the majority. 
   That is part of our frustration. We believe the discussion on education is one of the most important debates that we will have. We are here, ready to debate. We were here last week on Friday and were closed out. We were here on Monday and are here Tuesday and continue to be closed out from being able to consider these amendments. That is the wrong policy. 
   Parents do not understand why we cannot debate it. Various organizations representing teachers, parents, school boards, and local communities are all pleading to the U.S. Senate to go ahead and have the debate on these issues. 
   There is widespread approval for continuing Federal support for reducing class size nationwide. This initiative is supported by the National Parent Teacher Association, the National School Boards Association, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Council of Chief State School Officers, the American Association of School Administrators, the Council of Great City Schools, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the National Association of State Directors of Special Education, the National Education Association, the International Reading Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the National Association of School Psychologists. 
   These groups are all saying please, go ahead with this debate. Go ahead and have the votes on these matters. We will abide by whatever the Senate does, but do not close us out. 
   Mr. President, that is what is happening here this afternoon. I hope we will not have the cloture vote to close it out. I am still hopeful somehow at this late hour we will be able to work out a process so we can consider the educational amendments which families all over this country want us to consider. 
   I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, next week, on March 17th, St. Patrick's Day, one of Revere, Massachusetts' finest sons, Charles Paone, will celebrate his 90th birthday. Charlie, as he is known by his many friends, has spent most of his life in his hometown of Revere. He graduated from Immaculate Conception High School in 1927, and went on to Georgetown University, graduating in 1931. After college, Charlie returned to Massachusetts and attended Boston College Law School, receiving his law degree from that outstanding college in 1935. 
   Charlie was inducted into the Army in 1942, where he served with distinction in the 209th Counter Intelligence Corps. He's been a member of the American Legion for more than 50 years, and he's been very active in his post. He has also been a member of the Knights of Columbus for more than 60 years, and is a past Grand Knight. In 1981 he retired from the Revere Public School System after four decades of outstanding service. 
   Charlie is loved by his family and friends as a wonderful role model who is always willing to go the extra mile for those in need, whether it's helping someone with their taxes or providing a ride to the local store for groceries. And, of course, all of us in the Senate know Charlie's nephew Marty, who does an excellent job as our Secretary for the Minority. 
   In many ways, our country is great today because of Americans like Charlie of the World War II generation. They served their country far above and beyond the call of duty in the war, and they came back from the war to rebuild the nation on the home front and make America the great country it is today. Tom Brokaw, in his current number one best-seller, calls them ``The Greatest Generation,'' and it's leaders like Charlie that he's writing about. 
   It's a privilege to join Charlie's family and friends in wishing him a very happy 90th birthday and a very happy St. Patrick's Day, and to commend him for all that he has done for his family, his friends, his community, and our country.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I am sure that many Members of the Senate, and certainly Americans who have been watching the Senate for the past few days, must have a question on their minds about what is going on in the U.S. Senate. For many of us who have been here for some period of time, it is becoming painfully clear what is going on. Our good friends on the other side look up to 
   the Parliamentarian and ask, ``There is no opportunity for them to offer an amendment at all, is there?'' and after they get their assurance, then they permit this side to speak. If you agree with them, you get a chance to speak, and they don't object to calling off the quorum; but if you don't agree with them, then you don't get a chance to speak. 
   This is the new U.S. Senate. I guess this must be part of the attitude we all heard about after the impeachment--that we were going to try and work things out in a way of comity and understanding, and we are going to have give-and-take on both sides. We were denied an opportunity to debate this issue or offer amendments last Friday when we wanted to, and we were denied  the opportunity to offer amendments here today. There are evidently objections to the consideration of the Murray amendment, even though the majority and the chairman of the committee were quite prepared to tag amendments on to this Ed-Flex legislation, which is of so much importance to local districts. I supported this legislation, but it doesn't really compare in importance to the Murray amendment which will result in the reductions of class size. 
   We saw the acceptance of a far-reaching banking amendment, and I doubt very much whether there are five Members in the U.S. Senate that would be able to explain it. And then the majority talks to us about not trying to clutter up this legislation with amendments, like the Murray amendment to reduce class size, whose only purpose is to continue the commitment made last year which the Republicans signed on for and took credit, to make sure this commitment was going to continue for the next 6 years, but we have been denied the opportunity to bring it to the floor. But we have accepted a banking amendment of enormous significance and importance and there isn't a complaint over here, not a complaint over here. 
   So now we have a prohibition on offering amendments from 3 o'clock to 5 o'clock. It is neatly timed to divide the time up so that we can talk about this. I dare say when the majority leader comes over here, we will have the same kind of situation tomorrow, the same situation since he has filed the cloture motion. We will have the explanation, ``Look, we have been on education for a number of days now and it is time we resolve it.'' 
   Madam President, maybe that explanation satisfies some Americans. But it defies logic, Madam President, if we are prepared to try to debate and discuss these matters, why we don't let the Senate make a judgment on it. 
   I listened to my friend talk about the amendment. Last year, the amendment that was accepted on teachers was drafted in a back room. As I remember, the good Senator from Vermont was in that back room at that time. I didn't hear him complaining at that time about being in the back room. When the chairman of the House committee, Congressman GOODLING, went out there to announce this, he was quite prepared to take very considerable credit for what had been done in terms of expanding the classrooms. He went out and stated at that time:  
   This is a real victory for the Republican Congress, but more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators and parents who are fed up with Washington mandates, redtape and regulation.  
   That is what the chairman of the House committee said on this.

   Mr. KENNEDY. We will let the record stand and let the people figure it out. 
   The point is, Madam President, what we have tried to do with this Ed-Flex legislation, which some Democratic Governors and Republican Governors desire, is to create greater flexibility, while at the same time insisting that we are going to have some accountability--those issues have not been completely resolved--and to ensure that Federal funding that was going to be available was going to be targeted to the neediest students. We all want to make sure that we are going to be able to judge the Ed-Flex by how the students' achievement and accomplishment actually are enhanced over a period of time. 
   There is another amendment by the Senator from Rhode Island, who wants to ensure that parental involvement in these decisions will be considered. That has not been accepted. We certainly hope that will be included, because every single study that has been made with regard to the importance of early education shows the importance and significance of parental involvement. 
   So we still have to resolve those issues. As our majority leader pointed out when he addressed the Governors two weeks ago, we would get a chance to debate the issue of education. This is what our Majority Leader LOTT, who spoke to the National Governors' Association, said:  
   Now, when we bring up the education issues on the floor next week, there will be some amendments and some disagreements. But at the leadership meeting we had yesterday afternoon, I said, ``That's great. Let's go to the Senate floor, let's take days, let's take a week, let's take 2 weeks if it's necessary, let's talk about education.''  
   What happened, Madam President? What happened to that kind of commitment that was made to the Governors? What happened to the opportunity to be able to address the issue of class size and to be able to vote on it? What happened in the last two weeks which has denied the Senator from Washington the opportunity to offer her amendment last Friday and denied the opportunity to offer it today? I daresay she will be denied the opportunity to offer it tomorrow. 
   What happened here, Madam President? 
   What is more important to the families of this country than the issues of education? What is more important than having a good debate on issues such as classroom size? What is more important than considering other issues that our colleagues wanted to bring up for Senate consideration, such as the afterschool programs to try to assist children that too often are finding themselves in trouble or spending too much time watching the television in the afternoon? What is wrong with an amendment to expand that program? Let's hear the arguments and have a vote here. Let's have a short time limit. The Senator from Washington had indicated that she would be willing to enter into a time agreement. We don't need to have a cloture vote tomorrow. We could vote on the Senator's amendment late this afternoon, if that is the desire. I bet the membership would stay here during the evening, if that was the desire and others wanted to speak on it because of its importance to people in communities all across this country--parents, children and schoolteachers. We can do that. 
   We can reach a time agreement, as our minority leader said, on the floor of the U.S. Senate, for five or six amendments with time limitations. We could wind this whole debate up by tomorrow. But, no. Are we sure we can't have any amendments this afternoon? Yes, the Senate can be assured that it is not possible for any Member of the U.S. Senate this afternoon to offer an amendment. Fine. Then you can go ahead and speak. 
   That is known as a gag rule, Madam President. We had that kind of problem at the end of the last session. We had the gag rule on minimum wage. We had the gag rule on the Patients' Bill of Rights. And now we start off this Congress and we have a gag rule on education. If the majority agrees with you, you can bring up your amendment. But if you have an amendment like Senator BINGAMAN and Senator REID on school dropouts, where we had a very substantial number of Republicans who supported that, absolutely not. Absolutely not. 
   The amount of time spent in quorum calls last week when they brought up this simple amendment that had been debated and discussed and accepted and dropped in conference last year is beyond belief. We had a small number of amendments that could have been worked out. All of us understand that there is a program and a schedule, and Senator DASCHLE spoke for all of us on our side to try to reduce any number of amendments, and to try to get a time limitation and to move on. But that continues to be denied. 
   ``Not as long as school class size is one of the amendments,'' they say. Isn't that wonderful? No agreement as long as school class size is an issue. What is this terrible issue about school  class size that they won't even permit Republicans or Democrats to vote on? 
   I see my colleague, the author of this amendment. I am glad to yield to the Senator from Washington and withhold the remainder of the time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I want to just take a few moments at this time, because we have others who would like to speak, to say that I am somewhat perplexed at some of the arguments that have been made here this afternoon about the importance of local control and the role of the States in terms of education, because just last fall, in October, we gave assurance to the States that there would be help and assistance toward making the classrooms smaller. We gave them those assurances. Communities all across the country were depending on them. 
   Now we have an amendment on the floor that effectively wipes out that commitment. So not only do local school districts not know how to plan for the future, but they don't even know now--even with the assurance they have gotten from HEW--about what funds would come into local communities and whether they would have the resources to be able to plan for the fall. If that makes a great deal of sense, it makes a great deal of sense to others, not to me. 
   Now, Madam President, I will include in the RECORD what we have done over the past several years on increasing funding in education. We have seen that, since 1995, we have made a bipartisan commitment to increase IDEA funding by $2 billion. That has been very worthwhile. Many of our Republican friends initiated that. I am glad to support it. It made sense and it continues to make sense. We also had a bipartisan commitment to help the neediest children in America by increasing Title I funding by one billion dollars. We have initiated bipartisan commitments for the funding of afterschool programs and education technology by about $700 million. Since 1995, we have expanded opportunities for qualified students to go to college. And last year, we made a 1-year downpayment on a bipartisan commitment to reducing class size across the country over 7 years. 
   We reject the idea of pitting children against children. I listened to the eloquence of my friend from New Hampshire, talking about how we wanted one group of children to benefit at the expense of other children. Let me just mention that I am strongly committed toward enhancing the resources available to the IDEA, just as I am for supporting the Murray amendment. Improving teacher quality, having well-trained teachers, can identify children with special needs early and better address their needs. They can also better teach all children. If you are talking about special needs children, improving the teacher quality and getting well-trained teachers helps us to meet that responsibility. 
   Reducing class size, as the Murray amendment provides for, would help all children--all children--including children with disabilities. They would get more individual attention, which they need. Modernizing the school buildings--school construction--would offer support and help for all children, including those with disabilities and give them access to safe and modern schools. Children with disabilities would benefit from having buildings with appropriate access to school facilities and buildings equipped to handle modern technologies. Expanding the afterschool programs would help all children, including those with disabilities, stay off the street and out of trouble and help them get extra academic help. The Reading Excellence Act will help all children read well early. It will help teachers address reading difficulties early and possibly eliminate the need for costly special  education later. All of these initiatives would help all children, including children with disabilities, get better educations. 
   We are committed to all of these factors, to try to help children all across the country. So we welcome the opportunity to work with the Senator from New Hampshire, or any others, to see expanded resources for IDEA. It is essential and important. But we don't want to penalize some children to benefit others. Let's make a commitment that we move all the children along together. 
   I withhold the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement of the majority leader on the issue that is before us, the Ed-Flex legislation. If you look back over the history, it was officially initiated by an amendment by the Senator from Oregon, Senator Hatfield, and myself. It was initially provided that six States were going to have the power of waiver, and then when we considered the Goals 2000 we added six more States. 
   So many of us on this side are very familiar with the legislation, are very familiar with the record that has been made, and are in support of the kind of accountability that the majority leader has stated. We are eager to see this legislation move towards completion. But we want to point out too, as the majority leader knows, that the underlying legislation may very well be the major opportunity for debate on education this year. Because the Elementary/Secondary Education Act does not expire until next year, it may very well not be up at that time. 
   We will have a chance to express a sense of the Senate on the budget items. We will look forward to debating appropriations. That is generally the last piece of legislation that comes here in October. But this may very well be the only serious debate on education for the whole year. That is why, given the fact that there is not an extensive or busy calendar, given the importance of the issue--education--to families all over the country, and given the timeliness of the particular issue--the Murray amendment in terms of giving assurances to local communities all across the country--it is imperative that we have an opportunity for the Senate to address this issue in a brief way. Senator MURRAY has indicated her willingness to enter into a reasonable time limit to move toward a disposition of that legislation and that particular amendment. 
   I just finally remind our colleagues that our leader, Senator DASCHLE, had indicated that he would urge short time limits on as few as five or six amendments. I would think that Senator DASCHLE might even be able to get  a reduction to maybe even four amendments, even though there are many Members here who have plans and believe they are important. We could dispose of all of this in the period of a day, if not a day and a half. 
   It seems to me that it is not unreasonable to say that on this issue which is of central importance and significance to families all across this country--the issue over partnership, the Federal Government working with the States and local communities--that we address the issue of class size, and we also address the very important issue of the funding of the IDEA. 
   I think we can find very, very broad support for making sure that local communities are going to have the funding for IDEA, but I also think if put to a vote we would have a strong majority of Republicans and Democrats in favor of giving the communities across this country some help and assistance in terms of class size. That is something that every parent understands. It is something every teacher understands and every student understands. 
   No one makes that case better than the former school board member and former teacher herself, Senator MURRAY. I welcome the chance to hear her on this issue.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KENNEDY. The Senator reminds us that in the final days of the last Congress, we passed legislation that would provide local communities the opportunity to hire additional teachers so we could have smaller class sizes for the first three grades. That was worked out in a bipartisan way. As I understand, from what the Senator says, the school boards are meeting now to find out whether this was just going to be something that would be for 1 year or whether it is going to be continual? The President has indicated strong support to continue it, recognizing that we need some 2 million new teachers over the period of 10 years. He wanted to really jump-start that whole process, and do it particularly in the early grades, which all the research indicates has such enormous potential for enhancing student achievement. 
   I was wondering whether the Senator realized that last October, when we made this agreement for the 1 year--the 1-year agreement--Congressman GOODLING, who is chairman of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, a Republican, declared:  
   The class size reduction was a real victory for the Republican Congress. But more importantly, it is a huge win for local educators, parents who were fed up with Washington mandates, redtape and regulation. We agree with the President's desire to help classroom teachers, but our proposal does not create the big new Federal education programs.  
   So Congressman GOODLING, the Republican chairman of the Committee at the time, was taking credit for a Republican victory. We considered it a victory as well. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans, and the people who were going to benefit were the children, so all of those who were involved at that particular time claimed it as a victory. 
   Now, the good Senator's amendment takes that concept, which the Senator had championed all last year, and extends it so the local families, school boards, principals, schoolteachers, and children will know there will be a continuation in the employment of those teachers over the period of the next 5 years, so that we can make some meaningful progress in reducing the class size. 
   Is that correct?

   Mr. KENNEDY. If the Senator will yield, then, for a final question? The Senator is the principal sponsor of this legislation and the one who was instrumental in achieving its outcome in the fall of last year, with bipartisan support and the support of the chairman of the House committee, Congressman GOODLING. As I understand it, therefore, the Senator is prepared to at least urge others to withhold further education amendments and support what Senator DASCHLE has said? There may be just a few amendments, but that the Senator's would certainly be one of the important ones because of the importance of the timing for local school districts, and that my colleague would agree to a reasonable time period?

You would certainly support an initiative by the leaders, even from our side--maybe there are some on the other side--to move towards a very few amendments--I think the leader said five or six--and do it with a time limit so that we can move along with the Senate schedule.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I intend to support this amendment. Now that we have the time to get to the crux of education policy, I welcome this opportunity. The manager of the bill has now advanced this issue in terms of the debate and discussion, and I hope we will move beyond the question of whether we are just going to deal with Ed-Flex, because the manager himself has offered this particular amendment. 
   Mr. President, I joined with those back in 1975 to make a commitment in terms of trying to address the problems of supporting those children in our schools that have special needs. Four million disabled children did not receive the help that they need to be successful in schools. Few disabled preschoolers receive services. One million disabled children were excluded from public schools. Children in this country, prior to the 1975 Act, were basically shunted aside in institutions and did not participate in the education system of this country. 
   In 1975 we passed legislation to provide help and assistance. We set in the 1975 Act the level of a 40-percent goal for funding to help and assist the local communities. I daresay I had thought we might have the opportunity in the wake of the Garrett decision yesterday to have an opportunity to debate and discuss how we were going to be able to help and assist a number of local communities now that will have to provide additional help and assistance to the special needs children. That ought to be a matter of priority. That ought to be a matter of debate. It ought to be a matter of allocating resources to help and assist local communities. 
   In many instances, we are finding across America that the needs of special needs children are being placed against the needs of educating the broader constituency, so we are pitting children against children. What we ought to try and do is deal with both of these particular issues. I am for allocations of resources that move us closer and closer to the level of some 40 percent, which was set as a goal for us in the 1975 Act. 
   Let us not lose the fact that under the constitution of every State there is a commitment to educate children in their States. Sometimes they forget this, but they have a solemn responsibility. I don't know a single State  that doesn't have that particular requirement. This is going to be something that we will have to work out with the various States and we will have to work this out with the local communities, but if the Senator from Vermont and the Senator from New Hampshire and others want to say they want to find additional resources in meeting the needs of special children, put me on that particular piece of legislation, too, because I am all for it. I am all for it--not at the expense of these other children. No serious educator would put it at the expense of other children. 
   If we have better trained teachers in smaller classrooms, we will identify more easily those children that have special needs. If we have smaller class size, we will know which child needs the special attention. If we have better trained teachers, the better trained teachers will understand which of the children should be involved in special need programs and which should not. With achievement in reading programs and literacy programs, we may very well help children at the early ages not be qualified in terms of special needs, because they will be advanced and their academic achievement may very well be enhanced. 
   If we do the kind of things that the Senator from Ohio just pointed out, more and more targeted resources in terms of the children in terms of Head Start will be enormously important. We reauthorized Head Start last year. We expanded the Early Start children up to 12.5 percent in that Head Start program, but we are still not doing enough. The Senator from Ohio points out that it is an admirable effort. In the State of Ohio they have gone ahead, evidently, and provided the difference between what is provided by the Federal Government and funds provided by the State in order to make sure that every child who is eligible in Ohio is going to qualify for Head Start. We are only reaching about 40 percent of the children across the country. By that early type of intervention, we will find out what can be done in terms of special needs children. 
   The bottom line is every educator knows if you have a smaller class size, better trained teachers involved in afterschool programs--all of these help and assist both to make the total numbers of children that might need the kind of special needs less; and, second, to identify those that truly need that help and assistance. 
   So there may be those that want to try and pit the special needs children against other children, but I hope that would not be what the U.S. Senate is about. Parents understand this; schoolteachers understand it. What we are basically understanding is that is the proper way to go. 
   We can understand a legitimate effort to try and address the question of the school dropouts, which is a very important and significant national need, a modest amendment that had been considered by the Senate, passed overwhelmingly with bipartisan support last year. This isn't something new. The amendment of the Senators from New Mexico and Nevada, quite frankly, have more legitimacy to be considered on the floor of the U.S. Senate than the Ed-Flex bill, because we have already considered and passed it. Even so, it is fine if we put that on. It certainly will help strengthen the Ed-Flex bill. 
   However, now we have the parliamentary games to try, instead of permitting a thoughtful legitimate amendment that has been considered to be debated and finally voted on, to effectively try to emasculate that amendment with the second degree. I want to give assurances to those on that side that we understand; we have been here a certain period of time as well. We are glad to spend as much time as our friends and colleagues want in debating education. The longer the better. But we are going to make sure that we are going to have a vote up and down on their amendment. This bill will not pass without a vote up and down. We can do it either nicely or whatever way they want to do it. We have that opportunity. We have that right to do it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I listened to our friend and colleague from New Hampshire speak about the education budget and about the expenditures in the areas of education. I just want to review here, in this time, for a few moments, exactly what has been the record of our Republican friends in the House and Senate, and the administration, over the period since 1994 when the Republicans took over the leadership in the Congress. 
   After 1994, on March 16, 1995, one of the first acts of the new Republican House of Representatives was to ask for a $1.7 billion rescission on all education programs below what was enacted in the appropriations the year before. That is an extensive rescission, no matter how you cut it. This is in all the education programs of 1994. They asked to cut back $1.7 billion. The final rescission bill that passed on July 27, 1995, was $600 million below 1995. So, as we are looking over, now, and listening to who is interested in education, I hope our colleagues will at least give some attention, when they are reviewing the record, as to who has been interested and who has been committed, judging by the allocation of resources. Resources themselves do not solve the problems of education, but they are a pretty good indication of a nation's priorities. 
   What we had as the first order of business in 1995 in the House rescission bill was to move ahead with a major cut of $1.7 billion for the appropriations the year before. Now, in the first full funding cycle, the 1996 House Appropriations, in August of 1995, cut $3.9 billion below 1996. Then the continuing resolution ended up at $3.1 billion below 1996. This was at a time when we had the memorable shutdown of the Government. The President said, That is too much, you will be cutting the heart out of many of these education programs. That was one of the principal reasons he went toe-to-toe with the Congress, because of those dramatic cuts in the area of education. Finally, there was a continuing resolution after the Senate adopted a Specter-Harkin amendment to restore $2.7 billion. We saw a bottom line $400 million below fiscal year 1996.  
   In 1997, the Senate bill was $3.1 billion below the President's. This is rather extraordinary to me, that Members on the other side can stand up and talk and criticize the President on appropriations when you have this kind of record to defend--$3.1 billion below the President's. My good friend from New Hampshire ought to be talking to the Republican appropriators. Mr. President, $3.1 billion below what the President asked for, that was the Senate bill. The final agreement, after extensive negotiation thankfully moved the appropriation up, was to $3.5 billion above what the President asked for; as a result of the administration's position, a $6 billion swing in education funding. 
   Then, in 1998, both the House and Senate bills were $200 million below the President's. Again, after tough negotiation the final agreement was $3.4 billion above, over 1997. 
   Mr. President, these are fairly significant figures. All of us are concerned about education policy. I know my friend and colleague from Vermont, Senator JEFFORDS, has long stood for making sure that we, as a country, and as a matter of principle, focus on and provide greater support for education as a national priority, so I appreciate his commitment, his position in these decisions. But we have to look at the bottom line. Coming into 1999, fiscal year 1999, they are still cutting below the President's investment. The House bill, in June of 1998, which was for the fiscal year 1999, was $2 billion below the President's; the final agreement was $3.6 billion over 1998. 
   This is the record. Year after year after year those appropriations committees, which are effectively controlled by the Republican leadership, have consistently underfunded education. So it does not come, I don't think, with good grace, to suggest that somehow we have an administration or President who is not strongly committed--whether it has been to the special needs children or all the children in this country. We all are mindful that even with these kinds of appropriations we only are spending probably 4 cents out of every dollar, maybe 5 cents out of every dollar, in education. You get 2 more cents for the food program, so the total considered to be the moneys that are spent locally, about 6 cents, is the Federal funding. But 2 cents of that has to do with nutrition. We are talking about 4 cents. 
   This is a major item, obviously, the title I program, but there is also some in excess of $4 billion in special needs. 
   The Head Start programs and others are certainly enormously important, and they can certainly use additional resources. 
   Federal education funding rose from $23 billion in 1996 to $33.5 billion in 1999, an increase of $10.5 billion, or 46 percent. That is a pretty good indication of at least this President's priorities in the education area. So, we hope when we come back here at 2:15 we will move ahead and accept this. We are, I believe, on this side, strongly committed to trying to find every scarce dollar resource to fund these education programs. 
   As I mentioned, with the Supreme Court holding of yesterday, we do have, I think, additional kinds of responsibilities. It was that aspect of the statement of the Senator from New Hampshire with which I agree. With that holding, there will be additional kinds of demands on local communities. I do think we ought to try to find additional resources on that particular measure, and we will certainly work with all in this body to see what can be done to gain those resources and support. 
   I yield.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will put in the RECORD the actual funding levels, in terms of the IDEA. In 1995, it was $3.2 billion; in 1996, it was $3.2 billion; in 1997, it was $4 billion. They are numbers that have to be rounded out--$4.35 billion. In 1998, it is $4.5 billion. And in 1999, it is $5 billion; the current is $5.54 billion, and the President's request was for $5.106 billion. The total increase from 1995 to the present is, therefore, an increase from $3.2 to $5.54 billion. 
   That is a significant increase. I say to our colleagues, much of that was attributed to our Republican friends who made it a priority. Quite frankly, we joined in that effort; I think the record would reflect that. 
   I will say, though, that we were able to see that kind of increase while we were also able to see an increase in the other programs as well. It wasn't an either/or position. That is what I hope will result this afternoon, after we have had a good discussion and debate. 
   We are strongly committed on this side to finding additional resources for the funding of that program. We will work with our committee chair to see how this last Supreme Court decision is going to impact local communities. I think that is enormously important. We are committing ourselves at this time, the day after that decision, to work closely, because we do think that there are going to be some very important additional burdens on local communities with that decision about the scope of the ADA, including educational and health support. I think there is going to be a call for additional help and assistance. We will certainly work with the chair to try and deal with that. 
   I have had the chance to talk with a leader on our side, Senator HARKIN, who has been such a leader on so many of these issues affecting the disabled. He is in strong support of trying to find ways to help and assist local communities as well. I am sure we will be addressing this probably later in the day. 
   I wanted at this time to make sure that our membership understood with that decision we are going to look forward to working in a cooperative way with the chair of the committee.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, will the Senator join me in indicating to the Senate the excellent results of the Senate Finance Committee this morning on legislation which the Senator from Vermont and I have worked on closely with Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN. There was a very positive bipartisan result, as I understand, 16 to 2, and although it is not directly related to education, it is directly related to the issue of employment of the disabled. Perhaps the good Senator would want to indicate to the membership the success of the Finance Committee in reporting that out.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I think this is perhaps in some respects the most notable thing that we will achieve today. As important as this is, with the reporting out of that particular bill, which is really, as the Senator has pointed out, the Americans with Disabilities Act, we effectively attempted to eliminate discrimination against those that had disability. It was enormously important, and we made extraordinary success. But to really breathe life into that legislation, you have to make sure that not only is the individual not going to be discriminated against in getting the job, but that they are also not going to have these barriers placed in front of them in holding the job which were there in terms of their elimination of their health care support and any other kinds of support services. That was the purpose of this legislation that was reported out with very strong bipartisan support. 
   We look forward, hopefully, to being able to act on that at an early time.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I want to thank the Senator for her statement and for her excellent summation of some of the challenges that are facing the children of her State, and also across this country. 
   The Senator has spoken to the members of our Health and Education Committee about some of the challenges that exist in the rural areas of her State, particularly in terms of ensuring that those children have access to the types of technologies which are commonplace in so many of our schools--not commonplace enough, but at least are important tools for learning--and to make sure that they have teachers who are going to know how to use those technologies in ways that might be taught in those schools. 
   I know this has been one of the special areas she has been interested in based upon her own visits to a number of the different communities across Arkansas. I want to indicate to her that we look forward to working closely with her on that issue as well as other issues. It is a matter of very significant importance. We welcome the chance, as we have talked with her about her concerns about education, to make sure that these items are given priority. 
   I thank the Senator.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Generally speaking, we understand from the various General Accounting Office reports that there is about $125 billion worth of needs for our schools, K through 12, to bring the buildings and facilities up to safety standards and to meet other kinds of codes. In many different communities, whether it is urban or, as the Senator pointed out, rural, there are not sufficient resources to help. Those communities can help somewhat. The State can help somewhat. But they are looking for a partner. At least I find that is true in my own State. We are going to have an opportunity to address that particular need, to try to figure out 
   how we can best partner with the State and local communities and work with those in the rural areas as well as the urban areas. 
   I want to give assurance to the good Senator that we want to work very closely with her as we try to work through this process. I believe we can take some important steps in this Congress in that area. We look forward to her insight and her assistance in doing so.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is now 6:10 p.m. on a Thursday evening, and we have had this Ed-Flex legislation before the Senate since yesterday. The Ed-Flex proposal would permit States and local communities to have greater flexibility with accountability for scarce resources that are provided by the Federal Government--in this case, the Title I program, which is about $8 billion that focuses on the neediest children in this country. There was an effort to give greater flexibility to the local communities, consistent with the purpose of the legislation, to try to have a more positive impact in the achievement of the children in this country. 
   This legislation was thought to have been a part of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We were going to have an opportunity to consider those measures together, but it was a decision of the majority of the committee to vote that out as an early piece of legislation. I voted in favor of that process and procedure. And then there was the indication by the Majority Leader that this measure would be before the Senate at an early time in this session. 
   We had legislation last week to address the very important, critical and legitimate needs of our service men and women, to try to give them a fair increase in their pay--particularly those individuals who are serving in harm's way in many different parts of the world, but generally for the armed services of this country, in order to make up for the failure to do so at other times. We had a good debate on that, and it was voted on. We had 26 different amendments that were advanced during that period of time, some of which were accepted and some of which we voted on. But we came to a conclusion on that particular measure. 
   So we started the debate on Ed-Flex. I don't think most of those American families who are watching now would really understand exactly what Ed-Flex is really all about. Nonetheless, it might very well provide some benefit to some young people in this country, and we were going to move ahead with it. I think most parents would understand if their children were in a classroom where there were fewer children in the class and a well-qualified teacher was interacting with that child and the 17 or 18 other children in that particular classroom, rather than the 30, 32, or 33 children in many classrooms across this country. I think parents would understand the advantages of moving toward smaller classes. 
   I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would favor that action, and we have an excellent proposal to do that, which was accepted by Republicans and Democrats in the final hours of the session last year prior to the election. And now we have many of those communities that are asking, ``Well, should we just hire a teacher if we are only going to have a teacher for 1 year? Let us know, Congress of the United States. You didn't do the whole job last year in authorizing it for the complete 6 years. Let us know whether you are going to make the judgment  and decision, as recommended by the President, that we ought to have the full 6 years.'' The President of the United States, in his budget, has allocated resources to be able to do that. The communities want to know. 
   Senator MURRAY has an excellent amendment to deal with that issue. I don't know about my other colleagues, but I know that in my own State of Massachusetts, communities want to have an answer to that particular question. And we are prepared to move ahead with that debate. We are prepared to have a full discussion on the floor of the U.S. Senate. We were prepared to do that yesterday. We are prepared to do it tonight. We are prepared to do it tomorrow or Monday, or at any time. It is of critical importance, and it is the kind of business that we should be dealing with in terms of education. 
   Families can understand smaller class size. Families can understand, as well, the importance of the development of afterschool programs. I referred, earlier in the debate, to the excellent review that has been made by independent reviewers on the value of the Title I programs, and there were a number of recommendations in there. They noted that we have made some important progress in the past few years in targeting the Title I programs more precisely, as we did in the last reauthorization legislation. But we also know of the importance of the afterschool programs. 
   I will mention this report, the evaluation of promising results, continuing challenges, of the national assessment. This is about Title I from the Department of Education, 1999, and was just released. One of the findings shows that in a recent study of elementary schools in Maryland, the most successful schools were seeing consistent academic gains as a result of extended-day programs. Afterschool programs are extended-day programs. And there are others, such as programs that extend into the weekend and summer programs that continue the education during the summer months. 
   There are a number of different ways that local communities have been implementing afterschool programs. Last year, we had some $40 million in appropriations for afterschool programs, and there were $500 million worth of applications for those programs coming from local communities. The President has raised his appropriation up to $600 million to reach out to one million children in the country and provide afterschool programs. We have an excellent amendment by our friend and colleague from California, Senator BOXER, and also one from Senator DODD in that particular area--one would be based upon the schools, and the other would be based upon nonprofits. They are somewhat different approaches, but I think they both have very substantial merit. 
   Nonetheless, Mr. President, we have the opportunity to vote and debate on a measure that will make a real difference in terms of families' lives for extended-day programs. That will make a difference. It will improve quality education and student achievement. 
   We were prepared to move ahead with that particular debate. But that, evidently, will not be the case. We had a good opportunity and a good record to explore and to engage those that would differ with us. We have the amendment that our colleagues are familiar with that was advanced by Senator BINGAMAN, REID and others, that brought special focus and attention on the problems of school dropouts. Sure, we have a lot of dropout programs. But this program was very innovative in terms of the evaluation of that, and was successful in implementing a program that can make a difference. 
   I commend those Senators for the work they have done on it. In the past, that amendment was accepted overwhelmingly by this body. That could make a difference to children that are in school now, today and tomorrow. We were prepared to debate that program, but we have been unable to bring that to resolution. 
   As the good Senator, Senator BINGAMAN, pointed out, some 500,000 children drop out of school before graduating from high school each year. There are important reasons for that. There have been successful programs to try to correct that. But this was a worthwhile effort to bring the authorization of funding for that particular program. 
   My colleague and friend from Massachusetts, Senator KERRY, had a modest program to provide additional help, assistance and training to principals to help them deal with some of the more complex issues that they face. And that is a very, very worthwhile amendment. 
   Our good friend from North Dakota, Senator DORGAN, and others had a program to have a report card on various schools so that parents would have better information about how the schools were doing. 
   There were others, but not many others. I haven't gotten the complete list at this time, but there are a few others. 
   But on each and every one of those, Senator DASCHLE was prepared to recommend to all of us that we move ahead with short time limitations. As far as I was concerned, we would have been able, at least from our side, to have concluded the consideration this measure by Tuesday of next week. We were glad to try to accommodate the interests of the majority in working out the time limits of these particular measures, and even the order of them. We assume that there may be amendments to be offered by the other side, including the very important amendment that was brought to our attention with regards to IDEA and children with special needs. That amendment would provide additional help and assistance to local communities, through IDEA, to offset some of the serious financial burdens of educating of children with special needs. 
   We have an important responsibility to children with special needs, and the States have an obligation under their own constitutions to educate every child. 
   We did make the commitment back in 1975 that we would establish a goal of 40 percent federal funding, and we have failed to do so. 
   I believe very strongly that we should support those programs, particularly in light of yesterday's Supreme Court decision that will permit children with special needs to continue their education. It will be supported by the local communities as well. That will add some certainty for those children, so they will be able to continue their education. 
   That is the most important and significant aspect of the program. But there will be some additional financial responsibilities. This is an area of national concern, because all of us understand that our participation in the education process is limited and targeted to special priorities. We have made disadvantaged children and the neediest children in our country a priority. Certainly those with special needs ought to be a national priority as well. We ought to be willing to help children, regardless of what community they live in, and regardless of what their needs may be. 
   Mr. President, these are some of the items that we are talking 
   about. I think most families in our country could make up their mind pretty easily about the kind of priorities that we should be considering. I think the overwhelming majority of Americans would feel support for the programs I have begun to outline. 
   Let me point out that they are very modest and important programs, with demonstrated effectiveness. Certainly we are able to do so and support those programs. Many of them, as I mentioned earlier, have already been targeted for support by the President in his budget--financial support has been there. 
   Mr. President, we find ourselves in the situation on Thursday evening where effectively by the rules of the Senate are not going to be debating these issues tomorrow, we will not be debating these issues on Monday, and at 5 o'clock the Senate will vote whether or not we are going to exclude all possibility of considering those amendments on this particular measure. We will not spend the time tomorrow, which we certainly could, in debating and considering these issues. We will not do it on Monday. And we will delay the eventual outcome of consideration of these measures to a future day. 
   We heard earlier today, around noontime, that those that are supporting the measure of Senator BINGAMAN were actually filibustering the legislation. This is after a day and a half of considering the amendments to the Ed-Flex  legislation. We had indicated at that time that we were prepared to accept--at least Senator BINGAMAN was--the amendment and move ahead. 
   It reminds me of where we were at the end of the last session where we were effectively denied any opportunity to bring up the patients' bill of rights, which American families were so strongly in support of. We were denied the opportunity for fair consideration and debate on it. We were denied the opportunity to consider an increase in the minimum wage for working families in spite of the extraordinary progress that we have had--economic prosperity which so many have participated in, but not those at the lowest end of the economic ladder. We were prepared to refute the case that a modest increase in the minimum wage is going to mean lost jobs or is going to add to the inflation in this country, ridiculous claims by those that were trying to stop any increase in the minimum wage. 
   We will have an opportunity to consider a minimum wage increase. I must say that the responses that Speaker HASTERT has given on the consideration of the minimum wage has given us some reason to hope that we will have an opportunity to debate and to act on increasing the minimum wage. But we were denied that chance in the last Congress, as we were denied the opportunity to act on a patients' bill of rights. 
   Some of us have come to the conclusion that the only way we can get a vote is if we offer an amendment that the majority agrees with. That seems to be the rule. We are denied the opportunity on this side to bring these matters up and have a full debate. I quite frankly don't understand why this should be so. The American people want action in the field of education. I believe they want partnership--a Federal partnership with the State and with the local communities. They understand the primacy of the local control on education, and they understand the importance of State help and assistance to many different communities. And they value the limited but important targeting that is given by some of the Federal programs. 
   But they want to have the participation of all of us in a partnership to try to help families. They have heard the various philosophical and ideological debates. They want action. They want well-qualified teachers in every classroom. They want classrooms where children can learn. They want to make sure they are going to have the kinds of technology in those classrooms which will permit children going to public school to compete with any young person going to school in any part of the country. They want their teachers' skills upgraded so they can integrate those skills into the curriculum with additional training. 
   They want afterschool programs, because they know that it makes a difference to give a child the opportunity to get some extra help in the course of the afternoon--maybe getting their homework done instead of watching television or engaging in other kinds of unhealthy behavior--so when the parents return home, the child can spend some quality time with those parents and the parents don't have to say, ``You have been watching television all afternoon. Get upstairs and get your homework done.'' These are issues about which families care very deeply. 
   Sure, we have a full agenda on many matters--on Social Security, but Social Security reform is not ready for debate; on issues dealing with Medicare, but Medicare is not ready for Senate consideration either. Sure, we have important responsibilities in trying to get a Patients' Bill of Rights, but we are attempting to work that out through the committee process and hopefully will have an opportunity to address that in the next several weeks. Yes, we have important responsibilities in protecting the privacy of individuals regarding to medical records, but that legislation is not ready to be considered. 
   I really challenge the leadership on the other side to indicate to the Members what is on the possible agenda here that is more important for our attention, effort and debate than the issue of the education of the young people of this country. There is nothing. That is why this course of action, of effectively denying the debate and for the Senate to work its will in these very important areas, is so unacceptable--unacceptable. 
   We want to make sure that those families understand. You might be able, although I don't think they will be able, to have cloture, in effect denying Members the opportunity to consider those particular amendments on Monday. But you are not going to make this battle go away, because those amendments are going to be offered on other pieces of legislation--they make too much of a difference to families. They are not going to go away. It is the early part of this session. We are not in the final hours when you are able to jimmy the rules in order to deny the opportunity for people to bring these matters up. You cannot do that now. We are going to insist that we have this debate and discussion, and have the Senate work its will. 
   I thank our colleagues today who have been willing to participate in this effort and have spent close to 3 hours or so in quorum calls during the course of the day when we could have been debating these issues. I hope we will not hear anymore from the other side about filibustering by amendment, because there are too many who have waited too long to try to at least get a result here in the U.S. Senate on some of these issues. 
   I know, finally, that it is painful, evidently, for some of our colleagues to vote on some of these matters. We heard a lot of that this afternoon, ``We don't want to vote on it. It is painful to vote on them.'' That is, unfortunately, what this business is about. It is about choices and priorities, to a great extent. We have every intention of pursuing these issues. We are not going to be denied. I believe we will not have cloture on Monday. It will be up to them, then, whether we are to deal with these issues in the timely and reasonable way which we are prepared to do. But if that is not the case, I just want to make certain everyone in here knows--I know this from speaking to our colleagues who have worked so hard in so many of these different areas--that we are going to be quite prepared to advance these frequently, on each and 
   every opportunity that will present itself. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it's an honor for me to join in this tribute to a wonderful friend and outstanding colleague, Congressman Mo Udall. He served the people of Arizona with extraordinary distinction and he was a dear friend to all of us in the Kennedy family. 
   Mo came from a remarkable family with a long and respected history in politics and public service. His grandfather led a wagon train of settlers into the territory in the 1880's. His father served as chief justice of New Mexico's State Supreme Court. His brother, Steward Udall, served with President Kennedy in Congress, and my brother respected his ability so much that he appointed him to serve as secretary of Interior in the years of the New Frontier. Today, Mo's son, MARK, and his nephew, TOM, are carrying on the great Udall tradition of public service as newly elected member of the House of Representatives. So the Chambers of Congress ring once again with the respected Udall name. 
   Mo came to Congress a year before I did, and under similar circumstances. He was elected in 1961 to fill the seat vacated when his brother Stewart became Secretary of the Interior. 
   Every working man and woman in America owes a debt of gratitude to Mo for his many years of distinguished public service. His brilliant leadership on important environmental issues, campaign financing, and reform of the House of Representatives itself endeared him to all of us who knew him, and to millions who benefited from his extraordinary achievements. 
   On many issues, he was far ahead of his time, and his courage in tackling difficult challenges in a Congressional career of thirty brilliant years was admired by us all. President Kennedy would have called him a profile in courage, and so do I. 
   As Chairman of the Interior Committee, Mo was ``Mr. Environment'' in the Congress, urging the nation to deal more effectively with the increasingly urgent environmental challenges we faced. He worked hard to designate millions of acres of federal lands as wilderness, and to enact landmark legislation to regulate the strip mining industry and manage nuclear waste. Mo was at the forefront of efforts year after year to protect the environment, expand the country's national parks, promote land-use planning and restructure the energy industry. It came as no surprise when the National Wildlife Federation named Mo as its legislator of the year as early as 1973. 
   Under Mo's leadership, Congress passed the nation's first campaign finance reform legislation in 1971. That landmark disclosure law, which required federal candidates to file detailed public reports of their financing, remains one of the most important aspects of election reform as we know it today. 
   As a member of the Post Office and Civil Service Committee, Mo led battles to improve pay scales for federal employees, institute a system of merit pay, and reform and strengthen the entire Post Office Department. 
   Mo's leadership was equally pre-eminent on many other issues. Somehow, for thirty years, whenever you probed to the heart of a major battle, you always found Mo Udall championing the rights of citizens against special interest pressure, defending the highest ideals of America, and always doing it with the special grace and wit that were his trademark and that endeared him to Democrats and Republicans alike. 
   I think particularly of his influential role in ending the Vietnam war. Mo Udall was one of the first members of Congress in the 1960's to break with the Administration and oppose the war. Because of Mo, we were able to end the war more quickly. 
   I also think of his early battles to reform the seniority system and to make the Congress more responsive to the people we serve. In carrying forward these efforts today, we continue to follow the paths he blazed so well throughout his remarkable career. 
   Above all, I think of the extraordinary courage he displayed in his latter years, battling the cruel disease that finally led to his resignation from the Congress, in 1991, thirty years almost to the very day since he arrived in the House. in his final battle, as in so many other battles, Mo won the respect and admiration and affection of us all. 
   And through it all, Mo charmed friend and foe alike with his extraordinary sense of humor. Mo came from a small town named St. Johns in Arizona, and he loved to tell people that he knew something about small towns. As he said, ``I was in fifth grade before I learned the town's name wasn't `Resume Speed.' '' 
   He was also the master of the self-deprecating joke. He often told the story of his visit to New Hampshire during the presidential primaries in his 1976 campaign. At one stop, his advance woman urged him to shake a few hands in a nearby barber shop. So he stuck his head in the door and said, ``I'm Mo Udall, and I'm running for President!'' The barber replied, ``Yes, I know. We were just laughing about that this morning.''  
   His brilliant wit could ease even the tensest moments and bring people together. When Mo Udall laughed, Congress and the nation laughed with him, and then went on to do the nation's business more effectively. 
   I have many warm memories of the years that Mo and I served together in Congress. In so many ways, Mo was a Congressman for all seasons. He served the people of Arizona and America long and well. We miss his statesmanship, and we miss his friendship too. We miss you, Mo, and we always will.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I think all of us in the Senate are looking forward to these next few days during which we will have an opportunity to address the fundamental issue which  is on the minds of most families in this country--certainly the working families in this Nation--and that is whether we, as a Federal Government, are going to be partners with state and local governments as we try to address the critical issues facing our public schools--whether our children are going to be able to make academic progress and have the opportunity to achieve their full potential. 
   Public education is basically a partnership, and one in which the Federal Government has had a very limited role, historically. The principal responsibility has been local governments, and the States have had some interest. The Federal Government has really had a limited interest. As has been pointed out, approximately 7 cents out of every dollar that is spent locally that can be traced back to the Federal Government. Two cents of that is actually in nutrition and the support of breakfast and lunch programs. It comes down to about 4 cents out of every dollar that is actually appropriated by the Federal Government. 
   So all of us are interested in how we can use scarce resources. What we are talking about here today is not expanding that in any way. We are talking about whether, of that 4 cents, maybe 2 cents will be able to have greater flexibility at the local level. 
   The question is what are the priorities for us at the Federal level? It has been generally agreed that the priority for us at the Federal level is going to be targeting the neediest and the most disadvantaged children in the country. We, as a society, feel that we have some responsibility, some extra responsibility--that it is not just a local responsibility to try to deal with those needy children, but that we have a national responsibility. That was the basis for the title I programs. 
   Over a long period of time, we have debated about how that money can most effectively be used to enhance academic achievement and accomplishment. As has been pointed out today, and as was pointed out in the President's excellent statement earlier today over in the Library of Congress, we know what needs to be done. It is a question now of whether we, as a country and a society and a people, are willing to do it. 
   During the next few days, we will have an opportunity to look at a number of different features of the education priority. We are dealing now with the Frist-Wyden legislation, and I want to speak to that for a few moments and make some observations and also address, later in the afternoon, what I think could be useful changes in the legislation. 
   I commend Senator FRIST and Senator WYDEN for their initiative, and I have voted for this legislation to come out of our committee both last year and this year--and, as a matter of fact, I was the author, with Senator Hatfield, in 1994 that initially set up the Ed-Flex--and I have followed it very closely. I am glad to have a chance to reflect on some of the observations that I have made over the years in watching that. But we will also have an opportunity to debate whether we, as a Senate, are going to go on record as supporting smaller classrooms from the early grades. 
   We will have a chance to hear an excellent amendment from the Senator from Washington, Senator MURRAY, on that particular issue. We made a commitment to the school districts across the country last year that we were going to start this process. It was going to go in effect for some 6 years. We made the commitment for the first year, but the school districts across the country are wondering whether this is going to be a continuum. Certainly it is extraordinarily timely that we provide that kind of authorization for smaller classrooms, so that the school districts all across the country will have some certainty as to what the education policy at the congressional level will be on that issue. 
   The President has included the resources to fund that initiative, in excess of $11 billion, in his budgets over the next 5 years. That is very important, and we will have an opportunity to address that issue. 
   Senator BOXER wants to address afterschool programs. I think we have seen, with a modest program in the last year, the beginning of the recognition of the afterschool problem. Every day, there are some 5 to 9 million children between the ages of 9 and 14, who too often find themselves not attending to their homework, but rather find themselves involved in behavior which is inappropriate. 
   What we have seen is that where these programs have been developed--where children are able to work in the afterschool situation, being tutored perhaps in their subject matter or encouraged to participate in literacy programs--those children are doing much better academically and socially as well. And when they have the opportunity to spend time with their parents in the evening time, it is quality time, rather than parents telling children as soon as they get home, ``Run upstairs and do your homework.'' This has been very, very important, and Senator BOXER has an important proposal to authorize and to enhance the commitment in those areas. 
   There will be modest amendments in other areas. I know Senator HARKIN has a proposal with regard to school construction. I know Senator BINGAMAN has an amendment about school dropouts. Some of these are programs that we have debated in the past and have been actually accepted by the Senate. There are other programs as well, issues involving technology and other matters that will eventually be addressed and brought up. We are not interested in undue delay, but we also believe that there is no issue which is of greater importance to American families, and we ought to be willing to address these issues. 
   We just passed an increase in military pay. There were 26 amendments on that particular proposal. I do not expect that we will have as many on this, but nonetheless it is important that we 
   do have a chance through today and through the remainder of the week and through the early part of next week to address some of these issues. We welcome this chance to focus on the issues of education and also on what our policies are going to be. 
   Just to review very briefly, Mr. President, this chart demonstrates quite clearly a rather fundamental commitment. That is, for every dollar that is spent by the States, they spend 62 cents in addition to that for the needy children in their State. The corresponding Federal dollar amount is $4.73. This is a really clear indication of what we are talking about, primarily with Title I, which is the principal issue here--the resources that are being provided are going to the neediest children in this country. 
   And, interestingly, in the reauthorization bill of 1994, we changed the direction of Title I to very high poverty areas--very high poverty areas--not just poverty areas but very high poverty areas. And when we have a chance, as I will in just a few moments, to go through and see what the distinction has been in targeting more precisely the resources, there has been a very important indication of progress among the children in getting a much more targeted direction in terms of resources. This is part of the reason why some of us believe that, in addition to being able to get some kinds of waivers from the Federal programs in the area of Title I, we ought to insist that we are going to require that there be academic achievement and student improvement if we are going to move ahead. We are finding now, under the most recent report of Title I, that for the first time we are making noticeable and important gains on Title I. That has escaped us over the almost 30 years, but now we are making some real progress in the area of Title I. I will have a chance to review that, but this is basically an indication to show the targeting of Title I. 
   Secondly, Mr. President, while we are looking at the issue of flexibility at the present time, I just want to point out what we have done in terms of Ed-Flex. In 1994, we passed what was called the Hatfield-Kennedy amendment on the elementary and secondary education bill. That amendment provided that six States at that time would have Ed-Flex. The Governors then, once they were given that kind of approval, would be able to waive particular requirements if any community within the State wanted to do so. When we came to the Goals 2000, we added another six States and we permitted the Secretary of Education to provide Ed-Flex to any school district in the country. 
   So what we have seen is, with all of the various applications that have been  made in the period since then, some 54 percent have been approved; 31 percent, when they brought those measures up to the Department of Education, were shown to be unnecessary and therefore withdrawn; and only 8 percent were disapproved. This is a pretty good indication that any school district that wanted to seek a waiver of any of these rules and regulations has been permitted to do so. In the State of California, there have been more than 1,000 applications that have been approved. That is the current situation in which we find ourselves. 
   On the issue of accountability, the real question is, ``In the waiver of these regulations, are we going to be able to give the assurance that we are going to have student achievement?'' What we are basically saying is, if we are going to give you 5 years of waiving the regulations, which take scarce resources, and target it on needy children, are we going to insist that the children are going to have student achievement? That is what we are asking. 
   And I mentioned, at least to my colleague and friend, Senator WYDEN, that we could add those words in three different places in the legislation along with the language that is in here and resolve at least one of the concerns that I have, and that I think a number of others have as well. 
   We have seen since it has passed out of our Committee, as I am sure has been explained by the authors of the legislation, that they provide changes to try to reflect greater accountability. And we very much appreciate that. That is in the managers' package, and it is a good start. I believe the authors have gone through that in some detail. If not, I will take some time to do that briefly later in my discussion. But this is where we are, Mr. President. 
   What we are interested in is student achievement. What we are going to insist on is to make sure that if we are going to give over to the States the resources targeted for these particular areas, that they are going to be able to come back over the period of the following 2, 3, 4, 5 years and demonstrate the student achievement. That is what we are interested in and what we want to address here later this afternoon. 
   Mr. President, education is a top priority in this Congress, and few other issues are more important to the Nation than ensuring that every child has the opportunity to attend a good, safe, and modern public school. The Ed-Flex Partnership Act can be a useful step toward improving public schools, but to be effective, it must go hand in hand with strong accountability. 
   Current law already contains substantial flexibility. As I mentioned, the 1994 amendments to the Elementary/Secondary Act reduced paperwork and increased flexibility. Since then, two-thirds of the Act's regulations--two-thirds--have been eliminated. States now have an option to submit a single consolidated State application instead of separate applications, and all but one State has adopted this approach. Schools and school districts already have great flexibility today and paperwork is not their top issue. 
   According to the General Accounting Office report that was quoted earlier today, ``information, funding, and management,'' not paperwork, are the primary concerns of school districts. Provisions for increased flexibility, such as waivers, ``do not increase federal assistance to school districts, nor do they relieve districts of any of their major financial obligations.'' That is the finding of the General Accounting Office. 
   It is interesting to me, Mr. President. I would have thought there would be much more authority and much greater credibility if those who were talking about this would be able to demonstrate that the States themselves were willing to waive their statutes and regulations. That has not been the case. In some instances States have, but in many they have not. As the General Accounting Office report shows, even if you granted it, it would not make a great deal of difference, because there are so many State regulations and statutes that are in existence, that are related to this program, that it would not really have the kind of beneficial result many of us would like. 
   I am always glad to hear our good friends the Governors talk about reducing the regulations, when we have seen a reduction in the regulations by two-thirds since the authorization of 1994, and yet we have not really heard from them, nor have we heard here on the floor of the Senate, how the States themselves have changed their statutes and rules and regulations in order to be more flexible during this period of time. 
   In fact, in many cases it is the State's redtape, not the Federal bureaucracy, that will keep schools from taking full advantage of the flexibility that the law provides. Ten States cannot waive their own regulations and statutes because State law does not permit it in order to match this. 
   It is good, as we start off on this, to have some idea about the scope of this whole debate. I think it is going to be useful if we get through this part of it in the next day or so. The real 
   guts of the whole debate is going to be next week when we come to the questions of classrooms and afterschool programs. 
   But I do want to make some additional points. In fact, in many cases, as I mentioned, it is the State's redtape, not the Federal bureaucracy, that will keep schools from taking full advantage of the flexibility that the law provides. That is why, if tied to strong accountability, expanding Ed-Flex makes sense, so all States can ease the burden on local school districts as they obtain increased Federal flexibility. 
   One requirement to be eligible for Ed-Flex is that a State must be able to waive that State's statutory or regulatory requirements which impede State or local efforts to improve learning and teaching. That step will ensure that the real paperwork burdens on local school districts are diminished. As I mentioned, we have 10 States that do not have that capacity or willingness to do so. 
   Families across the Nation want Uncle Sam to be a partner, a helping hand in these efforts. Parents want results. They want their communities, States, and the Federal Government to work together to improve public schools. In doing our Federal part, we should ensure that when we provide more flexibility, it is matched with strong accountability for results, so that every parent knows their children are getting the education they deserve. 
   I support the Frist bill because it provides flexibility and takes some steps towards holding States accountable. But it isn't enough. Congress has the responsibility to ensure that Federal tax dollars are used effectively to help all children learn. Just giving States more flexibility will not do the job. A blank check approach to school reform is the wrong approach. Our primary concern in this legislation is to guarantee that accountability goes hand in hand with flexibility. Strong accountability measures are essential to ensure that parents and communities across the country have confidence in the waiver process. 
   Another fundamental requirement is that States and districts must provide parents, educators, and other interested members of the community with the opportunity to comment on proposed waivers and make those comments available for public review. These public comments should be submitted with State or local waiver applications. What we are talking about is parental involvement. And we will have an opportunity to address that. 
   I am sure we will hear the response back, ``Why are we going to do that?'' That is going to require more action at the State level. We are going to have hearings in order to hear parents' views about it. But the fact of the matter is, unless you get the parents involved, you are not going to do the job. The parental involvement is essential. We will have a chance to go through that in the most recent title I report. 
   And you can't show me where in the Frist-Wyden proposal they are going to guarantee that the parents are going to have a voice in the final decision that is going to be made here. It just is not there. You show me a community where you have intense parental involvement, and you are going to see a school system that is moving in the right direction. You show me a community where parental involvement is distant or remote, and you are going to see a school that is in decline. Those are not my conclusions--those are the conclusions of the educational community. We want to make sure that parents are going to be involved when waivers are being proposed to get their kind of input. And there will be the transmission of their views to the Secretary.  
   Mr. President, it is essential that States and districts provide parents, educators, and other members of the community with the opportunity to comment on proposed waivers and make their comments available for public review. These public comments should be submitted with State or local waiver applications. 
   That is what we are talking about. Just make that change. Public comments should be submitted with State or local waiver applications. That would move us in a very, very important, very positive way--we get the student accountability and we get the parental involvement. Those are the measures we are looking at, Mr. President. 
   We must also ensure that all students, particularly the neediest students, have the opportunity to meet the high State standards of achievement. Fundamental standards should not be waived. Parents need to know how their children are doing in every school, and in the poorest performing schools, parents also need help in achieving change. 
   Under Title I, disadvantaged students have the opportunity to achieve the same high standards as all children. School districts must provide realistic assistance to improve low-performing schools. Flexibility makes sense, but not if it means losing these essential tools for parents and communities to achieve reform and improve their schools. 
   There were four very important changes in the 1994 authorization: first was a significant reduction in paperwork; second, the targeting of the highest incidence of poverty; third, the heavy involvement of parents in terms of the participation; and fourth, and perhaps most importantly, high standards. 
   We move away from dumbing down. We establish high standards for poor children as well as children that were coming from other communities. Those factors have had an important positive impact. We are finally getting there. 
   We must ensure that increased flexibility leads to improved student achievement. Accountability in this context means that States must evaluate how waivers actually improve student achievement--open-ended waivers make no sense. Results are what counts. Student achievement is what counts. 
   The Secretary of Education should be able to terminate a State's waiver authority if the student achievement is not improving after 5 years. States must be able to terminate any waivers granted to a school district or participating schools if student achievement is not improving. If waivers do not lead to satisfactory progress, it makes no sense to continue. 
   What I have been mentioning here is being practiced in one of the Ed-Flex States, and is showing remarkable improvement in terms of education. That state is Texas, where they have real student achievement, real accountability, parental involvement, and specific student achievement goals. That is true accountability. 
   If you review the different State annual reports, there is a dramatic contrast between what has been implemented by the State of Texas in using the greater flexibility to enhance student achievement and what has happened in many of the other States. True accountability is what we want to achieve if we are going to have the Federal funds. 
   Each of these requirements is sensible. No one wants a heavy-handed Federal regulation of State and local education. That is not the issue. The real issue is accountability. These important requirements are well designed to achieve it. We should do nothing to undermine these principles, especially when we have new evidence that they work, particularly for the neediest students. 
   ``The National Assessment of Title I,'' released earlier this week, shows that student achievement is increasing and that the Federal Government is an effective partner in that success. The glass on the table is half full, not half empty as critics of public schools would have you believe. This is good news for schools, good news for parents, good news for students, and it should be convincing evidence to Congress that many of the reforms we put in place in recent years are working. 
   Since the reauthorization of Title I in 1994, a nonpartisan Independent Review Panel, made up of 22 experts from across the country, has overseen the program. Title I is the largest Federal investment in improving elementary and secondary schools. Title I helps to improve education for 11 million children in 45,000 schools with high concentrations of poverty. It helps schools provide professional development for teachers, improve curriculums, and extend learning time so students meet high State standards of achievement. 
   Under the 1994 amendments to Title I, States were no longer 
   allowed to set lower standards for children in the poorest communities than they set for students in more affluent communities. The results are clear: even the hardest-to-reach students will do well when expectations are set high and they are given the support they need. 
   Student achievement in reading and math has increased, particularly in the achievement of the poorest students. Since 1992, reading achievement for 9-year-olds in the highest poverty schools has increased nationwide by a whole grade level. Between 1990 and 1996, math scores of the poorest students rose by a grade level. 
   Students are meeting high State standards, too. Students in the highest poverty elementary schools improved in five of six States reporting 3-year data in reading, and in four out of five States in math. Students in Connecticut, Maryland, North Carolina, and Texas made progress in both subjects. 
   Many urban school districts report that achievement also improved in their highest poverty schools. In 10 out of the 13 large urban districts that report 3-year trend data, there were increases in the number of elementary students in the highest poverty schools who met the district or State standards of proficiency in writing or math. Six districts, including Houston, Dade County, New York, Philadelphia, San Antonio, and San Francisco made progress in both subjects. 
   Federal funds are increasingly targeted to the poorest schools. The 1994 amendments to Title I shifted funds, as I mentioned, away from low-poverty schools into high-poverty schools. Today, 95 percent of the high-poverty schools receive Title I funding, up from 80 percent in 1993. 
   The percent of schools with parent compacts--agreements between teachers and parents about how they will work together to help the children do better--rose from 20 percent in 1994 to 75 percent in 1998. A substantial majority of the schools find their compacts are important in promoting parents' involvement, especially in higher poverty schools. Parent involvement is a key element in terms of academic achievement, and that is why we believe their voice regarding waiving the requirements should be heard and at least considered. 
   Title I funds help improve teaching and learning in the classroom. Ninety-nine percent of Title I funds go to the local level; 93 percent of those Federal dollars are spent directly on instruction, compared to only 62 percent of all State and local education dollars that are spent on instruction. 
   We are going to hear a lot as we debate education about where the Federal money that is appropriated goes, in terms of Federal bureaucracy and administration, State bureaucracy and how much of the money goes to the local level. This is the most recent report that has been done by independents. It shows that local school districts get 95.5; State administration is 4 percent, Federal administration is one-half of 1 percent. State administration of their own programs are considerably higher, as the chart indicates. 
   All of these steps are working together to improve student achievement. The best illustrations of these successes are in local schools. In Baltimore County, MD, all but one of the 19 Title I schools increased student performance between 1993 and 1998. The success has come from Title I support for extended year programs, implementation of effective programs in reading, and intensive professional development for teachers. 
   At Roosevelt High School in Dallas, 80 percent of the students are poor. Title I funds were used to increase parent involvement, train teachers to work with parents, and make other changes to bring high standards to every classroom. Reading scores have nearly doubled, from the 40th percentile in 1992 to the 77th percentile in 1996.  During the same period, math scores soared from the 16th percentile to the 73rd percentile, and writing scores rose from the 58th to the 84th percentile. That is remarkable. 
   What happened in this area? We got the parents involved and we enhanced the training of teachers to work more effectively with the parents to bring the high standards into every classroom. 
   The Baldwin Elementary School in Boston, where 80 percent of the students are poor, performance on the Stanford 9 test rose substantially from 1996 to 1998 because of the increases in teacher professional development and implementation of a reform to raise standards and achievement for all children. 
   In 1996, 66 percent of third grade students scored in the lowest levels in math. By 1998, 100 percent scored in the highest level. In 1997, 75 percent of fourth graders scored in the lowest levels in reading. By 1998, no fourth graders were at the lowest level, and 56 percent were at the highest level. 
   We have seen that the National Assessment of Title I shows that high standards and parental involvement get better results for children, particularly the neediest children. That is what we would like to see come through this legislation--where you get the flexibility, but you are also going to be able to demonstrate enhanced student achievement and parental involvement. Those are the two key requirements. 
   The improvements so far are gratifying, but there is no cause for complacency. Clearly, more needs to be done. We must build on these successes to ensure that all children have the best possible education. Increasing flexibility without accountability will stop progress in its tracks. But just increasing flexibility with accountability won't do the job either. 
   We must provide more support for programs like Title I to make these opportunities available to all children. We must do a better job of supporting the States and local communities in their efforts to hire and train teachers. The National Assessment of Title I found that too many students in too many Title I schools--particularly those with high concentrations of low-income children--are being taught by unqualified teachers. 
   The teacher shortage forced many school districts to hire uncertified teachers, and asked certified teachers to teach outside their areas of expertise. Each year, more than 50,000 underprepared teachers enter the classroom. One in four new teachers does not fully meet State certification requirements. Twelve percent of new teachers have had no teacher training at all. Students in inner city schools have only a 50 percent chance of being taught by a qualified science or math teacher. In Massachusetts, 30 percent of teachers in high-poverty schools do not even have a minor degree in their field. 
   In addition, many schools are seriously understaffed. During the next decade, rising student enrollments and massive teacher retirement mean that the Nation will need to hire 2 million new teachers. Between 1995 and 1997, student enrollment in Massachusetts rose by 28,000 students, causing a shortage of 1,600 teachers--without including teacher retirements. 
   We must fulfill last year's commitment to help communities hire 100,000 new teachers, as part of our national pledge to reduce class size. Research has documented what parents and teachers have already known--that smaller classes enhance student achievement. 
   It is equally important to help communities recruit promising teacher candidates, provide new teachers with trained mentors who will then help them succeed in the classroom, and give current teachers the ongoing training they need to help keep up with modern technology and new research. 
   Another major need is in the area of afterschool activities. According to the National Assessment on Title I, opportunities for children to participate afterschool and summer school programs have grown from 10 percent of Title I schools to 41 percent in 1998. That has made an important contribution to the enhancement of these children's achievement. But more needs to be done. We must increase support for afterschool programs. 
   In addition, children who have fallen behind in their school work need opportunities to catch up, to meet legitimate requirements for graduation, to master basic skills, and to meet high standards of achievement. A high school diploma should mean something--it must be more than a certificate of attendance. It should be a certificate of achievement. High-quality afterschool and summer school academic improvement activities should be available to every child in every community in America. 
   Finally, we must do more to see that every child in every community is learning in safe and modern facilities. Across the country, 14 million children in one-third of the Nation's schools 
   are learning in substandard buildings. Half of the schools have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition. It will take an estimated $100 billion to repair the existing facilities. 
   Too many children are struggling to learn in overcrowded schools. This year, K through 12 enrollment reached an all-time high and will continue to grow over the next 7 years. Communities will need to build new public schools. 
   The agenda is broad, but the need is great. We are on the right track. There is no need to make a u-turn on education. We are making progress. We need to build on these successes and do what we can to meet the pressing needs of schools across the Nation, so that we can meet the high standards of achievement. When it comes to education, the Nation's children deserve the best that we can give them.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I thank the Senator from Connecticut. We are all mindful that our good friend and colleague is a leader in this body in many areas, but when it comes to children's interests, he is truly our leader. And on the issue of afterschool programs, Senator BOXER has been in the forefront of that effort. We look forward to having a good debate on that issue as we move ahead as well. I thank the Senator very much for his involvement. Hopefully we will have an opportunity to consider that in the next day or so. That is certainly our hope because it is a matter of enormous importance.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I want to say how much I agree with the Senator from Rhode Island. Student achievement is measured by the individual State's program. I think it is important that we underline that student achievement is measured by what is happening in the States, not by some Federal standard. That is all we are asking. The State establishes its criteria, and all we are saying is if you are going to get the additional flexibility and you are going to get the resources, that at some place someone ought to know whether the students are achieving and making progress.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This is really all we are saying. We are taking Federal resources--resources that will go into the States and to the local communities--and communities are going to use these resources in ways that are going to be consistent with the overall purpose, which is targeting the needy children, and, over 5 years at least, there will be  some progress in student achievement according to what the State has established. 
   Would the Senator agree with me that an example which incorporates what we are intending to do is in the State of Texas, which has set numerical criteria that are closely tied to both schools and districts, and the specific students affected by the waiver? Texas expects all districts that receive waivers under Title I to make annual gains on test scores so that in 5 years 90 percent of all the students will pass State assessment tests in reading and mathematics. Texas districts must make annual gains so at the end of the same 5 years, 90 percent of African American students, 90 percent of Hispanic students, 90 percent of white students, 90 percent of economically disadvantaged students will pass these tests. Now, there is something specific. The State establishes the criteria. They say we want the flexibility to be able to do it, and we say fine. What we have found out is that they have made great academic achievement and progress for those students. 
   We have another State of the 12 that says on their waiver, ``We want a commitment to the identification and implementation of programs that will create an environment in which all students achieve academic potential.'' They got the waiver, they got the resources, and it will be a bold Secretary of Education that is going to terminate or take that away. 
   What we are trying to say is, as Texas has done right from the very beginning, it has got to be very specific. The State establishes their criteria and they have proposed measurable ways of evaluating whether those students are going to achieve. And they have met all their goals so far. Why do we have to spend so much time in this Chamber saying that makes a good deal of sense? We know it is something that is working. Why don't we try to accept it? That is all we are looking for--for the words ``student achievement'' to be included in the criteria. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. I just wanted to give the assurance to--if you will yield 15 seconds--to the Senator from Maine, as far as I am concerned, she is always effective, whether it is that clear voice that comes out from the northeast part of the country, we always listen and take great care what she says.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I know the afternoon is moving along, but we are making some progress. Even as we are trying to find some areas of common ground, let me just respond specifically to the Senator from Tennessee on his provisions in this and on his statement that the criteria in this results in greater performance standards than in Title I. It is difficult to see that, because, under the provisions under Title I, the State has developed and implemented the challenging State content standard, challenging student performance standards and aligned assessments described in the Elementary/Secondary Act, and therefore it has content standards and performance standards included, while, in this legislation, Ed-Flex, it says, ``made substantial progress as determined towards development.'' So, I think we are headed in the right direction, but I don't want anyone to think we have tougher standards in this particular proposal than we do in the underlying Title I. 
   Specifically in the managers' package, on page 3, you have findings:  
   To achieve the State goals for the education of children in the State, the focus must be on results in raising the achievement of all students, not process.  
   I agree. Amen. That is exactly what we want to try to use as a measurable fact. But it is only a finding, it is not part of the operative language. This is a good idea, and that is exactly what we are trying to do, to make sure that we are going to have the students' achievement and performance, as we have outlined in the earlier debate. Managers' amendment, page 6, says an ``Eligible State'' is a State that:  
   ..... waives State statutory or regulatory requirements relating to education while holding local educational agencies or schools within the State that are affected by such waivers accountable for the performance of the students who are affected by such waivers.  
   We want to see the whole State, not just the local communities. We are able to take what the Senator has put as a finding--and we agree and put that into language--and to make sure that the State is going to have compliance, that particular provision says that a State will hold local districts accountable for results. It does nothing to say that the State will evaluate whether they have done so. It does nothing more to ensure that the State's overall waiver plans to achieve student achievement. If we have that, we have solved at least the major problem. 
   Look at page 9 in the managers' package, ``Local Application'' shall:  
   ..... describe for each school year, specific, measurable, educational goals, which may include progress toward increased school and student performance, for each local educational agency or school affected by the proposed waiver.......  
   We could solve at least one part of this by instead of saying ``may include'' saying ``shall include.'' ``Shall include.'' All we are trying to do is to make sure that--while giving the States and local communities flexibility--the fundamental purpose of Title I is going to be achieved for the reasons that have been illustrated in the very impressive report that has come out in the last 2 days about the successes of Title I. We want to make sure when we are providing this, that the principal criterion is going to be student achievement, and that is what we are going to do. The words are used but we do not find it applicable, in terms of the statewide program. 
   As I say here on page 9:  
   Local application shall describe for each school year specific measurable educational goals which may include progress toward increased school and student performance.......  
   Isn't this all about the performance of the children? Isn't that what we are attempting to achieve? That is why we are spending the resources, to enhance the students' performance. That is what we are doing. As we are prepared to see greater flexibility, we are simply saying: Okay, you get the flexibility, all we are asking for is student performance and achievement. That is what the basic debate on this is. 
   In the managers' package, on page 11 on State waiver approval, it says:

   Mr. KENNEDY. What we are effectively doing under the existing proposal in Ed-Flex is focusing attention on needy children, but there are some specific guarantees under title I; for example, well-qualified teachers to ensure that we are going to seek the academic enhancement and achievement of the children. That is one example. There are a series of those. As I understand the Senator's amendment, without the Senator's amendment, they will be able to waive those as well.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This really has nothing to do with paperwork at all. We have already decided that there are going to be other kinds of safeguards to make sure that the funding is focused in terms of the needy students, but there are some specific guarantees that have been written in there, the ones that I have said. The purpose of the Wellstone amendment is to give assurance that those particular guarantees will not be waived for the neediest children, as I understand it.

   Mr. KENNEDY. This is entirely different than what we talked about in the general Ed-Flex where we had requirements that, for example, you could have a studentwide utilization of resources if it was 50 percent poor, and then if it went down to 45, we said, OK; 40, maybe yes. Those were the general kinds of waivers. But the point that the Senator from Minnesota is trying to say is those specific criteria which have been found by educators who have really spent their lifetime focusing on the needs of the neediest children, such as qualified teachers and some commonsense protections, effectively could be waived if the Senator's amendment is not agreed to.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I will just take a moment of the Senate's time. We had a good opportunity during the course of the afternoon to talk about the student performance. We have worked out language which I think responds certainly to my concerns and, hopefully, is consistent with what Senator FRIST and Senator JEFFORDS were doing. Now the States will be able to receive Ed-Flex, but they will also--in the application, there will be an indication about what their expectation in the State is in terms of the students' performance, consistent with what the overall State plan is to enhance academic achievement. It also will take in student performance after 5 years, should there be the request for the continuation of this legislation. 
   I thank my colleagues and friends. I think we really have the best of all worlds here. I am grateful to Senator JEFFORDS and Senator FRIST for working this through.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I welcome the opportunity that the Senate of the United States now in this early part of March will be considering various education policy questions because I believe, like other Members of this body, that the issues of education are of central concern to families all over America. I firmly believe that what families all over America are looking for is some form of partnership between the local community, the State, and the Federal Government, working in harmony to try to enhance the academic achievement and accomplishment for the young people in this country. 
   I think all of us are very much aware that enhancing education achievement is a complex issue, and therefore we have a variety of different kinds of ideas about how best that can be achieved. I think all of us understand that the Federal role has been a limited role. It has been a limited role in identifying where, as a matter of national policy, we want to give focus and attention to children in this country. Historically, that has been the focus and attention in terms of the neediest, the disadvantaged children in this country. 
   There have been other areas. For example, those that have some special needs. We have also been helpful in providing help and assistance to schools in terms of nutrition programs, breakfast and lunch programs. There has been a program in terms of the bilingual, help and assistance in Goals 2000 under President Clinton to try and help and assist local communities 
   to move ahead in terms of education reform, and a number of other very important areas. 
   Tomorrow we will begin the debate on education policy. The issue that is going to be before the Senate will be whether we are going to provide additional kinds of flexibility to the States and the school districts in their use of a number of the Federal programs that reach out into the communities. 
   In 1994, we had reauthorization of the title 1 program. I joined in the initiative with Senator Hatfield. It was his initiative in providing a test program where we permitted a number of States to effectively waive the regulations on the title I programs with the assurance that the objective of the title I programs would be maintained and that the resources could be targeted to needy children. We have seen over a period of time a number of States take advantage of this flexibility. 
   There have been other school districts which have had the opportunity to make application--some of them have, but not many. What is before the Senate now is the consideration to effectively permit greater flexibility in the States and local communities for the using of title I funds. Ninety percent of the waivers that have been considered to date have been on the title I programs. There are other programs that can be waivers, but those have been the title I programs. 
   By and large, it is for reasons that have been best established within the local community. There have been waivers granted when they have not been able to reach a 50-percent standard of poor and needy children. It might be 48 or 45 or in some instances 40-percent poverty children. Without that waiver, there would not be the kinds of additional resources that would be available to that school to help and assist the needy children. 
   Now we are embarked on a more extensive kind of a consideration of a waiver program. What I think we understand is if we are going to get into providing additional waivers, we need to have important accountability about how these resources that are going to be expended are going to be used to help and assist the academic achievement of the targeted group, which are the neediest children. Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to go over that particular issue with Senator FRIST and others after we have an opportunity to move toward the bill. 
   Mr. President, I think, quite frankly, I would have agreed that there is a certain logic in considering the waiver provisions when we reauthorize the total bill. I don't have an objection to the consideration of this legislation. It may be a valuable tool in terms of a local community if we are going to be assured that these scarce resources that we have available that today are targeted on the neediest children, are going to go to the neediest children; that we are going to ensure that parents are going to be involved in any decisions; that it is going to affect those children, and that we are going to maintain our content and performance standards which are out there now so we can have some opportunity to be assured that those children are actually benefiting from any alteration or change from what has been the Federal policy; and that there will be ultimately the judgment of the Secretary of Education that if the measure is going to violate the fundamental principle of the intent of the legislation, then the power still retains within the Secretary of Education not to permit  such a waiver to move ahead. That is basically the initial issue that we will be debating. 
   We will also, I think, have an important opportunity to debate the President's proposal for smaller class size. That is something which is very, very important. We made a downpayment with Republicans and Democrats alike at the end of the last session to ensure additional schoolteachers in local school districts, and now the school districts themselves are going to wonder whether that was really a one-time only or whether it will be as the President intended to be--a commitment over a period of some 6 years. The afterschool programs which have been such a success, which the President and Secretary Riley have talked about--there will be initiatives, hopefully, in those areas. There are excellent programs by Senator BINGAMAN in terms of school dropouts that has been accepted in the past by this body; I hope we will be able to give attention to that area. 
   There will be a limited but important group of amendments which we think can be enormously helpful and valuable to our local communities in terms of being that kind of constructive partner in enhancing the education for the children of this country. 
   So that is where we are going, and I welcome the chance to have that debate over the period of these next several days. There are many things that are important in this session, but this will be one of the most important. 
   Finally, let me say I want to pay tribute to my friend and associate from Minnesota, Senator WELLSTONE, who has very strong views in terms of making sure these resources are going to actually be targeted to the neediest children in this country. He has been an effective and forceful fighter for those children. I know he will speak for himself, but he really questions whether any of these kinds of waivers can still give the kinds of assurances, as we have them in the current legislation, that will target those funds to the children. It is a powerful case that he makes--one that should be listened to by our colleagues--and it is a very persuasive case that he makes. We have come to a different conclusion, but I have enormous respect and friendship for him. 
   I must say that our colleagues should listen to him carefully on the points he is making, because I think he speaks for the neediest children in this country, as he has so often. It is a position that is a respectable position and I think a very defensible position, and I think it underlies the kind of central concerns many of us have if we fail to have the kind of accountability that hopefully will be included in the legislation. So I thank him for all of his work and for his consistency in protecting the title I children. I hope that all of our colleagues will pay close attention to what I know will be a very important statement. 
   I yield whatever time I have back, Mr. President. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps continue to perform their duties superbly in the defense of our nation. Today, as our nation prepares for the possibility of sending 4,000 marines and Army troops as part of a peacekeeping force for Kosovo, we must do all we can to support all our forces who sacrifice so much to serve and protect this country. 
   Our service men and women deserve a pay raise, and they deserve fair retirement benefits. If we don't make significant improvements in these two areas, we will continue to fail to recruit and retain the forces needed to maintain our nation's military readiness and protect our national security. 
   I voted to report S. 4 out of the Armed Services Committee, and I support this legislation. I remain concerned, however, that we are moving too quickly, without adequately considering the budget impact or the best means to recruit and retain our talented service men and women. Clearly, action by Congress is needed to meet the needs of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines, but we have not yet adequately considered the full impact, including the long-term impact of these policy changes on our troops and our defense budget. 
   The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Chiefs, themselves, have testified about the need for reforms in military retirement plans, and they have expressed their support for a significant and much-needed pay raise. But, we have not held any hearings at all on the specifics of this bill. 
   Secretary Cohen expressed his concerns about the overall impact of this legislation in a letter to Senator LEVIN last Friday. The Secretary said he appreciated the Senate's attention to this critical issue, but he also emphasized his concern about the high cost of this legislation and about the lack of hearings to discuss the bill's impact on our service men and women. 
   Our Armed Forces are facing complex challenges. Military recruiting has tremendous difficulties. In the last few months, the Army and Navy have announced they must reduce their recruiting standards in order to meet their recruiting goals. The Air Force, facing an unusual drop-off in new recruits, announced that for the first time it will use national television advertising in its recruiting. 
   Our Armed Forces are having increasing difficulty retaining highly-skilled personnel. Retention of mid-level officers and enlisted personnel is the lowest it has been in many years. These mid-grade personnel are the backbone of our Armed Forces. They lead and train new service members. They provide critical continuity between high-level commanders and individual soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines. We cannot afford to lose these irreplaceable leaders. 
   Recruiting and retention are in critical condition. Our margin for error is gone, and we must ensure that the policies we enact are the best ones. That is why many of us have serious reservations about how we are proceeding. We have too little information about whether these proposals are cost-effective or will do enough to boost morale, increase retention, or improve recruiting. 
   We are all concerned about the readiness of our Armed Forces. But further consideration of these far-reaching proposals is essential. Before this bill reaches the President's desk, we need a far better understanding of this bill's impact on our service men and women and on the overall budget.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I support this amendment. We are all concerned about reports of declining retention in our Armed Forces. Our midgrade officers and enlisted personnel are leaving the service at alarming rates. This amendment directly addresses this critical problem by focusing special and incentive pays on areas where the Armed Forces face the greatest retention challenges. 
   The readiness of our Armed Forces must be a top priority. Our service men and women are an indispensable part of our Nation's defense. We must act to improve retention in order to ensure the readiness of our Armed Forces. In today's tight budget environment, it is imperative that we efficiently use our taxpayers' dollars. Special and incentive pays are an effective way to increase retention while being mindful of costs. 
   Our amendment responds to the needs of the Armed Services by authorizing programs that the services specifically want and that are ready to be implemented. These programs have been thoroughly researched by the services and will have an immediate impact on retention. 
   At the Senate Armed Services Readiness Hearing in January, Admiral Jay Johnson, the Chief of Naval Operations, agreed with my assessment that current Navy retention rates will result in the Navy having 50 percent fewer Surface Warfare Officers than needed. Officers in these positions have never been authorized to receive special pay incentives, and retention of these men and women is now among the lowest of any officer community in the Armed Forces. This amendment gives the Navy a flexible means to address this critical retention issue, and will give the same flexibility to the other services in the specific areas where the most attention is needed. 
   In these critical times for recruiting and retention of military personnel, we must enact sensible legislation that provides the services with effective flexibility in the management of their personnel challenges. No one knows the full effects of retention problems more than the services themselves. We need to give the services the tools they need so they can help ensure the readiness of our Armed Forces. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this amendment and I commend Senator ROBB  and Senator CLELAND for their leadership on this amendment.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Every four years, citizens of our country exercise one of the most important rights of our democracy--the right to vote for the President of the United States. This constitutional privilege is valued by all Americans and envied by millions around the world. It proves that the will of the majority will prevail, and that power will be transferred peacefully through the election process from one President to the next, time and again. 
   The essence of our democracy is the power of the right to vote. Many of our greatest battles in the Senate and the country in recent decades have been waged to extend and protect that right. 
   I think especially of the Voting Rights Acts, which have been at the heart of our civil rights debates. I think of our success in 1970 in lowering the voting age to 18, so that young Americans who were old enough to fight in the Vietnam War would be old enough to vote about that war, which America never should have fought. I think of the Supreme Court's great decision on one person, one vote, and our efforts in Congress to protect it. 
   I also think of the success of democracy in other lands--in Chile and Argentina and other nations in our hemisphere--and in Greece, in South Africa, and in many other countries. 
   The Framers of the Constitution clearly understood the fundamental place of the right to vote in the new democracy they were creating. They clearly did not intend the Impeachment Clause to nullify the vote of the people, except in the most extraordinary cases of great danger to the nation. 
   The entire history of the debates at the Constitutional Convention demonstrates their clear intent to limit impeachment as narrowly as possible, to prevent a willful partisan majority in Congress from undermining the right to vote and the power of the President the people had elected. 
   The Framers of the Constitution also made clear that the President was not to be subordinate to the Senate or the House of Representatives. The new government they created was based on another fundamental principle as well--the principle of separation of powers among the three coequal branches of government--the Executive Branch, the Legislative Branch, and the Judicial Branch. They specifically did not create a parliamentary system of government, in which the President would serve at the pleasure of Congress. 
   In their wisdom, the Framers recognized that in certain extreme cases, a narrow exception to the orderly transfer of Presidential power through national elections every four years was necessary to protect the nation from an abusive President. And so they created the impeachment process, by  which the President could be removed from office by the Senate and the House of Representatives in extreme cases where the President had committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors''. 
   The Framers of the Constitution made clear that the orderly transfer of Presidential power through national elections was to be scrupulously followed. They took great care to guarantee that this transfer would rarely, if ever, be undermined by the impeachment of the President. Removal of the President would come only after the House of Representatives--with the sole power to impeach--and the Senate--with the sole power to conduct a trial--found that the President had committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' a term borrowed from the English impeachment experience. 
   Clearly, the Framers intended the House and the Senate to use the impeachment power cautiously, and not wield it promiscuously for partisan political purposes. Sadly, in this case, Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the Framers rejected--recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people. 
   First, Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee essentially swallowed the referral of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr whole, without seriously questioning it or calling any witnesses. They used the referral as the foundation for Articles of Impeachment which were released to the public before the White House counsel had an opportunity to complete their testimony before the Committee. 
   Why were the House Judiciary Committee and the House of Representatives on the fast track to impeachment? Because, as House Manager Hyde told the Senate, ``we were operating under time constraints which were self-imposed but I promised my colleagues to finish it before the end of the year. I didn't want to drag it out.'' In the battle between speed and fairness, should speed have prevailed over fairness? Clearly not. But the lame duck Republican House of Representatives was bent on acting before the last Congress ended, fearful that their slimmer majority in the current Congress would not approve any articles of impeachment at all. 
   In their most blatant attempt of all to stack the deck against the President, the House Republican leadership refused to allow a fair vote on censure as an alternative to impeachment an alternative that would have ended this unseemly charade two 
   months ago. Instead, Members of the House were given a single choice--a vote to impeach the President or do nothing. 
   After their partisan victory in the House of Representatives, the House Managers brought their vendetta against the President to the Senate. They brought thousands of pages of evidence, containing 22 statements by Monica Lewinsky, 6 statements by Vernon Jordan, 3 statements by Sidney Blumenthal, the videotaped deposition of President Clinton in the Jones case, and the videotaped record of his appearance before the grand jury. Their opening statements attempted to shed the most favorable light on the evidence, but it was quickly apparent that they had not and could not persuade two-thirds of the Senate to remove the President. 
   While trying to persuade Senators to convict President Clinton, the House Managers argued relentlessly for the opportunity to examine witnesses during the trial. The hypocrisy in the position of the House Managers on witnesses was obvious. They did not think it was necessary to call witnesses in the House proceedings. They demeaned the House by their partisan excesses. But they were shameless in their attempt to force the Senate to wallow in witnesses. 
   Our Republican friends have desperately been trying to produce a two-thirds majority to remove the President from office. But their efforts have succeeded only in turning a serious constitutional process into a partisan process that demeaned both the House and the Senate and became a painful ordeal for the entire country. 
   In pursuing the allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice, the House Managers presented an ever changing, constantly shifting list of charges to the Senate. Veteran prosecutors testified before the House Judiciary Committee that they would never prosecute such a case, and that it would be irresponsible for the Senate to attempt to use these allegations as a basis to remove the President from office. 
   Some of the allegations of perjury by the House Managers were laughable. Clearly, it was not perjury for the President to use the phrase ``certain occasions'' to describe the frequency of his contacts with Miss Lewinsky, or to use the word ``occasional'' to describe the frequency of his telephone conversations with her. 
   Even the few allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice that are arguably more serious are far from proven beyond a reasonable doubt, which is the standard that I believe should be applied by the Senate in considering the facts of this case. Indeed, I do not believe they were proved by clear and convincing evidence. But even if any such allegations were true, they still fall far short of the constitutional standard required for impeaching a President and removing him from office. 
   President Clinton's behavior was wrong. All of us condemn it. None of us condones it. He failed to tell the truth about it, and he misled the country for many months. But nothing he did rises to the high constitutional standard required for impeachment and removal of a President from office. 
   I believe that conclusion is required by the Constitution. At the time of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, the Framers engaged in a vigorous debate about the role of the President, the new chief executive they were creating. In addition to determining the basic powers of the office, many of those at the convention debated whether or not impeachment should apply at all to the President. As University of Chicago Law School Professor Cass Sunstein told the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, ``Many of the framers wanted no impeachment power whatsoever . . . [t]hey suggested that in a world of separation of powers and election of the President, there was no place for impeachment. . . . That position was defeated by reference to egregious hypotheticals in which the President betrayed the country during war or got his office through bribery. Those are the cases that persuaded the swing votes that there should be impeachment power.'' In the end, the Framers reluctantly agreed that there might be limited circumstances in which a President should be removed from office by Congress in order to protect the country from great harm, without waiting for the next election. 
   Once the Framers concluded that the President could be removed by the legislature in such cases, they debated the standard for impeachment. Nine days before the final Constitution was signed, the impeachment provision was limited only to treason and bribery. George Mason then argued that the provision was too restrictive, and should be amended to include the phrase, ``or maladministration.'' But, vigorous opposition came from others who believed that such a vague phrase would give Congress too much power to undermine the President. Mason withdrew his original proposal and substituted the phrase, ``other high Crimes and Misdemeanors against the State''--a phrase well-known from English law. 
   The Constitutional Convention adopted the modification by a vote of eight states to three--confident that only serious offenses against the nation would provide the basis for impeachment. Later, the Committee of Style removed the words, ``against the State,'' but because the Committee had been instructed not to change the meaning of any provision, the impeachment clause should be interpreted as it was originally drafted. 
   The debate surrounding the Impeachment Clause was significant. By first expanding and then narrowing the clause, the Framers clearly intended that the President could be removed from office for ``crimes'' beyond treason and bribery, but that he could not be removed for inefficient administration or administration 
   inconsistent with the dominant view in Congress. Impeachment was not to be the illegitimate twin of the English vote of ``No Confidence'' under a parliamentary system of government. The doctrine of separation of powers was paramount.  The President was to serve at the pleasure of the people, not the pleasure of the Congress, and certainly not at the pleasure of a willful partisan majority in the House of Representatives. 
   As Charles Black stated in his highly regarded work on impeachment, the two specific impeachable offenses--treason and bribery--can help identify both the ``ordinary crimes which ought also to be looked upon as impeachable offenses, and those serious misdeeds, not ordinary crimes, which ought to be looked on as impeachable offenses . . .'' Using treason and bribery as ``the miners' canaries,'' Professor Black states that ``high crimes and misdemeanors, in the constitutional sense, ought to be held to be those offenses which are rather obviously wrong, whether or not `criminal,' and which so seriously threaten the order of political society as to make pestilent and dangerous the continuance in power of their perpetrator.'' 
   The distinguished historian, Professor Arthur Schlesinger, told the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, the ``[e]vidence seems to me conclusive that the Founding Fathers saw impeachment as a remedy for grave and momentous offenses against the Constitution; George Mason said, great crimes, great and dangerous offenses, attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' 
   In addition to Professor Schlesinger, over 430 law professors and over 400 historians and constitutional scholars have stated emphatically that the allegations against President Clinton do not meet the standard set by the Constitution for impeachment. The scholarly support for the argument that the charges against President Clinton do not rise to the level of impeachable offenses--even if they are true--is overwhelming, and it cannot be ignored. 
   The law professors wrote, ``[i]t goes without saying that lying under oath is a very serious offense. But even if the House of Representatives had the constitutional authority to impeach for any instance of perjury or obstruction of justice, a responsible House would not exercise this awesome power on the facts alleged in this case.'' 
   The historians wrote, ``[t]he Framers explicitly reserved [impeachment] for high crimes and misdemeanors in the exercise of executive power. Impeachment for anything else would, according to James Madison, leave the President to serve `during the pleasure of the Senate,' thereby mangling the system of checks and balances that is our chief safeguard against abuses of power . . . Although we do not condone President Clinton's private behavior or his subsequent attempts to deceive, the current charges against him depart from what the Framers saw as grounds for impeachment.'' 
   The House Managers apparently made no attempt to obtain scholarly support for their opposition. It is a fair inference that they did not do so because they knew they could not obtain it. 
   The House Managers argue that because the Senate convicted and removed three federal judges for making perjurious statements, we must now convict and remove the President. But, to determine whether or not President Clinton should be removed from office requires the Senate to do more than make simplistic analogies to federal judges. 
   Removal of the President of the United States and removal of a federal judge are vastly different. The President is unique, and his role is in no way comparable to the role of the over 900 federal judges we have today. The impact on the country of removing one of 900 federal judges is infinitesimal, compared to the impact of removing the only President we have. And the people elect the President for a specific four year term, while federal judges are appointed for life, subject to good behavior. These distinctions are obvious, and they make all the difference. 
   Other precedents also undermine the House Managers' insistence that the Senate is bound to remove President Clinton from office. The House Judiciary Committee refused on a bipartisan basis to impeach President Nixon for deliberately lying under oath to the Internal Revenue Service, although he under reported his taxable income by at least $796,000. During the 1974 Judiciary Committee debates, many Republican and Democratic members of the Committee agreed that tax fraud was not the kind of abuse of power that impeachment was designed to remedy. 
   Finally, the House Managers argue that President Clinton must be removed to protect the rule of law and cleanse the office. It is not enough, they say, that he can be prosecuted once he leaves office. But protecting the rule of law under the Constitution is not the proper standard for removal of the President. Before impeaching and convicting the President, the Senate must find that he committed ``Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' As Professor Laurence Tribe testified before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, ``[i]f the proposition is that when the President is a law breaker, has committed any crime, then the rule of law and the take care clause requires that one impeach him, then we have rewritten the [impeachment] clause.'' 
   The Constitution has guided our country well for two centuries. The decision we make now goes far beyond this President. As we decide whether President Clinton will be removed from office, the future of the Presidency and the well-being of our democracy itself are at stake. 
   How will history remember this Congress? The Radical Republicans in the middle of the 19th century were condemned in the eyes of history for using impeachment as a partisan vendetta against President Andrew Johnson. And I believe the Radical Republicans at the end of the 20th century will be condemned even more severely by history for their partisan vendetta against President Clinton. 
   The impeachment process was never intended to become a weapon for a partisan majority in Congress to attack the President. To do so is a violation of the fundamental separation of powers doctrine at the heart of the Constitution. It is an invitation to future partisan majorities in future Congresses to use the impeachment power to undermine the President. It could weaken Republican and Democratic Presidents alike for years to come. 
   This case is a constitutional travesty. We deplore the conduct of President Clinton that led to this yearlong distraction for the nation. But we should deplore even more the partisan attempt to abuse the Constitution by misusing the impeachment power.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is a privilege to join with Senator DOMENICI in introducing the PRIME Act--the Program for Investment in Micro-Entrepreneurs. This important idea is part of President Clinton's budget for Fiscal Year 2000. It deserves bipartisan support and I look forward to working closely with Senator DOMENICI to achieve its passage early this year. 
   The nation's entrepreneurial spirit is thriving, fueled by the record-breaking economic growth and prosperity that we currently enjoy. But, many deserving entrepreneurs still face unfair challenges that limit their ability to turn innovative ideas into successful businesses that create new jobs. They need skills and technical training in the business basics needed to take their ideas to the next level--starting their own firms. 
   The PRIME Act will help entrepreneurs close the gap between worthwhile ideas and successful businesses. It will provide $105 million dollars over the next four years to build skills in record keeping, planning, management, marketing, and computer technology, and other basic business practices. 
   The Community Development Financial Institutions Fund in the Treasury Department is now the lead federal agency for micro-enterprise activities across the country, and the PRIME Act will enhance these efforts in several specific ways: 
   It will provide grants for micro-enterprise organizations across the country that assist disadvantaged and low-income entrepreneurs and provide them with essential training and education. 
   It will encourage the development of new micro-enterprise organizations, and expand existing ones to reach more entrepreneurs. 
   It will enhance research on innovative and successful ways of encouraging these new businesses and enabling them to succeed. 
   Under the Act, between $15 and $35 million in grants will be available each year to organizations that work with entrepreneurs. The President's fiscal year 2000 budget proposes $15 million for the program. Local groups will leverage these funds with their own public and private resources to increase the overall assistance that will be available. 
   Massachusetts and New Mexico are already leaders in this effort. The business communities and local banks in our states have made significant investments in creating loan capital for micro-entrepreneurs to start their own businesses. Non-profit organizations working with micro-entrepreneurs on this effort have worked closely with us on this legislation. We look forward to working with them and with other members of Congress to give micro-entrepreneurs across the country the greater opportunity they deserve to realize their potential. 
   By investing in micro-entrepreneurs, we will be harnessing the spirit and ideas of large numbers of Americans and creating new opportunities for self-sufficiency. We'll be creating new small businesses that will strengthen local economies in communities across the country. And that in turn will help to keep our national economy strong as well. This is worthwhile legislation, and I urge the Senate to approve it.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America lost one of its greatest citizens and greatest patrons of the arts last week with the death of Paul Mellon. All of us who knew him admired his passion for the arts, his extraordinary taste and insights, and his lifelong dedication to our country and to improving the lives of others. 
   He was widely known and loved for many different aspects of his philanthropy in many states, including Massachusetts. Perhaps his greatest gift of all to the nation is here in the nation's capital--the National Gallery of Art. The skill and care and support which he devoted to the Gallery for over half a century brilliantly fulfilled his father's gift to the nation. He made the Gallery what it is today--a world-renowned museum containing many of the greatest masterpieces of our time and all time, a fitting and inspiring monument to the special place of the arts in America's history and heritage. 
   I believe that all Americans and peoples throughout the world who care about the arts are mourning the loss of Paul Mellon. We are proud of his achievements and his enduring legacy to the nation. We will miss him very much.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, America's children--from the smallest premature baby to the tallest teenager--deserve access to doctors trained specifically in meeting their health needs. I commend Senator KERREY's leadership in this bipartisan legislation introduced today to provide greater support to children's hospitals, so that they can continue to train the kinds of doctors that children need. 
   In the United States, there are 53 freestanding pediatric hospitals--less than 1% of all the hospitals in the country. Yet they train more than a quarter of all pediatricians and more than half of all pediatric specialists. These hospitals also help train other doctors who need experience in taking care of children--including family doctors, neurologists, and surgeons. 
   Children's hospitals typically provide care for the sickest children--those whose medical needs are not easily met in the local and community hospitals. Patients in children's hospitals include a higher percentage of our nation's uninsured children and low-income children. These hospitals are the source of many new lifesaving strategies, such as treating childhood cancer and helping premature babies to breathe. 
   But the ability of children's hospitals to train doctors is in increasing jeopardy. Funds for training residents are declining as changes take place in the ways we pay for our health care. For most hospitals, support for graduate medical education is funded through Medicare. But since freestanding children's hospitals treat almost no Medicare patients, they receive almost no federal support or other support for training their residents. 
   Democrats and Republicans recognize that qualified children's physicians are needed as much as other types of physicians. Under this bill, the Department of Health and Human Services is authorized to provide support to freestanding children's hospitals for such training. It means that children's hospitals will receive the same level of support that this country gives to other teaching hospitals. Under this legislation funds will be distributed fairly, by using a formula that considers variations across the country in the cost of such training. Safeguards are included to guarantee that the dollars are spent only when residents are actually trained. 
   President Clinton's budget recognizes this high priority. It includes a $40 million downpayment until this legislation is enacted. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration to assure early passage of this needed legislation. I commend both the President  and the First Lady for their strong commitment to children and for their indispensable leadership on this important issue. Action by Congress is needed now. We must work together to make a long-term commitment to enable children's hospitals to train the physicians of the future to care for children.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, senior citizens deserve coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare, and it is time for Congress to see that they get it. 
   Medicare is a compact between workers and their government that says, ``Work hard, pay into the system when you are young, and we will guarantee health security in your retirement.'' But that commitment is being broken every day, because Medicare does not cover prescription drugs. 
   Prescription drug bills eat up a disproportionate share of the income of the typical elderly household. Senior citizens spend three times more of their income on health care than persons under 65, and they account for one-third of all prescription drug expenditures. Yet they make-up only 12 percent of the population. 
   The greatest gap in Medicare--and the greatest anachronism--is its failure to cover prescription drugs. 
   Because of this gap and other gaps in Medicare coverage, and the growing cost of the Part B premium, Medicare now pays only 50% of the out-of-pocket medical costs of the elderly. On average, senior citizens now spend almost as much of their income on health care as they did before Medicare was enacted. 
   Prescription drugs are the single largest out-of-pocket cost to the elderly for health services. The average senior citizen fills an average of eighteen prescriptions a year, and takes four to six prescriptions daily. Many elderly Americans face monthly drug bills of $100 or more.  
   When Medicare was enacted in 1965, coverage of prescription drugs in private insurance policies was rare--and Medicare followed that standard practice. Today, 99 percent of employment-based health insurance policies provide prescription drug coverage--99 percent. But Medicare is caught in a 34-year-old time warp--and senior citizens are suffering as a result. 
   Too many elderly Americans today face a cruel choice between food on the table and the medicine they need to stay healthy or to treat their illnesses. Too many senior citizens often take only half the pills their doctor prescribes, or don't even fill needed prescriptions--because they can't afford the high cost of the drugs. Too often, they are paying twice as much as they should for their prescription drugs, because they are forced to pay full price when those with private insurance policies get the advantage of negotiated discounts. As a result, many senior citizens end up in the hospital--at excessive cost to Medicare--because they aren't obtaining the drugs they need or are not taking them correctly. As we enter the new century, pharmaceutical products are increasingly the source of miracle cures for many dread diseases--and senior citizens will be left even farther behind if we fail to act. 
   The 21st century may well be the century of life sciences. With the support of the American people, Congress is on the way to the goal of doubling the budget of the National Institutes of Health over the next five years. This investment is seed money for the additional basic research that will enable scientists to develop new therapies to improve and extend the lives of senior citizens and all citizens. 
   In 1998 alone, private industry spent more than $21 billion for research on new medicines and to bring them to the public. These miracle drugs save lives--and they save dollars too, by preventing unnecessary hospitalization and expensive surgery. All patients deserve affordable access to these medications. Yet, Medicare, which is the nation's largest insurer, does not cover outpatient prescription drugs, and senior citizens and persons with disabilities pay a heavy daily price for this glaring omission. 
   America's senior citizens and disabled citizens deserve to benefit from new discoveries in the same way that other families do. Yet, without negotiating power, they receive the brunt of cost-shifting--with often devastating results. In the words of a recent report by Standard & Poor's, ``Drugmakers have historically raised prices to private customers to compensate for the discounts they grant to managed care consumers.'' The so-called ``private'' customers referred to in this report are largely our nation's mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles, grandmothers, and grandfathers. 
   Up to 19 million Medicare beneficiaries are forced to fend for themselves when it comes to purchasing these life-saving and life-improving therapies. They have no prescription drug coverage from any source. Other Medicare beneficiaries have some coverage, but too often it is inadequate, unreliable and unaffordable. 
   About 6 percent of senior citizens have limited coverage through a Medicare HMO. While the majority of Medicare HMO plans offer prescription drug coverage, the benefits vary widely. Some plans cap the benefit at just $300 a year or less. Imagine that, $300 a year or less. In addition, the current trend is for HMOs to cut back on drug coverage or, in extreme cases, leave the Medicare market altogether. We have tried to remedy this problem in Massachusetts, but clearly it is a national problem, and it requires a national solution. 
   An additional 12 percent of Medicare beneficiaries purchase an independent medigap policy with prescription drug coverage and coverage of other gaps in Medicare. Only three of the ten standard medigap benefit packages even include insurance for prescription drugs. These plans are difficult to obtain, because even the most generous companies refuse to cover all people who walk in the door. 
   They fear that only those who urgently need the coverage will sign up, so the plans contain escape clauses that exclude applicants with pre-existing conditions. Even if they decide to issue a policy, often there are no limits on what these private companies can charge. As a result, medigap plans with drug coverage are often out of reach for senior citizens. For those fortunate enough to obtain the coverage, the benefits are limited and the costs are high. 
   Another 10 percent are Medicare beneficiaries are eligible for coverage under Medicaid. This coverage is an important part of the safety net for our poorest elderly and disabled citizens, but it offers no help to the vast majority of senior citizens. 
   Finally, a third of all Medicare beneficiaries have reasonably comprehensive coverage through a retiree health plan. These plans, which are offered through their former employers, supplement Medicare, and the prescription drug benefits are often generous. But increasingly, retiree health benefits are on the chopping block as companies cut costs by reducing health spending. 
   Despite Medicare's lack of coverage for prescription drugs, their misuse results in preventable illnesses that cost Medicare as much as $16 billion annually, while imposing vast misery on senior citizens. It is in our best interest, and in the best interest of Medicare, to reform it in ways that encourage proper use and minimize these abuses. 
   Savings can be achieved when physicians and pharmacists are better educated on the needs of senior citizens and the potential problems they face in obtaining and using their medications. 
   Savings can also be achieved when senior citizens are assisted in learning how to follow the instructions that are dispensed with their medications. Too often, patients shortchange themselves. They take half doses or try to stretch out their prescription to make it last longer. This is wrong, and it doesn't have to happen. If elderly patients know that the drugs they need will be affordable, compliance will improve, and so will their quality of life. 
   President Clinton has correctly identified prescription drug coverage as one of the very highest priorities for Medicare reform. I hope we can reach a broad bipartisan consensus in the coming weeks that any Medicare reform worth the name will include coverage of prescription drugs. The health and financial security of millions of senior citizens depend on it, and we owe it to them to act as soon as possible. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join my colleagues in introducing the Work Incentives Improvement Act to provide affordable and accessible health care for persons with disabilities so they can work and live independently. 
   Despite the extraordinary growth and prosperity the country is now enjoying, people with disabilities continue to struggle to live independently and become fully contributing members of their communities. We have made significant progress through special education programs that open new horizons for excellence in learning, and through rehabilitation programs that develop practical independent living skills. 
   Too often, however, the goal of independence is still out of reach. We need to do more to see that the benefits of our prosperous economy are truly available to all Americans, including those with disabilities. Disabled children and adults deserve access to the benefits and support they need to achieve their full potential. 
   Large numbers of the 54 million disabled Americans have the capacity to work and become productive citizens. But they are unable to do so because of the unnecessary barriers they face. For too long, people with disabilities have suffered from unfair penalties if they go to work. They are in danger of losing their cash benefits if they accept a paying job. They are in danger of losing the medical coverage, which may well mean the difference between life and death. Too often, they face a harsh choice between eating a decent meal and buying their needed medication. 
   The bipartisan legislation we are introducing today will help to remove these unfair barriers. It will make health insurance coverage more widely available, through opportunities to buy-in to Medicare and Medicaid at an affordable rate. It will phase out the loss of cash benefits as income rises--instead of the unfair sudden cut-off that so many workers with disabilities face today. It will bring greater access for people with disabilities to the services they need in order to become successfully employed. 
   Our goal is to restructure and improve existing disability programs so that they do more to encourage and support every disabled person's dream to work and live independently, and be productive and contributing members of their community. That goal should be the birthright of all Americans--and when we say all, we mean all. 
   This bill is the right thing to do, it is the cost effective thing to do, and now is the time to do it. For too long, our fellow disabled citizens have been left out and left behind. A new and brighter day is on the horizon for Americans with disabilities, and together we can make it a reality. 
   I especially commend Senator JEFFORDS, Senator ROTH and Senator MOYNIHAN for their impressive leadership on this issue. We look forward to working with all members of Congress to pass this landmark legislation that will give disabled persons across the country a better opportunity to fulfill their dreams and participate fully in the social and economic mainstream of the nation.

    Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today Senators MIKULSKI, WELLSTONE, KERRY, and I are introducing the America After School Act. With this legislation, the nation can do much more to provide the care and activities that children need when they are not in school. 
   Over 17 million parents rely on others to care for their children before and after the school bell rings each day. Over 5 million children are left home alone after school. The need for responsible after-school activities is urgent. Hundreds of thousands of families are on waiting lists across the country for such programs. 
   Today's students deserve the best and brightest future possible. After school programs provide a unique opportunity to help to meet this challenge. Tutoring, mentoring, recreational, and cultural activities are all key components of strong, stimulating after school programs. These activities can help young men and women strengthen their computer skills, explore prospective careers, learn about the arts, and develop their physical fitness. They are an investment in education, children, and our future. 
   After school programs help reduce crime. Police across the nation report that juvenile delinquency peaks between 3 and 8 p.m. each day. We know that unsupervised children are more likely to engage in destructive behavior. Effective after school programs help keep young people off the streets, away from gangs, and out of trouble. All children deserve a safe and productive environment in which to spend their time out of school. 
   Parents want safe, effective after school programs for their children, and this legislation helps meet that need. The legislation significantly expands after school care for low-income families by increasing the Child Care and Development Block Grant. Title I of the bill, authorizes a $3 billion increase in such grants over the next 5 years. With this higher level of investment, we can reduce waiting lists and provide after school care to hundreds of thousands of additional children from low-income working families. Communities with high concentrations of poverty and at-risk youth will receive priority for this funding, so that the help will be available where it is needed most. The needs of children with disabilities are also specifically addressed. 
   After school programs should challenge children, stimulate their curiosity, and enhance their creativity. We get what we pay for. On the average, child care providers earn less than bus drivers and garbage collectors. We need stronger incentives to develop and retain skilled child care providers. Our bill designates 25 percent of the increase for indirect services that include salary incentives for training care givers. 
   Our bill also strengthens and expands the 21st Century Learning Centers program. In the last Congress, we provided $200 million to expand this worthwhile program and increase after school programs to serve up to a half million more children. This action was an important step forward--but even with this increase, a tremendous need remains. 
   To address this problem, President Clinton has proposed to triple the federal investment in these centers: The additional funds will ensure that one million more youths will be in safe, effective after school care. Our America After School Act builds on this momentum. By strengthening the 21st Century Learning Centers program, we will provide greater opportunities for hundreds of thousands more children and their families. This additional funding will support mentoring programs, academic assistance programs, and drug, alcohol, and gang prevention activities. 
   Title III of this bill provides $1.25 billion over the next five years to expand grants by the Justice Department for after-school programs to prevent juvenile delinquency. Both public and private agencies will be eligible to apply for these grants, and awards will be made on a matching basis. To maximize its effectiveness, recipients must coordinate their efforts with state and local law enforcement officials. After school educational and recreational programs in high crime neighborhoods will receive priority, since children in these neighborhoods face the highest risk. 
   We must do all we can to prepare students for the future. Providing safe and worthwhile afterschool activities is an essential part of achieving this goal. We owe our children no less.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, first of all, I wish to join our colleagues in commending our leader for an excellent presentation on the unfinished agenda of the past Congress, as these are really the opening moments of the Congress in terms of dealing with our legislative agenda. It is entirely appropriate that our leaders speak to what we hope will be accomplished during this Congress. Tonight we will listen to the President of the United States meet his responsibilities under the Constitution, addressing the State of the Union. In the next day or so we will hear from the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives, Mr. GEPHARDT, who will outline an agenda for the country as well. 
   I must at this time say how impressed I am with the outlines of this very thoughtful proposal, a real challenge for the Congress as we begin our important legislative undertakings. 
   We currently have extraordinary economic prosperity in the United States. It is the excellent leadership of President Clinton, Vice President GORE, and the Administration that has put us into a position to have the strongest economy we have had in any recent period of time, with both economic growth and price stability. That is reflected in enhanced hopes and dreams for working families all across this country. 
   There are those who have not participated in that economic expansion as much as others, however. We hear the concerns expressed by our Democratic leader, and we will also hear the President tonight speak about how we can make our society a fairer and a more just society and how we can enhance the opportunity to reach out to those who are struggling hard, playing by the rules, trying to provide for their families, who also ought to be able to enjoy the kind of prosperity that we are experiencing. 
   The Democratic leader outlined a number of different areas with which working families in the United States are most concerned. Sure, we have many--about 75, 78 percent--of our working families that have some kind of health insurance, even though those numbers are gradually dropping and have been dropping quite precipitously in the last 3 or 4 years. But we want to make sure that those working families are going to be able to have health care decisions made by their doctors and by their nurses and not by the insurance companies. 
   That is why I joined with our Democratic leader in strong support of the Patients' Bill of Rights, a proposal that is effectively supported by every major medical society, every patient organization, and every nursing organization in the country. 
   We have asked and invited our Republican friends and colleagues to join with us. We have tried to point out the inadequacies of their particular proposal in the fact that it only covers a third of the Americans who are covered by any kind of health insurance, leaving two-thirds of the members of the American family out. But we have been unable to get them to join with us. The professional health community says the way to go is with the health care  bill of rights as introduced by the Democratic leader. 
   Mr. President, the Democratic leader and the President outline another major concern that working families have, and that is the quality of education for their children. Sure, there is primary responsibility for education at the local level, and there is a State interest, but it should also be a matter of national priority. We are looking for partnerships. We are looking for ways of being able to work together. 
   This particular proposal which the Democratic leader has outlined, has recognized what the General Accounting Office recognized over 2 years ago, and that is that the cost to repair public schools in the United States of America, if they were all to be repaired, would be $110 billion. The President and the Democratic Party stand for trying to help and assist local communities to provide for that reconstruction and, importantly, the modernization of the schools, to work in partnership with the States--not only in terms of the construction but also to make sure we are going to have a qualified teacher in every classroom, that the classrooms, particularly in the early grades, are going to be smaller, and that there are going to be the afterschool programs to help keep children out of trouble and to help and assist children who may be falling further behind to be able to enhance their academic achievements and accomplishments. That makes a great deal of sense, Mr. President. 
   These particular proposals will be advanced for debate and discussion in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. We are looking forward to that. We are doing the country's business in working in partnership with States and local communities. 
   There is also urgency, in terms of ensuring that the parents of working families are going to be secure, in dealing with Social Security. We will hear an outline this evening. The President was good enough to invite Democrats and Republicans to come to the White House and to sit down with him to try to find some common ground. We will hear tonight that he is still strongly committed to trying to work this out in a bipartisan, nonpartisan way. It is the only way that that can be managed. And that is going to be very important. It will be a top priority for our seniors, our children, and our working families. 
   As the leader has pointed out, there will be an additional program to try to help and assist with many of the needs of the children of this country. That is going to be in legislation which he has outlined here today and which many of us have been interested in in terms of the early start programs, the pre-K programs. We talked to the Nation and made a commitment with the Governors some years ago that every child was going to be ready for school. We have to continue with that commitment. We want every child to be ready for school. 
   We want tough standards at schools. We want to make sure that graduation is more than just an attendance program--that it means children have learned in these schools. I believe we are going to hear about excellent programs this evening and we have the Public Schools Excellence Act's inclusion in education. 
   The list goes on for the elderly, including the continuation of the Older Americans Act, the Early Medicare Access Act, and Medicare coverage of prescription drugs. I hope we are going to be able, in this Congress, to address the issue of prescription drugs, which is of urgency for so many of our elderly and citizens with disabilities. It is such a burden--we find many of our citizens have to make a choice between the prescriptions that they need and a good meal. 
   Finally, I want to just mention the sense of hope that we have, many of us, as we look forward to this Congress. Just last week at the White House, the President indicated his strong support for legislation which has been introduced by Senator JEFFORDS from Vermont, Senator ROTH from Delaware, and cosponsored by myself and Senator MOYNIHAN, with regard to ensuring that those individuals, some 54 million Americans who have some disability, are going to be able to work without losing the benefits that they need. 
   The disabled want to work. They can work. But we have a system, under Medicaid, which discourages them from working by providing financial penalties and the denial of services if they go out and work. We have crafted an effective program that will encourage those disabled to participate in our workforce and in our workplace. They have been excluded for far too long. This legislation starts off as one of the principal pieces of bipartisan legislation, which augurs well, if we are going to be serious about dealing with serious issues. I am very hopeful that this will be one of the first pieces of legislation that will pass. It will make a great deal of difference, not just to the disabled but to all Americans, because who can say today that by this evening they are not going to face some kind of challenge and be faced with some kind of disability as well? 
   Mr. President, I am hopeful that we will be able to make progress on this agenda. I commend our Democratic leader for advancing it. I think it is one which demands action, and I look forward to working with our colleagues to see what can be achieved in this Congress for improving the quality of life for working families in this Congress.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today, we renew the battle in Congress to enact a strong Patients' Bill of Rights to protect American families from abuses by HMOs and managed care health plans that too often put profits over patients' needs. 
   Our Patients' Bill of Rights will protect families against the arbitrary and self-serving decisions that can rob average citizens of their savings and their peace of mind, and often their health and their very lives. Doctors and patients should be making medical decisions, not insurance company accountants. Too often, managed care is mismanaged care. For the millions of Americans who rely on health insurance to protect them and their loved ones when serious illness strikes, the Patients Bill of Rights is truly a matter of life and death. 
   The dishonor roll of those victimized by insurance company abuses is long and growing. 
   A baby loses his hands and feet because his parents believe they have to take him to a distant hospital emergency room covered by their HMO, rather than to the hospital closest to their home.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator DASCHLE for his leadership in making these vital health programs that mean so much to older Americans a central part of the Democratic agenda. Our proposal for Early Access to Medicare is a key part of these initiatives. It provides a lifeline for millions of Americans who are within a few years of the age of eligibility for Medicare and who have lost their health insurance coverage or fear that they will lose it. Our proposal also includes President Clinton's program to assist disabled senior citizens and their families--assistance that can mean the difference between institutionalization in a nursing home and the ability to remain in their own home. In addition, our proposal extends and strengthens the Older Americans Act, which provides valuable services for senior citizens, from ``Meals on Wheels'' to employment opportunities. 
   Providing early access to Medicare will offer help and hope to more than three million Americans aged 55 to 64 who have no health insurance today. They are too young for Medicare, and unable to obtain private coverage they can afford. Often, they are victims of corporate downsizing, or of a company's decision to cancel their health insurance. 
   In the past year, the number of the uninsured in this age group increased at a faster rate than other age groups. These Americans have been left out  and left behind through no fault of their own--often after decades of hard work and reliable insurance coverage. It is time for Congress to provide a helping hand. 
   Many of these citizens have serious health problems that threaten to destroy the savings of a lifetime and that prevent them from finding or keeping a job. Even those without current health problems know that a single serious illness could wipe out their savings. 
   These uninsured Americans tend to be in poorer health than other members of their age group. Their health continues to deteriorate, the longer they remain uninsured. this unnecessary burden of illness is a preventable human tragedy. It adds to Medicare's long-term costs, because when these individuals turn 65, they join Medicare with greater and more costly needs for health care. 
   Even those with good coverage today can't be certain that it will be there tomorrow. No one nearing retirement can be confident that the health insurance they have today will protect them until they qualify for Medicare at 65. 
   Our proposal offers several types of assistance. Any uninsured American who is 62 or older can buy into Medicare. Over time, the participants will pay the full cost of the coverage, but to help keep premiums affordable, they can defer payment of part of the premiums until they turn 65 and Medicare starts to pay most of their health care costs. Once they turn 65, this deferred portion of the premium will be paid back at a modest monthly rate 
   estimated at about $10 per month for each year of participation in the buy-in program. 
   In addition, individuals age 55-61 who lose their health insurance because they are laid off or because their company closes will also be able to buy into Medicare, but they will not qualify for the deferred premium. Also, people who have retired before age 65 with the expectation of employer-paid health insurance would be allowed to buy into the company's program for active workers if the company drops its retirement coverage before they are eligible for Medicare. 
   Our proposal is a lifeline for all these Americans. It is also a constructive step toward the day when every American will be guaranteed the fundamental right to health care. 
   In the past, opponents have waged a campaign of disinformation that this sensible plan is somehow a threat to Medicare. They are wrong--and the American people understand that they are wrong. Under our proposal, the participants themselves will ultimately pay the full cost of this new coverage. The modest short-term budget impact can be financed through savings obtained by reducing fraud and abuse in Medicare. 
   Every American should have the security and peace of mind of knowing that their final years in the workforce will not be haunted by the fear of devastating medical costs or the inability to meet basic medical needs. Uninsured Americans who are too young for Medicare but too old to purchase affordable private insurance coverage deserve our help--and we intend to see that they get it. 
   Additional assistance for the disabled is also very important. Few issues are more important to senior citizens and their families than how to care for a severely disable order person at home. No senior citizens who want to remain in their own homes should be forced to enter a nursing home. Children who want to take disabled parents into their own homes deserve support. The issue of caring for the severely disabled at home is not just a concern for senior citizens. No parent should be forced to place a disabled child in institutional care. No disabled citizen who wants to live independently and can do so should be denied that opportunity. 
   President Clinton's proposal is not a comprehensive solution to the problem of financing needed long-term care. It will not end the enormous burdens that caregivers often assume. But it is an important and constructive step that will provide needed help to millions of families. 
   Under the proposal, disabled persons or their caregivers will be entitled to a tax credit of $1,000--far less than the total cost of caring for a disabled person, but still significant relief that can help buy a critical piece of equipment, pay for a period of respite care, or meet other unmet needs. 
   The proposal also creates a National Family Caregiver Support Program to develop community resources for counseling, respite care and other services, training in assisting persons with disabilities, and providing information about resources available to meet the needs of the disabled and their caregivers. 
   One of the most difficult aspects of caring for a disabled parent or child is not knowing where to turn for help, or finding that help is not available. This program will help to meet these needs. 
   Finally, the legislation extends and strengthens the Older Americans Act, a step that is long overdue. The Act provides essential services that assist senior citizens in every community. It supports 57 state agencies on aging, 660 area agencies, and 27,000 service providers who work with the elderly. 
   The Act is an essential source of nutrition for many low income and frail elderly. In FY 1996, more than 3 million older persons were served 238 million meals with funding from the Act. The Act supported transportation, assistance, home care, recreation and other important services provided by 6,400 senior centers. It funded more than 40 million rides and 15 million home care services to older persons. The Act also pays for training and research in the field of aging. It helps unemployed low-income older persons to find employment opportunities. And it provides protection and advocacy services for vulnerable senior citizens. 
   Elderly Americans and those nearing retirement have worked all their lives to build America. When they face basic needs for health care and long-term care, they deserve the best help that America can provide. These proposals are important and timely. They will make a very important difference in the lives of millions of our fellow citizens, and they deserve prompt enactment by the Congress.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a sponsor of this important bill, and I commend Senator HARKIN for his leadership on this issue. With the high incidence of foodborne illnesses, it is essential for regulatory agencies to have the authority necessary to prevent or minimize outbreaks of these illnesses, and combat food contamination. 
   Microbial contamination of food is an increasing problem. The emergence of highly virulent strains of common bacteria, such as E. coli 0157, is a significant cause of foodborne illnesses. Common infections that were once easily treatable are now a major public health threat, as the microorganisms acquire the ability to resist destruction by antibiotics. 
   The current enforcement authority of the Department of Agriculture is not sufficient. Our bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture the additional authority he needs in order to recall adulterated or misbranded meat or poultry products, and to assess civil penalties against processors who repeatedly violate meat and poultry safety standards. Most processors comply responsibly with USDA requests for voluntary recalls of unsafe products. This additional authority will ensure more timely and comprehensive removal of potentially dangerous foods from supermarket shelves. 
   Such new enforcement tools are necessary to improve food safety in general and to reduce the risk of future outbreaks of foodborne illnesses. Families across the country deserve to have confidence that the meat and poultry they eat are safe, and I look forward to early action by Congress on this important legislation. 
   Assurance of safe meat and poultry is just one part of the challenge of guaranteeing safe food. The safety of produce and of processed food, including imported food, is the responsibility of the Food and Drug Administration and a major part of President Clinton's Food Safety Initiative. I plan to develop legislation, in cooperation with other Senators, to ensure that no matter where our food is grown, processed, or packaged, it meets uniform high standards of safety.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, states and local communities are making significant progress toward improving their public schools. Almost every state has developed challenging academic standards for all students to meet--and they are holding schools accountable for results. 
   But just setting standards isn't enough. Schools and communities have to do more to ensure improved student achievement. Schools must have small classes, particularly in the early grades. They must have strong parent involvement. They must have safe, modern facilities with up-to-date technology. They must have high-quality after-school opportunities for children who need extra help. They must have well-trained teachers in the classroom who keep up with current developments in their field and the best teaching practices. 
   Last year, with broad bipartisan support, Congress made substantial investments in the nation's public schools to reduce class size, expand after-school programs, and improve the initial training of teachers. However, more needs to be done. 
   Education must continue to be a top priority in the new Congress. We must do more to meet the needs of public schools, families, and children, so that all children have an opportunity to attend good schools. We need to do more to help communities modernize their schools, reduce class sizes, especially in grades 1-3, improve the quality of the nation's teachers, and expand after-school programs. 
   These steps are urgently needed to help communities address the serious problems of rising student enrollments, overcrowded classrooms, dilapidated schools, teacher shortages, underqualified teachers, high turnover rates of teachers, and lack of after-school programs. These are real problems that deserve real solutions. 
   The needs of families across the nation should not be ignored. They want the federal government to offer a helping hand in improving public schools. 
   This year, the nation has set a new record for elementary and secondary student enrollment. The figure has reached an all-time high of 53 million students--500,000 more students than last year. 
   Serious teacher shortages are being caused by rising student enrollments, and also by the growing number of teacher retirements. The nation's public schools will need to hire 2.2 million teachers over the next ten years, just to hold their own. If we don't act now, the need for more teachers will put even greater pressure on school districts to lower their standards and hire unqualified teachers. 
   Also, too many teachers leave within the first three years of teaching--including 30-50% of teachers in urban areas--because they don't get the support and mentoring they need to 
   succeed. Veteran teachers and principals need more and better opportunities for professional development to enhance their knowledge and skills, to integrate technology into the curriculum, and to help children meet high standards. 
   We must fulfill last year's commitment to help communities hire 100,000 new teachers, in order to reduce class size. But it is equally important that we help communities recruit promising teacher candidates, provide new teachers with trained mentors who will help them succeed in the classroom, and give current teachers the on-going training they need to stay abreast of modern technologies and new research. 
   Many communities are working hard to attract, keep, and support good teachers--and often they're succeeding. 
   The North Carolina Teaching Fellows Program has recruited 3,600 high-ability high school graduates to go into teaching. The students agree to teach for four years in the state's public schools in exchange for a four-year college scholarship. North Carolina principals report that the performance of the Fellows far exceeds other new teachers. 
   In Chicago, a program called the Golden Apple Scholars of Illinois recruits promising young men and women into the profession by selecting them during their junior year of high school, then mentoring them through the rest of high school, college, and five years of actual teaching. 60 Golden Apple scholars enter the teaching field each year, and 90 percent of them stay in the classroom. 
   Colorado State University's Project Promise recruits prospective teachers from fields such as law, geology, chemistry, stock trading and medicine. Current teachers mentor graduates in their first two years of teaching. More than 90 percent of the recruits enter the field, and 80 percent stay for at least five years. 
   New York City's Mentor Teacher Internship Program has increased the retention of new teachers. In Montana, only 4 percent of new teachers in mentoring programs left after their first year of teaching, compared with 28 percent of teachers without mentoring programs. 
   New York City's District 2 has made professional development the central component for improving schools. They believe that student learning will increase as the knowledge of educators grows--and it's working. In 1996, student math scores were second in the city. 
   Massachusetts has invested $60 million in the Teacher Quality Endowment Fund to launch the 12-to-62 Plan for Strengthening Massachusetts Future Teaching Force. The plan being developed is a comprehensive effort to improve recruitment, retention, and professional development of teachers throughout their careers. 
   Congress should build on and support these successful efforts across the country to 
   ensure that the nation's teaching force is strong and successful in the years ahead. 
   The Teacher Excellence Act we are introducing will invest $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2000 to improve the recruitment, retention, and on-going professional development of the nation's teachers. The proposal will provide states and local school districts with the support they need to recruit excellent teacher candidates, to retain and  support promising beginning teachers, and to provide veteran teachers and principals with the on-going professional development they need to help all children meet high standards of achievement. 
   States will receive grants through the current Title I or Title II formula, whichever is greater. They will use 20 percent of the funding to provide scholarships to prospective teachers--whether they are high school graduates, professionals who want to make a career change, or paraprofessionals who want to become fully certified as teachers. Scholarship recipients must agree to teach for at least 3 years after completion of the teaching degree and teach in a high-need school district or in a high-need subject. 
   At least 70 percent of the funds must go to local school districts on a competitive basis to implement, improve or expand high-quality programs for beginning teachers, including mentoring and internship programs, and provide high-quality professional development for principals and veteran teachers. Our goal is to ensure that every child has the opportunity to meet high state standards. States must also set additional eligibility criteria, including the poverty rate of the school district; the need for support based on low student achievement and low teacher retention rates; and the need for upgrading the knowledge and skills of veteran teachers in high-priority content areas. Other criteria include the need to help students with disabilities and limited English proficiency. States must target grants to school districts with the highest needs and ensure a fair distribution of grants among school districts serving urban and rural areas. 
   In addition to providing states and communities with the support they need to ensure that there is a qualified, well-trained teacher in every classroom, we must also hold states and communities accountable for results--and for making the changes that will achieve those results. 
   Currently, teachers are often assigned subjects in which they have no training or experience. Nearly one-fourth of all secondary school teachers do not have even a college minor in their main teaching field, let alone a college major. This fact is true for more than 50 percent of math teachers. 56 percent of high school students taking a physical science course are taught by out-of-field teachers, as are 27 percent of those taking mathematics, and 21 percent of those taking English. The proportions are much higher in high-poverty schools. In schools with the highest minority enrollments, students have less than a 50 percent chance of having science or math teachers who hold a license and a degree in the field they teach. 
   Because of teacher shortages caused by rising enrollments and teacher retirements, communities must often lower their standards and hire unqualified teachers. Currently, 
   communities across the country have hired 50,000 unqualified teachers in order to address such shortages. More than 12 percent of newly hired teachers have no training and 15 percent of new teachers enter teaching without meeting state standards. 
   Under the Teacher Excellence Act, states and communities will be held accountable for reducing the number of emergency certified teachers and out-of-field placements of teachers. As they work to improve recruitment, retention, and professional development of teachers, states and communities should also reduce these practices that undermine efforts to help all students meet high standards. States will be able to use up to 10 percent of the funds in order to meet these accountability requirements. 
   In addition, the bill supports the full $300 million for funding of Title II of the Higher Education Act to improve the initial preparation of teachers. Also, current support for technology programs must include a requirement for training teachers in how to use technologies effectively to improve student learning. 
   We must do all we can to improve teacher quality across the country. What teachers know and are able to teach are among the most important influences on student achievement. Improving teacher quality is an effective way to link high state standards to the classroom. We should do all we can to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn from a qualified, well-trained teacher and to attend a school with a well-trained principal.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, all of us commend our troops for their superb performance. Their extraordinary efforts last year in Operation Desert Fox, Hurricane Mitch, Operation Provide Comfort, and in Kenya, and Tanzania highlighted only a few of their significant contributions to the Nation in 1998. 
   America continues to rely heavily on its Armed Forces, and we want our service members and families to know how proud we in Congress are of their contributions to our country and to our national defense. We are deeply indebted to them for their service, and we have the highest respect for their dedication, their patriotism, and their courage. 
   This past year once again demonstrated the importance of guaranteeing that our military forces are well prepared to meet any challenge. However, I am very concered about the future readiness of our Armed Forces. I am troubled by reports of declining readiness, poor retention, and recruiting shortfalls. 
   Two years ago the Army reduced its recuiting standards, and now the Navy has followed suit. Secretary of the Navy Danzig has announced that the Navy is lowering its educational standards for new recruits. This and other reductions in personnel standards by the Navy are taking place because the Navy fell short of its recruiting goals last year for the first time since the draft ended in 1973. Secretary Danzig also recently announced that retention of Naval Officers is so low that the Navy will have 50 percent fewer officers than required to man its ships in the coming years. These are serious concerns that must be addressed, and this legislation does so. 
   Congress must do all it can to provide for our men and women in the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. They have worked hard for us. Now we must provide the support they need to do their jobs and care for their families. 
   The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act is a substantial step toward meeting these urgent needs of our service members, and will encourage more of these highly skilled and well-trained men and women to remain in the military ranks. I also hope that the provisions in this act will encourage more of the Nation's young men and women to join the military and serve their country in that way. 
   Our proposal increases base pay for our troops. 
   It contains pay table reforms and guaranteed pay raises above inflation. 
   It restores equity to the military retirement system by providing active duty service members 50 percent retirement after 20 years of service. 
   It allows service members to transfer hard-earned educational benefits to others in their family. 
   It provides stability by extending authorities for bonus pay and special pay. 
   I'm reminded of the words of President Kennedy during an address at the U.S. Naval Academy in August of 1963. That is what he said about a career in the Navy:  
   I can imagine a no more rewarding career. And any man who may be asked in this century what he did to make his life worth while, I think can respond with a good deal of pride and satisfaction: ``I served in the United States Navy.''  
   My brother was a Navy man, but I'm sure that veterans of all the other services in those years felt the same way. 
   I want to do all I can to see that our service men and women feel the same way today and on into the next century. These personnel issues are important, and Congress has to deal with them effectively and responsibly. The  Military Recruiting and Retirement Improvement Act moves our Nation in the right direction, and I look forward to early and favorable action on it by the Senate.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, it is an honor to join with Senator DASCHLE and other Democratic Senators to introduce the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 1999. This proposal is strongly supported by President Clinton, and is also being introduced today in the House of Representatives by Congressman DAVID BONIOR, Democratic Leader RICHARD GEPHARDT, and many of their colleagues. 
   The federal minimum wage is now $5.15 an hour. Our bill will raise it by $1.00 over the next two years--a 50 cent increase on September 1, 1999, and another 50 cent increase on September 1, 2000, so that the minimum wage will reach the level of $6.15 by the turn of the century. 
   These modest increases will help 20 million workers and their families. Twelve million Americans earning less than $6.15 an hour today will see a direct increase in their pay, and another 8 million Americans earning between $6.15 and $7.15 an hour are also likely to benefit from the increase. 
   To have the purchasing power it had in 1968, the minimum wage should be at least $7.45 an hour today, instead of the current level of $5.15. The gap shows how far we have fallen short in giving low income workers their fair share of our extraordinary economic prosperity. Since 1968, the stock market, adjusted for inflation, has gone up by over 150 percent--while the purchasing power of the minimum wage has gone down by 30 percent. 
   The nation's economy is the best it has been in decades. Under the leadership of President Clinton, the country as a whole is enjoying a remarkable period of growth and prosperity. Enterprise and entrepreneurship are flourishing--generating an unprecedented expansion, with impressive efficiencies and significant job creation. The stock market has soared. Inflation is low, unemployment is low, and interest rates are low. 
   But the benefits of this prosperity have not flowed fairly to minimum wage earners. These workers can barely make ends meet. Working 40 hours a week, 52 weeks a year, they earn $10,712 a year--$2,900 below the poverty line for a family of three. A full day's work should mean a fair day's pay. But for millions of Americans who earn the minimum wage, it doesn't. 
   According to the Department of Labor, 60% of minimum wage earners are women. Nearly three-fourths are adults. Minimum wage workers are teacher's aides and child care providers, home health care aides and clothing store workers. They care for vast numbers of elderly Americans in nursing homes. They stock shelves in the corner store. They mop the floors and empty the trash in thousands of office buildings in communities across the country. 
   Three-fifths of these workers are the sole breadwinners in their families. More than half work full time. These families need help. They work hard and they should be treated with dignity. They deserve this increase in the minimum wage. 
   Opponents typically claim that, if the minimum wage goes up, the sky will fall--small businesses will collapse and jobs will be lost. This hasn't happened in the past, and it won't happen in the future. In fact, in the time that has passed since the most recent increases in the federal minimum wage--a 50-cent increase on October 1, 1996 and a 40-cent increase on September 1, 1997--employment has increased in all sectors of the population. 
   The American people understand that you can't raise a family on $5.15 an hour. This issue is of vital importance to working families across the country. In the past election, for example, by a margin of 2 to 1, voters in the State of Washington approved a ballot initiative to increase the state minimum wage to $6.50 an hour. In many other states, raising the minimum wage was a potent issue in the election. 
   The minimum wage is a women's issue. It is a children's issue. It is a civil rights issue. It is a labor issue. It is a family issue. Above all, it is a fairness issue and a dignity issue. I intend to do all I can to see that the minimum wage is increased this year. No one who works for a living should have to live in poverty.

   Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend Senator MOYNIHAN for his strong leadership on this issue. More than three million Americans aged 55 to 64 have no health insurance today.
