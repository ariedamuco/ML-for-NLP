   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of all the Democratic Senators, I express our appreciation for the kind words about our friend CHUCK ROBB. I sent him a note after the election, and he, of course, in his typical fashion responded. But I so much appreciate the Democratic leader covering his extraordinary life. One thing the leader didn't mention is that he is really a son of the West. He was born in Arizona. Of course, he went to high school in Fairfax and did a great job there. 
   One reason I so admire CHUCK ROBB--and the leader touched upon that--is his military record. I have not served in the U.S. military. I look at CHUCK ROBB with so much admiration. He went to the jungles of Vietnam. He didn't have to go, but he did. Not only did he go there, but he served in combat and was given a medal for valor. That says it all about CHUCK ROBB.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been here, not as many years by far as most everyone on this floor right now, but it is not often that you see the two leaders and our longtime leader Senator BYRD, stand and say they will support a piece of legislation. I have never seen it happen before. I think this is to show the intensity of the feelings of the people who support this legislation, led by Senator JOE BIDEN. So I am really pleased it appears at this stage that the three leaders, Senator LOTT, Senator DASCHLE, and Senator BYRD, have agreed to do this. 
   I was at lunch today with Senator HOLLINGS, who is the ranking Democrat on the committee of jurisdiction that may have something to do with this, the Commerce Committee. He said he will do everything he can to move this matter along. I know I will. Senator SPECTER, on the other side of the aisle, said he would do anything possible to move this along. This is a rare occasion in the Senate that you see this much support for a piece of legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the American public, the people from South Dakota, the people from Mississippi, do not know how hard these two men work for their States and their country. They probably have some idea because they are both so popular in their respective States, but from someone who sits and watches these two men every day we are in session--and many of the days we are not in session--I am in awe as to the work they do and the difficult situations they get us out of. 
   If someone had said this morning at 10 o'clock that we would be in the position we are in today--being able to go home for Christmas--I would have laughed at them. I thought it was impossible for us to do that. But these two men, working together, were able to put together a package of about $500 billion involving the most important things this country deals with on a daily basis. They did this. They did it alone. There were others on the outside helping a little bit, but this is just an example. 
   But I have been able, from my perspective here for 2 years, to watch them, and I am tremendously impressed. I want this RECORD spread with the fact that these resolutions do not in any way connote the really good work they do. On paper it says they did a good job, but it takes someone who works with these two gentlemen on a daily basis to see the sacrifices they make for their States and for the country. 
   Their families should be so proud of what they do. The people of their States should be so proud of what they do. And I, speaking on behalf of Americans, after this bitter election, say here are examples of everything that is good about the American political system--Senators DASCHLE and LOTT.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I have waited around this afternoon, this evening, to have an opportunity to direct a few comments to the Senator from Alaska. I say to my friend from Alaska, I remember about a year ago at this time the Senator from Alaska gave me as a token of recognition a Tasmanian devil tie. 
   Now, coming from Senator STEVENS, who has such a record in the Senate, that meant a lot to me. In celebration of our ending the session today, I wore this tie. I say this because in all sincerity it meant a lot to me when Senator STEVENS gave me this tie. You have been a role model for me since I came to Washington almost 20 years ago. You have a record that is unsurpassed for doing good things for your State as well as being an effective leader. I have served with the Senator from Alaska my entire time in the Senate on the Appropriations Committee, and I have admired the work done. I respected the tenacity shown, often for the people of the State of Alaska and other causes for which he believes. 
   I wish to publicly state how appreciative I am of this token, this honor the Senator gave me.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before coming to the Senate, I was a member of the California congressional delegation. Even though I am from the State of Nevada, they allowed me to be part of their deliberations and, in fact, when I came here, I was secretary-treasurer of the California congressional delegation. As a result of that association, I got to know Julian Dixon very well. He was a fine man. He came to Nevada for me on a number of occasions. He was an outspoken advocate of doing good things for the District of Columbia. The District of Columbia lost a very powerful voice when Julian Dixon's heart stopped beating. 
   He also, as I indicated in my conversation with the Presiding Officer today, served very valiantly as a member of the Ethics Committee in the House of Representatives. In fact, the Presiding Officer served as a Member with him. In short, Julian Dixon, who was a great advocate for political causes throughout his entire political career, was a person who believed in the Congress. He believed in our form of government. His loss is a loss to our Nation. I extend my condolences to his entire family, recognizing that we lost a great patriot in Julian Dixon.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was of course very disappointed in the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court. I sat and listened to that argument. I think both lawyers Olson and Boies did an outstanding job. I was disappointed in the 5-4 decision. I think it was as a result of the Supreme Court's decision that the vote did not go forward in the first place. 
   Having said that, I am an attorney. I have always believed we are a nation of laws and not of men. I said prior to the decision being rendered by the Supreme Court I would follow that decision; that I may not like it, but I would do whatever I could to make sure it was accepted. 
   I think during this entire process we as a nation should be very proud. I repeat, I didn't like the way the election turned out. We have a man, Vice President GORE, who won the national vote, a vote of the public, by 250,000 votes over his opponent. If there had ever been a count in Florida, he would have won that. But this country is a great country. Even though AL GORE won the election, he will not take office. This country is amazing. In spite of that, there was not a single arrest during any of these very bitter discussions regarding the vote. There was not a single injury that I know of. It is something that is part of history. I am going to do everything I can to make sure that George W. Bush's Presidency is as good as it can be. 
   I know he comes from a good family. I served in the Congress during the tenure of his father. I liked his dad very much. He wrote me a number of personal letters on things that I did that he thought were good. I have those letters and I treasure those letters. I was the first Democrat to speak openly for our incursions into Iraq. I think President Bush did the right thing. In short, I think George W. Bush has the ability to be a good President. I am going to do everything I can, as I said, to support President-elect Bush. 
   I think we have to recognize that what took place last night was magnificent. Vice President GORE's speech was magnanimous, gracious. As we indicated, he got more popular votes than even Ronald Reagan. Then that was followed by a speech by President-elect Bush which was outstanding. I think the tone of his speech was good. I think the issues he talked about were issues we have talked about for some time here on the Senate floor. 
   President-elect Bush is going to get all the advice and counsel he needs, I am sure, and he does not need mine. I am confident that today he is being briefed and briefed and briefed and told opinions of what people think he should do. But, in spite of that, my advice to the President-elect is, if he wants to be bipartisan in action rather than just words, the first thing he should do is recognize we have a House of Representatives which is almost evenly divided. He has to recognize that we have a Senate that is evenly divided. We have 50 Democrats; we have 50 Republicans. Either by math  that is taught at MIT or the so-called fuzzy math talked about during the campaign, 50 and 50 are equal. 
   As a result of that, I recommend the President-elect interject himself into what is going on here in the legislative branch of the Government. I think what he should do is say 50-50 is equal. I think the Republicans should go along with the Democrats to have committees that are even--that is, the same number of Democrats on the committee as Republicans. There should be equal funding. There should be equal staffing. I 
   think he should take a look at the committee chairmanship structure. I think it would be a significant step if President-elect Bush stepped forward and looked at what the future holds. 
   The future holds that, for example, if the Budget Committee is 10-10--one of the first things we are required by law to do is come forward with the budget--if the committee is 10-10, anything that comes before this Senate will be bipartisan in nature and I think will be approved quickly. It would be the same on other committees. I think one thing the American people have said is that we should work in a bipartisan basis, 50-50 in the Senate, 50-50, approximately, in the House. 
   We have a President who was elected with fewer votes than the his opponent. I just think this is a time that calls for bipartisanship. I think we can do that. But I think it would set a very bad tone if the Republicans, some of whom are in denial that the Senate is 50-50, would prevent the Senate from going forward by saying we are not going to give you equality on the committees. If that happens, it is not the Democrats who are holding up action in the Senate, it is the Republicans--the Republicans who we no longer refer to as the majority because they are not the majority. It is the Republicans who will be holding up this Congress and this country from moving forward. 
   I also think it appropriate that President Bush follow the example we have in the Cabinet today with Secretary Cohen. Secretary Cohen is a bona fide, card-carrying Republican from the State of Maine who did an outstanding job and is doing an outstanding job during his tenure as Secretary of Defense. I hope President-elect Bush will also look to people of the other party, the Democratic Party, to fill spots in his Cabinet. I am confident he will do that. 
   Again, I feel so good today about our country. We should all feel good about our country. In spite of the closeness of the election, in spite of the more than 1 month since the election took place, we have two men who stepped forward last night; they stepped forward with compassion, stepped forward with confidence--confidence at the greatness of this country. 
   I have been through statewide recounts, two of them, one of which I lost by 524 votes; one of which I won by 428 votes. I know what close elections are all about. I know how difficult recounts are. I was very proud of both men and their families for what they put up with and how they ended the election process last night. It speaks well of them and of our country. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. The Senator from North Dakota has been such a leader on this issue dealing with the Federal Reserve. In fact, the Senator will recall that the Senator from North Dakota and the Senator from Nevada ordered a study of the Federal Reserve. We found, among other things, that they have a slush fund of over $3 billion. It has been there for 70 years, or thereabouts. They never use it. 
   I ask the Senator from North Dakota: Wouldn't it seem logical, as we are trying to do all of these things in the last few minutes of this session, if that money were to be used to help farmers, or help with some of the problems created by forest fires in the West? Wouldn't that be a better place to use that money than to use it for the so-called rainy day fund? We have never had a rainy day in the Federal Reserve.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud and congratulate the Senator from North Dakota. With this election having taken more than 30 days, and the stock market, as a result of the turmoil of the election, having dropped significantly, there is a lot of uneasiness in the economy. 
   I hope the people who are cloistered in the Federal Reserve, hidden away from public view, have the opportunity to listen to what the Senator from North Dakota said. It is so important the people of the State of Nevada and this country be given a break at the beginning of the year on interest rates. Construction is being hurt. Everything we do is affected by the interest rates which as the Senator so graphically illustrated, dictate our lives. I hope the Federal Reserve would follow what the Senator from North Dakota has said. The Senator from North Dakota has had long experience working on financial matters, including the Ways and Means Committee in the House of Representatives, and in the Senate as head of the Policy Committee, and has given great direction on fiscal matters.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that the distinguished chairman of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Senator CAMPBELL, engage in a brief colloquy regarding the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians Settlement Act of 2000. The purpose of this legislation is to provide for the settlement of issues and claims related to the trust lands of the Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians of California. 
   In June 1996, after decades of neglect and months of difficult negotiations, representatives of the United States, the Torres-Martinez Tribe, the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Coachella Valley Water District signed a settlement agreement that resolves their conflicting claims and provides for dismissal of litigation. Legislation necessary to ratify this settlement agreement and to authorize the Federal actions and appropriations necessary for its implementation was introduced in 1996. However, because provisions in the legislation dealing with the taking of after-acquired land into trust for purposes of gaming proved very controversial, the legislation never passed the Senate. It has taken this long to get to the point where the bill is again being considered by the Senate, and the bill is still controversial. 
   The basic settlement provisions involve land and cash in return for dismissal of all claims with regard to the Torres-Martinez Tribe. By far the most controversial of the provisions in the bill are those authorizing the Secretary of the Interior to take lands into trust for the explicit purpose of gaming. These lands are isolated from the principal lands to be taken into trust for the tribe, and have only one purpose--to provide a place to build a casino. It is clear that these lands have been chosen, not because of their cultural or historical relationship to the tribal members, but because of their proximity to an area of high density traffic. While Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, authorizes the Secretary to take lands into trust as part of a land settlement, it was never the intent of IGRA to allow the Federal land claims settlement process to be manipulated in this manner. 
   Personally, I feel that the language in H.R. 4643 is poorly drafted, particularly when it comes to authorizing the taking of land into trust for purposes of gaming. I think we should draft a new bill that more clearly respects the intent of IGRA. However, I understand the hardship that further delay would cause the Torres-Martinez Tribe; and so I am prepared to allow H.R. 5528 to proceed as drafted. I do believe, and I want to make my views clear, that the practice of settling Indian land claims with off-reservation land-into-trust acquisitions for purposes of gaming is something that should not become common practice in settling these claims. 
   Does the chairman agree that H.R. 5528 represents a unique situation, and the Department of Justice and the Secretary of Interior should work to ensure that when they are negotiating Indian land claims they should try and hammer out fair settlements that fully compensate tribes for legitimate losses they have suffered and that land-into-trust acquisitions for gaming purposes as a component of such settlements should be avoided?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask that Senator BREAUX engage in a brief colloquy regarding S. 2792. The purpose of the legislation sponsored by the distinguished senior Senator from Louisiana is to provide that land owned by the Coushatta Tribe of Louisiana but which is not held in trust by the United States for the Tribe may be leased or transferred by the tribe without further approval by the United States. 
   I am concerned because the language in this bill does not clearly provide that, if there is going to be gaming on this land, it is to be regulated gaming. That is, any land included in this bill is subject to regulation either by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act, IGRA, if Indians purchase the land, or subject to state and local regulation. 
   I stand for a conservative interpretation of the IGRA. As such, with all land bills involving Indian land, we must follow IGRA--in statute and intent. Congressional intent for Indian gaming under IGRA was to provide economic flexibility regarding the use of land  which has a cultural or historical relationship to the tribal members. Congress did not provide in IGRA a mechanism for tribes to use to acquire and sell land which is only valuable because of its proximity to a commercially attractive area of high density traffic. 
   Is it the intent of the Senator from Louisiana that S. 2792 fully comply with the statute and intent of IGRA and that if any gaming takes place on the land covered by this bill, such gaming continues to be subject to the applicable IGRA or state or local regulation?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from Nebraska, the acting leader, it is my understanding we are going to try to extend the CR until Monday. I hope in the spirit that was felt around here today, that we were going to try to complete this session's work sometime next week, we can continue that. 
   I do say, just as a warning to everyone, we have been to this point on a number of occasions before with this session of Congress. It seems we can never quite get over the goal line. 
   I hope all Members, Democrats and Republicans, will do their utmost to try to work this out. We have four appropriations bills that are badly needed. In my opinion--and I think everyone in the minority agrees--it would be a shame if we were unable to complete those bills and have to go forward with a continuing resolution, in effect dumping all that in the lap of the new President and new Congress. 
   Of course, I am not going to object to my friend's unanimous consent request, but I do say we should really try to put our shoulders to the wheel and push this session over the goal line.

I believe it is very important for the American public, the people from Nebraska, and the people from Nevada, that we try to complete our work as quickly as possible, without a lot of dissension. There was a tremendous amount of work put into the various appropriations bills--the balanced budget add-on and other things we did prior to leaving here that we almost had completed. I hope we can join together and finish that as quickly as possible and not leave any undone work for the new Congress and President. 
   I was happy to hear the acting leader indicate that we were going to try to finish the business we have now pending before the Congress. I think it will send a very good message to the American public if we can work together, as I believe we are going to have to do with the next Congress. Thank you.

   During our party conferences, we will find out if we need the two extra votes on bankruptcy. It is my understanding what the leader wants is to have a vote on cloture on bankruptcy. If we have to go through the drill, we will have to have a couple votes before we get to that. I will talk to the people in the Democratic Conference at 12:30 today and report back to the leader as quickly as I can. 
   I am happy to hear the majority leader talking about moving forward where we left off before the lame duck session started. There has been a tremendous amount of work that has gone into those appropriation bills, the balanced budget problem we have, the add-ons, and the other things the leader has indicated we will try to move, rather than have a CR. I hope we do that. We await the direction of the majority in the next few days so we can go home and have a good Christmas.

   I ask the leader, is there some assurance--I guess that is the word--is there some certainty that the House will accept this? What has the leader learned?

   Mr. REID. I say to the leader, the President is excited about this. It is my understanding that he will do what is necessary in this instance. I repeat that when we come back here, I hope we can move this forward. With minor exceptions, the work done by Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD and others on the Labor-HHS bill is really good work. I hope we can wrap it up very quickly.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know my friend from Illinois wishes to speak at some length. First, I have a couple of comments. On the recently completed vote on cloture regarding bankruptcy, I think that is an example of why we need to follow Senate procedures the way we have for 200-plus years. Here is the bankruptcy bill brought up on a bill under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Relations Committee. Some Members who should have been weren't in that conference. I just think it is a very poor way to do business. 
   I think that we in the minority have been treated unfairly on a number of occasions this year. In an effort to show my displeasure--and that is a real soft, cool word because I feel more strongly than that--I voted against invoking cloture. 
   There comes a time when we have to work as legislators, and as Senators. If things don't change here, there are going to be other unfortunate procedures such as this, even though there is support for the substance of the legislation. 
   Also, Senator SCHUMER had a very strong point in this legislation. He and I cosponsored an amendment that is very simple. It said that these people--these very, in my opinion, evil people, who go to clinics where women come to get advice--some people may not like the advice they get in these clinics because some of the advice results in obtaining an abortion. But we live in a free country; people have the right to go where they want to go and talk about what they want. What these women are doing is lawful, not illegal. People spray chemicals into those facilities, and they can't get rid of the stench for up to 1 year, and many times they have to simply tear the insides of the facility down so it can be reused. In this legislation, Senator SCHUMER and I said if you do that, you cannot discharge that debt in bankruptcy as a result of the damages incurred, whether to the facilities or those women who use those facilities. 
   That provision should be in this legislation. For it not to be is wrong, and I understand that the chief advocate of the legislation--I don't know this to be a fact--Senator GRASSLEY, was willing to accept the provision. However, it was not in there. This is wrong and, as a matter of procedure and as a result of the substantive issue that I just talked about, I am satisfied with my vote. I have no second thoughts. I did the right thing. Unless there is a different method of approaching this bankruptcy reform, which I agree is badly needed, there are going to be roadblocks all along the way. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, the acting leader today, that, of course, we are very disappointed that the tremendous work done by all the participants, Republicans and Democrats, Senator STEVENS, Senator BYRD, Senator HARKIN--it was a bipartisan effort--yesterday morning we had an agreement on the very important Labor-HHS bill. As a result of the actions of the whip of the House, TOM DELAY, that bill fell through. It was a terrible disappointment for everybody. We hope that there is a way to complete action on these bills. Each day that goes by, I become less encouraged, but I hope that something can be worked out. 
   Yesterday, we had the makings of a very important compromise. I am disappointed that it fell through. 
   Mr. President, we are going into, as has already been announced by Senator GRASSLEY, 4 hours of morning business. On this side, we have 2 hours, or whatever part thereof remains from the brief statements of Senator GRASSLEY and I. The time was basically set aside for Senator WELLSTONE. He has another issue that he wants to speak about; namely, bankruptcy. But he graciously has consented to allowing Senators BOXER, BAUCUS, DORGAN, DURBIN, and HARKIN to have 5 minutes each during his time. 
   I personally express my appreciation to the Senator from Minnesota for allowing these Senators to speak. I again say that it is too bad we are not completing all of our work here today rather than figuring out some way to get out of town in the next few days. 
   So I would ask unanimous consent that those people--Senators BOXER, BAUCUS, DORGAN, DURBIN, and HARKIN--be allowed 5 minutes each during the time of morning business today.

   Mr. REID. Well, I say to my friend, I guess the good news is that ultimately there will have to be an end to the 106th Congress because the calendar is going to run out eventually. I hope we will see fit to maybe wrap up the work we have. 
   As you know, there has been tremendous work on Labor-HHS during the past 24 hours. Early this morning we thought we had an agreement worked out. As you know, my counterpart in the House on the Republican side, I understand, threw what we refer to as a monkey wrench into the proposed workout of the Labor-HHS bill which now, it is my understanding, is in further negotiations. 
   Time is really working very fast against us. As you know, we have sent a number of bills to the President. He is going to have to make a decision on those bills, whether he is going to veto them or sign them. 
   I know the majority leader is aware of all the problems that this Congress faces, but I hope that we exert any influence any of us have to try to work out this Labor-HHS bill. I think if that were worked out, we could probably resolve the other issues, or at least I hope so. There are a few other issues such as assisted suicide and immigration that would still be outstanding, but hopefully we could resolve those if we got this big final spending bill done.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, what I would like to do for a few minutes is talk about the Governor of Texas and his plan regarding Social Security. I will not go into a lot of detail other than to say that the actuarials that are cited show that his plan is impossible because he is promising the same trillion dollars to two different groups, and in effect, the plan, just in a few short years, would bankrupt the country and we would have staggering deficits again. 
   So that those within the sound of my voice do not think that these statements that I am making are coming from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee or the Democratic National Committee, let me read a number of quotes. 
   First of all, from Ron Gebhardtsbauer, who is Senior Pension Fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, who said:  
   ``I don't see any way they pay off the public debt.'' And given Bush's large package of tax cuts, ``in 2015 the budget will go negative. There won't be a surplus anymore.''  
   Paul Krugman, economist and columnist for the New York Times stated on October 29:  
   George W. Bush's proposal, admittedly, does not count on the stupidity of markets. Instead, he trusts the people: voters are not supposed to notice that the same pool of money is promised to two different groups of people.  
   Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers, who, by the way, is not only Secretary of Treasury and a brilliant academician but is also a fiduciary with the Social Security trust fund and has an obligation in that regard also, here is what he says:  
   Now, there is of course, a Social Security surplus of approximately $2 trillion over the next 10 years. That surplus is currently earmarked to pay the guaranteed benefits for the baby boom generation when it retires. If that surplus is diverted to new accounts, then the resources will not be there to pay the guaranteed benefits when the baby boom generation retires.  
   Robert Ball, former Commissioner of the Social Security Administration, said on October 27, just a few days ago:  
   I've looked over Governor Bush's plan. He takes one trillion dollars out of Social Security for savings accounts. But Social Security is counting on that money to pay benefits. His plan simply doesn't add up and would undermine Social Security.  
   Henry J. Aaron and Alan Blinder, Century Foundation Study of Governor Bush's Social Security proposal, Washington Post, August 24:  
   In a recent report, we showed that Social Security retirement benefits would have to be cut as much as 54 percent to restore balance under a Bush-style privatization plan.  
   In an editorial in the New York Times yesterday:  
   The governor's scheme would siphon money out of Social Security at the very moment when both seniors and younger taxpayers want to see long-term fixes to ensure its solvency.  
   Mr. President, the fact is that Governor Bush's plan ruins Social Security and ruins our economy. That is not a very good duo, as far as I am concerned, when you take into consideration that Social Security is the most successful social program in the history of the world. 
   We need to make sure that we do what we can to strengthen the program. Governor Bush's program weakens the program.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I find myself in amazement when I hear the Republican's spin that the Democrats played partisan politics in this Congress. 
   The truth is, we have repeatedly asked for the Republican leadership to work with us so we could have meaningful legislative accomplishments for  the people in Nevada and in other States represented in this body. 
   These legislative accomplishments should include meaningful prescription drug benefits that help people--not the HMOs; a meaningful Patients' Bill of Rights--benefits to ensure the American people receive the urgent medical care they need rather than an HMO litigation protection bill; meaningful funding for education; that is, funding for school construction, repair, and modernization rather than denying States any Federal assistance to maintain our Nation's schools. 
   We always hear that this takes away from local control. No one on this side of the aisle wants to take local control away from schools. 
   We have many programs that we have worked on that have been very helpful in school districts. 
   I have not heard a single person from the Clark County School District, the sixth largest school district in the country--basically Las Vegas--complain about too much Federal money, or too much Federal control. Quite the opposite. The calls I get are for more help, especially school construction and repair and modernization. 
   I think we need a meaningful tax cut; that is, a significant tax to ensure we can still pay down the debt rather than a tax cut of such magnitude that we forget our current 
   obligations; targeted tax cuts, for example, that would allow a child to go to school not based upon how much money the parents have but how much ability they have. A tax credit to allow the parents to deduct up to $10,000 a year per child would be most helpful to the American people. That is what we call a targeted tax cut. Of course, we need a minimum wage increase. 
   Speaking of Governor Bush, the reason Governor Bush has not been an advocate for a minimum wage increase is the State of Texas has one that is almost $2 an hour less than the Federal minimum wage. 
   In some States, the wages are much higher. You have some jurisdictions that have a minimum wage as much as $11 an hour. But here we don't. We have a $5.15 minimum wage. We want to increase it 50 cents an hour. We are getting all kinds of static for trying to do that. We need to do that. 
   Campaign finance reform: Certainly with this campaign season, people understand how we have to do something to take money out of campaigns. We need to have campaigns more meaningful. It shouldn't be how much money you are able to raise. It should be what the merits of your claims are. 
   As we get closer to Halloween, the debt of the American people should scare them more than any ghost. Instead of giving them treats, this Republican Congress, in my opinion, played a dirty trick on the American people. They are scheming to drive a stake through the heart of the positive Democratic agenda--an agenda that could make a real difference in the lives of working people. 
   We do not have the legislative accomplishments that we need. Instead we have accomplishments that could have been. 
   I know that there are others here wishing to speak. We have a limited amount of time. 
   I see my friends from Illinois and Minnesota. I would be happy to yield my time to either of them. 
   How much time does the Senator from Illinois desire?

   Mr. REID. One more question I want to ask my friend from Illinois. I have a long-time friend; we went to high  school together. We were inseparable friends. He was my chief of staff until he retired 2 years ago. His mother has been very ill. She passed away last night. 
   The point I want to make is this: My friend's sister, my friend Gloria, with whom I also went to high school, spent many months caring for her mother in her home. She gave up her job. It 
   was a tremendous burden, but it was her mother. She did it; she is a caring person; she gave up her life to take care of her aged mother. 
   Do you know what tax break she got from that? Nothing. 
   As I understand what my friend is saying, the Senator thinks we should spend a little bit of this surplus to give my friend Gloria a tax break so that she and other people similarly situated who are willing to take care of their mother or other loved ones--and there is no better care that can be given--should be given some kind of tax incentive for doing this; is that what my friend is saying?

   Mr. REID. I see the illustrative chart. It appears to me every year that President Clinton has been in power, in office, the deficit has gone down. Does the Senator from Illinois--and I was in Congress in 1993 when we took a very tough vote, the Clinton budget deficit reduction act was a tough veto. Not a single Republican voted for it in the House, not a single Republican over here. AL GORE came over and broke the tie. 
   Would the Senator agree with me, that is what put the country on the road to economic recovery where we created 22 million jobs--the lowest unemployment in 40 years--we have surpluses instead of deficits; we have a Federal Government today that is 300,000 people fewer than when GORE and Clinton took office? Does the Senator believe that is the reason this chart is illustrated the way it is?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the greatest respect for my friend from Idaho. We served together in the House, and we have worked together many years on public resources issues dealing with the West. I don't mean to be disagreeable, but on this issue we simply disagree. I am going to take a couple of minutes because I have told the Senators from Ohio and Iowa they can speak next. 
   The oil problem started in the Republican administration; it certainly wasn't the fault of the Republican administration. There was an embargo by the OPEC nations. Following that, there was an bipartisan effort to change things. There were incentives to develop oil shale, do alternative energy with wind and solar and geothermal. But with the oil glut that came about, all of that was taken away. Some of the research involving alternative energy was simply not renewed by Congress. That is too bad. 
   During the years of the Clinton-Gore administration, they have tried very hard every year that I have served on committees and subcommittees with jurisdiction to deal with energy matters. They have tried every year--especially in the appropriations process--to get more money for development of alternative energy sources. They have been stymied every time. 
   We should also understand that if we could reduce the consumption of fuel in America--for example, if we had more fuel-efficient cars and if we had automobiles that were 3 miles per gallon more efficient, we would save a million barrels of oil a day. 
   There are things we need to do here. We need to join in a bipartisan effort, not a finger-pointing effort, to develop energy policy in this country. None of us wants to be dependent on foreign oil. In fact, with the oil being so cheap, there was no incentive for us to do it. Congress failed, and it wasn't simply that we didn't meet what the administration wanted. Certainly, this legislation has been suggested by my friend from Idaho, has as its centerpiece oil development in ANWR, the pristine Arctic wilderness, which we are not going to do. 
   I yield the floor.

Since the first of September, we have passed only three or four appropriations bills. We struggled through the month of September, and nothing happened.

   Mr. REID. We have 13 appropriations bills. This debate cannot relate around one appropriations bill. The Senator from Pennsylvania worked hard on the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. A number of us have worked on it. But the Republicans have left this bill to the last bill so they can attach everything to it that has not been done and that should have been done previously.

   Mr. REID. No. I will not. 
   I say to the Chair and to those Members listening that the President doesn't need to take any blame for what is taking place here in Congress. We have a constitutional framework that gives him separate but equal power with the Congress. He is exerting that now. Thank goodness he is able to exert that because what has gone on here, according to pundits and according to what I believe having been here for almost 20 years, is a travesty. 
   Here we are trying to work our way through Congress 8 days before an election. This should have been completed a long time ago. We have not been able to have debates on issues in this Congress. Why? Because the majority has  taken the position they don't want to have to take any difficult votes. As a result of that, we don't take any votes. We don't have debates. 
   It is interesting to note that we haven't done anything on a Patients' Bill of Rights. We have done nothing on prescription drugs. On education, for the past 2 years in this Congress, we only have spent parts of 6 days dealing with education. The American people say it is the most important issue facing the American people. Members of Congress say it is the most important issue. It seems to me that we could spend more than 6 partial days talking about education. 
   We need help with school construction. In Las Vegas, we have the sixth largest school district in America. We have to build one new school every month to keep up with growth. 
   In the small State of Nevada, last year we spent $112 million just on interest on the money we borrowed to build schools. We need help with school construction and modernization. Schools all over America need help. The average age of schools in America is over 40 years. We also need to reduce class size. Unfortunately, we haven't had a meaningful debate that has allowed us to discuss how important and successful class size reduction is for our schools. 
   A year and a half ago, following the Columbine massacre, we 
   passed what we felt was minimal gun safety legislation. Nothing has happened since then to move that forward. We have not had a conference. The result is that we still have pawnshop loopholes where just anyone can go in and buy guns. They can be felons. The same happens not only in pawnshops but at gun shows. We need that legislation cleared for further action. We have been unable to do that. 
   I say to my friend from Pennsylvania that, again, I appreciate his frustration. I appreciate his hard work. 
   But the fact is that constitutionally the President has a role, and he is fulfilling that role. I repeat that I am glad he is fulfilling that role. 
   We have so many things that we need to do in this Congress that we have simply been unable to do. 
   As a result of our friend, Paul Coverdell, having unexpectedly passed away, the composition of the Senate changed. As such, we felt there should be another vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We were denied that. 
   There are so many things that have been taking place here that has prevented the Senate from operating as the Senate. 
   My friend from Pennsylvania is frustrated as a result of his dealings with the subcommittee. 
   I am frustrated as a Member of the Senate that we are not able to talk about issues that I think are important. We have been prevented from being able to talk about those issues. 
   In America today there are 3,000 children dropping out of school every day. Shouldn't we be allowed to talk about that? The answer has been no. We haven't been able to have a meaningful debate about the serious problem of children dropping out of school. 
   The fact is the President is concerned about this $250 billion tax bill. The minority has been shut out of all negotiations. The ranking member of the Finance Committee has not been involved in anything, let alone any other members of the Finance Committee. 
   We have conferences that are uniquely held with only one party. 
   There is a lot of frustration to go around. 
   I want to reassert and reemphasize that the President is doing the right thing. I believe he is doing the right thing, which is supported totally by the minority. He is doing the right thing by having us work every day. 
   What good does it do? We should have been having 24-hour continuing resolutions 2 weeks ago. If so, we would have already completed our work 2 weeks ago. So, we are doing 24-hour continuing resolutions right now. If, in fact, we had a 4-day continuing resolution, people would fly out of here and back to their parades and campaigning and leave the work that needs to be done here in Congress undone. 
   I am supportive of what the President is doing. It is good for Congress. It is good for the American people. 
   Does the Senator from Pennsylvania have any questions of the Senator from Nevada?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, the President, I repeat, is doing the right thing. The right thing is having Congress do its work. This is all a game. 
   Now if we could complete our work by Tuesday, it seems to me if people hung around here and did their work now--they said they have to start reading the bill--let them read it now. I also say if people want to expedite matters and challenge the President's authority, I am standing right where I am today and yesterday. I said we will agree on a voice vote to the tax bill and send it to the White House this afternoon. Nope, objections from the other side. They wouldn't let us do that. They wouldn't let us do that. They are here stalling for reasons that some of us are having a little trouble determining, but they are stalling. They have continued to stall. That is why we wouldn't get any appropriations bills passed until very recently. 
   My friend from Pennsylvania said there is no factual variance. I was going to run through some of those, but the analogy is something like this. He says we gave the President 90 percent of what he wanted. Whether that is right or not, the point is, it is like a football game. You go to the 10-yard line and you almost make a touchdown; does that mean you should get the score? The answer is no. The score should not be given to the majority because they have not done their work. They haven't even gotten to the 10-yard line. 
   I say Members should be here working. The President is saying we should work. We don't need to go home. Some of us have a long way to go to go home. We should be here doing our work. I think the American people understand that the President is equal to the Congress. 
   I don't know why the framers of this Constitution had article I the legislative branch, article II the executive branch, article III the judicial branch. They could have been reversed. It doesn't matter. They are separate but equal. 
   I am so thankful that the President recognizes his ability to take a look at what is going on here and say, ``I don't like it.'' That is what he said. He doesn't like it and 46 of us over here, we don't like it either. 
   Because of that, we are in the position we are now in. No one is being humiliated. The word was used twice by the Senator from Pennsylvania. But, no one is being humiliated. The Constitution has been in effect for over 200 years. The President has an absolute right to do what he has done. If, in fact, the majority does not think the President will veto these bills, send them down and we will find out. 
   The problem is really that the bills are unfair. We have had very little input. We will let the American people decide who is right, whether President Clinton is right in doing what he is doing or the Republicans are right, doing what they are doing. I think the American people will resoundingly proclaim that what has gone on over here has been not only procedurally unfair, it has been substantively unfair. 
   I also say, using Nevada as a State that doesn't need help--no one is asking that local control of schools be taken away. This is something the majority always uses. Only about 7 percent of what any school district in America gets comes from Washington. There is not a person on the Democratic side who says they want to take control away from local schools. We are saying that schools need some help in helping pay the interest on the bonds. The illustration I used was that the State of Nevada spends $112 million in interest without paying a single penny on the principal. We are a small State, 2 million people. His State is 12 million people. We believe the people of America realize the school problems we have, the education problems in America are national in scope and Congress has to take a look at some of the national problems. Schools are crumbling, classes are too large, too many kids are dropping out of school. The solution the majority has is to take control away from public schools and put all the money in private schools; do what you can to damage and destroy public schools. We are not willing to do that. We believe that because the vast majority, in fact almost 95 percent, of kids go to public schools, we should do what we can to improve public schools. 
   Again, I think the Senator from Pennsylvania does an excellent job as chairman of that subcommittee. I understand his frustration. A lot of the control has been taken away from the subcommittee chairs and ranking members in these last days of Congress. The majority leadership is calling a lot of the shots. That is what we read about. The Democrats can only read about it because we are not in many of these negotiations. But the Senator's frustration does not take away from the fact that the President of the United States has done the right thing in saying Congress should be working this weekend, every day, until Congress completes it work.

   Mr. REID. The Senator from Indiana, Mr. BAYH, and I were here as you were getting ready to speak. We talked, shared some of our thoughts about you. The Senator from Indiana and I agreed on everything, but the one thing that sticks out in my mind is we agreed that you have been a visionary. You have been able to look out and find out what is going to happen and try to alert us. Frankly, we haven't followed a lot of the vision that you have had as quickly as we should. 
   I always loved going to school from the time I was a little boy until the time I finished my professional schooling. But the one thing that always worried me was taking tests. So for me personally to be able to serve my entire time in the Senate on the same committee as you, during the short period of time when you were chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, before you moved to chairman of the Finance Committee, that it has been like going to school. 
   In fact, in the back of the Chamber today, I recited to the Senator some of the things he taught me about transportation and some of the things that need to be done. The good part of being educated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan is that I haven't had to take any tests. As a result of that, I feel I am a much better Senator and certainly a much better person for having had the good fortune to serve in the Senate and on the Environment and Public Works Committee with someone who the history books will write was one of the great Senators to serve in the history of our Republic.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to attempt to put some transparence on what is going on around here. 
   This summer, the Republicans very successfully convinced the American people that their party was for estate tax relief and marriage penalty relief and that the Democrats were not. Well, my friends, that is simply not the case. The Democrats are for eliminating the estate tax for small businesses and family farms valued at $8 million and for all other estates worth $4 million. And, Mr. President, it is the Democratic plan for marriage penalty relief that completely eliminates the marriage penalty found in 65 provisions in the tax code. 
   So, isn't it a bit frightening that the Republicans have so successfully twisted the debate so as to mislead the American people into thinking that they are actually the party supportive of tax cuts. Reality is, however, that they are the party of political rhetoric and political maneuvering. If the Republicans really wanted to give the American people estate tax relief and marriage penalty relief, they could have--they had many, many opportunities for sending the President real relief. Instead of giving the American people empty rhetoric--we could be sitting here today with elimination of the estate tax and marriage penalty tax relief for virtually all Americans. 
   Now, why do I bring all this up. Because it is happening over and over again. The Republicans are misleading the American people on a host of critical pieces of legislation, including: patients bill of rights, prescription drug coverage, minimum wage increase, tax cuts, health insurance coverage and education. 
   Instead of actually providing the American people with real relief--this year--the Republicans prefer the politics. 
   I have heard from constituents who ask me--``If both Republicans and Democrats want patients bill of rights, then why can't the Republicans and Democrats just work together to get something done?'' That is an excellent question. Why? 
   Why is it that we cannot just reach agreement? Is it that we are missing  some magical force here in Washington to bring bipartisanship to all? Unfortunately, the answer is that the Republicans want the rhetoric--and the Democrats want real reform. So, until the Republicans stop pandering and posturing and start sincerely and openly working together, there can be no agreements. You see, the Republicans have a more difficult time even working with each other--there is nothing partisan or bipartisan about that. Yet they have misled the American people to think that the Democrats--not the Republicans--are the ones holding up the works and refusing to work in a bipartisan manner. Mr. President, that is truly overstepping the bounds of the reality of what is going on up here. 
   Our efforts to fight for fundamental fairness in health, education and tax cuts, are being twisted into political pandering and posturing by the Republicans. But all we are doing is fighting for the fundamental fairness that the American people have fought for by working hard every day of their lives. 
   Let me illustrate this by highlighting the differences between the policies of the Republicans and the Democrats with respect to the bill that we have before us. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we do as much as possible to meet America's need for safe and modern schools. 
   Democrats solution--enact the bipartisan Rangel-Johnson proposal to finance $25 billion in bonds to construct and modernize 6,000 schools. 
   Republican's bill--is thoroughly inadequate--it provides no guaranteed funding for urgent school repairs, provides only $16 billion in bonds, and does not include the important Davis-Bacon provision to ensure that the construction workers who build and repair our nation's schools receive a fair wage for their work. 
   Result of their plan--the arbitrage provision encourages delay in urgently needed school construction and would disproportionately help wealthy school districts. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we promote bipartisanship in health care by coupling both the Republican and Democrat priorities on health care and long-term care. 
   Democrats solution-- our FamilyCare proposal would expand coverage to 4 million uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per person. 
   Republican's bill--provides additional coverage to one-seventh of the people at $18,000 per person--that is one-seventh of the people at 6 times the cost. Their approach is inequitable, inefficient, and counterproductive to health care policy. 
   Result of their plan--completely ignores a proposal to cover millions of uninsured, working Americans and jeopardizes the insurance coverage of those individuals currently receiving employer-based coverage. In fact, on the Republican health deduction, the Joint Tax Committee estimates that while over 26 million individuals would receive benefits under the proposal, only 1.6 million individuals would be newly insured as a result. In contrast, the Democrats in Congress and the Clinton-Gore Administration plan would expand coverage to 5 million uninsured Americans. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we help the families who care for our nation's elderly. 
   Democrats solution--accept the Republicans deduction for long-term care insurance in exchange for inclusion of a proposal to provide a $3,000 tax credit for long-term care costs. 
   Republican's bill--provide a health care deduction for long-term care costs. 
   Result of their plan--they provide half of the benefits of the long-term care credit that the Democrats provide. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that all Americans are insured. 
   Democrats solution--bipartisan policies for health insurance options for children with disabilities, legal immigrant pregnant women and children, and enrolling uninsured children in schools, needed payment increases to hospitals, academic health centers, home health agencies and other vulnerable providers. 
   Republican's bill--provides over one-third of the cost of their medicare bill to the HMOs. 
   Result of their plan--there is no accountability to prevent excessive payment increases to HMOs and failure to address the urgent health needs of seniors, people with disabilities, and children. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we encourage medical research and expand vaccine distribution to proactively approach medicine. 
   Democrats solution--a bipartisan tax credit for vaccine research and purchases for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and any infectious disease that causes over 1 million deaths annually. 
   Republican's bill--nothing. 
   Result of their plan--this is a failure to address a problem of serious ramifications. These diseases cause almost half of all deaths worldwide of people under age 45, killing over 8 million children each year and orphaning millions more. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that low and middle income individuals save and invest for their future. 
   Democrats solution--provide savings incentives to low and middle income individuals through retirement savings accounts. 
   Republican's bill--they specifically dropped this provision from the bipartisan Senate Finance Committee bill. 
   Result of their plan--a failure to address the lack of pension coverage for 70 million people. I want to just add one point here. Every year, through tax incentives, private pensions cost the fisc $76 billion. Yet 75 percent of American households in the 15 percent tax bracket--that means income of about $30,000--receive little or no tax incentive on their IRA or pension contribution. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we meet our current obligations before we promise new programs for distressed communities. 
   Democrats solution--fully fund the currently existing empowerment zones to spur economic development in distressed communities. 
   Republican's bill--create new renewal communities without meeting our promise to the existing empowerment zone communities. 
   Result of their plan--irresponsible pandering to wealthy business owners who will benefit from their new renewal communities at the expense of low and middle income entrepreneurs. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we don't turn our backs on those areas most in need. 
   Democrats solution--provide an economic activity credit to encourage business investment in jobs for the residents of Puerto Rico. 
   Republican's bill--they specifically rejected this provision. 
   Result of their plan-- this equates to turning their backs on the hard working people of Puerto Rico. Even while at an historical low of about 10.1 percent, the unemployment rate in Puerto Rico continues to remain well above that of any state; the per capita income in Puerto Rico, which was $9,908 in FY 1999, is less than half that of any state; and well over 50 percent of the labor force in Puerto Rico are within $1.00 of the current minimum wage. 
   The Democrats are fighting to ensure that we encourage adoption of special needs children from foster care programs. 
   Democrats solution--change a few words in the current tax code to ensure that families who adopt children from foster care can benefit from the same tax credit which is available to parents who adopt international children. 
   Republican's bill--specifically ignored a more inclusive approach. 
   Result of their plan--the Republicans turned their backs on those children with the greatest needs. 
   Let's look at some of those who do benefit under the Republican plan for example--the Texas State Universities. Now, stay with me on this. The Republicans--well I should say only about 4 or 5 Republicans, in their closed door, secret meetings included a couple of interesting rifle shots in their tax bill. The one, interestingly enough, would provide a specific exception just for the Texas state universities, that would make their interest on bonds nontaxable. The American people are giving the Texas state universities a $4 million gift --while our public elementary and high school students are learning in trailers. 
   The bottom line is that the Republicans want to help big business and the HMOs. The Democrats reject this approach. The Democrats are fighting for fundamental fairness for the American people--our children, our elderly,  and all individuals of every race, color, and creed.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my friend from Oklahoma, it would seem, based upon the complexity of the tax bill and the difficult problems that we have with the Commerce-State-Justice bill, that this debate is not going to take place in a couple of hours. I think it is going to take a long time. I have to give some assurance to the people on our side of the aisle that I would say it is going to be a long day. I very seriously doubt there will be votes early this day. 
   I suggest to my friends on the minority side, and I think it should have some resonance on the majority side, it is very likely we will be doing things here tomorrow. Remember, we have, among other things, a 24-hour CR and we have some of the most important measures we have had to deal with this entire Congress; that is, this $250 billion tax bill, plus Commerce-State-Justice, which is about $40 billion. A vast majority of the issues have not been debated on the Senate floor. These are ``first impression'' for most of us. So I think we are going to have to talk about them to some degree.

We in Nevada believe in States rights. We are part of the great western heritage. 
   Is it true that if this particular legislation passes, the people of the State of Nevada should be aware of the fact that we could repeal something that they pass in the legislature or by ballot proposition?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could say to my Democratic colleagues, we have a number of people who have indicated a desire to speak on this issue prior to 3:15. And we appreciate the effort made by the Senator from Oregon. We have Senator LINCOLN, to whom we are going to yield 5 minutes; Senator BAYH, to whom we are going to yield 5 minutes; Senator TORRICELLI, 10 minutes; and Senator DORGAN, 10 minutes; Senator BAUCUS, 10 minutes; Senator CONRAD, 12 minutes. 
   Each minute they are not here means their portion of the share of time will be lessened because we are next in line to speak, and there is no one on the Republican side to speak. The time I have allocated here will use up basically all of our time. There will, of course, be time after the 3:15 vote where people can come and speak on any issue they desire. But I have announced to the Senate those who have requested time. Unless there is some other arrangement made, those who desire to speak prior to 3:15 will not be able to do so until after 3:15. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and request that time be allocated between both sides evenly.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, no one in the Congress has worked harder than you have. So I know you, as much as anyone, would like to have this session end. But I do say, in response to my friend from Oklahoma about working the weekend--now, I am not an expert in religion; we have a Chaplain and others to take care of our professional aspects of religion--but 
   I do know that even in biblical times, when the ox was in the mire on the Sabbath, you had to help get that animal out of the mud. I think that is what we are in now. 
   It may be necessary that we work on Sunday; We have so many things left to do. I agree with the minority leader. These breaks don't have us doing the work that we need to do. We need our attention focused on completing Commerce-State-Justice, doing this tax bill, and doing whatever needs to be done on bankruptcy, if, in fact, anything is going to be done. There are a number of items we have to do. The minute we say we are not going to do anything until Tuesday, Washington is vacated and nothing is done.

   Mr. REID. If I could say to my friend, before he leaves the floor, I just came from the studio where I did a little TV thing because we are now not going to be able to be in Nevada next week. Senator BRYAN and I joined together to name a hospital for the most decorated soldier from Nevada who served in  World War II, a man by the name of Jack Streeter, who is alive. 
   It is amazing, as I went through this American hero's record--seven Silver Stars, two Bronze Stars, five Purple Hearts--now, I know that the Senator from West Virginia, his medals have not been on the field of battle in Germany like my friend Jack Streeter, but I was thinking, as the Senator was talking to me--I am the minority whip. Of course, this is one of the lesser positions the Senator from West Virginia has held. 
   The Senator from West Virginia has been whip, majority leader, minority leader more than once, and in addition to that, the honor that most people would feel they had fulfilled their career with, of being chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   So I say to my friend publicly, as I have said privately, what an honor it is to be able to serve with one of the legends, in his own time, of the Senate: ROBERT BYRD. There are not many Senators that you think of as being so closely connected with the Senate as ROBERT BYRD. We have the Calhouns and we have a few people whose names come to our mind, but ROBERT BYRD is someone, when the history books are written, will always be mentioned as one of the all-time leaders of the congressional process. What a great honor it is to be able to serve with the Senator from West Virginia.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my good friend from West Virginia talked about his opposition to the provision in the bill dealing with Latino immigrant fairness. He and I have had a number of conversations about that. I, of course, respect his views as were just laid out here, his feelings on that piece of legislation. 
   Briefly, I would just say about this legislation that the Republicans have chosen to ignore what we felt is something that is very important. We have tried to have hearings. We have tried to do legislation on this. Simply, we were ignored. 
   We, of course, have met with our counterparts in the House. And they feel strongly about this. They have been ignored, just as we have over here. We have received the support of the administration to help us in crafting legislation that would protect what we believe is a basic tenet of American justice. 
   They have decided to ignore our bill and those who support it, and have decided to include their own immigration bill. The President has had no choice but to do this drastic maneuvering measure. We have tried, time and time again, to bring this bill to the floor, and it is always met by the other side's intransigence. 
   We have a simple goal: One of fairness. We want one set of rules for all refugees and immigrants. And we offer a clear plan to correct serious flaws in our immigration code. Meanwhile, the majority is trying to cloud the issues, distort our bill, and create an intricate maze that helps very few. 
   The current system is unworkable and unfair. Out plan aims to correct flaws in the current unworkable and biased immigration rules. For instance: 
   There is one set of rules for Cubans and Nicaraguan refugees who fled left-wing dictatorships; and another, far stricter set of rules for refugees from Central America, the Caribbean, and Liberia who fled other dictatorships; 
   Because Congress failed to renew Section 245(i), families who have a right to be together here in the U.S. are being torn apart, sometimes for up to 10 years; They are forced to leave their families and can't come back for 10 years. They haven't done anything illegal. 
   Because of past Congressional action and bureaucratic bungling, some people who were eligible for a legalization program enacted in 1986 are now U.S. citizens; while others are facing deportation. 
   Democrats want a simple set of fair rules that make sense and clean up the immigration code. 
   We want to establish legal parity between Central American, Liberian and Caribbean refugees so that all refugees who fled political turmoil in the 1990s are treated the same. 
   We want to renew 245(i). This provision, which has allowed all family members of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents to adjust their status while in the U.S., has been allowed to expired. Our proposal would renew it and allow all immigrants who have a legal right to become permanent residents to apply for their green cards in the U.S. and remain here with their families while they wait for a decision. 
   The registry date would allow all persons who came to the U.S. before 1986 to be eligible to adjust their status. This provision has been regularly updated since enactment in 1929 but has not been updated since 1972. 
   Republicans now agree that Congress should help some immigrants, but their proposal provides no relief on parity, little on 245(i), and even less on the registry date.  
   When you read the fine print, their immigration proposals don't fix what is broken in our immigration code. 
   Instead, the majority wants to continue to pick and choose between immigrants and which countries they should come from--rewarding some, denying others, with no just cause. 
   We want a simple, fair, family unification policy. That's what we're proposing. That's what we'll fight for. That's what Congress must do before we adjourn. 
   The main reason I came to the floor today is to respond to my friend from Idaho who came to the floor to talk about some of the things the Vice President said that were exaggerations, according to him. I would like to comment on some of the statements he made. This is a difficult game. The game is that these men go around giving a lot of statements, Bush and GORE. And they should be held to the same standard. What is that standard? Listen to everything they say. 
   Now, we know from an October 23 Washington Post in a column written by Michael Kinsley entitled ``The Emperor's New Brain'' that:  
   George W. Bush's handling of the stupidity issue has been nothing short of brilliant. A Martian watching the last presidential debate might have concluded that this man would be well-advised not to put quite so much emphasis on mental testing.  
   This has been raised by the Senator from Idaho, and I am happy to respond. The same article says:  
   But if George W. Bush isn't a moron, he is a man of impressive intellectual dishonesty and/or confusion. His utterances frequently make no sense on their own terms. His policy recommendations are often internally inconsistent and mutually contradictory.  
   He further states:  
   When he repeatedly attacks his opponents for ``partisanship,'' does he get the joke? When he blames the absence of a federal patients' rights law on ``a lot of bickering in Washington, D.C.,'' has he noticed that the bickering consists of his own party which controls Congress, blocking the legislation? When he summarizes, ``It's kind of like a political issue as opposed to a people issue,'' does he mean to suggest anything in particular? Perhaps that politicians, when acting politically, ignore the wishes of the people? 
   In the debate, he declared, ``I don't want to use food as a diplomatic weapon from this point forward. We shouldn't be using food. It hurts the farmers. It's not the right thing to do.'' When, just a few days later, he criticized legislation weakening the trade embargo on Cuba--which covers food along with everything else--had he rethought his philosophy on the issue? Or was there nothing to rethink.  
   The article ends by saying:  
   In short, does George W. Bush mean what he says, or does he understand it? The answer can't be both. And is both too much to ask for?  
   My friend from Idaho talked about some things that AL GORE had said over the years. We will talk about those in a minute. He said he was here because of some of the statements I made. I didn't make any statements. I came here without any editorial comment other than saying I was quoting direct, verbatim statements made by Gov. George Bush. 
   I am not going to go through the 20-odd pages of ``Bushisms" or whatever you want to call them. I am going to talk about a few that obviously got the attention of my friend from Idaho.

   Saginaw, MI, September 29, a few weeks ago:

   Redwood, CA, September 27:  
   I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.  
   On the Oprah show:  
   I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans.  
   As I said, I have talked about some of the things he has said. I haven't in any way changed a single word, a single paragraph, a single spelling. I just quoted directly. This is a man who is running for President of the United States. I think it is something we need to consider, especially in light of the fact that on Wednesday, the Rand commission came out with a study. The Rand commission is bipartisan. They are widely respected. They are independent. Basically what they said is that all the claims that Governor Bush has made about education in Texas, how it has improved, simply are false, not true. Then we have the next day, on Thursday, the Actuary Commission came out and said that if you took into consideration all of the things that Governor Bush wanted to do with Social Security and taxes, it would, in effect, bankrupt the country. 
   I think we have to recognize that Governor Bush is talking about some real big whoppers, if the Senator from Idaho wants to talk about whoppers. 
   In fact, the Wall Street Journal, which is deemed by some to be the newspaper of the Republican Party, had in a news story, dated October 12 of the year 2000, a headline saying ``The Biggest Whopper: The Bush Tax Cut.'' 
   Among other things, the article says:  
   Writing before last night's debate, the winner for the biggest exaggeration is easy: George W. Bush and his tax cut. 
   The GOP nominee claims his tax measure principally will help the working poor and middle-class Americans. The rich, he says, will get a smaller percentage than they currently do, and the tax plan comfortably fits with projected budget surpluses and his Social Security plans. 
   None of that is true. 
   Instead of making the case that a huge tax cut is necessary to reward the productive elements of society who will make the investments that ultimately benefit everyone, Mr. Bush misrepresents the size and shape of his proposal. He suggests that after setting aside half of the 10-year surplus for Social Security, he will divide the rest between tax cuts and initiatives in areas like education, health care and defense. In truth, he proposes over $1.3 trillion in tax cuts and less than $500 billion for those other initiatives, not including $196 billion of unspecified reductions in discretionary spending.  
   The biggest whopper:  
   The Bush claim that his tax cut not only doesn't reward the rich but actually makes them pay more is really phony.  
   The article goes on to say:  
   The Republican nominee has been unsparing in his criticism of the Clinton-Gore administration's defense spending, claiming more needs to be done on pay, readiness and missile defense. Yet over the decade, the Gore budget envisions spending $55 million more than Mr. Bush proposes. Why? The Texan can't afford it, given his tax cuts. 
   The press has tripped all over itself to praise Mr. Bush for suggesting a ``solution'' to long-term Social Security with partial privatization. Yet unlike the serious Social Security proposals--such as Senators Pat Moynihan and Bob Kerrey--Mr. Bush insists he can do this without any cuts in Social Security benefits.  
   Of course, Mr. President, that is indicated in the study by the actuaries as absolutely impossible; it can't be done. And ``In His Own Words'' in the New York Thursday, October 26, 2000, there were remarks out of Sanford, Florida, where George W. Bush said:  
   They're trying to say, you know, old George W. is going to take away your check. But I'm going to set aside $2.4 trillion of Social Security surplus.  
   On October 17, in the debate, here is what he said:  
   ..... And one of my promises is going to be Social Security reform. And you bet we need to take a trillion dollar--a trillion dollars out of that $2.4 trillion surplus.  
   Well, he heads to Florida and then increases it by $1.4 trillion. With all due respect, I am not sure that the good Governor understands. According to people who have studied the issue, he doesn't. You can't do both. You can't cut Social Security and think that those moneys that are set aside to pay benefits can also be taken out to put into privatization. It won't work. 
   My friend from Idaho said today that one of the things that AL GORE is considered to be untruthful about is his statement that he was involved in the authorship of the book that was made into a great movie by Erich Segal called Love Story. He is saying it is simply untrue that AL GORE had anything to do with that. But understand that the author of the book, who I think should have some foundation to  speak about the book he wrote, says that his protagonist, Oliver Barret IV--the man in Love Story--was partly based on Mr. GORE. Now, that is a fact. Erich Segal, the author, said that his protagonist in the book Love Story, Oliver Barret IV, was based on ALBERT GORE. So what my friend from Idaho said, and what others have said, cannot contradict what the author of the book has said. 
   Talking about exaggerations and misstatements, look at the Seattle Post-Intelligencer on October 4 of this year. Byline, Paul Krugman. He says:  
   I really, truly wasn't planning to write any more columns about George W. Bush's arithmetic. But his performance on ``Moneyline'' last Wednesday was just mind-blowing. I had to download a transcript to convince myself that I had really heard him correctly. 
   It was as if Bush aides had prepared him with a memo saying: ``You've said some things on the stump that weren't true. Your mission, in the few minutes you have, is to repeat all those things. Don't speak in generalities--give specific false numbers. That'll show them.'' 
   First, Bush talked about the budget--``There's about $4.6 trillion of surplus projected,'' he declared, which is true, even if the projections are dubious. He went on to say: ``I want some of the money, nearly a trillion, to go to projects like prescription drugs for seniors. Money to strengthen the military to keep the peace. I've got some views about education around the world. I want to--you know, I've got some money in there for the environment.''  
   Figure that one out, if you can. 
   Mr. President, further in the New York Times of October 11, a man by the name of Paul Krugman writes a column, and the heading is: ``A Retirement Fable; No Fuzzy Numbers Needed.'' 
   Among other things, he says:  
   Mr. Bush has made an important political discovery. Really big misstatements, it turns out, cannot be effectively challenged, because voters can't believe that a man who seems so likable would do that sort of thing. In last week's debate Mr. Bush again declared that he plans to spend a quarter of the surplus on popular new programs, even though his own budget shows he plans to spend less than half that much. .....And he insists that he has a plan to save Social Security, when his actual proposal, as it stands, would bankrupt the system.  
   Michael Kinsley, in the Washington Post, on the 24th, a couple days ago, says, among other things, referring to Bush:  
   His utterances frequently make no sense in their own terms. His policy recommendations are often internally inconsistent and mutually contradictory. Because it's harder to explain and prove, intellectual dishonesty doesn't get the attention that petty fibbing does, even though intellectual dishonesty indicts both a candidate's character and his policy positions. All politicians.....get away with more of it than they should. But George W. gets away with an extraordinary amount of it.  
   He continues to say.  
   .....he'll get the trillion dollars needed for his partial privatization ``out of the surplus.'' Does he not understand that the current surplus is committed to future benefits, which will have to be cut to make the numbers work? Or does he understand and not care?  
   Kinsley further says:  
   When he repeatedly attacks his opponent for ``partisanship,'' does he get the joke? When he blames the absence of a federal patients' rights law on ``a lot of bickering in Washington, DC,'' has he noticed that the bickering consists of his own party, which controls Congress, blocking the legislation?  
   Also, if we are talking about people who misstate things, let's really put a magnifying glass on some of the things that the Governor has said. In last week's debate, GORE described his own education plan, but Bush said that the ``three'' men convicted in the murder of James Byrd, a black man dragged to his death from his pickup truck, will receive the death penalty. That is not quite true. One faces life imprisonment. Bush took credit for expanding a child's health insurance program in Texas. He took credit in the debate for working with the Democrats to get a Patients' Bill of Rights. He vetoed that. And then he says we have a provision to allow lawsuits. He didn't sign that. 
   Mr. President, we hear a lot about how the Vice President has been involved in the Russian situation. And he has. He has done a good deal to work out differences between the two nations--the former Soviet Union and now Russia. The Vice President has had extensive experience working on that. One of the people he worked with was Prime Minister Chernomyrdin, who he didn't pick, the Russian government picked him. In this debate--we all heard it--and I will get the citations from the Washington Post, byline by Howard Kurtz and others. He said:  
   Money from the International Monetary Funded wound up in the pocket of former Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin. Chernomyrdin has been linked to corruption.  
   Experts say there is no proof he received any IMF money. 
   Further, Bush said that our European friends would put troops on the ground in the Balkans, where the bulk of the peacekeeping forces are in Bosnia and Kosovo. Bush also cited Haiti as example of a country from which the U.S. should withdraw its troops, when in fact all but 100 troops have left. 
   Mr. President, the Senator from Idaho said he will be back 
   Monday afternoon. I am happy to visit with him on the statements that the Governor of the State of Texas has made. I didn't make them, he made them. I simply came to the Senate floor to discuss with the American people what he has said:  
   I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans. 
   Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it. 
   I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully. 
   I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy. 
   Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream. 
   I understand small business growth.. I was one.

   I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family. 
   Rarely is the question asked: Is our children learning? 
   The important question is, how many hands have I shaked?  
   These are statements made by the Governor of the State of Texas. 
   Anytime anyone wants to come and talk to me about the statements made by the Governor of the State of Texas, I am happy to do it. I didn't make them up. I am quoting them directly.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to my friend from Ohio who read the unanimous consent request, the substance of the agreement is fine with the minority. We would only hope that there could be a definite time locked in for a vote. During the last couple of weeks, there have been a lot of Members who simply have not known when they were going to be called upon to vote. They have other business they are conducting. We, again, have no disagreement with the substance of the unanimous consent agreement. However, we object unless we can get a definite time as to when we can vote. 
   I also say, through the Chair to my friend from Ohio, it is not as if there are a number of votes being anticipated here so that we are going to slow things up if you set, for example, 5 o'clock, which we would suggest, as a definite time for voting on these amendments. So until we can get a definite time locked in for voting on the amendments, at or about 5 o'clock, we would object, and I do object.

   Mr. REID. The general debate time is gone. The majority and minority used more than their allotted time. We have 4 hours under the control of the Senator from New Hampshire, and we would make it easier for staff and the parties here debating if we would explicitly determine that the time you are going to use will come off Senator GREGG's time. Otherwise, we don't have any time to be debating. Would the Senator from New Hampshire allow the Senator from Vermont to use part of his time?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is an important piece of legislation. Although we will not spend time on the floor debating it or talking about it, that does not take away from the significance of the needlestick bill. 
   I extend my appreciation to everyone on the majority side and the many people who have worked on our side for coming up with a bipartisan bill to alleviate a significant problem that nurses in America have had for many years.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on October 17, 1997, 28-year-old Lisa Black, a registered nurse from Reno, Nevada, was nursing a man in the terminal stages of AIDS when a needle containing his blood punctured her skin. 
   Today, Lisa Black is infected with Hepatitis C and HIV. 
   She must take 22 pills a day to keep her HIV infection from progressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects of Hepatitis C. 
   Karen Daley, a nurse for over 20 years and President of the Massachusetts Nurses Association, sustained a needlestick injury when she reached her gloved hand into a needle box to dispose of the needle with which she had drawn blood. 
   Karen Daley did everything in her power and took all the necessary precautions--including wearing gloves and following proper procedures--to reduce her risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Her injury did not occur because she was careless or distracted or not paying attention to what she was doing. 
   Karen Daley has good reason to believe that had a safer needle and disposal system been in place at her hospital, she would not be sick today. According to the CDC, eighty percent of all needlestick injuries can be prevented through the use of safer needles. 
   I am pleased that today we are passing bipartisan legislation--the Needlestick Worker Safety and Prevention Act--that will help reduce the incidence of needlestick injuries and illnesses, like those sustained by Karen Daley and Lisa Black. 
   The Health Care Worker Safety and Prevention Act will strengthen the Occupational Safety and Health Administration's (OSHA) standard on bloodborne pathogens to encourage greater utilization of newer, safer devices in health facilities. It will require the involvement of workers who provide direct patient care in determining which safer needles and sharps to use in the workplace and a more consistent documentation of all needlestick injuries. 
   I would like to thank Senators KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, and ENZI as well as Representatives BALLENGER and OWENS for their commitment to this legislation. I am pleased that we were able to come together across party lines to protect the health and safety of our front-line health care workers.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want to say a couple things to him and have on the record of the Senate for the remainder of time of this Republic the fact that  the State of Nevada has had 23 Senators, and never in the history of the State of Nevada on any level of government have there been two elected officials who have worked more closely together than Senators BRYAN and REID. 
   We took the bar together in 1963. He then began service for a short period of time as a private attorney. Then he became a prosecuting attorney and then Nevada's first public defender. We went to the State legislature together in 1967 where we were known as the ``gold dust twins.'' We were the only two freshmen in that 60-body legislature. That was the beginning of our love for the legislative process. 
   Senator BRYAN went on to serve, after the Nevada Assembly, in the State senate, then to serve as attorney general of the State of Nevada, as Governor of Nevada, elected twice, and then he came to Washington as a U.S. Senator. No one in the history of the State of Nevada has had such an electric and exciting political career as Senator RICHARD BRYAN. I feel so fortunate that this partnership we have developed over the years is one we both feel good about. 
   As strong as the partnership is of Senators REID and BRYAN, as he mentioned, the knowledge that we in Nevada have as to the relationship of Richard and Bonnie Bryan is very significant. She literally has been with him every step of the way. She was a wonderful first lady who is still talked about as to her proficiency. 
   It is with a great deal of sadness that occasions such as this have come since he announced his retirement. The first came when he announced at a press conference in front of his alma mater, Las Vegas High School, he wasn't going to run anymore. I shed about all the tears I could on that occasion. I don't think I have shed any tears since then publicly, but I have privately. My life will never be the same without Senator RICHARD BRYAN working with me. We have had a wonderful run. I hope that at least I can speak from his perspective that the people of the State of Nevada have benefited as a result of his service. He has done some wonderful things--helping local government in Nevada, State government in Nevada, and helping people throughout America, especially with his consumer advocacy. 
   So I wish there were something I could say that would translate into the love and affection and admiration I have for Senator BRYAN, but I can't do that, other than to close by acknowledging our unique friendship and the love we have for one another. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

The Senator from California is aware that, in effect, the Rand Corporation's independent report came out yesterday and said the things Governor Bush has been saying about education in Texas are wrong, not true, misleading. The children in Texas, in fact, aren't doing any better than the children in other places. They are doing worse. Has the Senator noticed those statements from the other side in trying

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri did not mislead me. He never has. The fact is, he didn't contemplate our leader coming forward and saying a number of things that the Senator felt deserved a response. I enjoyed listening to the Senator from Missouri, even though I may not have agreed. 
   Mr. President, first of all, just a couple of comments on what my friend from Missouri just said. 
   With the pension provision in the bill--now some $64 billion--it is true there was some action taken in the Finance Committee. But not a single second was spent on this floor dealing with the $64 billion provision which is jammed into this bill. 
   On the budget amendment, $80 billion--nothing in finance. In fact, the chairman of the Finance Committee said he would allow a vote in the Finance Committee if all the Members promised not to bring up prescription drugs in any way, or Patients' Bill of Rights. The minority would not agree to that. It seems totally reasonable in the Finance Committee that this is something that should have been brought up. As a result of the chairman's action, the matter was not brought before the Finance Committee. And again this $80 billion matter received no floor consideration. 
   New markets initiative: $25 billion--nothing in the Finance Committee; no action taken on the floor. 
   Keep in mind that I have gone over just a few things; in fact, three. We are already up to about $200 billion, and not a single minute spent on the Senate floor with $200 billion of the taxpayers' money. That doesn't take into consideration foreign sales. That is $4.5 billion. The Finance Committee spent a little time on that; nothing on the floor. Why? Because the outlandish proposition was made that if this came to the floor, someone was going to offer an amendment. Pardon me. But isn't that what the Senate is all about? People have a right to offer amendments to pieces of legislation. But because there was this terrible threat that on a piece of legislation a Senator will offer an amendment, we have no floor action on it; again, $4.5 billion. 
   I also say there is going to be plenty of debate tomorrow on a number of these issues. But on this bill itself, there has been no conference and no Democratic involvement at all in bringing this bill to the point where it is. The Democrats were not even allowed to see the document until it came here. 
   These are members of the Finance Committee. One of the most bipartisan and, I would say, nonpartisan people I have ever worked with is the senior Senator from Louisiana, JOHN BREAUX, a senior Member of the Finance Committee. He was not allowed to look at any of the papers. He was not happy about that. 
   Today the bill was dumped in our lap. 
   I would also say about the assisted suicide that there will be lots of debate on it tomorrow. The Senator from Oregon, Senator WYDEN, feels very strongly about this, as he should. Why? It doesn't matter how you feel on this  issue. The fact is that the voters in the State of Oregon said we feel this way on assisted suicide. As a result of the people of Oregon passing a law in the State of Oregon, we now have this action. 
   It seems to me those who keep talking about States rights should leave a State alone. People of the State of Oregon voted a certain way. If you disagree with what the people of the State of Oregon did in voting in favor of assisted suicide, then let's at least have the ability on the Senate floor to debate the issue which we have been prevented from doing. 
   My friend from Missouri, for whom I have the greatest respect, talked about health care. 
   They always throw in the 1993 Clinton health care plan. Let's bring this down to reality so people really understand what this is all about. 
   When the health care debate started, 80 percent of the people 
   of America favored reforming the health care system. But then comes Halloween and the masquerade by the health insurance industry. They spent over $100 million trying to abuse and frighten the American people. They succeeded beyond anyone's wildest dreams. They were probably even surprised on how they succeeded in frightening the people of America with their Harry and Louise ads and with their clever manipulations. 
   As a result of that, we got no health care reform because after they did their television and radio advertising, 80 percent of the people in America didn't want health care reform. They were frightened. They were confused. 
   That doesn't take away from the fact that we now have 45 million people with no health insurance. It doesn't take away from the fact that we have many people who have insurance that gives them minimum and inadequate rights. That is why we tried to pass the Patients' Bill of Rights--to give patients certain rights.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Missouri not so subtly indicated that he thinks there is going to be a new world out there after the November 7 election. I think he is going to be very disappointed. He is going to be disappointed because the American people understand the record of George W. Bush better each day. 
   For example, the prescription of George W. Bush for health care, I think, is bad medicine for America. Why? Because the State of Texas and George Bush have the worst record in the nation on health insurance coverage. That says a lot. But he has won that award; just like Houston is the most polluted city in America. He won that award. He also wins the award for the worse health coverage in America. Texas has fallen to last among all States in overall health insurance coverage. Texas ranks second to last in health insurance coverage for children, and the percentage of children without coverage has gone up under the Governor. 
   While nationwide Medicaid enrollment has increased, Medicaid enrollment in Texas has declined. 
   George W. Bush retains roadblocks to eligible populations in health programs. Even a judge found Texas guilty of not providing 1.5 million children with adequate health care. This was August of this year. The justice said the State failed not only the 1.5 million children but 13,000 abused and neglected children. Rather than taking corrective action, the State decided to appeal the court's ruling over the objection of State legislators. 
   Texas legislators blame Bush for Texas' poor health insurance coverage. 
   In a letter to the Vice President from Texas State representatives, 
   the Governor prioritized oil breaks over children's health insurance in 1999. In 1999, after Bush deemed a $45 million oil industry tax break an emergency and made it the first signed bill of the session, Democratic legislators questioned his priorities in putting the legislation before expanding the CHIP program, or children health insurance programs. ``It's about priorities,'' Democratic representative Dale Tillery said. ``I know a whole lot of uninsured children, but I don't know a whole lot of poor oilmen.'' 
   I could go into more detail about Governor Bush's record on health care but this gives us a general idea. 
   The American public is beginning to find out more about George W. Bush. Yesterday, the Rand Corporation, a nonprofit organization that helps improve policy and decisionmaking through research and analysis, an independent, fair, nonpartisan corporation, said that claims Governor Bush has been making about education in Texas and how well they are doing is without foundation, not factual. In fact, the only way that Governor Bush is able to take any credit for it is that tests are skewed in Texas. The Rand Corporation said if you use Texas math in any State, the education scores all over America would be magnified. 
   The fact is, the State of Texas is doing worse that most States. What Governor Bush is claiming about education is simply without foundation. 
   In addition to the independent Rand Corporation, another independent nonpartisan body, the American Academy of Actuaries, reported today that Governor Bush's proposed tax cut will basically bankrupt the country. The American Academy of Actuaries report finds that George W. Bush's $3 trillion tax cut, combined with his plan to divert money from the Social Security trust fund into individual stock market accounts, would make it all but impossible to eliminate the publicly held national debt. In fact, one of the people from the American Academy of Actuaries who worked on this report said: I don't see any way they pay off the public debt. Given Bush's large package of tax cuts, the budget will go negative quickly. There won't be a surplus anymore. 
   This is not a partisan report. It has been produced by one of the most widely respected organizations in America. The American Academy of Actuaries is part of a growing chorus of voices which have discredited Governor Bush's plan to privatize this Nation's most successful Federal program in our history, Social Security. In August, the Century Foundation also concluded that Governor Bush was making a promise to seniors and to young people that he couldn't keep with his Social Security privatization scheme. You can't do it for both. 
   This study, which was written by the respected economist Henry J. Aaron and former Federal Reserve Board member Alan Blinder, found that diverting just 2 percentage points of the Social Security payroll tax into private accounts would result in a reduction of benefits by as much as 54 percent and higher payroll taxes to keep the Social Security trust fund solvent. 
   In addition, Larry Summers, the Secretary of the Treasury, who is also a trustee of the Social Security system, and therefore has a fiduciary relationship to make sure the system remains solvent, said if just 2 percent of the payroll tax is diverted from the Social Security revenue stream, the Social Security trust fund will lack the resources to pay benefits by the time someone who is now 40 retires. 
   By today's report, the most damning indictment of the Bush plan to date is this report from the actuary group, the first independent report finding that the Federal budget surplus, a result of hard choices we have made in this country, would be eliminated by Governor Bush's shaky retirement scheme. To add insult to injury, not only would we return to the bad old days of deficits as far as the eye could see, we would devastate the most popular social program in the Nation's history, a program which has 
   virtually eliminated the poverty rate among the elderly, provides critical benefits to disabled Americans, and supports widows, many of whom have little or no retirement security. 
   Let's review what is at stake in this privatization scheme. We have turned a record deficit of $400 billion, counting the Social Security surplus we used to use to hide the deficit, in 1992, to a record surplus this year of $260 billion. We have paid down more than $450 billion in debt. We sparked the longest expansion in economic history, 22 million new jobs, the fastest and longest real wage growth in three decades, the lowest unemployment in three decades, the highest home ownership in two decades, and the largest 5-year drop in childhood poverty since the 1960s. 
   I was on a debate a week ago last Sunday and two Republican colleagues who I had the pleasure of discussing the issues with started saying it is because the Gingrich Congress that we  were able to get this House in order. I said: You must have been talking to Frank Luntz who is the pollster who always tells you guys what to say. I didn't know, but as I was speaking, he was in the room. He had been there discussing with these two Members of Congress what they should say. 
   We should state the facts. The 1993 Clinton Budget Deficit Reduction Act passed this body without a single Republican vote, passed the House of Representatives without a single Republican vote; the tie was broken by Vice President GORE, setting this Nation on a road to economic recovery. That is what happened. There were all kinds of prophecies of doom. I read them in the RECORD earlier today. That didn't come to be. This legislation has put this country where it should be. 
   There is a real chance we could throw all this away with Governor Bush's $3 trillion tax cut and his dangerous Social Security privatization plan. For a month, the Vice President has been saying that Bush's plan would hurt Social Security and bring us record deficits. Governor Bush called that fuzzy math. Now the Nation's best mathematicians have found that the public's economic plans and Social Security plans could do just that--bankrupt this Nation and Social Security. 
   This report validates everything that the minority has been saying over here. It tells us that George W. Bush's plan would make Social Security financially unstable during the lifetime of today's seniors. It shows Governor Bush outspending AL GORE, and AL GORE as the candidate of fiscal responsibility. By comparison, Vice President Gore and congressional Democrats want to preserve Social Security's fundamental guarantee to America's seniors. We can do that by dedicating all of the Social Security surplus to that program. 
   Of course we have to take care of debt reduction. Our plan reduces publicly held debt and would strengthen Social Security by using long-term interest savings to keep the system solvent. 
   We talked about tax cuts. But the most important tax cut the American people would ever receive is to reduce the long-held debt this country has. If we reduce that debt, it will save this country $250 to $300 billion a year according to where the interest rate is paid. That is where every American, no matter if they are rich or poor, will get a tax savings because everything they buy will be cheaper. 
   The Vice President also proposes to end the motherhood penalty by giving parents a credit toward Social Security for up to 5 years spent raising their children. The widow benefit would be increased. He is proposing retirement savings plus, which is not a privatization scheme but would allow Americans to create individual retirement accounts that would supplement their Social Security and help them reap historic long-term gains in the stock market. 
   Yesterday, I came to this floor, approximately 24 hours ago. I talked about this campaign being a campaign, we would hope, of ideas, of policy views, of a vision for what the country should be. Not the ability to operate a 7-Eleven store but to operate the greatest country in the history of the world, the only superpower left in the world. 
   Having said that, I am going to again give some direct quotes and these are all brand new. I did not talk about them last night. I am, tonight, going to again read verbatim quotes that have been made by a person, Governor Bush, who wants to be President of the United States. Here is what he said. 
   Interview with the New York Times, March 15, 2000:  
   People make suggestions on what to say all the time. I'll give you an example; I don't read what's handed to me. People say, ``Here, here's your speech, or here's an idea for a speech.'' They're changed. Trust me.  
   Interview with the Associated Press, March 8, 2000:  
   It's evolutionary, going from governor to president, and this is a significant step, to be able to vote for yourself on the ballot, and I'll be able to do so next fall, I hope.  
   Next direct quote:  
   It is not Reaganesque to support a tax plan that is Clinton in nature.  
   February 23, 2000, USA Today:  
   I don't have to accept their tenants. I was trying to convince those college students to accept my tenants. And I reject any labeling me because I happened to go to the university.  
   New York Daily News, February 19, this year:  
   I understand small business growth. I was one.  
   Florence, SC, February 17, 2000:  
   The Senator has got to understand if he's going to have--he can't have it both ways. He can't take the high horse and then claim the low road.  
   To Cokie Roberts, February 20, 2000:  
   Really proud of it. A great campaign. And I'm really pleased with the organization and the thousands of South Carolinians that worked on my behalf. I'm very gracious and humbled.  
   He said:  
   I am very gracious and humbled.  
   Newsweek, February 28, 2000:  
   I don't want to win? If that were the case why the heck am I on the bus 16 hours a day, shaking thousands of hands, giving hundreds of speeches, getting pillared in the press and cartoons and still staying on message to win?  
   Same interview:  
   I thought how proud I am to be standing up beside my dad. Never did it occur to me that he would become the gist for cartoonists.  
   Hilton Head, SC:  
   If you are sick and tired of the politics of cynicism and polls and principles, come and join this campaign.  
   That was on February 16, 2000. Again, that same day, those in Beaufort, SC:  
   How do you know if you don't measure if you have a system that simply suckles kids through?  
   Here, in Beaufort he was explaining the need for educational accountability. 
   In a South Carolina debate, February 15:  
   We ought to make the pie higher.  
   ``Meet The Press,'' February 13:  
   I do not agree with this notion that somehow if I go to try to attract votes and to lead people toward a better tomorrow somehow I get subscribed to some--some doctrine gets subscribed to me.  
   ``Meet The Press,'' February 13, 2000:  
   I've changed my style somewhat, as you know. I'm less--I pontificate less, although it may be hard to tell it from this show. And I'm more interacting with people.  
   Nashua, NH, February 1, New York Times:  
   I think we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth to the middle class, I think we should knock down the tollbooth.  
   San Antonio Express-News, January 30:  
   The most important job is not to be governor, or first lady in my case.  
   January 29, 2000:  
   Will the highways on the Internet become more few?  
   Concord, NH: 
   Los Angeles Times, January 28:  
   This is Preservation Month. I appreciate preservation. It's what you do when you run for president. You gotta preserve.  
   Chamber of Commerce in Nashua, NH, January 27:  
   I know how hard it is for you to put food on your family.  
   Quoted by Molly Ivins, this is from the San Francisco Chronical, January 21:  
   What I am against is quotas. I am against hard quotas, quotas they basically delineate based upon whatever. However they delineate, quotas, I think vulcanize society. So I don't know how that fits into what everybody else is saying their relatives positions, but that's my position.  
   Iowa Western Community College, January 21:  
   This is a quote: ``When I was coming up it was a dangerous world, and you knew exactly who they were. ..... It was us vs. them, and it was clear who them was. Today, we are not so sure who the they are, but we know they're there.''  
   This is from the Des Moines Register, January 15:  
   The administration I'll bring is a group of men and women who are focused on what's best for America, honest men and women, decent men and women, women who will see service to our country as a great privilege and who will not stain the house.  
   Financial Times, January 14:  
   This is a dangerous world. It's a world of madmen and uncertainty and potential mental losses.  
   Same interview:  
   We must all hear the universal call to like your neighbor just like you like to be liked yourself.  
   Florence, SC, January 11:  
   Rarely is the question asked: Is your children learning?  
   Same interview:  
   Gov. Bush will not stand for the subsidation of failure.  
   ``Larry King Live,'' December 16 of last year:   
   There needs to be debates, like we're going through. There needs to be town-hall meetings. There needs to be travel. This is a huge country.  
   New Hampshire, Republican debate:  
   I read the newspaper. 
   In answer to a question about his reading habits.  
   ``Meet The Press,'' November 21, of last year:  
   I think it's important for those of us in a position of responsibility to be firm in sharing our experiences, to understand that the babies out of wedlock is a very difficult chore for mom and baby alike. ..... I believe we ought to say there is a different alternative than the culture that is proposed by people such as Miss Wolf in society. ..... And, you know, hopefully condoms will work, but it hasn't worked.  
   From ``A Charge to Keep,'' by George W. Bush, published last year in November:  
   The students at Yale came from all different backgrounds and all parts of the country. Within months, I knew many of them.  
   New York Times:  
   The important question is, How many hands have I shaked?  
   The Washington Post, July 27:  
   I don't remember debates. I don't think we spent a lot of time debating it. Maybe we did, but I don't remember.  
   This is on a discussion of the Vietnam war when he was at Yale. 
   Knight Ridder News Service:  
   The only thing I know about Slovakia is what I learned first-hand from your foreign minister, who came to Texas.  
   The fact is, the meeting was not with the Minister of Slovakia but with the Prime Minister of Slovenia, two different countries. 
   June 16, New York Times:  
   If the East Timorians decide to revolt, I'm sure I'll have a statement.  
   Economist, June 12:  
   Keep good relations with the Grecians.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a remarkable Nevadan, Phyllis Thompson. Phyllis has been a resident of Henderson, Nevada since 1951. On November 1, 2000, she will be receiving the Philanthropy Day Award from St. Rose Dominican Hospital. The Philanthropy Day Award honors individuals who embody volunteerism and have made significant civic and charitable contributions. There is no one more deserving of this honor than Phyllis Thompson. 
   Phyllis Thompson is a talented and tenacious businesswoman. She entered the construction business in the early 1970s, an all-male field at the time. She and her husband Charles started Basic Ready Mix with one truck, and she had to work nights as a waitress to make ends meet. Eventually, she was able to expand the business to 175 trucks. She sold the company in 1991, but she could not stay retired for long. In 1996, she founded Phyllis E. Thompson Companies, a commercial real estate firm, which she has built into an unequivocal success. 
   Not only has Phyllis Thompson accomplished a great deal in the business world, but she has also enjoyed success as a sportsman. She has been hunting trophy deer for twenty years and is a professional off-road racer. In 1997, she won the Nevada Prim 250, a 250 mile off-road race. 
   Throughout her extraordinary life, Phyllis Thompson's true devotion has been to family. She is the proud mother of two children, Lonny and Terri, and has been blessed with six grandchildren. In addition, her charitable work has been focused on helping families. St. Rose Dominican Hospital, the Salvation Army, Boys & Girls Clubs of Henderson, Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, Safe House, and Child Seekers are among the many organizations to which she has given so much. In fact, she was recognized in 1999 as Board Member of the Year by the Boys & Girls Clubs of Henderson. 
   Philanthropy Day, established in 1986, is observed every November to recognize the importance of philanthropy in our communities. It is a time to acknowledge the entire spectrum of services provided by the non-profit community, and recognize the profound effect that volunteerism and giving have on the fabric of society. 
   Phyllis Thompson embodies the spirit of Philanthropy Day. She has shared her success and good fortune through volunteerism and philanthropy. She sets a wonderful example for all of our citizens, selflessly giving of her time, talent and financial means to help others make the most of their lives. I thank her for their friendship and all that she has done for the citizens of Nevada.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have an interesting number of issues before this body. We have talked on various occasions, not the least of which has been today, about what we have not done: A real Patients' Bill of Rights; a prescription drug coverage through Medicare; a minimum wage increase; tax-deductibility for college-level education, including lifelong learning; education funds to modernize our schools, to have afterschool programs, to have more teachers; commonsense gun safety legislation; long-term tax credits for families caring for elderly parents; and affordable housing. These issues--any one of them--could have been completed with the intercession of the Governor of Texas who is running for President. 
   The campaign, that will be completed in 12 or 13 days, is a campaign of ideas. What I would like to do tonight is spread across the RECORD of this Senate some of the ideas of George W. Bush, the Governor of the State of Texas. I say this because I think we should understand there are a number of policies that are being advocated by the Vice President and by the Governor of Texas. 
   So what I want to do today is quote verbatim, statements that have been made by George W. Bush. I will not be able to complete all of his statements tonight, but I am going to spend some time reading direct quotes of George W. Bush. Maybe I will return tomorrow or the day after to complete the statements of the Governor of the State of Texas. 
   The first quote comes from October 23, 2000. That was last Monday. Here is the direct quote:  
   I don't want nations feeling like that they can bully ourselves and our allies. I want to have a ballistic defense system so that we can make the world more peaceful, and at the same time I want to reduce our own nuclear capacities to the level commiserate with keeping the peace.  
   October 18, 2000, another direct quote:  
   Families is where our nation finds hope, where wings take dream.  
   He also said, on that same occasion, in LaCrosse, WI:  
   If I'm the president, we're going to have emergency-room care, we're going to have gag orders.  
   He also said, and I quote:  
   Drug therapies are replacing a lot of medicines as we used to know it.  
   Another direct quote:  
   It's one thing about insurance, that's a Washington term.  
   Direct quote:  
   I think we ought to raise the age at which juveniles can have a gun.  
   This is the Governor of the State of Texas, the man running for President of the United States, who has said these things. 
   The next direct quote:  
   Mr. Vice President, in all due respect, it is--I'm not sure 80 percent of the people get the death tax. I know this: 100 percent will get it if I'm the president. 
   Next direct quote:  
   Quotas are bad for America. It's not the way America is all about.  
   Direct quote. 
   October 18, in St. Louis, the same day that he said, ``Families is where our nation finds hopes, where wings take dream,'' he said:  
   If affirmative action means what I just described, what I'm for, then I'm for it.  
   In Greensboro, NC, on October 10 of this year, he said:  
   Our priorities is our faith.  
   October 11 of the year 2000:  
   I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.  
   The direct quote from Gov. George W. Bush: ``I mean, there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling, which is illiterate children.'' 
   Greensboro, NC, the day before--that is, October 10--when he was commenting on the Vice President's tax plan:  
   It's going to require numerous IRA agents.  
   The Governor of the State of Texas said, on October 4, in Reynoldsburg, OH:  
   I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question.  
   This was in response to a question about whether he wished he could take back any of his answers in the first debate. The direct quote is: ``I think if you know what you believe, it makes it a lot easier to answer questions. I can't answer your question.'' 
   I do not think that takes any discussion to figure out what he just said, because I do not think he knows what he just said. 
   In Boston, on October 3 of the year 2000, he said:  
   I would have my secretary of treasury be in touch with the financial centers, not only here but at home.  
   Saginaw, MI, September 29, 2000:  
   I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.  
   Quote: ``I know the human being and fish can coexist peacefully.'' 
   Redwood, CA, September 27, 2000:  
   I will have a foreign-handed foreign policy.  
   Again, these are direct quotes from the Governor of the State of Texas, the man who has been nominated to be President of the United States. 
   Los Angeles, September 27:  
   One of the common denominators I have found is that expectations rise above that which is expected.  
   Beaverton, OR, September 25, this year:   
   It is clear our nation is reliant upon big foreign oil. More and more of our imports come from overseas.  
   Direct quote, MSNBC, September 20, 2000:  
   Well, that's going to be up to the pundits and the people to make up their mind. I'll tell you what is a president for him, for example, talking about my record in the state of Texas. I mean, he's willing to say anything in order to convince people that I haven't had a good record in Texas.  
   September 9, on the Oprah show:  
   I am a person who recognizes the fallacy of humans.  
   Interview with Paula Zahn, September 18, 2000:  
   A tax cut is really one of the anecdotes to coming out of an economic illness.  
   I have read these over several times. I still am stunned by what has been said by the man running for President of the United States. 
   Orange, CA, September 15, 2000:  
   The woman who knew that I had dyslexia--I never interviewed her.  
   Westminster, CA, September 13:  
   The best way to relieve families from time is to let them keep some of their own money.  
   The same interview:  
   They have miscalculated me as a leader.  
   Orlando, FL, September 12, 2000:  
   I don't think we need to be subliminable about the differences between our views on prescription drugs.  
   This is a campaign of ideas, Mr. President, a discussion of policies, a discussion of having a vision of what this country needs, someone who can discuss them in a logical manner. 
   Pittsburgh, PA, September 8:  
   This is what I'm good at. I like meeting people, my fellow citizens, I like interfacing with them.  
   Westland, MI, September 8:  
   That's Washington. That's the place where you find people getting ready to jump out of the foxholes before the first shot is fired.  
   Detroit, September 7, 2000:  
   Listen, Al Gore is a very tough opponent. He is the incumbent. He represents the incumbency. And a challenger is somebody who generally comes from the pack and wins, if you're going to win. And that's where I'm coming from.  
   Houston, TX, September 6:  
   We'll let our friends be the peacemakers and the great country called America will be the pacemakers.  
   Scranton, PA, September 6:  
   We don't believe in planners and deciders making decisions on behalf of Americans.  
   Allentown, PA, September 5:  
   I regret that a private comment I made to the vice presidential candidate made it through the public airways.  
   New York Times, September 2:  
   The point is, this is a way to help inoculate me about what has come and is coming.  
   CNN online chat:  
   As governor of Texas, I have set high standards for our public schools, and I have met these standards.  
   Same interview:  
   Well, I think if you say you're going to do something and don't do it, that is trustworthiness.  
   Des Moines, IA, August 21:  
   I don't know whether I'm going to win or not. I think I am. I do know I am ready for the job. And, if not, that's just the way it goes.  
   Same, Des Moines, IA:  
   This campaign not only hears the voices of entrepreneurs and the farmers and the entrepreneurs, we hear the voices of those struggling to get ahead.  
   Des Moines, IA, August 21:  
   We cannot let terrorists and rogue nations hold this nation hostile or hold our allies hostile. 
   I have a different vision of leadership. A leadership is something who brings people together.  
   That is from Bartlett, TN, August 18. 
   August 11, Associated Press:  
   I think he needs to stand up and say if he thought the president were wrong on policy and issues, he ought to say where.  
   Salinas, CA, August 10:  
   I want you to know that farmers are not going to be secondary thoughts to a Bush administration. They will be in the forethought of our thinking.  
   Today Show interview, August 1:  
   And if he continues that, I'm going to tell the nation what I think about him as a human being and as a person.  
   Washington Post, July 15. This was a comment to New Jersey's Secretary of State, the Honorable DeForest Soaries, Jr.:  
   You might want to comment on that, Honorable.  
   Seattle Post-Intelligencer, June 23, 2000:  
   This case has had full analyzation and has been looked at a lot. I understand the emotionality of death penalty cases.  
   Cleveland, OH, June 29:  
   States should have the right to enact reasonable laws and restrictions particularly to end the inhuman practice of ending a life that otherwise could live.  
   This is another Cleveland quote from a different time, July 1:  
   Unfairly but truthfully, our party has been tagged as being against things. Anti-immigrant, for example. And we're not a party of anti-immigrants. Quite the opposite. We're a party that welcomes people.  
   Wayne, MI, June 28:  
   The fundamental question is, Will I be a successful president when it comes to foreign policy? I will be, but until I'm the president, it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll be more effective.  
   NPR radio, June 16:  
   The only things that I can tell you is that every case I have reviewed I have been comfortable with the innocence or guilt of the person that I've looked at. I do not believe we've 
   put a guilty ..... I mean innocent person to death in the State of Texas. 
   Hardball, MSNBC, discussion on abortion, May 31 of this year:  
   I'm gonna talk about the ideal world, Chris. I've read--I understand reality. If you're asking me as the president, would I understand reality, I do.  
   June 9, 2000, Wilton, CT:  
   There's not going to be enough people in the system to take advantage of people like me.  
   April 3, U.S. News and World Report:  
   I think anybody who doesn't think I'm smart enough to handle the job is underestimating.  
   This is interesting. This is also on Hardball. Governor Bush:  
   First of all, Cinco de Mayo is not the independence day. That's dieciseis de Septiembre, and .....  
   Chris Matthews says:  
   What's that in English?  
   Governor Bush:  
   Fifteenth of September.  
   Mr. President, I took 2 years of high school Spanish, and I know that is not September 15. 
   From Albuquerque, NM, on May 31:  
   Actually, I--this may sound a little West Texan to you, but I like it. What I'm talking about--when I'm talking about myself, and when he's talking about myself, all of us are talking about me. 
   Again, he said:  
   Actually I--this may sound a little west Texan to you, but I like it. What I'm talking about--when I'm talking about myself, and when he's talking about myself, all of us are talking about me.  
   Here is another direct quote from the Albuquerque on May 31:  
   This is a world that is much more uncertain than the past. In the past, we were certain, we were certain it was us versus the Russians in the past. We were certain, and therefore we had huge nuclear arsenals aimed at each other to keep the peace. That's what we were certain of. You see, even though it's an uncertain world, we're certain of some things. We're certain that even though the ``evil empire'' may have passed, evil still remains. We're certain there are people that can't stand what America stands for. We're certain there are madmen in this world, and there's terror and there's missiles, and I'm certain of this, too: I'm certain to maintain the peace, we better have a military of high morale, and I'm certain that under this administration, morale in the military is dangerously low.  
   He was talking with Paula Zahn on May 18 about Rudy Giuliani, the mayor of New York City:  
   He has certainly earned a reputation as a fantastic mayor, because the results speak for themselves. I mean, New York is a safer place for him to be.  
   This was in the New York Times on March 4, 2000:  
   The fact that he relies on facts--says things that are not factual--are going to undermine his campaign.  
   On his meeting with JOHN MCCAIN, in the Dallas Morning News on May 10, 2000, he said:  
   I think we agree, the past is over.  
   This is from Reuters, May 5, 2000:  
   It's clearly a budget. It's got a lot of numbers in it.  
   Here is an interview Governor Bush did with Jim Lehrer on The NewsHour, on April 27, 2000:  
   Governor BUSH: Because the picture on the newspaper. It just seems so un-American to me, the picture of the guy storming the house with a scared little boy there. I talked to my little brother, Jeb--I haven't told this to many people. But he's the Governor of--I shouldn't call him my little brother--my brother, Jeb, the great Governor of Texas.

   Mr. REID. I listened with amazement. In responding to my friend from Iowa, following the second debate, the Vice President, during that debate, said that there was a young lady in Florida that wasn't able to get a desk. The Republican spin doctors came back the next day and said that wasn't true, she was only out of a desk for a day. In fact, she missed 7 days because of not having room in that classroom, for whatever reason. I was so amazed that the press picked up on what the Vice President said, which to me indicated that was just one of the minor problems that we have in education. 
   I heard a day or two after the debate from Governor Bush. He said this. I heard it. He said: Well, I did fine in the debate because the expectations were so low of me that all I had to do was show up and say my name is George W. Bush and win the debate. 
   I say to my friend from Iowa, that is about how the American press has treated it. All he had to do was show up and tell his name, because if they looked into some of his statements--for one, the statement that the Senator from Iowa asked me about regarding food--it seems to me for our farmers who are suffering so much in our country today that is something the press might want to pick up on. 
   Does the Senator have another question?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, both the Senator from Wyoming and I are gratified that the Senator from Oklahoma is presiding today. We certainly look forward to closing this session. 
   From the minority's perspective, we are ready to vote as soon as possible. We know how Senator STEVENS has worked very hard to wrap up these final three appropriations bills. We hope it can be done expeditiously. 
   In recognition of the fact that once we agree on what the final plan is going to be, it usually takes a day or so to understand, that people need that time to read the bill and to make sure that final legislation is what we want, I hope tomorrow can be a full, complete day. We look forward to moving on a day-by-day basis with 24-hour continuing resolutions. The only way we are going to get out of here is to continue working. I hope if we don't make the Friday deadline, as the Senator from Wyoming indicated, which I hope we can do, that we will continue working through the weekend until we finish with the election on the national level and the State level only 2 weeks from now. 
   What we are doing here doesn't seem to be getting a lot of attention anyway, with all the problems around the world, the Presidential election, Middle East problems. It seems to me it would be to everyone's benefit to try to resolve some of the outstanding issues which are important at this stage only to Members who serve in Congress. I hope that is wrong, but it appears that is the case. 
   I repeat, for the third time today, the minority is willing and able to do whatever is possible to move these bills along to finality.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I truly enjoy working with the chairman and his staff in putting together the Energy and Water appropriations bill each year. 
   The third time's the charm. 
   This time, I think we really have completed work on the FY 2001 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. 
   I am a little surprised to be talking about final passage of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill in late October. Ours is usually one of the earliest to be passed and signed by the President. 
   Ours is also a bill that is very rarely vetoed. However, this has been an unusual year. 
   We have modified our bill to meet the Administration's needs on the Missouri River and I am confident that the President will now sign this bill promptly. 
   For the information of Senators: the Energy and Water portion of this Conference Report has not changed since all of our colleagues joined us in voting on this matter last week. 
   Our counterparts in the House insisted upon having a Conference, but no changes have been made since we completed work on the package that came before the Senate last week. In fact, it has not changed much at all since it originally passed both Houses earlier this month. 
   For the third, and, I hope, final time this year, I encourage all of my colleagues to support final passage of this Conference Report which includes both the final energy and Water and VA-HUD Conference Reports. 
   This is a very important appropriations bill, one where we are asked to pay for a broad array of programs critical to our nation's future. We fund 
   the guardians of our Nation's nuclear weapons stockpile our nation's flood control and navigation systems, infrastructure that contributes to human safety and economic growth 
   Long-term research, development, and deployment of solar and renewable technologies, programs critical to our nation's long-term energy security and environmental future and 
   Science programs that are unlocking the human genome and other breakthroughs that help to keep the U.S. at the scientific forefront of the world. 
   By and large I think this is a fine Conference Report. 
   The Conference Report we lay before the Senate totals just over $23.5 billion. Of that, $13.7 billion is set aside for defense activities and just under $9.9 billion will be spent on nondefense activities at the Department of Energy, Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and several other independent agencies. 
   It addresses the needs of our Nation's nuclear stockpile and the crumbling infrastructure at the weapons labs and plants. 
   Enhanced funding in the water accounts allows us to move forward on a handful of important new construction starts while maintaining our emphasis on clearing out the $40 billion backlog in work already authorized and ready to go. 
   We have also been able to provide much needed additional funding to both the Science and Solar and Renewable accounts at DOE. 
   I am particularly pleased to report that funding for the solar and renewable programs is $60 million higher than last year. This year's numbers are the highest these programs have seen in quite some time. 
   At a time when our Nation is once again questioning our utter and singular dependence on fossil fuels, I am delighted that we are going to be able to move forward aggressively on renewable programs. 
   Obviously, I have some disappointments about things we were not able to do this year. 
   However, as all of us know, an appropriations bill is a one year funding bill. We are never able to do all that we want and there is always next year. 
   The twin notions of one-year funding and re-visiting issues next year brings me to my final point this evening. 
   Today we are providing $199 million for the National Ignition Facility at the Lawrence Livermore National Lab in California. This is about $15 million below the oft-revised DOE request for this project. They are lucky to get that much. 
   The final funding figure represents a compromise between the Administration and Congressman PACKARD, both supportive of NIF, and Senator DOMENICI and I who both would have preferred a substantially smaller dollar amount. 
   For reasons I have discussed at length in other venues, I believe the Department and laboratory sold the Congress a bill of goods on NIF, and I do not feel that they can be trusted to get it right now. 
   Chairman PACKARD feels strongly that the lab and Department have gotten their House in order and should be given the opportunity to proceed for another year in order to prove it. 
   I have great respect for the chairman of the conference. We both came to the House of Representatives together in 1982 and I consider him a friend. I do,  however, disagree with him on this matter. 
   His work on this subcommittee has been excellent and I will miss both his good nature and his fine judgement after he retires this Fall. 
   He has prevailed upon Chairman DOMENICI and me to allow NIF to go forward for one year, albeit with substantial reporting and milestone requirements. 
   It is my hope and expectation that DOE will go out of their way to find credible, external reviewers to add some element of objectivity to the new project reviews we are imposing on the Department. 
   I am going to watch this program like a hawk for the next year. 
   If the Department and lab fall a day behind schedule or go a dollar over budget, I will not hesitate to zero NIF right out of the Senate bill next year and I suspect that Senator DOMENICI will help me do it. 
   We have given them all but a couple of percent of what the Administration requested for this project. Now is the time for performance, not excuses. 
   After nearly a year of listening to DOE and Livermore discuss the problems with this project, I am still not sure what bothers me more: The notion that DOE woke up one morning and discovered that their estimate was off by a billion dollars; or that they simply expected us to give them the money without much of a fuss. 
   A billion dollars is a tremendous amount of money. 
   I am done sitting by while DOE and the three weapons labs continue to sweet talk us into beginning projects and then revealing the real price tag to us later. 
   Livermore is on the hot seat now, deservedly so, but this is a complex-wide problem. 
   It is going to stop. 
   The chairman and I have worked together on this bill and so many other issues for many years. Despite the hard work and late nights that completing this bill requires, it is always a pleasure to work with him and his staff to get the job done. 
   Both of us had staff changes at the clerk position this year and we just kept humming along. The bill has worked as well as it ever has. 
   I thank the entire staff for all their hard work. Clay Sell, David Gwaltney, and LaShawnda Smith of Senator DOMENICI's staff have worked very well with Drew Willison, Roger Cockrell, and Liz Blevins of my staff. 
   Every year the associate subcommittee staff provides valuable advice, input, and recommendations to our staff and I am grateful for their help, too.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I did at the conference committee we had last night, I express my appreciation to Senator MIKULSKI for the great leadership she has shown in working this bill through this very difficult process. 
   As she has indicated, it takes two to do that. It is important we recognize that there are matters, when we are able to work together, where both Democrats and Republicans can work toward a common goal. That goal has been, for many months now, getting this very difficult VA-HUD bill to a point where we are now going to approve it. The Senator from Missouri is also to be commended for working so closely with the Senator from Maryland in coming up with this great piece of legislation. They are both a couple of experts in this field, not only experts in the field that covers the legislative matters before us but experts in moving the matters through the legislative process. Both sides of the aisle recognize their expertise. 
   After this conference report is approved, we will next move to a vote on a continuing resolution. What is a continuing resolution? It is when we have failed here to do our work to extend the operation of Government so it doesn't shut down. 
   So we are going to have another continuing resolution approved this afternoon. I am disappointed that we are now to a point where this is the fourth continuing resolution, I believe, that we will approve. This is for 6 days--until next Wednesday. We just completed work on a long continuing resolution. We basically completed very little during that period of time. 
   The new fiscal year is now nearly 3 weeks old, and Congress has still failed to have signed into law 9 of the 13 appropriations bills. 
   To compensate for the failure to do our work, we pass these continuing resolutions that I have talked about to stop the Government from shutting down. We have been through a Government shutdown. We know it can happen. We will now consider in a few minutes another continuing resolution. That is too bad. I find it disturbing that the continuing resolution didn't go for 24 hours at a time. 
   I have not been in the Congress as long as some people, but I have been here a long time. I can remember when a congressional session was winding down and we worked day and night. We worked Mondays. We worked Fridays, Saturdays, and on occasion we worked Sundays to complete our work. No, not here. We have had leisure time. We have not had any hard lifting. We just took a 5-day break. 
   I understand the importance of the upcoming elections as well as anyone else. The elections represent a crucial choice regarding the future of this great Republic. However, no election is more important than the election that takes place here in this Congress every day when we, in effect, vote on legislation. This election represents something just as important. That is why we were sent here--to do the work of the people. We are not doing it. The majority isn't allowing us to do it. 
   We will never finish these appropriations bills until it is clear to everyone that we must do our work and do it every day of the week. We have been used to 3-day weeks around here where we worked Tuesdays starting about 2:30, and Wednesday and Thursday. But we finished early on Thursday. I have never seen a congressional session such as this. We don't work on Mondays. We don't work on Fridays. And now we have a new deal: We are working 2-day weeks. We are now going to a 2-day week schedule. Of course, on the first day we will work late. So it will only be about a day and a half. I don't think when we have work to do that we should be working 2-day weeks. 
   I bet the hard-working American people who work for these massive corporations and small businesses would like a 2-day workweek. That is what we are having here. 
   It is no secret that this exceptionally slow work schedule is responsible for the fact that Congress has completed only a few appropriations bills. We passed one in July, one in August, none in September, and two so far this month. I think we should pick up the pace a little. I think the American people would agree. 
   Until we finish the 106th Congress, I think every continuing resolution we pass in the future should be for 24 hours. I am not going to vote for any more continuing resolutions that are for more than 24 hours. I don't know if I am going to vote for this continuing resolution. I think it is a shame that we are not going to be here literally doing work on this floor until probably next Tuesday with probably no votes until next Wednesday. 
   Not everyone would like this approach--because we have more certainty with a longer continuing resolution. I hope the President will support our efforts to have a 24-hour continuing resolution. I want to give everyone a hint here. The President just told us that is what he is going to do--that he will no longer approve a multiday continuing resolution--24 hours only. 
   When we get here Wednesday and that expires, remember that we 
   are not going to get one for more than 24 hours. We have to complete our work. It is important that we do that. 
   Let's set aside for the moment the disappointing record on the appropriations bills and focus instead on the laundry list of missed opportunities that litter Capitol Hill this fall. 
   The lack of action on the appropriations bills is rivaled only by the chronic inaction by this Republican Congress on the many other important issues that face our country. While the Republicans blame the Democrats for lack of action, how they can do that  with a straight face is a little hard for me to comprehend. The problem is the Republican majority doesn't seem to work with each other. 
   We all recognize that one of the highest priorities for America at the beginning of this century is education. We have spent in this Congress parts of 6 days working on education. That is it. It couldn't be a very high priority. We don't set the agenda here. I wish we could. But instead of parts of 6 days, we would spend weeks working on education. For the first time in 35 years we haven't approved the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is too bad. 
   Another issue before the Congress is that we have failed to address any meaningful way raising the minimum wage. Sixty percent of the people who draw minimum wage are women. For many of these women it is the only money they earn for their families. 
   I think it is important that women who get only 74 percent of what men make for the same job should at least be recognized by getting an increase in the minimum wage. 
   This long list of missed opportunities which will be compounded by a 2-day workweek that we are now going to have demonstrates the irony that the majority is more interested in plowing down the campaign trail than helping plow down the field to help us pass some legislation that helps working Americans. 
   What legislation am I talking about? Am I making this up? The long list of missed opportunities of this Republican-controlled Congress is: 
   The minimum wage we talked about; 
   The failure to enact anything dealing with health care; Prescription drug benefits, no; Prescription bill of rights, no; Helping make college education affordable, no; Doing something about education and lower class sizes, no; Having money for school construction, no. 
   In the State of Nevada--the most rapidly growing State in the Nation--we have to build a school every month in Las Vegas to keep up with the growth. We need some help. 
   The average school in America is over 40 years old. We have crumbling schools. We must build some new schools. In one school in Ohio, the ceiling collapsed and kids were hurt. 
   Then there is the failure to pass a meaningful targeted tax cut for middle-class working Americans. 
   It is important. 
   One issue that we should talk about a little bit is campaign finance reform. We are awash in money. People are out raising money. Why? Because one has to be competitive. JOHN MCCAIN has been very courageous. He is one of the few Republicans to join with every Democrat over here to do something about campaign finance reform. 
   Get rid of corporate money; let's at least do that. 
   Two years ago, in the small State of Nevada, over $20 million was spent on the election for the Senate. Neither one of us spent more money. We spent the same amount of money. Can you imagine that in a small State of Nevada with over $10 million each? It is shameful. We have to change it. But, no, we are not able to even vote on it. 
   This continuing resolution is going to be coming up, and I am not happy with it. I am certainly supportive of making sure that 
   we complete our work. But we don't need to take off from Thursday until next Wednesday. That is, in effect, what we are doing. That is too bad.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I received a phone call early this morning from my personal assistant, Janice Shelton, who indicated to me that Governor Carnahan was dead, having been killed in a tragic plane crash with his son, Randy. 
   I have watched very closely Governor Carnahan for the last 18 months, as we have watched the most noted Senate race in America this year between two very fine men, Senator ASHCROFT, formerly the Governor of Missouri, and Governor Carnahan. It was a great race to watch because they were so devoted to their different causes. There was distinction between the campaign philosophies. It was a race where the numbers never changed more than a point or two: For 18 months, back and forth, one ahead by a point, the other ahead by a point. 
   At this time, we realize that those numbers don't mean a great deal, that races in which we are engaged involve good people. Governor Carnahan, what a wonderful man. I got to know him very well, and his wife attended many functions in which I was in attendance. He dedicated his life to public service. The State of Missouri and the country will be less as a result of losing this fine man. 
   As has been indicated by Governor VOINOVICH, Senator VOINOVICH, our hearts go out to the entire family and the people of Missouri. Also, as Senator VOINOVICH and I were talking before the Senate convened, we have a great amount of sadness for Senator ASHCROFT, who is going through a difficult time now as a result of this, always wondering, having flown around the State himself, as we all have, trying to understand this life that we lead. So not only do I extend my sympathy to the Carnahan family, but also to Governor ASHCROFT, and the fact that in this country we can have people who have strong beliefs, differing beliefs, yet people of great moral certitude who believe very strongly in their causes. That is what makes this country as great as it is. 
   It is with a great deal of sadness that I came to work today. It is with a great deal of sadness I am with the Dean of the Senate and Senator VOINOVICH who is opening the Senate today. This will have an impact on my life, always, having known him and suddenly his life is snuffed out. I am a better person for having known Governor Carnahan. The people of Missouri are better off as a result of his service. I wish Godspeed to the people of Missouri and the Carnahan family.

   Mr. REID. If I could ask the Senator one more question; that is, I don't know what will happen this weekend, but I can only speak for myself and a number of other Senators with whom I have had the opportunity to speak on the phone and in person today. We should be working this weekend. For us now to not have votes until late Wednesday or maybe even Thursday, and to take Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and maybe Monday off? 
   I want the leader to know that there are a number of us on this side who feel the urgency is here; we should press forward and work through the weekend.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, this is the agreement we have been attempting to work out for the last day. This is something Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN have worked on very hard. It is a good bill. We, on this side, think the agreement is something that will be to the benefit not only of the Senate but the country.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the Senator from New York summed up my feelings. I think Americans have to understand that tiny, little Israel, the only democracy in that part of the world--surrounded by some of the worst tyrannies in the world--is having a very difficult time right now. If there was ever a country in the history of the United States that has shown their friendship to the United States it has been Israel. During this time of need for Israel, we have to show our friendship toward them--no one wants to see the violence taking place--and recognize that Israel is a democracy. It was in 1948. It is today. 
   As my friend from Michigan said, I hope we will have Chairman Arafat come forward and do something publicly to denounce what is taking place on the Palestinian side. It has been despicable--from the raiding of the tomb, to the terrible murders of these two Israeli soldiers today. 
   I support the statement made by my friend from New York, and certainly my friend from Michigan who is managing this bill. Today, of all days, signifies to me the importance of the work that he and Senator WARNER have done to get this bill to this point so we can authorize the many things that need to be done by the U.S. military. We have talked about the act of terrorism against our U.S. Navy, and this bill addresses that. 
   As I said yesterday, the Senator from Michigan is to be commended for his work on this bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report for H.R. 4205, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001. 
   The conference report contains a provision on an issue that I have been working on--the concurrent receipt of military retired pay and VA disability compensation. 
   A law enacted in 1891 requires a disabled career military veteran to waive the amount of his retired pay equal to his VA disability compensation. Military retirees are the only group of federal retirees who must waive retirement pay in order to receive VA disability compensation. If a veteran refuses to give up his retired pay, he will lose his VA disability benefits. Our government is effectively requiring career military retirees to fund their own disability benefits. This inequitable offset affects over 437,000 military retirees. 
   Section 666 of the Senate version of this legislation would have eliminated the current offset entirely. The provision was very similar of H.R. 303, which has 321 cosponsors in the House. The provision was supported by numerous veterans' service organizations, including the Military Coalition, the National Military/Veterans Alliance, the American Legion, the Disabled American Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Paralyzed Veterans of America, and the Uniformed Services Disabled Retirees. 
   Some members were concerned that the provision was too expensive, and consequently, many felt that we could not include a provision to completely eliminate the current offset in the conference report. In my opinion, no amount of money can equal the sacrifice our military men and women have made in service to their country. This is a small price to pay to show our appreciation to those who have sacrificed so much for our great nation. 
   While I am extremely disappointed that we did not take advantage of this opportunity to correct this long-standing inequity, I am pleased that the conference report does contain language that will take us one step closer to correcting this injustice once and for all. 
   The Fiscal Year 2000 National Defense Authorization Act included a provision, to authorize a monthly allowance to military retirees with severe service-connected disabilities rated by the Department of Veterans Affairs at 70 percent or greater. The provision authorized payments of $300 per month to retirees with 100 percent disability, $200 per month to retirees with 90 percent disability and $100 per month to retirees with 70 and 80 percent disability. To be eligible, retirees had to have at least 20 years of service and have their VA disability rating within four years of their retirement. Only individuals retired for longevity qualified for the monthly benefit. 
   The conference report for H.R. 4205 expands the eligibility for these special payments to those individuals retired for disability by their service. These individuals are also known as ``Chapter 61'' retirees. The payments will begin in fiscal year 2002. 
   I want to thank Senator WARNER and Senator LEVIN for their assistance in including this provision in the conference report. I would also like to acknowledge Congressman BILIRAKIS, who assisted as an outside conferee on the conference report which made it possible for us to debate concurrent receipt in this session of the 106th Congress. Congressman BILIRAKIS has been a vocal advocate for concurrent receipt in the House for over fifteen years. 
   The original law is 109 years old and discriminates against service members who decide to make the military their careers. Military retirees with service-connected disabilities should be able to receive compensation for their injuries above their military retired pay. The elimination of this offset is long overdue, and I will continue to pursue this issue in the 107th Congress. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the conference report for H.R. 4205.

At a time when we have accomplished a great deal procedurally, you two should be commended. It has been difficult to arrive at this point. This is one of the times where we worked with some cooperation. There will be more difficulties before the session ends, but the two leaders are to be commended for the work done today.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, under my reservation, I remind the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Oklahoma that on Friday of last week we agreed on this side to have the Senate bill brought before the Senate at that time, pursuant to the unanimous consent request of the Senator from Arizona, to have relevant amendments. We have no objection to that coming before the Senate and working on it that way. 
   This matter which has just passed the House, we just got it a matter of minutes ago--not hours ago; minutes ago--and we have two Senators who want to look at this legislation. They have some idea that they want to offer relevant amendments. We know that, come the light of day, they may not want to offer those relevant amendments, but now they do. 
   So I say to my friend from Arizona that he can come back after Senator ROBERTS speaks, but the same objection will be there unless we hear in the interim that the Senators, for some unknown reason, withdraw their objections. 
   On that, I object.

I know he has more patience than I, but we have to have a little bit of patience. In this instance, I don't think it is going to require a great deal of patience. We are going to be in session tomorrow, and I think there is a very good possibility, as I see it, that the persuasive arguments Senators have made today and last week will prevail and this legislation will pass. 
   As things now stand, we have people who haven't been able to read the bill. They may have some problems with it. The ranking member, the Senator from South Carolina, and some of our people over here--and, of course, the Senator from South Carolina works well with the Senator from Arizona, and we will see what we can do to get this wrapped up.

   Also, the work the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin have done on campaign finance reform--when the history books are written about what has happened in Government during the past hundred years, there is no question in my mind that one of the main chapters will be the work that has been done on campaign finance reform. It will happen, and it was instigated and initiated by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin. It is only a question of when; it will happen.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know Members are waiting to determine whether or not we are going to have a vote today. The majority leader has indicated we likely will have one. From the minority's perspective, we badly want to move to the Transportation appropriations bill which, as we speak, the House is discussing. 
   But we have a number of Members who are rightfully unwilling to do that until we get the legislation and are able to look at the conference report, which we don't now have. I hope we can start talking about the conference report, with the hope of getting the actual document as soon as possible so that Senators can look at it. 
   I know one Senator indicated he would like to be able to have a day to look at the conference report. I will check with this Senator and others to see if that can be expedited, if they have an opportunity to review the conference report. 
   In short, the minority is saying that we are ready to move forward and we are willing, in the late days of the session, to expedite things as much as we can, but there are certain basic things we need to read, such as a bill or a conference report, before we vote on it.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say, before my friend from Illinois leaves the floor, that I had the pleasure of serving with Sid Yates. I served with him in the House, of course, but didn't know him very well in that large body. I came to know him better after coming to the Senate and being a member of the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations while he was chairman of that committee on the House side. 
   We worked very closely together. Everything the Senator from Illinois has said is absolutely true about Sid Yates. He was a distinguished man, and a distinguished looking man. When he left the House, he was almost 90 years old; handsome; stood tall; never faltered a word of his speech. 
   Being from the western part of the United States, I will never forget Sid Yates. He stood for the West. He loved the wilderness, and he helped us protect the pristine wilderness of Nevada and other places in the West. Native Americans never had a better friend in the Congress than Sid Yates. 
   I didn't know Sid Yates as well as my friend from Illinois, but I have great respect and admiration for Sid Yates, and I will never forget him.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Minnesota leaves the floor, I want to make a couple comments. There have been, as the Senator indicated, a number of people who have worked very hard on domestic violence. Senator JOE BIDEN authored the original legislation and has been a model for what has transpired since then. 
   I say in the presence of the Senator from Minnesota that since he came to the Senate, this has been an issue he has worked on passionately. I appreciate the work he has done. 
   The Senator from Minnesota mentioned his wife Sheila. I remember the work the two of them have done together. 
   I remember the display they put in the Russell Building, which certainly dramatized the need for continuing the work in this area. There are many unique partnerships in America today, but one of those that I admire greatly is that of PAUL and Sheila WELLSTONE. They have worked on these issues together. I think it goes without saying that the good work the Senator has done would not be as good but for the involvement of his wife.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want the Senator from New Jersey to understand, before he leaves the floor, how appreciative I personally am, and the whole Senate is, for the work the Senator has done--not only in the Transportation appropriations--for many years. The Senator has set the pattern for transportation in the most rapidly growing State, Nevada. The Senator has been instrumental in the things we have been able to do with Senator SHELBY, to come up with programs for the State of Nevada that have been remarkably efficient and good. 
   In addition to that, before the Senator leaves, this may be the last opportunity we have to speak publicly on the Senator's behalf as to the things the Senator has done in relation to tobacco. I remember my children had respiratory problems and they hated to fly in an airplane. There was smoking and nonsmoking. That was a fallacy; it was all smoking. It is because of the Senator and his perseverance that we have people flying smoke free on airplanes all over the country. It is a crime to smoke a cigarette, as it should be, on an airplane. 
   This is just one of many things, including gun control, that the Senator has done on the Environment and Public Works Committee. We have served together my entire 14 years in the Senate. The Senator has been a leader in the area dealing with the environment. I speak not only for me but the entire Senate in gratitude for the great work the Senator has done.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems to me the majority is crying because the price of oil has dropped. The President made a decisive step and said we are going to pump oil from our reserve. Immediately, the price of oil dropped. Today it is below $30 a barrel. The majority seems so concerned that what the President has done has helped--the price of oil has dropped. 
   I suggest my friends in the majority talk to the Governor of Texas or maybe the man running for Vice President. They have connections with the oil industry. Maybe they could talk him into not shipping oil overseas if that is, in fact, what is happening. They are crying crocodile tears because what is happening here is good. We laid out in great detail yesterday what this administration has done to lower the price of oil to make sure the economy was in good shape. 
   I am also continually amazed at what the majority says about the Vice President: He broke the tie, so there is a 4-cent-per-gallon increase in gas; isn't that too bad? 
   Let's look at the history. Remember, the majority was saying all kinds of bad things would happen. The Republicans were saying all kinds of bad things would happen if, in fact, the Clinton and Gore budget deficit reduction plan passed. It passed. 
   Prior to passing, listen to what the Republicans had to say.

   Mr. REID. Mr. Chairman, I would like to request your help interpreting the language that was inserted into the conference report pertaining to the use of funds appropriated for the acquisition of environmentally sensitive property at Lake Tahoe. That language states that no funds may be used to acquire urban lots. To my knowledge, ``urban lots'' is a term that is not defined in this bill or any related statute or regulation. As a result, I want to make sure that we clarify what we intend by the term urban lot. 
   As you know, the plan to protect Lake Tahoe is predicated in large part of the Lake Tahoe Preservation Act of 1981 (H.R. 7306), commonly known as the Santini-Burton Act, and companion California and Nevada bond acts. Together, these State and Federal acts provide for the purchase and stewardship of environmentally sensitive lands in the Lake Tahoe Basin. The legislative history of the Santini-Burton Act indicated that approximately $150 million worth of land in Lake Tahoe would be purchased (approximately $100 million has been expended to date). The Santini-Burton Act generally identified lands eligible for purchase, and was followed by the adoption of a comprehensive plan identifying specific criteria for purchases. That plan was subject to an Environmental Impact Statement and accompanying public comment process, and this plan remains in effect to this day. 
   I am confident that, with the correct information in hand, Congress will direct the Forest Service to go forward with the completion of the program. In the meantime, however, the effort to protect Lake Tahoe is likely to sustain significant damage if the language in the conference report is mistakenly interpreted to reverse long standing policy decisions. That is why I am asking for your concurrence to direct the Forest Service to interpret the language in a manner consistent with the existing program. 
   Specifically, I want to make it clear that the term ``urban lot'' does not include environmentally sensitive lands. The current program designates a property's eligibility for acquisition according to its environmental sensitivity because that is the purpose of the acquisition program. Such designations reflect extensive analysis and the support of the local community. This report language should not be interpreted to change this methodology such that acquisition eligibility is based on an unspecified and invariably random geographic distinction. In all likelihood, any ill-conceived geographic standard would exclude the most environmentally sensitive property that the ongoing program is designed to protect. 
   I believe that the report language is consistent with the current practice of federal land acquisition in the Lake Tahoe basin. Do you share my understanding that the definition of ``urban lots'' includes only those properties that are presently qualified for urban development?

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-2-20001005</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Then it makes sense for any prohibition on land acquisition referred to in the report language to apply only if to properties that satisfy all of the following criteria: (1) they are not adjacent to current forest system lands, (2) they are within Tahoe Regional Planning Agency's urban boundaries, (3) they are not adjacent to Lake Tahoe, or to waters or streamzones tributary to Lake Tahoe, and (4) they are presently eligible to take residential or commercial development. This clarification integrates the intent of the new conference report language to limit such acquisitions to essential sensitive lands while retaining the basic purpose of the Lake Tahoe land acquisition program.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the Chairman knows, I included language in this bill that directs the Department of Interior to finalize the so-called 3809 regulations, which govern hardrock mining operations on public lands, and to do so consistently with the findings and recommendations of a study completed by the National Research Council or NRC. The language is identical to  language enacted in last year's omnibus bill. I want to emphasize my intent in offering this language, and request the Chairman's understanding and concurrence. Briefly, my intent is to ensure that the Department of Interior finalizes a rule that protects the environment and that takes into account the direction of Congress and the findings and recommendations of the NRC report.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year Congress adopted this requirement that Interior finalize 3809 rule changes only if they are ``not inconsistent'' with the recommendations of the NRC report I already described. Parsing this statutory language to the point of absurdity, the Interior Solicitor quickly wrote and circulated a legal opinion concluding that Congress intended by this action to require Interior's consideration only of material in the report specifically labeled as ``recommendations''--amounting only to a few lines of the report--and no other information in the report. And, he went on to conclude that this law imposes no significant limitations on the agency's ability to finalize its proposed 3809 rule. This year we have adopted the consistency requirement again, just as it was written last year. I ask the Chairman, did we enact the language again just to ratify the legal conclusion that Interior could finalize 3809 rules essentially without restrictions?

   Mr. REID. One last question that I have concerns a statement made by some of our House colleagues during House consideration of the FY 2001 Interior appropriations bill in which they suggested an interpretation of the ongoing rulemaking including broad discretion to deny mining permits, by redefining the existing statutory definition of unnecessary or undue degradation. Does the Chairman of the subcommittee who helped develop this language agree that our House colleagues are suggesting an interpretation that clearly goes beyond current law and that section 156 specifically states that nothing in this provision shall be construed to expand existing authority.

   I was not aware the Senator was coming to the floor today to speak about this subject. But my mind returns to that very dramatic hearing that went on for many hours. It was the first of its kind. 
   I would say, in passing, and ask the Senator if he agrees with me, that this is like AL GORE to begin something like this. He is a visionary. And this goes back long before anyone ever anticipated or thought that AL GORE would be a Member of the Senate, certainly not Vice President, and not running for the Presidency.

   Mr. REID. I say we need more people like the Presiding Officer. He has joined with us in many bipartisan matters. I hope the conversation we have had today does not in any way reflect upon the Senator from Oregon, who has worked with us on a number of issues. I am sure it has caused him a problem on the other side of the aisle. 
   The reason I mention that is everyone thinks McCain-Feingold is a bipartisan bill, and it is, in the sense that JOHN MCCAIN has stepped way forward on this to talk about the need for campaign finance reform. But the people willing to help him on the other side of the aisle, the majority of them, are few and far between. 
   On a number of issues we have talked about today, with rare exception, the Senator from Oregon has been willing to join in a bipartisan fashion to pass legislation. As my friend from Illinois has said, it is possible we could do this. All we have to do is what is right for the American people and get rid of these very high-pressure lobbying efforts--for example, the health insurance industry, which is preventing us from moving forward on something like a Patients' Bill of Rights.

I do not mean to take away from the intensity of his belief, his passion, that there should be drilling in this pristine area. The fact of the matter is that the majority is wrong on this issue. 
   The minority believes we do not have to pump every drop of oil that is on U.S. soil, that there are other things we should do. One of the things we need to do is develop alternative energy sources; that is, solar energy. We are not as a government doing nearly enough to develop this great resource. 
   We have heard a lot of discussion on this floor about the Nevada Test Site where some thousand nuclear devices were exploded over the years. Solar energy facilities could be developed at the Nevada Test Site which could produce enough electricity to supply all the needs of the United States. The desert Sun would supply enough energy for the whole United States. That is what we should develop--alternate energy sources. 
   I am very proud of the fact that this administration has decided they are going to go all out, and they have already begun to develop geothermal energy. All over the western part of the United States, there is geothermal energy potential. If one drives from the capital of Nevada, Carson City, to Reno, one sees steam coming out of the ground. That steam represents great potential for geothermal energy. 
   There are powerplants in Nevada and other places in the western part of the United States that produce electricity from the heat of the Earth. Geothermal energy is available in various parts of the United States. There is tremendous potential there. 
   If one drives in southern California, one sees areas where there are miles and miles of windmills. These windmills produce electricity, and we are getting better every day in developing more efficient windmills. That is where we should be directing our attention, not to producing oil in a pristine wilderness in Alaska. 
   The fact of the matter is, we could produce millions of barrels of oil there for a very short period of time. The effect on our energy policy would be minimal. It would produce jobs for the people of Alaska--and I understand why the Senators from Alaska are pushing jobs--but it would be to the detriment of our environment. 
   It was very clear in the debate last night that the Vice President said we should not be drilling in ANWR, there are other things we can do, and he mentioned, as I have, alternate energy policies. He also stated that we can do a lot of things in our country to conserve and reduce the need to produce more electricity. I hope we will focus on what we can do to make sure we are energy efficient and that we are not so dependent on importing foreign oil. 
   One of the things I regret we did not do, because the majority would not let us do it, is to put more oil in our reserves. We have a program to begin pumping some of our reserves. That is a wise decision. Look at the results. There was a dramatic decline in the cost of oil, and OPEC suddenly decided it was the right thing to do to start producing more oil 
   because they knew we would start pulling down our reserves and the cost of oil would go down anyway. 
   The Senator from Alaska criticized the Vice President for his interest in improving energy efficiency and expanding renewable energy production. His criticism is not well taken. In my view, the Vice President has a balanced, healthy approach to reducing American dependence on foreign oil and big oil generally. He recognizes we can produce oil and gas more efficiently at home, we can expand our domestic production of renewable energy, and our economy can become more efficient. 
   Vice President GORE has also realized, as he stated on a number of occasions and as I have already said, that we do not need to develop every drop of oil in the Earth. Unlike Governor  Bush, Vice President GORE believes that in some cases special places, national treasures, should be off limits to big oil. 
   We know there is a massive lobbying effort by big oil companies to drill in ANWR. It is the wrong thing to do. Clearly, the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is one of those special places about which the Vice President talked. It is the last pristine Arctic ecosystem in the United States. It should be out of bounds for oil exploration. I do not care if the caribou can walk on pipelines because it is warm or they cannot walk on pipelines because they are cold. The fact of the matter is, we do not need to drill in ANWR. It should be out of bounds. Vice President GORE recognizes we can protect America's national treasures and satisfy our energy needs. 
   I am disappointed that Governor Bush lacks, I am sorry to say, a notion about, or maybe even an understanding of, what energy policy is all about. His affiliation for so long with big oil seems to have tempered his views toward big oil. Of course, his Vice Presidential candidate has the same global view that big oil solves all problems. The only way for America to reduce its debilitating addiction to foreign oil is to develop alternative energy sources and to do a better job with our consumption. We do not solve our problems by drilling in our precious national wildlife refuge. 
   Mr. President, not only do I believe that the Vice President was right last night about our energy policy, but I also believe he was right about education. 
   I think, when we recognize that over 90 percent of our kids go to public schools, we have to do things to protect and improve our public schools. I think the Vice President recognizes the need for school construction. 
   In Las Vegas, we have to build a new school every month to keep up with growth. We need help. I did not misspeak. We need to build a new school every month to keep up with the growth in Las Vegas. We have the sixth largest school district in America. We need help, as other school districts around the country need help. We need them for different reasons. The average school in America is over 40 years old. The Vice President recognizes that school districts need help in school construction. We need help in getting more teachers and better teachers. 
   That is why the Vice President spoke so eloquently on the need to do something about prescription drug benefits. That is why he spoke about the need to do something about prescription drugs. 
   It was very clear to all of us that his statements regarding international policy were certainly well made. The Vice President did a good job because he has a wealth of experience. 
   But I also want to say this to the American people. I am not here today to diminish Governor Bush. We should be very proud in America that we had the ability last night to watch these two fine men debate. They are debating to become the President of the United States, the most powerful, the most important job in the whole world. 
   I have to say I think the glass is half full, not half empty. I think these two men did a good job. Most of us who serve in the Senate--or everyone who serves in the Senate--have been involved in these debates. It is hard. It might look easy watching these men at home on TV, but it is hard. There is tremendous pressure on each one of them. Millions of people are watching each one of them. 
   What is the criticism today? The Vice President sighed; and George Bush, when he was not speaking, his face was red and he snorted a couple times. If that is the worst we say about these two fine men, then we are in pretty good shape as a country. AL GORE is a friend of mine, Tipper Gore is a friend of mine. I think his debate was a slam dunk, as indicated in all the polls today. AL GORE won the debate. And I am very happy that he did. 
   But do not diminish these two men by saying one sighed too much or one had a red face. They were in a very difficult situation last night. I am proud of the work that both of them did. I think we, as a country, should feel good about our country, that people who are running for President can be seen, their sighs and red faces combined. I think we should recognize that. If you look just across the ocean, you see what is going on in Serbia and Yugoslavia. That is what we do not want. We should be very proud of what we have here in America.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from New York. New York is the financial capital of the world, and the Senator from New York, having long represented that State in the House of Representatives, has certainly hit the ground running here in the Senate. We depend on the Senator from New York on many occasions for financial information and advice due to the fact that he comes from the financial capital of the world. His very vivid description of the debate last night, in financial terms and what the tax situation is from both candidates, was welcome. I congratulate and applaud the Senator for his very lucid statement.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thought it was appropriate that we revisit what the junior Senator from Alaska said today. He has come to the floor on many occasions and said, as I have stated earlier, the same thing. He does it with great passion, and I appreciate how strongly he feels about it. I think the time has come that we don't let his statements go without giving the facts from the other side. What are some of those facts? Let's talk about production of oil in Alaska. 
   In 1999, the Clinton-Gore administration offered tracts on nearly 4 million acres of land in the national petroleum reserve in Alaska, to the west of Prudhoe Bay, for oil and gas leasing.  
   Oil companies with winning bids will pay--  
   This is a staggering figure, but it is to show that we in this administration have had an energy policy, as we all know.  
   Oil companies with winning bids will pay $104,635,728 for leases in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. A total of 425 tracts on approximately 3.9 million acres were offered by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management in today's lease sale, the first such sale for the reserve since 1984.  
   It is important we recognize that there is an energy policy and, as indicated, this is the first sale for the reserve since 1984.  
   Six oil companies submitted 174 bids on 133 tracts.  
   The oil industry should explore and develop the Alaskan Petroleum Reserve before there is any suggestion of opening the sensitive lands of the wildlife refuge to development. We acknowledge that, and that is why they are paying $105 million to do that. They should do that before there is even a suggestion of opening the sensitive lands of the ANWR to develop. ANWR doesn't need to be developed. To even suggest doing it before we fully explore the petroleum reserve in Alaska indicates that we are doing it for reasons other than petroleum production.  
   In 1998, the U.S. Geological Survey released a mean estimate of 2.4 billion barrels of economically recoverable oil in the Arctic Refuge at $18 a barrel market price in 1996 dollars. Such a discovery would never meet more than a small part of our oil needs at any given time. The U.S. consumes about 19 million barrels of oil daily or almost 7 billion barrels annually .....  
   So using these numbers for a couple of years, you could drill and it would be gone, and you would damage, to say the least, this beautiful part of the world.

   Mr. REID. I ask my friend from West Virginia this question. I can't pass up the opportunity; whenever I hear someone talking about miners, my mind is flooded with thoughts of my father. The Senator and I have discussed what a hard job a miner has. I can remember, as if it were yesterday, my father coming home, muddy and dirty, telling us he had another hard day at the office. The fact of the matter is, he worked very hard. Miners work very hard. 
   The Senator from West Virginia has done such an outstanding job of protecting miners, and not only coal miners. You have helped us with our gold miners, people who go under the Earth for other types of product than coal. 
   I also say this to my friend from West Virginia, my leader. This Government needs to do more with clean coal technology. We started a plant near Reno, NV, which cost hundreds of millions of dollars. But in the second phase of it, the Government did not come through in helping with that energy-efficient use of coal, and therefore they are going to have to switch and do something else. 
   The Federal Government has the means now of clean coal technology. But we have been too cheap as a government. We need to spend more money on clean coal technology. If we spent more money on clean coal technology, we would be less dependent on oil. So I want to help the Senator from West Virginia any way I can to make sure we do more with developing clean coal technology. And with the technology we have, let's make sure the Federal Government helps implement this in places such as Reno, at the Tracy plant, so we can do a better job of cleaning the air.

   Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Alaska leaves the floor, I of course recognize the expert on our side of the  aisle dealing with this legislation is the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER. I want to say this because I am the one who objected to this. Following what the Senator from Alaska has said--and I have the greatest respect for him, and we work together on many issues--it seems to me we can resolve this very quickly. There is a companion bill, H.R. 2884, which already passed the House. We can bring it up here as it passed the House. It would go through very quickly. We believe that would take care of the immediate problems facing us--the home heating oil reserves and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. 
   The problem we have, and the reason for the objection, is that to H.R. 2884 my friend from Alaska added some very--from our perspective--very controversial oil royalties, among other things. So we believe if the home heating oil reserve is as important as we think it is--and we believe it is extremely important--and if the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is as important as we think it is, we should go with the House bill. We can do that in a matter of 5 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that under the time reserved to the minority on the continuing resolution, Senator DURBIN, who has been waiting patiently all afternoon, be recognized for 10 minutes, Senator BOXER be recognized for 30 minutes, Senator GRAHAM for 30 minutes, Senator HARKIN for 15 minutes, Senator FEINGOLD for 10 minutes, and Senator WELLSTONE for 5 minutes.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, H-1B originated in our immigration laws in the 1950's so that trained professionals could work for a limited time in the U.S. In 1990, a cap was set on the category for the first time of 65,000. 
   Employers in every industry and sector of our economy, including manufacturing, higher education, health care, research, finance and others, have used it. 
   Employers from major multinational companies to small businesses seeking individuals with specific skills needed to grow their companies have used it. 
   It became wildly popular in the mid to late 90s following the Internet boom, when hundreds of hungry tech startups across the country began using it to recruit high tech workers from information technology jobs, mostly from India, China, Canada, and Britain. Some 420,000 are here today. 
   Those individuals have filled a critical shortage of high-tech workers in this country, which in fact, still exists today. 
   The American Competitiveness in the Twenty-first Century Act of 2000 proposes to raise the caps for the number of H-1B workers that employers can bring into the United States for the next 3 years.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, the 27th Olympiad is now finished, and the United States of America should be very proud of our participants. They showed the world that Americans put their hearts and souls into everything that they do. Part of the reason that I support the Olympic tradition is that these special games are a reflection of the diversity, brotherhood, and spirit that the United States celebrates everyday. I am especially proud of my state and the Olympic participants we sent to Sydney, Australia. 
   Lori Harrigan, Tasha Schwikert, and Charlene Tagaloa were three Nevadan athletes who gave wholly to the U.S. team in their respective sports. 
   Lori Harrigan, a pitcher for the champion U.S. softball team, helped her team bring home a second gold medal in as many Olympic Games. Lori has had an amazing softball career for many years now, and since she graduated from UNLV, Lori has won 13 international medals for the United States. Lori will be remembered in Olympic history as the first softball player to pitch a complete no-hitter game, which she accomplished this summer in the opening round game. This summer she lived up to the legacy that she blazed as a UNLV Runnin' Rebel, and her softball accomplishments are properly hallmarked by her retired jersey that UNLV has proudly displayed since 1998. 
   Las Vegan Tasha Schwikert has been the sweet surprise of the Olympic Games. She was not one of the original members of the U.S. gymnastics team. However, she was later chosen as a second alternate. An unfortunate injury to another gymnast gave Tasha the chance that she deserved for an Olympic appearance. Although Tasha didn't medal, she still showed the world a strong performance. And because of her youth and newly developed international experience, we can expect to see Tasha as a leader in future gymnastic competitions. 
   The United States women's volleyball team was the underdog of the Olympic indoor volleyball competition, and many did not even expect the team to contend for a medal in Sydney. With the help of Las Vegan, Charlene Tagaloa, the women's volleyball team played in the bronze medal math. 
   Nevada demonstrated its miulticulturalism during the Olympic Games, because six other current or former UNLV Runnin' Rebels competed for their native countries. These unique individuals include four swimmers and two track runners. These athletes are as follows: swimmers Mike Mintenko of Canada, Jacint Simon of Hungary, Andrew Livingston of Puerto Rico, Lorena Diaconescu of Romania, and sprinters, Ayanna Hutchinson and Alicia Tyson, of Trinidad and Tobago. 
   Nevada's contribution to the Olympic Games does not end with the efforts of its athletes. 
   Karen Dennis is not only the head of the UNLV women's track team, but she was chosen to be the U.S. women's track coach. Her talent and expertise undoubtedly contributed to the multiple medals and stellar performances we saw from the U.S. track team this Olympics. 
   Las Vegan Jim Lykins was chosen to be one of the two umpires from the United States to referee women's softball. He gleefully did not umpire the championship game, because Olympic rules prevent umpires from working any games played by their home country. Not being able to umpire the championship match was a worthwhile sacrifice for the gold medal that we won in the fast pitch softball competition. 
   We should all remember the character of the 2000 Olympic Games, both the smile evoking and heartbreaking moments, and continue to support the Nevadan and American athletes who have the integrity, dedication, and ability to represent our nation, now and in the future. Congratulations to all of our Olympic participants.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from West Virginia in the form of a question--the segue is better now than when I asked the first question because what I want to say to the Senator from West Virginia is, I haven't been here nearly as long as you have been here, but I have seen, in the 18 years I have been here, how things have changed. Why have they changed? Because of the unbelievable drive to raise money. Everybody has to raise money. On Mondays, on Tuesdays, on Wednesdays, on Thursdays, on Fridays, on Saturdays, and, I am sorry to say, on Sundays. I say to my friend from West Virginia, don't you think that is the biggest problem around here, the tremendous, overpowering demand for money because of television? 
   In the form of a dual question: Don't you think, if we did nothing else but eliminate corporate money, which the Congress in the early part of last century, or by the Senator's reasoning this century, early 19----

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend in the form of a question: In the early part of this century, Congress had the good sense to outlaw, in Federal elections, corporate money. Of course, the Supreme Court changed that a few years ago. I ask the Senator, wouldn't we be well served if we eliminated, among other things, corporate money in campaigns on the Federal level in any form or fashion?

   Mr. REID. I spoke to the Senator from West Virginia yesterday. We have worked today to fill the time, talking about some of the things that would work better in this body about which the Senator has spoken already. Senator HARKIN is going to speak, and Senator BOXER. We have Senator KENNEDY coming here at noon. We have Senator MOYNIHAN coming at 12:30. Senator CONRAD is coming. We have a list of speakers and we will work very hard to fulfill the promise to the Senator from West Virginia. 
   The last thing I say to the Senator from West Virginia, we were here except we were working on the Interior conference.

   The Democratic leader will be out in a few minutes to take half an hour. When he completes his statement, Senator KENNEDY will follow for half an hour. When he completes his statement at about 1:30, Senator CONRAD will be here to speak for half an hour. Following that, Senator DORGAN will be here for half an hour. Following that, Senator JOHNSON will be here to speak for 10 minutes. Senator DURBIN will come at approximately 2:40 to speak for about a half hour. Senator KOHL will speak around 3 or 3:10. At that time, most of the time will be gone. Senator BYRD will have the remaining time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I consider myself very fortunate today. Except for going to a conference here and there, and a few other things that had me go off the floor, I have had the opportunity to listen to almost everything that went on today, either from my seat in the Senate Chamber or in the Cloakroom. How fortunate I am. 
   The Senator from West Virginia is to be commended for initiating this debate on what American Government is all about. When the history books are written, people will review what took place during this debate, the high level of debate and the exchange between the Senator from New York and the Senator from West Virginia, both with years of wisdom, years of knowledge, and years of experience. People will look back at this consideration in the textbooks. 
   I stepped out to go over to the Senator's Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. The administration was there complaining about report language as to what the intent of the Congress was. It is hard for me to fathom they could do that. I don't want to embarrass anybody from the administration, but I spoke to two people from the administration. I said: What in the world are you trying to do? Are you trying to tell this subcommittee, this legislative entity, what our intent is? That is our responsibility as legislators, not this administration's responsibility. We have report language in bills so that people can look and find out what our intent is.

   Mr. REID. The courts, or anybody else. If the administration doesn't like what we do, they can take it to court, and that report language will give that court an idea as to what we meant. I say to Senator BYRD and Senator MOYNIHAN, words cannot express how I feel. 
   As people have heard me say on the floor before, I am from Searchlight, NV. My father never graduated from eighth grade and my mother never graduated from high school. To be in the Senate of the United States and to work with Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator BYRD is an honor. It is beyond my ability to express enough my appreciation for this discussion that has taken place today. I hope it will create some sense in this body--maybe not for this Congress but hopefully for the next one--that we will be able to legislate as we are supposed to do it. I express my appreciation to both Senators.

   I hope whoever has caused this, whoever that might be who is responsible, recognizes that they are responsible for slowing up what goes on around here. We have to move these appropriations bills.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friend from Utah, for whom I have the greatest respect got a little carried away this morning. I don't think he would purposely call me or my colleagues incompetent--but he did. I don't think he would call us silly or stupid, but he did. The word ``inane,'' in a dictionary, means silly or stupid. 
   We have a philosophical difference in what we are doing here. The fact that we disagree with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee does not mean we are incompetent. It doesn't mean we are stupid. It just demonstrates that we have a basic disagreement. 
   Mr. President, I want to go back and start where the majority started this morning, with the chairman of the Appropriations Committee on Commerce-State-Justice. Among other things, he said we were crying crocodile tears over here, and that this piece of legislation only dealt with criminals. I am paraphrasing what the other side said, but not too much. In actuality they said was that ``criminals were coming in, and attempting to do an end run to get citizenship.'' 
   The fact is, I take great exception to that. The Democratic proposal would not allow criminals to become citizens. First, this legislation is not offering citizenship. We are offering longtime residents, people who are already in this country, the ability to apply for permanent residency and then perhaps apply for citizenship. Second, anyone applying for residency must have good moral character. They also must show they have good moral character, which means that anyone with a criminal record--not criminals, of course wouldn't qualify, anyone with a criminal record would not qualify for permanent residency. 
   These people are people who are already in the country. They are working, they are paying taxes, they work hard. In many instances, in fact most instances, others won't take their jobs. 
   I think my friend from New Hampshire, for whom I have the greatest respect--he has a record which is outstanding; he served in the House of Representatives, was the Governor of the State of New Hampshire, is now a Member of the Senate--I do not think he is suggesting that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who supports the Latino Fairness Act wholeheartedly, is suggesting the U.S. Chamber of Commerce wants citizenship for criminals. I don't think the American Health Care Association is suggesting we want citizenship for criminals. I know that the American Hotel and Motel Association is not saying we should come here and give a blanket citizenship to criminals. I don't think the Resort, Recreation and Tourism organization is suggesting that criminals be given citizenship. 
   We have a list. We talked about it yesterday: The National Retail Association--dozens and dozens of organizations and companies believe we must do something, not only to protect the people who we are going to give the right to come to this country, under H-1B. In fact, we have given almost a half a million people the right to come to this country under H-1B. 
   We are going to increase it this year up to almost 200,000. I have a couple of different lists, and I could go to another chart. These companies and organizations believe that people who are already in the country also deserve the right to apply for permanent residency and someday apply for citizenship. 
   This is nothing but a typical red herring. In fact, the Republicans, the majority, are saying: How could you have this bill without even having a hearing? That will bring a smile to your face. The legislation pending before the Senate, the energy bill, S. 2557, was brought to the floor by the majority leader and it has had no hearings. 
   To say we did not introduce this legislation until July 25, we may not have introduced specifically the legislation, but I wrote a letter to the majority leader in May outlining the legislation. There have been long-time discussions. 
   In fact, we were denied a hearing in the House. We tried to have a hearing in the House last year on this legislation, but we could not. The chairman of the Immigration Subcommittee refused to give us a hearing, so SHEILA JACKSON-LEE and I had an informal hearing in the House. We could not do it because the chairman of the subcommittee would not let us have a hearing. 
   The parity legislation was introduced 3 years ago. That is no surprise to anyone. The registry has been in our law since 1929. I introduced the same legislation last year. We reintroduced it, of course, but it was introduced last year. We had, as I indicated, an informal hearing because we were denied a formal hearing. 
   The chairman of the Judiciary Committee said: What about the July 25 introduction? In his words, ``Is this incompetence?'' The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act contains multiple provisions, all of which were introduced well before July 2000. We combined a number of pieces of legislation  that have been around for a long time. Central American parity was introduced on September 15 of last year; date of registry was introduced on August 5, 1999. These have bill numbers. Section 245(i) was introduced May 25, 2000. Also, the one my friend from Rhode Island, Mr. REED, cares so much about, was introduced in March of 1999. These proposals have been denied hearings in the Judiciary Committee that my friend from Utah chairs and the Immigration Subcommittee which Senator ABRAHAM chairs. There have been no hearings because the majority has refused to allow us to have hearings. 
   Let's boil this down to where we really understand what is going on around here. There are threats to pull down the H-1B legislation. I dare them to pull the bill down. I dare them because it would be on their conscience. We have said we will vote on H-1B--what time is it now? Five to 12. We will vote at 12 o'clock. We can have a unanimous consent agreement that the vote can start in 5 minutes on H-1B. As soon as that 15-minute vote, which around here takes 40 minutes, is finished, we will have another 15-minute vote on our Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. We can complete it all in just a few minutes. 
   If people do not like our legislation, vote against it. There is a unanimous consent request kicking around here someplace which we hope to have approved soon that we vote at 4:30 on Senator DASCHLE's motion to suspend the rules so we can vote on this. Keep in mind, so everyone understands, you can disguise it any way you want, but this is a vote on our amendment, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   There has been a lot of talk about the registry provision that this is something new and unique, changing 1982 and 1986. This same thing has been going on since 1929. 
   The registry provision originated in 1929. The registry provision has been amended many times since 1929. In 1940, the registry date was changed to July 1, 1924, and in 1958, the date was changed to June 28, 1940. Subsequently, the date was changed to June 30, 1948, then January 1, 1972, then, of course, we changed 
   it to 1982, giving people 1 year to apply. That is what we are talking about, 1 year to apply. Some people did not file within that 1 year, even though they qualified. People who are here who deserve to qualify under the same law that has been changed since 1929 deserve a fair hearing. 
   What happened? What happened is there was sneaked into a bill a provision that said these people would not be entitled to a due process hearing, a fair hearing. So hundreds of thousands of people who could have qualified under the 1982 cutoff date were denied that privilege, and we are saying that is wrong. That is one of the most important parts of our legislation. 
   We are not ignoring the law with this legislation. We are correcting flaws in current immigration policy that have denied people the opportunity to have legal immigrant status. 
   My friend from Utah has disparaged a number of people, in addition to calling us incompetent, silly, and stupid. He also said that because trade unions oppose some legislation, that it is necessarily bad. Let's talk about trade unions. 
   Let's see here. We have carpenters. Carpenters: What is wrong with carpenters? We have nurses. I wonder what is wrong with nurses opposing legislation, or I wonder what is wrong with having people who work as electricians opposing legislation? What is wrong with trade unions opposing legislation? Is that any worse than the Chamber of Commerce supporting or opposing legislation? There has been a lot of name-calling that has been unnecessary. 
   We are playing around with this bill: If allowing people who have been here for many years to apply for permanent residency is playing around with legislation, then we are playing around with legislation. The playing around is going to stop because we are going to have this legislation passed. The President of the United States has said this will be in a bill, and if it is not, he will veto the bill. He has also gone so far as to say: I would like some support from the Congress before I do that. He has it. He has more than enough to sustain a veto in a letter to him from the House and from the Senate. 
   Our legislation is going to come to be, and people might just as well realize that. What Senators from the majority should also understand is that we are going to vote on our measure. We are going to vote for H-1B. We support it, but in addition to H-1B, we also believe, without any question, that we need to vote on our legislation. We need individuals who fill a critical shortage of high-tech workers in this country. We support that. We also need essential workers, skilled, and semi-skilled workers to fill jobs, as indicated by the scores of organizations and companies that support our amendment, our legislation. 
   I hope the majority understands they are the ones holding up this legislation, not us. They can file 15 more motions to invoke cloture, and we are still going to have a vote on our amendment. One of the votes is going to occur this afternoon if the unanimous consent request is brought forward. If not, it will occur some other time. 
   We believe that the vote which is going to occur at 4:30 this afternoon is the first test to finding out how people really feel about supporting this legislation--not holding hearings in the future, not saying we want to increase the caps on legal immigration. I do not want to do that. We need to deal with it now. 
   I think what we need to do is not talk about the future; let's talk about today, what we are going to do to make sure these people in Las Vegas--20,000 people in Nevada; most of them in Las Vegas--who have had their work cards pulled, who have lost their jobs, who have had their mortgages foreclosed on their homes, who have had their cars repossessed, who have had their credit cards pulled from them, who deserve the basic protections that we have in this country in something called due process that has been denied--we want to have a due process hearing for these people who have children who are American citizens, wives and husbands who are American citizens. 
   Today is the day we are going to determine if my constituents in Nevada are going to be given what every American, every person within the boundaries of our country, has a right to, and that is due process. 
   What we have is a piece of legislation that seeks to provide permanent and legally defined groups of immigrants who are already here, already working, already contributing to the tax base and social fabric of our country, with a way to gain U.S. permanent residency and hopefully someday citizenship. 
   I repeat, 5 minutes from now we would agree to vote on H-1B. Five minutes after that vote is completed, we will agree to vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I also say, if that process is not allowed, then we are going to continue here in the Senate to keep working until people are called upon to account for how they feel about this legislation. There comes a time when you have to fess up, you have to vote for or against a piece of legislation. That is what we are asking for here--a vote for or against this legislation.

   Mr. REID. Before the vote occurs at 4:30, I want to make sure we all understand where we are coming from in this instance. Our leader has asked that the rules be suspended, in effect, so that we can vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This is a very simple measure that we want to vote on. Some people disagree with what we are trying to do. We want an up-or-down vote on this amendment. The Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act contains Central American parity, date of registry,  245(i), and the matter that has been so well discussed by Senator REED from Rhode Island dealing with Liberians. We want an up-or-down vote on this and we will get one eventually. We hope this measure will pass. 
   Everybody should understand that a vote against our suspending the rules is against the amendment that we are advocating, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. This has nothing to do with illegal immigration. These are people who are already in the United States, who are here seeking to have their status readjusted. It has nothing to do with criminals. None of these people are criminals who could apply to have legal status here and apply for citizenship. 
   There are a number of red herrings that have been thrown up, and this is a simple proposal. We want the ability of these people who are in the country to have their status adjusted. Some of it is so unfair that people have the ability to apply under an amnesty act passed in 1986. Anybody in the country prior to 1982 could apply to have their status readjusted. They had a year to do that. Some people took more than a year. We believe there should be the ability of these people who were here before 1982 to have their status adjusted. We have asked that that date be moved up to 1986 in keeping with what we have done in this country since 1929. We have been adjusting the time for individuals to readjust their status. 
   It is unfair if we are unable to do this. The President has said he would not allow this Congress to adjourn unless this fairness provision is passed and made law. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, I think what we have heard today has been comforting, except for one thing. I wish we had a vehicle here before us that we could amend. I think we have a number of amendments we would like to offer to this legislation. The leader decided not  to do that. I hope in the next few days we can work on some of the issues that we believe are so important, which we have talked about on many occasions, such as minimum wage, Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, and education. We understand where we are in a parliamentary situation now that we can't offer any amendments. We look forward to the next week being very productive and our being able to move forward on some of this very important legislation.

   Mr. REID. Finally, the majority leader raised the minimum wage issue. I believe we can do something on a bipartisan basis. The three Senators on the floor presently--two Democrats and one Republican--know that one of the tax incentives we have to give small business is a meals tax deduction. We cut that back significantly and it has hurt restaurant businesses all over America. For Mississippi, having a heavy resort industry, along with Atlantic City and Nevada, I think that is something we can do on a bipartisan basis. 
   I hope we can get the minimum wage issue before us and have decent tax breaks that aren't budget busters and move forward on that. 
   On the Patients' Bill of Rights, for example, sadly, the structure of the Senate has changed by one. We believe we are entitled to another vote, and that failed by one vote previously. That is an issue we can debate later in some other forum. We have talked enough today on H-1B and matters related thereto. I can say that I am comforted by the fact that we were able to get an early vote on the motion to suspend the rules. I hope that will satisfy everybody because it was an up-or-down vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I hope we can set that matter aside and schedule an early vote on H-1B.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to talk a little bit about this legislation. 
   First, I think it is important to know that we--that is, Senator KENNEDY, Senator REED of Rhode Island, myself, Senator DURBIN, Senator LEAHY, and Senator GRAHAM--have a very important amendment we believe should be considered during the time we are debating this issue. Our amendment is called the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   We have had, in recent days, an inability to bring up legislation that is extremely important to the Senate. This legislation deals with a number of issues that were discussed on the floor yesterday briefly, but it deals with the lives of hundreds of thousands of people. 
   In 1996, there was slipped into one of the bills a provision that took away a basic, fundamental American right of due process. 
   As a result of legislation we passed in 1986, thousands of people who came to this country were entitled to apply to adjust their legalization status. However, inserted in legslation that we passed in 1996, was language that, in effect, denied them a due process hearing.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is interesting. This is an unusual situation where we have amendments that have been filed by other Senators being called up by someone else. I think it is very transparent, I say to my friend from Massachusetts and others within the sound of my voice, it is very transparent. All we want is a fair debate and the ability to vote on this amendment. 
   For example, George W. Bush says he wants to make sure that our immigration laws are fair to the Hispanic population of this country. If he wants to be so fair to the Hispanic population of this country, why doesn't he call the Republican leadership in the House and Senate to let us bring forward this legislation that the Hispanic communities all over America want? They won't let us do that. They know the Senator from Massachusetts was here to be recognized so that this amendment could be offered. 
   I have the floor now. I had other things to do this morning, but with Senate procedures such as they are, I  had the opportunity to get the floor, and I am going to keep the floor for a while because I am going to talk about what is going on in this country. 
   Does the Senator have a question, without my losing the floor?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me answer a number of questions because the Senator asked a number of questions. 
   First of all, I spoke yesterday to the National Restaurant Association. I agree with my friend from Massachusetts that it is important we do something for high-tech workers. I support efforts in Congress that have allowed 430,000 people to come to the United States to be high-tech workers, principally from India----

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-9-20000926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Yes, I agree with the Senator from Massachusetts. I am glad we have done that. 
   There is another group of people the restaurant owners believe should be allowed to come. They are essential workers, skilled and semi-skilled workers. We have hundreds of thousands of jobs in America today that aren't being filled. Why? Because there aren't enough Americans to take the jobs. That is why we have, as listed on the chart behind the Senator from Massachusetts, so many supporters from the business community of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. If we had a bigger board, we would have three times that many names on it. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-10-20000926</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. In answer to the Senator, I repeat that I have the greatest respect for the thousands of people who came to this country and are here now as a result of H-1B legislation. It is very important. Those high-tech jobs are important. But I say to my friend from Massachusetts that it is just as important to people who work in these restaurants and who work in these health care facilities as nurses, as cooks, as waiters, as waitresses, and as maids, their jobs are just as important because people who are running these establishments need these essential workers. That is who they are. ``Essential workers.'' They are skilled and semi-skilled workers. 
   I say to my friend from Massachusetts that we have had a hue and cry from the people on the other side of the aisle and from the Governor of Texas and others saying they believe there should be fairness to Latino immigrants. The best way to express that desire for fairness is to allow us to vote on this measure. 
   Let's have an up-or-down vote on the amendment offered by myself, the Senator from Massachusetts, the Senator from Illinois, Senator REED of Rhode Island, and Senator GRAHAM of Florida. Let's move this debate along. We could speed up the time. We would agree to a half hour evenly divided. It could take 30 minutes. Vote on it and move on.  
   I would like to see how people would express themselves on this vote. It is very important. 
   I have a constituency that is watching this very closely. The State of Nevada has the sixth largest school district in America: the Clark County School District. In that school district, over 25 percent of the children are Hispanic. 
   In Nevada, we also have 20,000 people, the majority of whom are Hispanic who are unable to work because they were, in effect, denied due process by a sneaky thing put in the 1996 act. I want them to have a due process hearing to determine whether or not they should remain in the United States. I believe the vast majority would remain here because fairness would dictate that they should. 
   That is what this is all about--basic fairness. That is why we call it the Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I say to anyone within the sound of my voice that if we are interested in speeding up what is going on here in Washington, in the Congress, let's have a vote on this measure that Senator KENNEDY, I, and others are pressing. We will agree. I said we will take 30 minutes, but we would agree to 10 minutes evenly divided. Let's have a vote up or down on this measure.

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-16-20000926</DOCNO>

   Mr. REID. And whether or not they are entitled to remain in this country. I believe in due process. One of the basic and fundamental assets that we have in this country, which sets us far and above any other country, is the legal system. We require and expect due process. 
   What we are saying is the bill that we passed in 1996 gave amnesty to people who had been in this country for an extended period of time. A provision was stuck in the 1996 Immigration Reform bill that denied these people due process. Some of them didn't meet the deadline to file for their amnesty because the INS ignored a law that we passed and President Reagan signed into law. 
   The question is not how much it is going to cost the Government but how much it is going to cost the business sector in this country.

We, the minority, will accept, on a voice vote, the two amendments that have been filed, and then I think the fair thing would be to allow us to proceed on an amendment that has been filed. It is right here: Mr. KENNEDY, for himself, Mr. REID, Mr. DURBIN, Mr. REED, Mr. GRAHAM, Mr. LEAHY, Mr. WELLSTONE, and Mr. DASCHLE submitted an amendment intended to be proposed by them to the bill, S. 2045, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000.

   Mr. REID. I answer the leader's question as follows: First of all, it is very clear that the President will accept nothing short of this legislation. In fact, there is a letter. I don't think it is any secret. We have more than 40 signatures from the Democrats--we only needed 34--to the President, saying if, in fact, he does veto this, we will sustain that veto. 
   I also say to my friend, it is obvious the majority does not want this legislation to pass. They are trying to confuse it. The managing word is always ``illegal immigration.'' This is not about illegal immigration. It has everything to do with fairness in our immigration laws, and helping the American business community in essential fields where they cannot fill the jobs. 
   In Nevada, we have approximately 20,000 people who want to work--who want to go back to work. They have had their work cards withdrawn. They have had their mortgages foreclosed. They have had their cars repossessed. People in America who have children--wives, husbands, American citizens--all they want is a fair hearing. All they want is a fair hearing that would allow them to keep their families together. That is what this legislation is all about.

That is why I say to my friend from California, we have dozens and dozens and dozens of groups of people and organizations that support doing something. 
   I said earlier, I say to my friend from California--I spoke yesterday to the National Restaurant Association. They  are desperate for people to work in their establishments. They are desperate for people to clean dishes, wait tables, cook food, serve food. I say to my friend from California, that job may not be very glamorous, one of those jobs I have described, but it is just as important to the individual who has it as the 420,000 high-tech jobs that we have allowed people from outside the U.S. to come here to fill, just as important.

   Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from California by saying she is absolutely right. But one cost we have not calculated is: What is the cost to a family that is broken up? I said on the floor yesterday, and I will repeat--I am sorry some will have to listen to it more than once--Secretary Richardson, now Secretary of Energy, was Ambassador to the United Nations. He came to Nevada. We had a good day visiting, doing work. 
   The last stop of the day was at a recreation center in an area of Las Vegas that is mostly Hispanic. As we were approaching, our staffs said: Let's take you in the back door because there is a big demonstration out front. We think you should not be disturbed. You can go in; we have people we have invited in and you could have a conversation. 
   We thought it over and we said, no, we are going to go in the front door. As we walked in the front door, we saw hundreds of people, many with brown faces--although I have to tell you there were many white faces as well and they were there to tell Secretary Richardson and I that what was happening was unfair. They qualified under the 1986 amnesty, but they had taken more than a year to file because the INS was not playing by the rules, and they were not entitled, under the 1996 provision that was tucked into the immigration reform bill, to a due process hearing. They were saying:  
   I worked at Caesar's Palace. I was a cook. I made good money. I had a union job. I bought my own home. I have lost my home, I have lost my car, and now I am being asked to lose my family. That is unfair. I have American children. Here, do you want to see them? Here they are.  
   So I say to my friend from California, it is absolutely mandatory that we push this legislation. I am so grateful that Vice President GORE has stated publicly that he supports this legislation; not some different legislation, not trying to wiggle out of it--he supports this legislation. 
   I say to George W. Bush, I can't speak Spanish. I have three children who speak fluent Spanish. I can't speak Spanish. He shows off speaking the little bit of Spanish he knows. Let him speak English and come here and tell us he supports this legislation. That will show he supports the Hispanic community in America and their priorities.

   It appears to me that because the President and Vice President have been unflinching in this--they have said this legislation will pass or this Congress will not adjourn. We have enough votes to sustain a veto. I think we are in good shape.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, we hear a hue and cry--and you and I have been doing some of the crying--about the businesses moving overseas. One reason they are doing that is, of course, there is cheap labor overseas. But the other is they can't find enough people to do the work here. So they throw their arms up and ask us to help them. 
   I believe it is so important we understand this legislation, of which the Senator from Illinois has been a constant supporter, and as a cosponsor of the amendment we have filed, this Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000. 
   Let's not confuse this. My friend from Utah raised the words: ``Illegal immigration. Aren't we supporting illegal immigration?'' Let the Record be spread with the fact this is not about illegal immigration. This has everything to do with fairness--fairness not  for some mystical people off on the horizon but for human beings who live in Las Vegas, who live in Winnemucca, or Chicago, and other places throughout America. All they want is a chance at the American dream. They are not asking for anything other than a fair hearing and the right to work as they know how.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois--and I apologize for not answering the last question directly; the Senator from Illinois has projected what is absolutely the question before the Senate; and that is, we, the Democrats, have been willing to support bringing high-tech workers here. In fact, almost 500,000 of them have come here to work because the high-tech sector which is fueling our economy needs such workers. 
   All we want to do is make sure that other essential workers--which is how I refer to them--skilled and semi-skilled workers come here so that they are able to do the work at Ingersoll-Rand, at Harborside Healthcare Corporation, at Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, at Carlson Restaurants Worldwide and TGI Friday's, and at the Brickman Group, Ltd. 
   As the Senator has indicated, the American Federation of Labor, the American Chamber of Commerce--where else have we been able to see these two groups coming together pushing a single piece of legislation? I can tell you one other, and that is a Patients' 
   Bill of Rights.

   Mr. REID. I respond to my distinguished friend from Illinois, all these people want is a fair hearing. Some of them, after they have a fair hearing, may not have merits to their case, and they may have to go back to their country of origin. But in America, shouldn't they at least be entitled to a fair hearing where they have due process? The obvious answer is yes. 
   I appreciate very much the leadership of the Senator from Illinois on this issue and his ability to articulate something that is so important. We all have the same situation in our offices, those of us who have large minority populations. In my office, I have two Spanish-speaking people working in my Las Vegas office, one in my Reno office, the purpose of which is to work on these very difficult cases. I think it is very good that the Senator from Illinois can condense an issue so understandably. 
   It is my understanding that the Senator from Vermont wishes me to yield.

   Mr. REID. I understand that. I have the floor. I am just making a statement. 
   I say to my friend from Vermont, I am so proud of you. I say that for this reason: I saw some statistics the other day about the State of Vermont. You have very few minorities in Vermont. For you to be the national leader on this issue that you have been takes a lot of political courage. It would be easy for you to be an ``immigrant basher,'' to talk about how bad illegal immigrants are and how bad it is to be dealing with this issue. But you, as the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, have stepped forward. 
   I say to my friend, the Senator from Vermont, you have stepped forward in a way that brings a sense of relief to this body because you have no dog in the fight, so to speak. You are here because you are trying to be a fair arbiter. You are the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee. That is why we, the rest of the members of the minority, have followed you as a leader on matters relating to things that come through that very important Judiciary Committee. 
   I am happy to yield to my friend from Vermont for a question, without my losing the floor.

   Mr. REID. I am happy to respond to my friend from Vermont. There will probably be chapters of books written about what has gone on today. It is going to take some political scientists and some academicians to figure out what went on here today. 
   As of now, Senator CONRAD from North Dakota filed an amendment, according to the unanimous consent  order that was in effect. The majority leader called up his amendment without notifying the Senator from North Dakota. Then Senator LOTT called Senator CONRAD's amendment and then offered a second-degree amendment to Senator CONRAD's amendment. It was very unusual. 
   The purpose, of course, is so we, the minority, once again, would be stymied from offering an amendment and how would that be so? Because the majority does not want to vote on amendments, whether it is an amendment on whether we should close the gun loophole as to whether emotionally disturbed people or criminals, may buy guns at gun shows or pawnshops. That doesn't sound too unreasonable to me. This is a loophole that should be closed. They won't let us vote on the Patients' Bill of Rights either.

   Mr. REID. Once again, we are prevented from moving forward. The Senate has worked a couple hundred years to vote on amendments. But recently we have a new style. If you don't vote on something, you are better off than if you do. 
   In fact, I saw something earlier today where the majority leader said ``that when the Republicans aren't here, their popularity goes up.'' But here is the quote:  
   We were out of town two months and our approval rating went up 11 points.  
   That was from February 3, 2000, by the leader. I think they have just extended this a little bit. Not only when they are out of town does their approval rating go up, I think they learned that if they don't have to vote, their approval rating doesn't go down.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Vermont, there was an interesting discussion on the floor yesterday where a Senator mentioned another Senator's name on the floor without advising that Senator that he was going to be using his name. And the most senior Democrat disagreed with that. He said it was unfair to talk about another Senator when that Senator was not on the floor. 
   If we carry that logic to what the Senator just asked, I think it would also be improper if Senator LEAHY filed an amendment pursuant to an order that had been entered into the Senate and the Senator from Nevada, without saying a word to the Senator from Vermont, called it up. 
   Now, we have been told by the Parliamentarian that there have been times in the past when other Senators have called up other Senator's amendments. We all know that. I have called up amendments for you when you haven't been here.

   Mr. REID. At an appropriate time, I hope we have the opportunity to offer this amendment. I came to the floor Friday and asked unanimous consent that we be allowed to proceed to this. What the minority is saying, is that there is no need to play any parliamentary games. What we want to do is to be able to have an up-or-down vote on amendment No. 4184, whether the underlying legislation was filed on July 25, February 1, or 2 minutes ago. We want a vote on the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000. We want a vote. But, if the majority is going to come in here under some parliamentary guise and say that it is not germane, that is their right. 
   But I want everyone to know--and I spread it across the record of this Senate--that is an obstacle that is unnecessary. They should allow us to vote on this if they believe that there should be fairness, as we have tried to outline here today, people who are already here, already working, or trying to work. We are not hauling in new people from outside the borders of the country. We want the people here to have a fair shot. That is all we want. If the majority does not want that, let them vote against it. I started out saying we would have an hour evenly divided. Then I said a half hour evenly divided. We are down to 10 minutes now, 5 minutes a side, that we would take on this.  We want an up-or-down vote. I think it is fair to have an up-or-down vote on this amendment.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will respond to only one of the things he has listed because the obvious answer to every one is that he is right. About the bulletproof vests, that is very important to the people of Nevada. Why? Because some people believe that Nevada, is a State that is very rural in nature. That is not true. Nevada is the most urban State in America because 90 percent of the people live in the metropolitan Reno or Las Vegas areas. Ten percent live outside of Reno or Las Vegas. Those 10 percent, in Winnemucca and Lovelock, all through Nevada--those little police departments cannot afford bulletproof vests. As a result of that, we have people who are hurt and not able to do their work as well. Some of them have to buy their own vests and usually they are not very good. 
   What the legislation the Senator from Vermont has pushed, and we have gotten a little money on some of his legislation, we need to make sure that in rural America, rural Nevada, in places such as Ely and Pioche and police officers in these rural places in Nevada get the same protection against the criminal element that the people who are police officers in the big cities have. So the Senator from Vermont is absolutely right. We have a game being played here; they don't want to vote on tough issues. 
   They have been pretty successful. And, I am sorry to say that they have been successful. We have spent little time debating issues and voting. We have spent a lot of time thinking about what we are going to do next, which is normally nothing. 
   My friend from Rhode Island has asked that I yield to him for a question, which I will do if I do not lose my right to the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, if there are ever any prizes given by a higher being to someone who cares about a group of people who have no one out there as their advocate or champion, JACK REED from Rhode Island will get one of those prizes. Nobody else has been as vocal a proponent for doing justice to those 10,000 individuals who have no other spokesperson. I congratulate the Senator for being very open and vocal. I have to tell him that but for him his amendment would not be part of this legislation about which we are speaking. I am very proud of the Senator from Rhode Island for the great work he has done. 
   I also respond in this way. Some of the people I am trying to help in Nevada have been there 30 years--not 30 days, 30 hours, 30 months, but 30 years. They want a fair hearing. When I first went to law school, I heard the words ``due process'' and really didn't know what that meant. I quickly came to learn in law school that it is the foundation of our system of justice. People who are here, no matter how they got here, should be entitled to basic fairness. So I thank my friend from Rhode Island for trying to help more than 10,000 Liberians get a fair hearing. That is basically what this is all about. 
   My friend from Florida has been on the floor now for a long period of time. He has indicated to me that he has a question. I am happy to yield for a question without my losing the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Louisiana is absolutely right. We know there was a promise made to Honduran immigrants in this country that their status would be adjusted the same as the Cubans and the Nicaraguans were adjusted. I was happy to recognize that the Cubans and Nicaraguans who are here deserve that. But for the Hondurans, this country has not lived up to the promise made to these people. 
   The Senator is absolutely right. That is why we have company after company and organization after organization supporting this legislation. Senator DURBIN has worked very hard on it, and the Senator from Louisiana has worked with him. 
   As has already been pointed out, supporters of the legislation include the Americans for Tax Reform, Empower American, AFL-CIO, Union of Needletrades and Industrial Textile Employees, Service Employees International Union, National Council of La Raza, League of United Latin American Citizens, Anti-Defamation League, Hadassah, The Women's Zionist Organization, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services, Jesuit Conference, American Bar Association, American Immigration Lawyers Association, Center for Equal Opportunity Club for Growth, Resort Recreation and Tourism Management, and the National School Transportation Association. 
   All we are saying is that these organizations are well-meaning. Why? Because their livelihoods depend on having people to do the work. 
   All we want to do is satisfy basic fairness. I think the way that we could have basic fairness is if the majority would allow us the right to vote on amendment No. 4184. It is as simple as that. I know my time is up.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my final few minutes is time that has been given to me by the leader and that time that I claim for myself to deal with the pending legislation, the postcloture debate. 
   My friend from Utah indicated he was wondering why we didn't file our legislation prior to May of this year. I say to my friend from Utah, as he knows, we have been working on this legislation for more than 2 years, following the 1996 legislation, which has caused much of the controversy and consternation to immigrants. That is the reason this legislation is coming forward--one of the main reasons. Furthermore, one of the main components of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act would update the date of registry. I introduced legislation in August of 1999--last year--and updated legislation in April of this year, to change the date of registry. So, I respect this isn't something we just started working on. We have been fighting for these provisions for years. 
   We have talked about this. In fact, in May of this year, I wrote a letter to the majority leader urging him to move expeditiously to allow us time on the floor to consider the H-1B legislation. There have been no surprises. There has been adequate time for all the committees of jurisdiction to hear this legislation at great length. There have certainly been no surprises. 
   I repeat what was said earlier in this debate. The Democrats, by virtue of this record, support H-1B. We voted for cloture. We believe this legislation should move forward. But in the process of it moving forward, we think in fairness that the legislation about which we speak; namely, the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000, should move forward also. 
   I repeat, if my friends on the other side of the aisle do not like the legislation, then they should vote against it. We are not trying to take up the valuable time of this Senate. But what we are doing is saying we want to move forward on this legislation, and we are not going to budge from this Congress until this legislation is passed. 
   We have a record that substantiates the statement I just made. No. 1, we moved Friday, we moved today, to proceed on this legislation. We have been denied that opportunity. 
   No. 2, we have letters signed by more than 40 Senators and we have more than 150 House Members who have signed a letter to the President, saying if he vetoes this legislation, we will certainly support his veto. Your veto will be based on the fact that the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act of 2000 is not included in something coming out of this Congress. 
   What we are looking to, and the vehicle that should go forward, is the Commerce-Justice-State appropriations bill. But if there is some other area, we will also support the President's veto on that. 
   This legislation, among other things, seeks to provide permanent and legally defined groups of immigrants who are already here, already working, already contributing to the tax base and social fabric of our country, with a way to gain U.S. citizenship. They are people who are already here. They are working or have been working. The only reason they are now not working is because the Immigration and Naturalization Service slipped into the 1996 bill that these people, like the people in Nevada, are not entitled to due process. Some of my constituents in Nevada have not had the ability to have their work permits renewed. They have been rejected. Some have been taken away from them. People lost their homes, their cars, their jobs. I am sorry to say in some instances it has even caused divorce. It has caused domestic abuse, domestic violence. People who have been gainfully employed suddenly find themselves without a job.....their families torn apart. 
   We want a vote, an up-or-down vote. As I have said, we don't want a lot of time. We will take 10 minutes, 5 minutes for the majority, 5 minutes by the minority: Vote on this bill. We will take it as it is written. 
   I think anything less than an up-or-down vote on this shows the majority, who in effect run this Senate, are unwilling to take what we do not believe is a hard vote. From their perspective, I guess it is a hard vote because they do not want to be on record voting against basic fairness for people who are here. Although we are willing to vote to bring 200,000 people to this country--we support that, too--we think in addition to the people who are coming here for high-tech jobs, the people who have skilled and semi-skilled jobs, who are badly needed in this country, also need the basic fairness that this legislation provides.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't really understand because I haven't been there, but I have some idea of the burden that the Senator bears. I really do. It hurts me--I care a great deal about the Senator as a person--to delay what I know the Senator believes is extremely important. 
   However, I believe we should resolve this quickly. We could have a vote in the morning on H-1B. We, the minority, don't oppose H-1B. As I have said today, we want a vote on the amendment filed which we have been talking about all day. We will take 5 or 10 minutes a side and vote. We could be done with this legislation tomorrow at 2 o'clock in the afternoon or 10 o'clock in the morning, whatever the leader decided. 
   The debate we have had today has been constructive but, in a sense, unnecessary. I hope the majority leader, the man who has the burden of controlling what goes on here, especially in his waning days of this Congress, will meet with the caucus or make the decision unilaterally, or whatever it takes, and move on. Take care of the high tech people. Also, take care of the restaurant workers and other people who also need to be taken care of. 
   Again, we will take as little as 5 minutes on this amendment and have a vote and go about our business.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Friday I moved that we proceed to the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, and my good friend, the majority leader, objected to our proceeding to that bill. I was disappointed, and I am sorry that we are not going to be able to debate this issue, and hope that there will come a time before this Congress ends when we will be able to do so. 
   Those who are watching for action on this important piece of legislation should understand why we are at this point; that is, why we are not debating the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, but, rather, why we are now on H-1B only, and why tomorrow there is going to be a motion to invoke cloture on the underlying bill. 
   I consider myself to be one of the strongest supporters for increasing visas for highly skilled workers. I have spent an enormous amount of time over the past several years working on this legislation in an effort to expedite its consideration. As a matter of fact, this legislation should have been brought forward to the Senate many months ago. It should have been taken up and debated under the normal process of considering legislation. I believe an H-1B bill would have passed quickly and the legislation would have already been signed into law. But it also would have provided other Members opportunities, as is their right, to offer related immigration amendments for what we all agree is the only immigration bill that we would consider this year as a freestanding bill. 
   Hindsight is 20-20. The majority decided not to consider this measure under the traditional rules that have served the Senate for more than 200 years. I believe, however, as I have indicated, that we will have time to debate the legislation about which I speak. 
   I think it is unfortunate that we at this stage are going to do the H-1B bill, apparently, alone. I say that because we were so close to an agreement on this underlying legislation. The details were set--the minority agreed each side would have 10 amendments, an hour each. That was compressed to five, then four. We agreed to do that. But we were turned down, and today we find ourselves in this parliamentary situation. 
   We could pass this legislation, including the amendment about which I speak, in a day--day and a half at the most. Instead, the majority is insisting on closing off all debate and preventing the consideration of immigration amendments. 
   I believe that offering and voting on amendments is a right, not a privilege. H-1B was designed so trained professionals could work for a limited time in the United States. It has become widely popular, especially in an age such as this, when Microsoft, IBM and other high-tech companies decided they needed people to fill jobs that were simply not being filled. Hundreds of start-up high-tech companies, in addition to the big ones such as Microsoft and IBM, began using this tool, H-1B, in an effort to recruit an army of high-tech workers for programming jobs. Mostly these people came from India, China, and Great Britain. We now have almost half a million people in this country who came as a result of H-1B. Individuals have filled a critical shortage of high-tech workers in this country and, in fact, the demand still exists. That is why we need to raise the cap for H-1B immigration. 
   But I also believe strongly that we cannot serve one of our country's very important interests and needs at the expense of others--in particular, when the stakes are people's families and their labor. 
   The needs of the United States are not subject to the zero sum theory. We cannot afford to deal or choose or prioritize between people and who we will serve as their legislators. We must try to serve them all. That is our cause, and that is what we promised our constituents. 
   This applies specifically to the other pieces of legislation that have been part of this discussion--in particular with the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, the piece of legislation I moved to proceed on last Friday. This piece of act seeks to provide permanent and legally defined groups of immigrants who are already here, already working, and already contributing to the tax base and social fabric of our country with a way to gain U.S. citizenship. 
   This piece of legislation provides these people with a way to benefit from the opportunities our country affords good citizenship and hard work. While sectors of this economy have benefited from this extended period of economic growth, and with unemployment rates approaching zero in some parts of our country, employers in all sectors, skilled and semi-skilled, are finding themselves with a tremendous shortage of labor. These views are echoed in many quarters. 
   I would like to refer, for example, to a letter sent to me by the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition, which is a group of businesses and trade associations from around the country which was formed specifically to address the shortage of workers in this country. This letter, dated September 8, is addressed to me.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this letter, among other things, states:  
   The Essential Worker Immigration Coalition is a coalition of businesses, trade associations, and other organizations from across the industry spectrum concerned with the shortage of both semi-skilled and unskilled ..... labor.  
   That is why it is called the Essential Worker Immigration Coalition. Among other things, they want to update the registry, they want to restore section 254(I), and also, as part of their plea, they desire we pass the Central American and Haitian Parity Act. 
   This coalition has many members. To mention a few: American Health Care Association, American Hotel & Motel Association, American Immigration Lawyers Association, American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Ingersoll-Rand, Cracker Barrel Old Country Store, Carlson Restaurants, National Retail Federation, National Restaurant Association, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among many others. 
   As you can tell, this piece of legislation has widespread support. This is not a feel-good piece of legislation, that is only attempts to bring more people into the country. It is legislation that is supported by business people in this country who do not have workers to do the work that is essential for them to conduct their business. 
   Take Nevada as an example. We, of course, depend on tourism as our No. 1 industry. But every State in the Union does. Tourism is ranked in the top three; in many instances, one or two, in every state of the Union. Nevada is an example of why we need this, as it mirrors the country as a whole. 
   We have to build a new school in Clark County, Las Vegas, every month to keep up with the growth. We have as many as 10,000 people a month moving into Las Vegas. We have jobs in the service industry that simply cannot be filled. We have one hotel that has 5,005 rooms. It takes people to cook the food for the guests, to make the beds, do all the maintenance work in this massive facility, and we are having trouble finding people to do this work. That is another reason why we support this legislation. 
   This bill aims to correct flaws in current immigration policy that have separated families and denied individuals an opportunity to apply for legal immigrant status by addressing three main issues. First, it would address the Central American and Haitian Parity Act of 2000, otherwise known as NACARA. This important legislation codifies that Central American and Haitian immigrants be granted the same rights that are currently granted to Nicaraguans and Cubans coming to the United States. There is no reason in the world that other people who come under basically the same basis as Nicaraguans and Cubans should not be given the same privileges. Second, 245(I) reauthorizes legislation which would allow immigrants meeting certain criteria to remain in the United States with their families and loved ones, rather than being forced to leave the country while their status is being adjusted. 
   Every one of us in the Senate have heard these heartbreaking examples, getting calls from our State offices where people are forced to go back to their country of origin when they already have a job here, and a quirk in the law is the only reason that they are ordered to go home. Section 245(I) would reauthorize legislation which would allow these immigrants meeting these criteria to remain in the United States while their status is being adjusted, rather than having them go home, lose their job here, leave their family here. It serves no purpose for the country they go to, and certainly not the country from which they come, the United States. 
   The third main component of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act incorporates legislation I introduced earlier this year in S. 2407 that would change the date of registry from 1972 to 1986. 
   I would like to provide a little background as to why I thought it was necessary to introduce the Date of Registry Act of 2000. We all remember the massive immigration reform legislation we considered in 1996 during the last days of the 104th Congress. Pasted into that was the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, an obscure but lethal description which stripped the Federal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate legalization claims against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
   First of all, let me say no one who supports this legislation supports illegal immigration. 
   We believe people who come here should play by the rules. But some people are found in predicaments that need to be readjusted and need to be reexamined. 
   That is why this legislation is so important. 
   That provision I talked about was sneaked into the 1996 act, section 377. This has caused significant hardship and denied due process and fundamental fairness for, not hundreds, not thousands, but hundreds of thousands of hard-working immigrants, including about 20,000 in the State of Nevada. 
   With its hands tied by section 377 language, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals issued a series of rulings in which it dismissed the claims of class action members and revoked thousands of work permits and stays from deportation. 
   As I said, in Nevada alone, about 20,000 people have been affected. These are good, hard-working people who have been in the United States and paid taxes for more than a decade. Suddenly they lose their jobs and ability to support their families. 
   I can remember Bill Richardson came to the State of Nevada. He was then the ambassador to the United Nations. We have a large Hispanic population in Nevada. Over 25 percent of the kids in our six largest school districts in America have Latino ancestry. 
   Recently I took part in an event with Secretary of Energy Richardson. We were going to this recreation center. It was kind of late at night. We were told before going there that there were a lot of demonstrators and we should go in the back way, not go in the front way. 
   Ambassador Richardson and I decided we would go in the front way and walk through these people out there. There were hundreds of people there, none of whom were there to cause any trouble. They were there to tell a story, and the stories they told were very sad. These were people who had American children who were born in the United States and either a husband or wife had improper paperwork done. There were problems. For example, one of the attendees gave a large sum of money to an individual who said he could help them with their citizenship papers. Later he found out that they had not been properly filled out. They were being cheated. There were all kinds of reasons why these people did not meet the program that was necessary to allow them to be here legally. But the main problem they had was section 377 because they could not have a due process hearing. It was outlawed in the 1996 act. 
   There were terribly sad stories of these people who had lost their homes because of having no work permits. Employers were there saying: Why can't this man or woman work? I need them. I can't find anybody to replace them. 
   This was one occasion I met with these people. I met with them on several other occasions, and I have seen firsthand the pain this cruel process has caused. Men and women who once knew the dignity of a decent, legal wage have been forced to seek work underground in an effort to make ends meet. Mortgages have been foreclosed  when families who lived in their own homes have been unable to pay their mortgages. They have lost their cars. Parents who had fulfilled dreams of sending their children to college, as they themselves had not been able to do, have seen those dreams turn into nightmares. 
   What could have happened to create these most unfortunate consequences? As I said, there are lots of reasons. For example, during the 99th Congress, we passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provided a one-time opportunity for certain aliens already in the United States who met specific criteria to legalize that status. 
   The statute established a 1-year period from May of 1987 to May of 1988, during which the INS was directed to accept and adjudicate applications from persons who wished to legalize their status. However, in implementing the congressionally mandated legalization program, the INS created new criteria and a number of eligibility rules that were nowhere to be found in the 1986 legislation. 
   In short, the INS failed to abide by a law passed by a Democratic Congress and signed by a Republican President, President Reagan. 
   Thousands of people who were, in fact, eligible for legalization were told they were ineligible or were blocked from filing legalization applications. Thousands of applicants sued, but by the time the Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the INS indeed contravened the 1986 legislation, the 1-year period for applying for legalization had passed. They were in a Catch-22. 
   While conceding that it had unlawfully narrowed eligibility for legalization, the INS was clearly dissatisfied with the Supreme Court decision. So the court cases dragged on, and the agency employed a different, much more clever approach. 
   Rather than affording the people within these classes due process of law, the INS succeeded in slipping an obscure amendment into the massive 1996 Illegal Immigrant Reform and Responsibility Act which, in effect, as I said, stripped the Federal courts of their jurisdiction to hear claims based upon the 1986 legislation. That provision was section 377 and is now, unfortunately, the law of the land. 
   Changing the date of registry to 1986 would ensure that those immigrants who were wrongfully denied the opportunity to legalize their status would finally be afforded that which they deserved 13 years ago. 
   It is of interest to note that it was also during 1986 that the Congress last changed the date of registry. The date of registry exists as a matter of public policy, with the recognition that immigrants who have remained in the country continuously for an extended period of time--and in some cases as many as 30 years--are highly unlikely to leave, and that is an understatement. 
   Today we must accept the reality that many of the people living in the United States are undocumented immigrants who have been here for a long time. Consequently, they do pay some taxes, but they could be paying more. They pay sales tax, and many times they do not pay income taxes. As a result, the businesses that employ these undocumented persons do not pay their fair share of taxes. 
   These are the facts, and coupled with the knowledge that we cannot simply solve this problem by wishing it away, this is the reality we must face when considering our immigration policies today and tomorrow. 
   We last changed the date of registry in 1986 with the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act which changed the date from January 1, 1972. In doing that, the 99th Congress employed the same rationale I have outlined above in support of a registry date change. 
   Furthermore, my date of registry legislation included in this bill is critical in another aspect. It establishes an appropriate 15-year differential between the date of enactment and the updated date of registry. 
   This measure builds upon the 15-year differential standard established in the 1986 reform legislation by implementing a ``rolling registry'' date which would sunset in 5 years without congressional reauthorization. In other words, on January 1, 2002, the date of registry would automatically change to January 1, 1987, thereby maintaining the 15-year differential. The date of registry would continue to change on a rolling basis through January 1, 2006, when the date of registry would be January 1, 1991. Limiting 
   this automatic change to 5 years would allow the Congress to examine both the positive and negative effects of a rolling date of registry and make an informed decision on reauthorization. 
   I should note again that the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which last changed the date of registry, was passed by a Democratic Congress and a Republican President. I mention these facts to highlight my hope that support for this legislation will be bipartisan and based upon our desire to ensure fundamental fairness as a matter of public policy in our country. 
   We hear many of our friends on the other side of the aisle, particularly the Republican candidate for President, talking about how the priorities of the Latino community are his priorities. I can tell everyone within the sound of my voice that I have met with many members of the Latino community, and whether it is members of the Hispanic caucus in the Congress or community activists in Nevada or other parts of the country, I am consistently reminded that the provisions contained in the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act are of their highest priority. 
   Vice President GORE recognizes this fact and believes he is truly in touch with the concerns and needs of the Latino community by supporting this legislation. If Governor Bush were really serious about the priorities of the Latino community, he would follow Vice President GORE's lead and demand that Congress take up and pass this act today. 
   This bill would solve the problems of many who have lived in this country for many years but have been wrongly denied the opportunity to legalize their status. This bill would solve the problem of workers who have been paying taxes, who have feared having their work permits stripped, or worse, being deported and separated from their families. 
   Consider for a moment U.S. citizens of Latino ancestry--past immigrants--who have made significant contributions to American society and culture in every sphere, as have other immigrants from other parts of the world. I am very proud of the fact my father-in-law immigrated to this country from Russia. We are a nation of immigrants. My grandmother came from England. 
   Throughout our short history as a nation, immigrants have fueled the engine of our economy, and Latino immigrants are no different. Latino purchasing power has grown 43 percent since 1995, reaching over $400 billion this year. Because Latinos create jobs, the number of Latino-owned firms grew by over 76 percent between 1987 and 1992, and will employ over 1.5 million people by next year. 
   Latinos care about the United States and are willing to fight for it too. Americans of Latino ancestry have fought for the United States in every war beginning with the American Revolution. Currently, approximately 80,000 Latino men and women are on active duty, and over 1 million Latinos are veterans of foreign wars. 
   Finally, Latinos participate in the American democracy. Of registered voters, Latinos have a higher voter turnout than the population as a whole. Latinos, both established and those new to our hometowns, contribute greatly to the United States. What better time to reconsider our Latino immigration policy and make it more practical and more fair than this month as we celebrate Latino Heritage Month. 
   America has always drawn strength from the extraordinary diversity of its people, and Latino Heritage Month presents an opportunity to commemorate the history, achievements, and contributions of Americans of Latino ancestry, as well as think to the future. 
   Immigrants' love for this country is predicated by the recognition of firsthand knowledge of how special this country is and how privileged they are and we are to live here. I believe Latinos will continue to make important contributions to America's future, but in order for Latinos to continue helping America, America must help them with this legislation.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota, it is too bad there are not more discussions about trade. I say my colleague has tried, more than any other Member of the Senate. If we take a look at what is happening with these tremendous trade deficits--we are all kind of fat and sassy around here these days. Because the economy is so good, it buries these trade deficits. But if the economy begins to lag a little bit--and it will someday--we are going to feel these trade deficits more than you can imagine--not more that you can imagine but more than most people can imagine. 
   So I compliment you for trying so hard to keep the fact that we need to be concerned about our trade deficit in the forefront of what we are doing. We cannot have this imbalance of trade going on forever and remain the strong, powerful country that we are. If the trade deficit continues and it keeps getting larger and larger, as the Senator's pictures have shown--I am trying to figure out a way to say ``a picture is worth a thousand words,'' and it really is. What you have shown here tugs at my heartstrings because it really is an issue we need to be addressing, and we are not. 
   Basically, I want to say to the Senator from North Dakota how much I appreciate his doing everything within his power, not only today but over the past 5 years, to bring this to the forefront so we start talking about these issues. 
   I have to say we failed. We have not followed your lead. We have not discussed, in any depth at all, the trade deficit.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we in the United States, because of the power of our economy, are not feeling the increase in fuel prices. We are feeling it a little bit. But other places in the world are feeling it very dramatically. 
   What I say to my friend, talking about the trade deficit and problems with energy, is that we may not be feeling them now, but if we do not address these problems we are going to feel these fuel problems dramatically because it was not long ago a barrel of oil was costing $10. We did nothing. At the time, of course, because of the low prices, we could have done something to put this fuel into our reserves. We did not do anything about that. We, of course, during the good times, have  done nothing to develop alternative fuel sources. We could do that. We have not done that. Now that there is the spike in oil prices, we are looking back and saying: Gee, I wish we would have done something. Tax policy does not do anything to favor alternative fuels. 
   There are a lot of things that are facing this country that we need to get ahold of while we have the opportunity. This economy is looked upon as the greatest of all time. But as good as our economy is, it can falter just as it has gone up. It does not take a lot of things to start going wrong before we have a problem with our economy. 
   So, again, before my friend leaves the floor, he could not talk about two issues that are any more important to this thriving economy than the trade deficit--that is pronounced and we are not doing anything about it--and, of course, energy, about which we are doing very little.

   We have to have an energy policy. This is not a problem of Democrats or Republicans; it has been a problem of administrations for the last 30 years. They simply will not get involved and work with Congress to come up with a long-term energy policy, and we need one.

   It is so important that we get this done. I understand the importance of H-1B. I supported it. We have had 420,000 people come to this country as a result of our H-1B legislation in the past. But there are other things that we simply need to do, including the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act, of which I am a cosponsor. I strongly support this piece of legislation that seeks to provide permanent and legally defined groups of immigrants who are already here working and contributing as taxpayers and to the social fabric of the company. They are awaiting U.S. citizenship. 
   I say to the majority leader that we need to have an opportunity to, in  some way, in the waning days of this Congress to work this out. We are going to work very hard. We will do it with the support and consideration of the majority leader, or without it. We really believe this is necessary. We are sorry the majority leader has objected, but we understand the reasons.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank Chairman ROBERTS for his comments and also for the work he does on a daily basis for the Ethics Committee. He works tirelessly, without complaint, and does an outstanding job for the Senate and the people of this country. Again, I thank the chairman for his comments regarding this matter. I have the greatest respect for Chief Justice Rehnquist. He has rendered great service to the country. I think he has been a good Justice. For example, almost 2 years ago now, he was the Presiding Officer in this body in one of the most difficult situations we have had in this country, dealing with the impeachment of the President. He did an exemplary job. I thought he was outstanding. But I believe on this issue he is wrong. He spoke out that the Judges should have honoraria. They don't need honoraria. I believe there is a great deal of truth in the observation that there was little honor in the honoraria practices of years ago. 
   Although a portion of the honoraria ban was declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court, after which the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel indicated that they would not enforce the ban in any part of government, notwithstanding these actions, the honoraria ban has continued in force by rule of the Senate, and for Members and highly paid staff in the House as well. It also appears that the judicial branch has continued to recognize and abide by the ban. I think it is wonderful that they have done so. So there is much to be preserved here, and let's not undo what has already set a pattern for good government.

   Mr. REID. I will only add, Mr. President, because the proposal allows for but does not guarantee limits--for example, there are no limitations on the amount of the honoraria or the number of honoraria received--there is always the potential for many other problems. The Senator from Kansas and I agree that the problem with this proposal is not that it needs to be tinkered with or fine-tuned; the problem is that it takes us in the wrong direction. If the Judges need more compensation, we should address that in Congress and pay them more money.

   It is certainly not the intention of the minority to hold up Congress, to hold up these appropriations bills. As a longtime member of the Appropriations Committee, and someone who has the greatest respect and admiration for the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee, I think it is important we work with the majority in trying to figure out a way out of this.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the defense authorization conference is meeting, I rise today to urge my colleagues to stand behind the Senate version of the bill with respect to Section 666 of H.R. 4205. This provision permits retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service connected disability to receive military retired pay concurrently with veterans' disability compensation. 
   Veterans from Nevada and all over the country care about this legislation. 
   Career military retired veterans are the only group of federal retirees who are required to waive their retirement pay in order to receive VA disability. Simply put, the law discriminates against career military men and women. All other federal employees receive both their civil service retirement and VA disability with no offset. 
   This inequity is absurd. How do we explain this inequity to these men and women who scarified their own safety to protect this great nation? How do we explain this inequity to Edward Lynk from Virginia who answered the call of duty to defend our nation? Mr. Lynk served for over 30 years in the Marine Corps and participated in three wars, where he was severely injured during combat in two of them. 
   Or George Blahun from Connecticut who entered the military in 1940 to serve his country because of the impending war. He served over 35 years during World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War. He is 100% disabled because of injuries incurred while performing military service. He asks that Congress stop giving veterans the ``arbitrary bureaucratic rhetorical nonsense'' and truly support this legislation. We must demonstrate to these veterans that we are thankful for their dedicated service. As such, we must fight for the amendment in the Senate version of the national defense authorization bill for FY 2001. 
   This is an absolute injustice to our career military retired veterans. Federal employees, for example a member of Congress or a staffer here on Capital Hill or an employee from the Department of Engery, are not penalized if they receive disability benefits. While career military men and women that have incurred injuries while in the line of duty are prohibited from doing so because of an archaic, out-dated 109-year-old law. 
   The amendment in the Senate bill represents an honest attempt to correct this inequity that has existed for far too long. Allowing disabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently will restore fairness to the entire Federal retirement policy. 
   It is unfair for our veterans not to receive both of these payments concurrently. We must ensure that our veterans who are facing serious disabilities as a result of injuries sustained during their service do not have to choose between retirement pay and losing a portion of their disability benefits. 
   We have an opportunity to show our gratitude to these remarkable 437,000 disabled military men and women who have scarified so much for this great country of ours. 
   We are currently losing over one thousand WWII veterans each day. Every day we delay acting on this inequity means that we have denied fundamental fairness to thousands of men and women. 
   The Senate passed this provision by unanimous consent and the House companion bill, H.R. 303 from Congressman BILIRAKIS has 314 cosponsors. Our veterans have earned this and now it is our chance to honor their service to our nation. Freedom isn't free--and this is a small cost to the Federal government given the immeasurable sacrifices made by these dedicated Americans.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from North Dakota that I, along with my constituents from the State of Nevada, appreciate the Senator being able to articulate the problems with the cost of prescription drugs. The Senator has been on this floor with visual aids showing how much a drug costs, the cost of a prescription being filled in Canada and the cost in America. There is a 300- to 400-percent difference in some of those medications. These are lifesaving drugs, drugs that make lives more comfortable. It makes people's live bearable. 
   No one in the Congress has done a better job of suggesting and showing the American people how unfair it is that the United States--the inventor, the manufacturer, the developer of these prescription drugs--why in the world do we, the country that developed the drugs, why do the people from Nevada and North Dakota and every place in between, why do we pay more than the people in Canada, Mexico, and other places in the world? 
   We don't have an answer to that, do we?

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. I carry in my wallet, and I have pulled it out on occasion--it is pretty worn and tattered--some quotes just confirming what my friend from North Dakota said about how people on the majority feel about Medicare. 
   Let me read some direct quotes: ``I was there fighting the fight, 1 of 12, voting against Medicare because we knew it wouldn't 
   work in 1965.'' Senator Robert Dole. He, as one of the leaders of the Republican Party, opposed it in 1965. I am sure he still opposes it. 
   We don't have to look at Senator Dole, even though I think he is one of the patriarchs of the Republican Party. Let's look at one of the present leaders, DICK ARMEY: ``Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a rotten trick, and I think we are going to have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over time.'' This is the House majority leader, DICK ARMEY. 
   What my friend from North Dakota has said is right: The majority has never felt good about Medicare. 
   As my friend has said, in 1965 when Medicare came into being, there really wasn't a need for prescription drugs because prescription drugs were in their infancy and it didn't matter the vast majority of the time whether someone was going to live or die, be comfortable or not. 
   Now, how can we, the only superpower in the world, a nation that is leading the world in research and medical products, how can we have a Medicare program, a program for health care for senior citizens, that does not include the prescription drug benefit? We can't do that. 
   I also say to my friend, the reason we are here is this morning a Senator came over and gave this presentation and said what my friend from North Dakota said: Sure, we want to do something about Medicare, but I have gotten letters from my constituents saying ``I'm against the big government plan.'' 
   This is exactly what we hear on the radio advertisements and the television advertisements that are paid for by the health care industry. They want the American people to think that the program the Democrats are propounding is a big government plan. There could be nothing further from the truth. 
   What does this have to do with big government? A woman by the name of Gail Rattigan, from Henderson, NV writes:  
   I am a registered nurse who recently cared for an 82-year-old woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldn't afford the medications her doctor told her were necessary to prevent a stroke. It would be much more cost effective for the Government to pay for medications that prevent more serious illnesses and expensive hospitalizations. These include but are not limited to blood pressure medications, anti-stroke anticoagulants, and cholesterol medications. The government's current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward. Get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money.  
   This is a registered nurse from Henderson, NV. 
   I want everyone on the majority side to know they are not going to be able to come over and make these statements as if there is no opposition to it. What my friend from Tennessee says is wrong. He states he has gotten all of these letters saying: I am against the big government plan. 
   That is because of the radio and TV advertisements from the powerful health insurance industry. But the real people are like the 82-year-old woman who wanted to commit suicide because she couldn't get medication. 
   Also, I want to spread across this record that my friend from Tennessee, who came and said, ``We need the Republican plan,'' makes the statement that he wants to involve Senator BREAUX in this. 
   The majority can't have it both ways. They either support the Bush plan, the plan of the person running for the President of the United States on the Republican ticket, or they don't support the nominee. It appears what my friend from Tennessee is doing is trying to have it both ways because the Senator from Louisiana does not support Governor Bush's plan. 
   The majority realizes that their medicare plan simply can not work because of their nominee's $1.6 trillion tax cut proposal. Senator BREAUX pointed this out quite clearly today. 
   My point is, I say to my friend from North Dakota, people who come here and make statements on the floor need to have substantiation. I say the Senator from Louisiana does not support the Bush Medicare plan. 
   I also say the majority has introduced a proposal--so we understand it, but it is a Medicare prescription drug benefit in name only. A New York Times writer states:  
   ..... all indications are that this plan is a non-starter. Insurance companies themselves are very skeptical; there haven't been many cases in which an industry's own lobbyists tell Congress that they don't want a subsidy, but this is one of them.  
   I take just another minute or two of my friend's time.  
   The GOP plan subsidizes insurance companies, not Medicare beneficiaries. Health insurance companies continue to say the Republican plan is unworkable.  
   The majority tries to give this to the insurance industry, but the insurance industry doesn't want it because it won't work. 
   Charles Kahn, President of the Health Insurance Association of America, has stated:  
   ..... we continue to believe the concept of the so-called drug-only private insurance simply would not work in practice. 
   I don't know of an insurance company that would offer a drug-only policy like that or even consider it.  
   Mr. President, I say to my friend from North Dakota, we know there needs to be something done about the high cost of prescription drugs. 
   No. 2, we know there has to be something done with Medicare to help senior citizens of this country be able to afford prescription drugs. That is all we are saying. And we want everyone to know the program put forth by the minority is a program that helps senior citizens. It is not something that is means tested, but a program that helps all senior citizens, not people who make less than $12,000 a year. It is a program that is essential. It is essential because people, as we speak, such as Gail Rattigan, who is a registered nurse, who wrote to me, write that people are considering suicide. If they are to take one pill a day, they are splitting them in two; they are asking if they can get half a prescription filled because they simply can't afford it. We need to change that.

   Mr. REID. We do need to talk about that hearing in Las Vegas. There is not anyone who could watch that and listen to that and not shed a tear. 
   I want to take off on something my friend from North Dakota said. During that hearing--those sick people and the mother who lost her son--there was not a question about whether or not they were Democrat or Republican. There was not a single word about that. Democrats get sick, and Republicans get sick. That is why I underscore what the Senator from North Dakota has stated today: That we need to come up with a plan that will work. We know the private insurance plan will not work. We do not have to have politicians tell us. The people the majority is trying to help tell us it will not work.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we, also, in the minority, are very interested in this subject. We think the Vice President and nominee has, along with others, set a good tone as to how we should look at what is going on with media. However, as we speak, at this very minute there are hearings on this subject going on in the Commerce Committee. The ranking member, Senator HOLLINGS, has not had an opportunity to review this unanimous-consent request. We believe if there is going to be legislation brought before the Senate, it should be in the regular order; that is, there should be an opportunity to amend the legislation if in fact that is necessary. We know there are a number of Senators who wish to offer amendments. 
   This unanimous-consent request that we have allows one amendment, and on that one amendment Senators can speak for 30 minutes. So when we have so much to do in this body--we have 11 appropriations bills we have not completed. I am going to discuss, in a little bit, some more things on education. We have a Patient's Bill of Rights we need to do, a prescription bill we need to do, minimum wage--I think it is awfully late in the game, when we have 15 days in the session left, to start talking about media violence. This is an issue that has been outstanding for many months. We have members of the minority who have spoken out on this time after time. 
   Based on that, and for other reasons, we object.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we also recognize that there are issues that need to be discussed as to what is going on with the media. That is why this legislation is important. The problem is there are other matters dealing with children we have totally ignored this year. For example, we have spent, this year, 6 days of debate on the ESEA. 
   As I have said, we do not apologize for the work we have done on tobacco. What has happened has been revolutionary as a result of the minority speaking out against the problems of tobacco. We do not apologize for that. Of course, we have called attention to it. 
   We have also called attention to the fact that we believe our children need more attention. On February 3 of this year, the majority said education will be a ``high priority'' in this Congress. 
   I regret to say instead of making education a central issue, and even a high priority, we have had only 6 days of debate on education this entire year on the Senate floor. There is not a more important issue that we can talk about on the Senate floor, bar none, than educating our children. Having 6 days of debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act in this Congress over a 2-year period does not indicate to me this is a ``high priority.'' 
   We have about 15 days left in this Congress. We still have 11 appropriations bills to do. We have a minimum wage bill to complete. We have the Patients' Bill of Rights bill to complete. We have prescription drug benefits to address. We have issues dealing with gun safety, bankruptcy reform--the list of things we have not done is unending. 
   I believe to bring up, as was done by the majority today, this issue dealing with media, when right now Senator MCCAIN and others are listening to testimony of Senator JOE LIEBERMAN as to what he believes should be done in this regard. We know this is an artificial effort by the majority to focus on this issue. There is no intention to bring this up for debate. That is why the unanimous consent request given was so restricted that they would allow one amendment for 30 minutes. I think it is obvious this was only an effort to bring up an issue and talk about what they cannot get done. 
   Remember, the majority controls what goes on here on the floor. It is very obvious to me one thing the majority does not want to go on is a debate about education. 
   The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is an act that was part of President Johnson's war on poverty. It has been a successful program. Title I, the largest program in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, was intended to help educational challenges facing high-poverty communities by targeting extra resources to school districts and schools with the highest concentrations of poverty. What it has done for children who could not read is remarkable. We have a lot more to do because Title I, which relates to teaching kids who have fallen behind how to read, has been so underfunded. Where it has been funded, it has done remarkably well. 
   We want this program to continue. In 1994, the Democratic-led Congress and the Clinton-Gore administration worked together to enact far-reaching reauthorization of Title I. We want to continue this, set high standards, and close the achievement gap. We want to do something about class size reduction. We want to hire more teachers. There are all kinds of studies that show if teachers have fewer children to teach, the kids do better, but we do not need studies to prove that. 
   Common sense dictates if a teacher has fewer children to teach, she is going to do a better job of teaching those children. That is what this legislation is about: Simple common sense; that is, if you have fewer children to teach, the kids are going to do better. We want to do that. We want to have class size reduction. 
   It is very clear one of the reasons we have such a high dropout rate is because of the fact children are in classes that are so big and schools that are so big. 
   I did an open school forum in Las Vegas during the August recess. Las  Vegas is the sixth largest school district in America with 230,000 children. It was interesting. The new superintendent of schools, Carlos Garcia, who came from Fresno, said that if a 
   child is not reading up to standard in the third grade, that kid is a good candidate for being a high school dropout. We need to make sure the children in third grade can read. That is what this is all about. That is why we need to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is why we need to have fewer kids for each teacher to teach. That is what we are trying to do. That is why Senator MURRAY has worked so hard on her Class Size Reduction Act. 
   Unfortunately, our friends on the other side of the aisle reject our class size reduction program by failing to provide a separate dedicated funding stream. What we have done as a result of the intervention of the Clinton-Gore administration is force at year end in the omnibus bill more money for teachers. As a result of that, we have hired almost 30,000 new teachers so far under this program, directly benefiting over 1.5 million children. It has been proven, if you have smaller class sizes, these kids outperform students in larger classes. It helps teachers, and it helps the students. I repeat, our friends on the other side of the aisle reject this. 
   I want to talk about something very important to me, and that is high school dropouts. I mentioned briefly that if a kid cannot read in third grade, he or she is a good candidate to be a high school dropout. 
   Three thousand children drop out of school every day, 500,000 a year. We would be so much better off if we could do something to keep 500 of those children in school every day, or 200 of those children. We would only have 2,800 dropping out of school every day. 
   We have worked on this. Senator BINGAMAN and I have a dropout prevention bill which supports local school development and programs for the prevention of dropouts. We successfully included $10 million in funding for dropout prevention in the Labor-HHS appropriations bill. We hope that stays in conference. The conference has not been held, of course, as has conferences for most appropriations bills not been held. I hope money will stay in there. It is a few dollars. We need a lot more money. If we are going to have an attack on keeping kids in school, if we are going to have lower dropouts, we need to have in the Department of Education a dropout czar, somebody in charge of making sure there are programs throughout America to keep kids in school. 
   We need to focus on education. We are not going to in this Congress. That is gone. We need to work on school modernization, support for disadvantaged children, afterschool opportunities. It is clear--and Senator BOXER has worked very hard on afterschool programs--that if we can keep kids occupied after school, they are simply not going to get involved in things they should not do. This has been proven and shown to be accurate. We need more money in afterschool programs. Senator BINGAMAN has worked hard on school accountability. We support funding accountability provisions for failing schools; for example, putting a qualified teacher in every classroom within 4 years of this legislation. 
   The record should be replete with the fact that this year this Congress has spent 6 days of debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act. That is pathetic. We are concerned about children. We should be able to debate the issue. We offered that this bill be handled in the regular course of business. Request after request has been rejected. That is too bad.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say, before my friend leaves the floor, how much respect I have for the Senator from Oregon and the great example he sets for everyone in the bipartisan consideration of legislation. 
   I do want to say, though, before my friend leaves, that one of the pleasures of my service in the Senate is that I have been able to work with Senator DASCHLE. We served in the House together. We have served in the Senate together. He is the leader. I am the assistant leader. 
   There are very few meetings he attends that I am not there. For example, we had a meeting yesterday with the bipartisan leadership of both Houses. At that meeting with the President of the United States, Senator DASCHLE was very clear in saying he wanted to get things done this year. He gave a list of things he thought we could accomplish. 
   We are so close to being able to do something on the Patients' Bill of Rights, which the Senator from Oregon has voted, I believe, the right way on many occasions. 
   Senator DASCHLE in that meeting said that he wanted to get things done. He gave a list of things that should be done. Senator DASCHLE, in private meetings and in public meetings, has said the most important thing we can do is complete legislation that is already before the Senate, 
   including the 11 appropriation bills that have not been completed. 
   I don't know what appears in U.S. News and World Report or whatever publication my friend from Oregon mentioned. The fact is, Senator DASCHLE has continually said publicly and privately the most important thing that we can do is enact legislation for the American people. 
   I think the record should be very clear that there is no intent on behalf of the minority to prevent anything from going forward. We want to move legislation. First of all, let's do the appropriations bills, and if we have time left over, do the other items, which I believe we will do, as indicated in a meeting with the President yesterday. Let's do them. 
   I express my appreciation to the Senator from West Virginia for his patience. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time before the scheduled votes be extended for whatever time I have used under leader time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say, through the Chair to my friend from West Virginia, that I agree with him. I think that if we are going to have 10-minute votes, we should have 10-minute votes. We started these votes at 6 o'clock. It is now quarter to 7. In fact, we started before 6. 
   I would hope we could stick to the 10-minute limit. People have all kinds of things to do rather than sit around and wait to vote.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I certainly applaud and congratulate the two managers of this bill to arrive at a point of a finite number of amendments with time limits. 
   I say to the Senate in general, however, that just because these amendments were in order doesn't mean the Senators have to offer them, and just because all the time agreements have been listed doesn't mean people have to use that time. I hope the two leaders work toward finding a way we can finish this bill tomorrow evening. There is a tremendous amount of work still left to be done in the Senate. I hope to finally resolve this legislation sometime tomorrow.

   Mr. REID. I say, through the Chair to my friend from Nebraska, we were also informed that Senator BYRD would agree to a voice vote on this. So I think it would be to everyone's best interests that those who have amendments to offer would offer the amendments as quickly as possible. 
   When Senator BYRD gets here, it is my understanding he wants to say a few words prior to the voice vote on his amendment. But I think it would be appropriate that the Senate be advised that there likely will not be a recorded vote at 10 o'clock this morning, so Senators should be about their other business. 
   I also say to the acting leader, we hope those who are managing the various appropriations bills that have passed the Senate and have passed the House would do whatever they can to get the conference process underway. We have a tremendous amount of work to do. And while we are not debating appropriations bills in the evening, as we were last week, there is still a lot of work to be done on those. We hope the conferences, including engaging the administration, would be ongoing at this time so we can have an end game around here to complete those bills.

   Mr. REID. I recognize the importance of wind energy development not only for North Dakota but also for the other states that might benefit from North Dakota's ability to harness this great resource. This project discussed by the Senator from North Dakota is particularly unique since it is being conducted by Native Americans in an effort to reduce their dependence on fossil fuels and to become more financially self-sufficient. Although we do not know, as the Senator points out, what our final allocation may be, the Senator can be assured that I will do my best to see that this initiative is funded, should the Subcommittee's allocation allow additional projects.

   Mr. REID. Mr. Leader, having looked at the votes on this issue, the Thompson amendment, I think it would be in everyone's interest if this could be worked out so there is a separate vote on this issue, separate from this legislation. Senator THOMPSON should know that there are a number of people who have a basic support for his legislation but would vote against it because it is on this legislation. He has worked so hard on this, so I hope he can have a separate up-or-down vote on the merits, not complicated by the PNTR issue.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, efforts to force this body to consider a questionable proposal, which is a ban on legal gambling on college games, shows a fundamental misunderstanding, in this Senator's view. 
   At this stage, we have about 18 or 19 days left in this 
   congressional session. We have 11 appropriations bills that must pass the Senate. We have all the fundamental conference reports that must be held. There is a hue and cry about doing something about a real Patients' Bill of Rights. There is a need to do something about minimum wage. We have all kinds of problems with education. As we speak, today, 3,000 children dropped out of high school in America, and we are not spending any time on that. We need prescription drug coverage, Medicare. There are so many fundamental issues that we need to work on and there is not a hue and cry out there that we need to take the next 19 days and spend 1 minute talking about banning something that is legal in America; that is, betting on college games. 
   Remember, if we were serious about doing something about betting on college games, we would go after the 98.5 percent of illegal betting that goes on in college games. Only a percent and a half goes on in college games, and that is legal in the State of Nevada. 
   With just a few weeks to go in Congress, it is incredulous we would be asked to waste time debating the merits of banning legalized wagering on college games. 
   Therefore, Mr. President, with great underscoring, I object.

   Mr. REID. I underline what the Senator from New Mexico has said. My friend from Illinois has three amendments he has filed. It is my understanding that he is going to offer one of those; and if there would be an up-or-down vote on that, he would withdraw two of the amendments--and not only an up-or-down vote but no second-degree amendments. 
   So the Senator from Illinois would agree--if I could have the attention of the Senator from New Mexico for just a minute. The Senator from Illinois would agree to 30 minutes equally divided, with a vote, with no second-degree amendments. That is my understanding, that we would have a vote on that at some time before final passage later tonight.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read the names of some of those who have lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue this fight. Following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today. September 6, 1999: Andres Aguliar, 33, Houston, TX; Sharon Barraso, 20, Philadelphia, PA; Tony Butler, 18, Philadelphia, PA; Edwin Cordova, 23, Houston, TX; Tijuan Dickey, 19, Baltimore, MD; Ellis Hair, 21, Chicago, IL; Anthony Jones, 32, Detroit, MI; Louis Merril, 17, Chicago, IL; Oscar Murray, 24, Detroit, MI; Isaac Noyola, 21, Houston, TX: Kevin Parker, 23, St. Louis, MO; Michael Sanchez, 28, Philadelphia, PA: Gregory Scott, 30, Houston, TX; Vincent Casey Stanley, 36, Memphis, TN; Cheryl Thornton, 20, New Orleans, LA; Unidentified Male, 58, Norfolk, VA; and Unidentified Male, 25, Norfolk, VA. 
   One of the gun violence victims I mentioned 23-year-old Edwin Cordova of Houston, was on his way home from a trip to Galveston with a group of friends. After passing a truck that had been attempting to block their way, one of the truck's passengers fired gunshots through the rear window of the vehicle. Cordova, who was riding in the front passenger's seat, died at the hospital of a gunshot wound to the neck. 
   We cannot sit back and allow such senseless gun violence to continue. The deaths of these people are a reminder to all of us that we need to enact sensible gun legislation now.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Pennsylvania leaves the floor, I want the RECORD to reflect the statements he has made are bipartisan in nature. I underline and underscore the importance of the statement of the Senator from Pennsylvania. I think it would be very unwise for Chairman Arafat to move unilaterally on establishing statehood. I hope he will sit back and look at the great loss that will take place if an agreement is not reached at this time. 
   I commend and applaud the Senator from Pennsylvania for his statement.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as always, I appreciate the hard work the chairman and his staff put into drafting this annual appropriations bill. 
   They have done an excellent job in pulling this bill together and I appreciate the cooperative manner with which he and his staff have worked with my staff. I also appreciate the consideration he has provided to the requests of all Members. 
   This subcommittee received over 1,000 requests from Members this year and majority and minority staff have combed through all of them. 
   As always, we are not able to accommodate as many of them as we would like, and, frankly, not even as many as we need to. 
   There are a great many things to like in this bill: 
   Solid funding for the programs to keep our nation's nuclear arsenal safe and secure. 
   Strong Army Corps and Bureau of Reclamation funding for work already underway. 
   First time funding for the Delta Regional Commission. 
   Also, for the first time in many years, the bill contains nearly full funding for the Solar and Renewable Energy programs. 
   I want to thank the Chairman of the Subcommittee, Mr. DOMENICI, for working with me to send some more resources to renewables. 
   We received a bipartisan letter, signed by 56 of our colleagues, requesting full funding for the Solar and Renewable accounts in this bill. I am delighted to report that we have come very close to doing so. 
   I believe that the Solar and Renewables programs are essential to our nation's long-term energy security and appreciate your consideration, Mr. Chairman. 
   As we have discussed, I am committed to producing a final energy and water conference report that is balanced and takes into account the wide variety of activities that we are called upon to fund. 
   Unfortunately, I do not believe that we can do justice to the non-defense side of our bill without additional resources. 
   There are also several controversial items, including no funding for Cal-Fed, no funding for the removal of a uranium tailings pile on the shore of the Colorado River near Moab, and the inclusion of several policy riders that will all need to be resolved in conference, or possibly here on the floor.  
   Additionally, it is my understanding that the administration has issued a veto threat over several issues, including: 
   1. Language prohibiting the Secretary of Interior from allocating water from the Central Arizona Project; and 
   2. A provision that prohibits the Army Corps of Engineers from updating the Missouri River Operators Manual; this provision also involves the Endangered Species Act. 
   This second item will be the subject of a fairly extensive debate here on the floor between Senators DASCHLE and BAUCUS and Senator BOND and others. 
   I take the veto threat seriously and encourage other Members to do the same. 
   While I am not inclined to encourage Members to vote against this bill at this time, it is my hope and expectation that these matters can be worked out either here on the floor or in conference. 
   In short, the vote count on this bill today or whenever we vote should not be considered indicative of the way I or other Members will vote if the President vetoes this bill. 
   That said, given the unfortunate financial constraints that the subcommittee had to work with--which I will discuss in a moment--this is a good bill overall. I support it and encourage my colleagues to do the same. 
   My overall message is simple today: This subcommittee simply does not have the resources it needs to do the job that Congress, the administration, and the American people expect of us. 
   I am not pointing fingers or attempting to assign blame: I am simply stating a fact. 
   This is a very important appropriations bill, one where we are asked to pay for a broad array of programs critical to our nation's future. We fund: 
   The guardians of our nation's nuclear weapons stockpile. 
   Our nation's flood control and navigation systems, infrastructure that contributes to human safety and economic growth. 
   Long-term research, development, and deployment of solar and renewable technologies, programs critical to our nation's long-term energy security and environmental future and; 
   Science programs that are unlocking the human genome and other breakthroughs that help to keep the U.S. at the scientific forefront of the world. 
   All of these are areas that are critical to our nation's independence and security, yet, year after year, this subcommittee is called upon to gut one or more of these programs to pay for other energy and water programs, or spending in other subcommittees. 
   We cannot continue to do this. These activities are too important. 
   While most of these comments focus on our shortfalls on the non-defense side of our ledger, they hold true for the defense programs, as well. 
   The subcommittee allocation for non-defense activities of the Bureau of Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Energy and others is over $600 million below the President's request. 
   Such a huge funding shortfall has required the subcommittee to impose strict limits on the types of projects that can be funded this year. 
   For example, as Chairman DOMENICI mentioned, there are no new construction new starts for BOR or the Army Corps in this bill. 
   As you can imagine, it is difficult to tell my colleagues that a fully authorized water project, one that is completely ready to go, has no shot at a construction new start this year. Only on-going work--usually at a dollar level well below the President's request--and a handful of new studies. 
   This is no way to run a robust national program. 
   But this year's numbers really only tell part of the story. All of us know, we have good financial years and bad financial years around here. However, short-falls year in and year out in the water accounts of the Army Corps have now resulted in a backlog of $45--$50 billion in fully authorized projects that are awaiting the first dollar in funding. 
   This shortfall just takes into account the Corps' historic mission of navigation and flood control and does not take into account some of the new directions that Congress has pushed the Corps in recent years. 
   It is wrong to give short shrift to important components of our nation's critical infrastructure. Flood control protects human lives and property; navigation projects ensure that our nation's economic engine continues to hum. 
   I think it is important to take a few minutes to review our ``critical water infrastructure'' and what it means in real terms to this country. 
   Our Nation's water resources infrastructure, developed over the past two centuries, has improved the quality of our lives and provided a foundation for the economic growth and development of this country. 
   Water supply systems, water treatment systems, flood protection projects, and water transportation systems all contribute to our national prosperity. 
   Our current economic expansion can be directly traced, at least in part, to investment decisions made by our forebears in this body to develop the nation's water resources. 
   They had the forethought to make these tough investment decisions and fortunately they are still paying dividends today. 
   The water infrastructure provided by the Army Corps alone provides an annual rate of return of approximately 26 percent. The stream of benefits are realized as flood damages prevented, reduced transportation costs, electricity, recreation, and water supply services. 
   Navigable channels provide an efficient and economic corridor for moving more than 2 billion tons of the Nation's domestic and foreign commerce. The value of this commerce is in excess of $660 billion. 
   Total jobs generated are about $13 million and Federal taxes generated by this commerce is estimated at nearly $150 billion. For every dollar invested to improve navigation infrastructure, U.S. Gross Domestic Product rises more than $3 dollars. 
   About 660 million of the 2.2 billion tons of cargo are moved on the nation's inland waterway system. That equates to 440,000 barges. 
   To move this cargo by alternative means would require an additional 17.6 million trucks on our nation's highway system or an additional 5.8 million rail cars on the nation's rail system. 
   That is a considerable amount of traffic to add to these overburdened systems. 
   The Army Corps manages 383 major lakes and reservoirs for flood control and has 8500 miles of levees in place. The flood protection provided by these structures, on average, prevents $20 billion in damages per year. That is a saving of $6 for every dollar invested in flood control projects. 
   Thousands of cities, towns and industries rely on the roughly 9.5 million acre feet of water supply storage from 116 lakes and reservoirs in the U.S. built by the Army Corps. 
   Army Corps owned and operated hydroelectric power plants produce enough electricity to supply almost 5 million homes with power. That is 24 percent of the total U.S. hydropower capacity of 3 percent of total U.S. electric capacity. Additionally, these plants annually return over half a billion dollars to the Federal Treasury. 
   Coastal projects protect almost 500 miles of our nation's critical eroding shoreline. 
   Over 30 percent of the recreation and tourism occurring on Federal lands takes place on Army Corps water resource projects. These visitors spend $10 billion annually on these recreational pursuits resulting in over 600,000 full and part-time jobs. 
   In addition to the direct benefits provided by this water infrastructure, substantial secondary or indirect economic benefits are realized. 
   I am also very familiar with the great work that the Bureau of Reclamation does for the 17 Western states, including mine. Its facilities include: 348 reservoirs providing 245 million acre-feet of water storage for municipal, rural and industrial uses to over 31 million people in the Western states. Irrigation water to 1 in every 5 western farmers for about 10 million acres of irrigated land. 
   Additionally, the Bureau is the second largest producer of hydroelectric power generating 40 billion kilowatt hours of energy each year from 58 powerplants. Its facilities also provide substantial flood control, recreation, and fish and wildlife benefits. 
   The great urbanization of the west could not be accomplished without  their management of scarce water resources. 
   Unfortunately, in recent years national investment has not kept pace with our level of economic and social expansion. 
   Public infrastructure investments including those for water resources infrastructure in 1960 amounted to 3.9 percent of the Gross Domestic Product. 
   Today the figure is more like 2.6 percent of the GDP. 
   That may not sound like much of a change, but let's look at the Army Corps during that period. 
   In the mid 1960s, the country was investing $4.5 billion annually in new water infrastructure, today it is less than $1.5 billion (measured in 1996 dollars). 
   Our water resources needs are no less today than they were 40 years ago. Yet we are investing one third as much. 
   One major impact of that reduction is the increasingly drawn out construction schedules forced by underfunding these projects. 
   These artificially lengthened schedules cause the loss of some $5 billion in annual benefits and increase the cost of these projects by some $500 million. 
   Failure to invest in maintenance, major rehabilitation, research and development, and new infrastructure has resulted in the gradual reduction in the value of our capital water resources stocks, and in turn the benefits we receive. 
   The value of the Army Corps' capital stock peaked in 1981 with a replacement value of $150 billion. Today its estimated value has decreased to $124 billion measured in 1995 dollars. 
   The Army Corps' estimates that their backlog for critical maintenance work is $400 million and is projected to grow by $100 million per year at current funding levels. 
   Our Nation's water infrastructure continues to perform as designed, but evidence of the need for reconstruction or modernization is becoming evident. 
   Some facilities have reached their capacity and some have reached the end of their design lives. New or shifting populations and growth have created unmet demands. 
   Finally, society's values are increasingly emphasizing sustainability and ecological considerations in water infrastructure management and development. 
   As you can see, I am one who firmly believes that investments in our nation's infrastructure more than pay for themselves through improved productivity and efficiency. To ignore these needs in the short term is going to cause us problems over the long haul. 
   Before I close today, I want to say some words of praise for the federal employees and contractors that populate the Departments, Agencies, and other organizations that are funded under this bill. 
   In the last year there has been a considerable amount of press and congressional attention surrounding issues such as security lapses at our National Labs and criticism of processes and procedures at the Army Corps. 
   From time to time we summons the political leadership of these organizations to the Hill to criticize, chide, or impress upon them the wisdom of our thinking. Often, it can be a pretty warm seat that we put them on. 
   None of that is to suggest that the Members of this body are anything other than respectful and proud of the hard work and accomplishments of our federal workforce, including contractors, lab employees, and others that make these important organizations run. 
   We expect a lot of you and, with very few exceptions, you live up to all of the expectations and demands that we impose on you. You serve your nation with distinction and we appreciate it. 
   I thank the Chairman, and the subcommittee staff for all of their hard work in getting us to this point. His team of Clay Sell, David Gwaltney, and LaShawnda Smith have been great to work with. On the minority staff, I want to say a word of thanks to Roger Cockrell, who is on detail from the Army Corps of Engineers office in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Liz Blevins of the subcommittee staff.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Brownback amendment. 
   The National Ignition Facility has become a shining example of how not to build large national facilities. 
   When this project was first proposed by the Department of Energy several years ago, DOE sold this project to me and other Members as a cornerstone of our nation's science-based Stockpile Stewardship program. 
   Leaders from DOE and the Lawrence Livermore National Lab came to me at a time when many Members of the Senate, including Chairman DOMENICI, were somewhat skeptical that NIF was actually needed. 
   They assured me that NIF was absolutely vital to national security and that it would be brought in on time and within budget. 
   Based on that, I came to bat for NIF and convinced many of my colleagues to support it. 
   I regret it. 
   In my estimation, DOE lied to me. 
   They sold me a bill of goods and I am not happy about it. 
   It is now several years later and the project is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. 
   The administration has undertaken a re-baselining activity in the last year that they believe will put this project back on a glidepath to completion. 
   Our subcommittee has provided (temporarily) $74.5 million for the project. The administration wants another $135 million this year and hundreds of millions of dollars more on top of the original baseline per year over the next 7 years to get this thing done (3-5 years late). 
   That is what they say now. By the time we are actually done, it will be billions. 
   Enough is enough. 
   There is plenty of skepticism in the scientific and national security community as to whether we will ever be able to get the information we need to certify our stockpile from NIF. 
   I believe there are other, cheaper ways to get this job done and I think it is time to go back to the drawing board and find a new path forward. 
   I cannot tell you how angry I am that DOE and all of the national labs consistently do this sort of thing to Congress: 
   They overpromise and under-deliver at a vastly inflated price. 
   I say, enough is enough. 
   This is nothing personal against Livermore. 
   If the next big thing at Los Alamos or Sandia runs dramatically over-budget I will be down here again to express my outrage. 
   I have been a Member of Congress and the Senate too long to watch as administration after administration comes up here to whisper sweet nothings in my ear and then jack up the price a year or two later. 
   Let me clear about one thing: I have nothing but respect for the thousands of men and women who populate our nation's weapons labs. 
   The scientists of Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, and Los Alamos are amongst the most brilliant, dedicated, patriotic and creative people on Earth. 
   The contributions they have made to our nation's national security are too numerous to count. 
   In recent years, I have had two Fellows from Lawrence Livermore, Larry Ferderber and Bob Perret, serve in my personal office. They both did exceptional work for me, for Nevada, and for our nation. They both served me very well for many years. 
   It is a shame that the highest levels of leadership at DOE and at Livermore have not served their employees and the American people with equal distinction. 
   Mr. President, I yield the Floor.

   Today is a day of solemnity in the Senate. We are going to swear in a new Senator as a result of the death of one of our colleagues. It is a day of reflection for all of us. Speaking for myself, and I am sure the Senator from Florida, every day we reflect on how fortunate we are to have someone who is a living example of the words that are engraved in the back of this Chamber: ``In God We Trust.'' He is someone to whom we all look --both the minority and majority--for ethical standards, for a sense of morality that he brings to this body.

   Mr. REID. Thank you for your hard work on this bill. This will provide the funding necessary for a strong military. I rise today to discuss one item contained in the Defense Appropriations Conference Report 
   The Conference Report includes language under Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense, National Guard Counterdrug Support directing that of the funding provided in the Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities account, $2,000,000 above the state allocation be provided to the Nevada National Guard to allow for the Counterdrug Reconnaissance and Interdiction Detachment unit in northern Nevada to expand operations to southern Nevada. 
   I would like to clarify that the funds for this project should be made available from the overall ``Drug Interdiction and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense account of $869,000,000 and not from the money allocated to the National Guard Counter-Drug support program, sometimes called the Governor's State Plan, which was also separately increased by $20,000,000 in the bill. I believe that this is reasonably clear from the language of the report, but I wanted to ensure there was no confusion. Is my description of the breakdown of the funding correct?

   Mr. REID. I respond to my friend from Massachusetts, that is true. We were promised. It was not a question that we would work on it. We were given every assurance that Haitians, Central Americans, people who lived under some of the most oppressive regimes in the history of their countries, would be granted the same privileges that the Cubans and Nicaraguans received. I was happy that the Cubans and Nicaraguans received basic fairness. 
   However, I say to my friend from Massachusetts, we are not asking for anything that is outlandish or new. This is the way America has been conducting its immigration policy since the birth of our republic. Is that not true?

   Mr. REID. No, it does not seem fair, I say to my friend from 
   Massachusetts. It does not seem any more fair than a story I will tell the Senator, which he has heard me tell before. It is a story that is embedded in my heart and which has prompted me to speak out on these issues. 
   Secretary Richardson and I visited a community center in Las Vegas. We were told to go in through the backdoor because there were people outside who were demonstrating. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, we decided that we would not going through the backdoor. 
   These people that were demonstrating were good American people who were there saying: I am married to someone from Mexico, or El Salvador, or Guatemala. They were saying: We have children who have been born in this country. They have taken my husband's work card away from him. He can no longer make payments on our house, our car. 
   Other people I talked to, they had lost their houses, they had been evicted from their homes, they had lost their jobs. And those jobs are not that easy to fill in Las Vegas. 
   I say to my friend, I believe that justice calls out for this. We hear terms such as ``fairness'' and ``social justice.'' Those terms are spoken on this floor a lot. But sometimes they are only words. To the people Bill Richardson and I met with in Las Vegas, however, these are more than words. These people, if the legislation we are trying to consider today was passed, would be able to have the satisfaction that their husbands or wives could go back to work, that their children would have parents who were legally employed, that they could live in their own home, and pay their taxes. 
   So I say to my friend from Massachusetts, who, I repeat, has been a leader on these issues for more than 30 years, that we not only have to do something about NACARA, which would give parity to Central Americans and Haitians, but also the legislation which I have introduced which would change the date of registry from 1972 to 1986. We have people here who have kids who have graduated from high school--American citizens. They are deporting the fathers and mothers of these children. 
   I would also say to my friend from Massachusetts that the date of registry has been in effect in this country for decades. Since 1929, we have changed the date of registry several times. I repeat, this isn't something we are doing that is unique or outlandish or bizarre. It is something that has been done for decades upon decades in this country.

   I went to a little place in rural Nevada a number of years ago called Smith Valley, a farming community in northwestern Nevada. After I gave my speech to the high school students, this very attractive, very bright-eyed young lady said: Senator, could I speak to you alone? I said: Sure. And this young lady proceeded to tell me what her family had gone through and how she, one of the top two or three kids in her graduating class, now could not go to college because she couldn't get loans because her parents' status needed to be readjusted. The story of Adriana is one of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of stories of unfairness faced by people in this country. 
   We in America pride ourselves on being fair. This is unfair. What we are doing to these people is un-American. These are people who are already American in many ways: They have spouses. They are families: a husband, a wife, a father, a mother who are American; many of the children are American citizens. In the process, somebody has been left out. We want to bring them in. We pride ourselves on doing everything we can to be family friendly. It would truly be family friendly to unite some of these immigrant families.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know the case of Norma. The Senator has again painted a very vivid picture. I personally have been acquainted with case after case out of my Las Vegas and Reno offices, the same kind of cases. We can change the name, but they are tragic stories. Remember, we are not saying grant citizenship to somebody who is not entitled to it. We are saying, don't send them back to the country they go to for a silly clerical revisit. We think the law should be that if they are eligible for citizenship, let them apply, and remain in the United States with their families and loved ones. 
   If we look at our own personal backgrounds, these issues become pretty personal. My father-in-law was born in Russia, my grandmother in England. People need to be treated fairly. Thank goodness my father-in-law and his family were able to work through the bureaucratic programs we have here in the United States and, as a result of that, my wife is an American citizen. 
   We are dealing with people's lives, people such as my father-in-law. All they wanted to do was come to America. They were oppressed in Russia.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would go one step beyond what my friend from Massachusetts has said. I call upon Governor George W. Bush, who goes around the country and even speaks in Spanish once in a while, talking about how compassionate he is, and how important the priorities of the Latino community are to him. I want him to speak out and say to my colleagues, the Republican leadership in the Congress, let's vote on these issues because they are about fairness. Let's take up and pass these reasonable provisions. If he is really compassionate, there is no area that deserves more compassion than what we are trying to do in this legislation. Not only do I call upon the Republican leadership to allow us to vote on these matters, I call upon the Republican nominee for President of the United States to speak out publicly. Is he for or against what we are trying to do?

   Mr. REID. The Vice President of the United States has put it in writing that he supports this. Vice President GORE put it in writing that he supports the provisions of the Latino and Immigrant Fairness Act. 
   I hope we can move forward with this legislation. There has been much talk about H-1B visa, and I believe that this legislation is very important. We live in a high-tech society. We want to move forward to try to meet our obligations. But let's not think we are going to lay over on these issues, which are issues of basic fairness, because of threats on the other side that we are not going to be able to do H-1B. Basic fairness dictates that we do both of them. And, we can if the Republicans would just allow us to move forward.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2869, the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act. Before addressing the substance of this legislation, I would like to thank and congratulate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH, as well as the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, for the outstanding, bipartisan efforts they have taken to produce the legislation we are considering today. I am well aware of the various difficulties and interests which had to be addressed, and I believe they did a fine job under such circumstances. 
   Mr. President, though modified and reduced in scope in order to secure its passage, S. 2869 is the most recent attempt by the Congress to protect the free exercise of religion. Prior to 1990, American courts had generally applied a strict scrutiny test to government actions that imposed substantial burdens on the exercise of religion. As my colleagues know, the strict scrutiny test is the highest standard the courts apply to actions on the part of government. However, in 1990, in Employment Division, Oregon Department of Human Resources, v. Smith, the United States Supreme Court largely eliminated the strict scrutiny test for free exercise cases. 
   Three years later, in direct response to the Smith decision, the 103rd Congress enacted the Religious Freedom and Restoration Act (RFRA), reapplying and extending the strict scrutiny test to all government actions, including those of state and local governments, that imposed substantial burdens on religious exercise. In 1997, the Supreme Court ruled, in City of Boerne, Texas v. Flores, that RFRA's coverage of state and local governments exceeded Congressional authority. 
   In response to the City of Boerne ruling, the Religious Liberty Protection Act (RLPA) was introduced during the 106th Congress. RLPA also reapplied a strict scrutiny standard to the actions of state and local governments with respect to religious exercise, but attempted to draw its authority from Congressional powers to attach conditions to federal funding programs and to regulate commerce. While the companion measure passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly in July 1999, the legislation stalled in the Senate when legitimate concerns were raised that RLPA, as drafted, would supersede certain civil rights, particularly in areas relating to employment and housing. These concerns were most troubling to the gay and lesbian community. Discrimination based upon race, national origin, and to lesser certainty, gender, would have been protected, regardless of RLPA, because the courts have recognized that preventing such discrimination is a sufficient enough compelling government interest to overcome the strict scrutiny standard that RLPA would apply to religious exercise. Sexual orientation and disability discrimination, however, have not been afforded this high level of protection. 
   Mr. President, as I was considering the merits of the Religious Liberty Protection Act, these concerns weighted heavily upon my mind. I say that because I was a proud supporter of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which we passed overwhelmingly during the 103rd Congress only to see the Supreme Court strike it down. I was, and remain, particularly supportive of the Land use provisions contained within RFRA, and RLPA, and which constitute the first of the two major sections contained within the 
   Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act which we are considering today. As my colleagues may know, land use decisions are extremely important to many of the religious organizations which have joined together in the effort to get this legislation passed and signed into law. With some affiliations, legislation affecting land use decisions are the most important aspects of protecting the free exercise of religion. This is especially true for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. Under current law, the LDS Church maintains serious reservations about non-uniform zoning regulations throughout the country which, though religiously-neutral on their face, have the effect of overly-restricting the size and location, among other things, of churches and temples. Often times, such regulations simply prohibit the construction of any church or temple. Under the legislation which Senators Hatch and Kennedy have crafted, the strict scrutiny test contained within RLPA would apply to land use decisions. In other words, state and local zoning boards would be required to use the least restrictive means possible to advance a compelling state interest. I recognize that this is a high standard to meet, certainly much higher than current law, where zoning regulations are rarely overturned in court on religious exercise grounds. However, I also believe that the free exercise of religion deserves, in fact demands, such a high level of protection. 
   As I stated earlier, protecting hard-fought civil rights, including those which prohibit discrimination based upon sexual orientation, played an important role in my desire to pursue a more narrowly-tailored religious freedom measure. I am proud to have had the opportunity to work with Senators Hatch and Kennedy to accomplish the worthwhile endeavor of protecting legitimate civil rights while at the same time protecting the free exercise of religion involving land use decisions. 
   While the first section of S. 2869 focuses upon land use, the second concerns the free exercise of religion as applied to institutionalized persons, i.e., prisoners. As my colleagues are well aware, in 1993, during the consideration of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, I offered an amendment on the Senate floor that would have prohibited the applicability of RFRA to incarcerated individuals. I offered  that amendment for a variety of reasons, not the least of which was my belief, one that I continue to hold, that prisoners in this country have become entirely too litigious. Frivolous lawsuits seem to be the norm, not the exception to the rule. In 1993, more than 1,400 more lawsuits were filed by federal prisoners against the government, whether it was corrections officers, prison wardens, attorneys general, etc., than were filed by the government against criminals. That unbelievable situation within our federal judicial system, coupled with the high costs that my home State of Nevada was incurring defending frivolous prisoner lawsuits, led me to offer the amendment which would have prohibited the applicability of RFRA to prisoners. Regrettably, that effort failed. However, I remained a proud supporter of the underlying legislation. 
   Seven years later, I am faced with a similar set of circumstances. I support the underlying legislation which protects the free exercise of religion as applied to land use decisions, but I remain concerned that the applicability of the strict scrutiny standard to religious exercise within our federal, state and local prisons will encourage prisoners, and the courts, to second guess the decisions of our corrections employees and other prison officials. Furthermore, I have been contacted by many corrections officers and by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, AFSCME, which represents more than 60,000 dedicated men and women who are on the front line in our nation's prisons. They have legitimate concerns about what impact this legislation may have on prison security. 
   A number of corrections officers have contacted me to relay their own personal experiences. These dedicated men and women have real concerns. In fact, AFSCME recently alerted their corrections officer membership that this legislation was coming up for a vote, and was deluged with phone calls from members expressing their distress about how this bill might affect their ability to maintain security and protect the safety of the public. As you can well imagine, getting inmates to comply with security measures in prison is no easy task. Many prisoners will use any excuse to avoid searches and to evade security measures instituted to protect prison personnel and the general public from harm. 
   While I continue to believe that we should not extend the privilege of a strict scrutiny standard to restrictions on the free exercise of religion behind the bars of our nation's prisons, I also recognize certain realities. The Prison Litigation Reform Act, PLRA, which we passed during the 104th Congress, has led many Senators to believe that my amendment is no longer necessary. I disagree with this conclusion given that PLRA applied to RFRA from April 1996, through June 1997, and there was no perceivable reduction in the number of prisoner RFRA lawsuits, or their corresponding burden. Furthermore, with specific regard to corrections employees, even when cases are screened and dismissed under the provisions of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, those lawsuits still show up on the public record, making it much more difficult for corrections employees who have been sued to obtain mortgages and car loans. 
   Mr. President, rather than offer an amendment to strike the provisions of S. 2869 relating to Institutionalized Persons and risk the certainty that this legislation would fail this year, I have decided, in consultation with the managers of this legislation, to pursue a different approach. My distinguished colleague from Utah, the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has agreed to hold a hearing next year on the impact of this legislation on our nation's penal institutions and their dedicated employees. I am hopeful that this will provide the opportunity for corrections administrators and other personnel to air their concerns about how this legislation may affect security in these institutions. I would also expect several Attorneys General, including the Nevada State Attorney General who has made limiting frivolous prisoner lawsuits a priority in my home State, to express their opinions. I look forward to this debate, and I would offer my personal gratitude to Chairman HATCH for the commitment. 
   I also plan on joining with Senator HATCH to request that the General Accounting Office conduct a detailed study as to what effects the Religious Freedom Restoration Act had on our nation's prisons, both before, during and after the application of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, and what effects, at the appropriate time, this legislation will have. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, while I retain serious reservations about the inclusion of prisoners in S. 2869, I commend Senators HATCH and KENNEDY for diligently working in a bipartisan fashion to craft a narrowly-tailored religious freedom protection measure that will pass this Senate.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Fletcher School of Law & Diplomacy was created in 1933, to be administered jointly by Tufts University and Harvard University, to offer a broad program of professional education in international affairs to a select group of graduate students, who desired to pursue careers in the U.S. State Department, the United Nations, and other public and private entities, organizations, and agencies that are involved in various aspects of international affairs: and 
   The Class of 1965 of said Fletcher School is celebrating its 35th reunion on August 19, 2000, to commemorate the achievements of members of that class. The members of the 1965 class have served with distinction in promoting world peace and harmony and working in many different places around the world, in a variety of professional, business, and public service positions to promote: freedom through international cooperation and effective defense policies; prosperity by means of international trade; democracy in new and developing nations by helping people understand how to build socially responsible societies based on democratic principles; and justice through the promotion of a better global understanding of the destiny of humankind to live in freedom from fear, hunger, want, and disease; and 
   Many in the Class of 1965 have served both in the U.S. Foreign Service, as well as in various positions in the U.S. Congress; and others have served in a variety of capacities in federal and state agencies, helping the United States to fulfill its role of leadership and responsibility in the world community. 
   I commend the Class of 1965 for the achievements and contributions that its members have made to promote better understanding among the people of the world and to bring hope to those who seek a better life for all the world's citizens. The United States Senate congratulates the class of 1965 of Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy on its 35th reunion and conveys best wishes to its members for good health, prosperity, and much happiness in the years to come.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to say to my friend from Utah, for whom I have the highest regard, he is a great Senator. I have personal feelings toward him that he understands. But I want to just say a couple of things before we settle this little bit here. 
   I served under George Mitchell. Never did Senator Mitchell prevent the minority from offering amendments. That is our biggest complaint in this body--that the majority will not allow the minority to offer amendments. We believe the Senate should be treated as it has for over 200 years. If that were the case, we wouldn't be in the situation we are in now. 
   I also say to my friend that the percentage on the judges doesn't work because we are dealing with a larger number. Of course, if you have a larger number of judges, which has occurred since President Reagan was President, you could have a smaller percentage. That means a lot more judges. As we know, you can prove anything with numbers. 
   I also say that one of the problems we have with judges is my friend from Michigan has one judge who has waited 1,300 days. That is much shorter than the 2 years my friend talked about in regards to the Banking Committee. In fact, I think the majority is protesting too much. 
   I withdraw my objection.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1993, one of the most interesting times in my legislative career was when we in this Chamber voted on President Clinton's deficit reduction plan. It was a historic vote. 
   As the Presiding Officer will remember, the bill passed the House of Representatives by a single vote without a single Republican voting for the President's plan. It came to the Senate and ended up in a tie vote, and the Vice President of the United States, AL GORE, broke the tie. It was a very difficult vote for everyone. In the Senate, as in the House, not a single Republican voted for the budget plan. 
   There were people on the other side of the aisle who told of all the calamities that would take place in the country if that passed. Seven years ago, this is what we heard from the other side of the aisle, Senate Republicans, from then-Representative WAYNE ALLARD:  
   In summary, the plan has a fatal flaw--it does not reduce the deficit.  
   Of course, it has reduced the deficit from some $300 billion a year to where we now have a surplus. 
   Senator CONRAD BURNS:  
   So we are still going to pile up some more debt, but most of all, we are going to cost jobs in this country.  
   What the Senator from Montana said, in truth and in fact, was wrong. In fact, over 20 million new jobs have been created; over 60 percent of those jobs are high-wage jobs. Contrary to what the Senator from Montana said, we didn't pile up more debt. We have reduced the debt. We have not only cut down the annual yearly deficit, we have actually paid down the debt--not enough, in my estimation, but we have begun to pay down the debt. 
   Senator HATCH of Utah said:  
   Make no mistake, these higher rates will cost jobs.  
   Again, not true. 
   Senator PHIL GRAMM of Texas on August 5, 1993, on the Senate floor:  
   I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the deficit four years from today will be higher than it is today and not lower. ..... When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   Everything he predicted is the direct opposite. The economy didn't get weaker; it got stronger. The deficit isn't higher; it is lower. Americans aren't paying more taxes; they are paying less taxes. He said, ``The economy will create fewer jobs.'' Of course, as I have indicated, it created more jobs. ``Government will spend more money.'' The fact is, the Federal Government today has 300,000 fewer Federal employees than it had when this statement was made by Senator GRAMM. We have a Federal Government today that is smaller than when President Kennedy was President. 
   He went on to say in September of 1993:  
   ..... [T]his program is going to make the economy weaker. ..... Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a result of this program.  
   Wrong, absolutely wrong; not even close. The program the President asked us to vote for, and we did, made the economy stronger. We have had the lowest inflation, the lowest unemployment in more than 40 years. There had been economic growth as high in the past but never any higher than we have had. We hold the record for the longest period of economic growth in the history of this country.

Senator HARKIN from Iowa has had a judge pending who already had a hearing. We also believe we have some appropriations bills that need to move forward, and there are some strings on that.

   This legislation has received the following comments from respected publications from around the country. George F. Will:  
   Congress now is contemplating a measure that sets some sort of indoor record for missing the point.  
   Sports Illustrated columnist Rick Reilly:  
   In fact, passing the bill would be like trying to stop a statewide flood in Oklahoma by fixing a leaking faucet in Enid. Nevada handles only 1 percent of the action on college sports. Not that bookies and the mob wouldn't very much like to get their hands on that 1 percent.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my mind has been reflecting on the fact that now would be the time Senator Coverdell would come in. When we would have a real problem, he would wander in and help bring everything together. As we know, that will not be the case. We attended Paul's funeral on Saturday, and he is not here to help with the problems we are having here. 
   Let me just say to my friend, Senator DOMENICI, for whom I have the greatest respect, he is someone in this body who has great power. He is chairman of the Budget Committee, one of the senior members of the Appropriations Committee. He is chairman of the Energy and Water Subcommittee, and he is someone with whom I have had the pleasure of working for my entire time here in the Senate--on a very close basis in recent years on Energy and Water. He has been chairman and I am the ranking member. It has been our bill. He is right. The chairman always has, as we know, a little more latitude, as he should have. But I have had input on the bill, and I feel very comfortable with the bill we have. 
   I say to my friend from New Mexico, for whom I have the greatest respect, we have a problem with this bill that could be resolved just like that. The fact of the matter is that no one is compelling me. We are all free agents in the Senate, and we have that right. We are elected in our home States, and while Senators are very persuasive in helping us and trying to get us to go along with what they want, no one compels us to do things, and they should not. In spite of the fact that this is a good bill, I think it could be made better. I will not go into detail, but I will explain the problems we have. 
   We have two leaders in the Senate, Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE. They both do tremendously good work under very difficult circumstances. An overused saying is that they both have a job of herding cats, trying to put jello in a bowl that doesn't have sides. They have a lot of problems, and we understand that. Very rarely in legislative matters do we have one of the leaders step forward. 
   The measure we have before us, the energy and water bill, is very important to this leader. There is a provision in it that is extremely bad for the upper Missouri basin States. One of those States, of course, is South Dakota. My friend from New Mexico stated--and rightfully so--that the provision is causing problems in the upper basin States not only to the minority leader, but it has been in the bill two times, on two different bills. Of course it has. But the fact is that it was meaningless in the bills initially because what this is all about is the Fish and Wildlife Service rewriting a manual, reissuing and having a new manual. It was first issued before World War II ended, in the early 1940s. They did a little revision in the 1970s--minor revisions. So for almost 60 years they have had the same manual. They have decided to rewrite it, and they are ready to publish this new manual. What this legislation does is prevent them from doing so. 
   Well, the fact of the matter is that is wrong; it is bad. The legislature should allow the administrative body to go forward and do their thing to control the Missouri River. The administrative agency is prevented from doing that. What Senator DASCHLE and others have said is: Take that provision out of the bill, and when that is taken out of the bill, we will 
   move forward on the legislation. This is a bill involving $23 billion, a very important bill. But this provision is something that should not prevent this bill from going forward. It should be removed from the bill, and there are all kinds of different steps. We are going to have conferences on this bill. We are going to revisit it at that time. 
   Let me also say that the history of the Senate is such that the interest of the minority is always protected. We talk about this great country of ours and we brag about our country, and we should do so. It is an imperfect country, but the best set of rules ever devised to rule the affairs of men and women comes from the U.S. Constitution. 
   What is the Constitution all about? The Constitution is not about protecting the rights of the majority; it is about protecting the rights of the minority. Where are those rights protected in our constitutional framework more than any other place? It is in the Senate. That is why the small State of Nevada has as much right to do things in this Senate--Senators REID and BRYAN--as do Senators MOYNIHAN and SCHUMER from New York, or BOXER and FEINSTEIN from California, even though they have millions and millions more people than we have in the State of Nevada. That is what the Senate is all about. What Senator DASCHLE and others are trying to do with this bill is nothing that hasn't been done in centuries past, decades past. 
   So I say to my friend from New Mexico, take that out and we will move forward with this legislation and then deal with a few controversial issues. We don't have many controversial issues. This is a very good bill, and I think we can finish it in a day. 
   Let me also say this. We believe there should be certain rights protected. Also under this Constitution, we have a situation that was developed by our Founding Fathers in which Senators would give the executive branch--the President--recommendations for people to serve in the judiciary. Once these recommendations were given, the President would send the names back to the Senate and we would confirm or approve those names. 
   One of the problems we are having here is it is very difficult to get people approved, confirmed. We have one Senator from the State of Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, who for 1,300 days has been waiting to have a hearing for a very qualified, competent woman who wants to be confirmed and whose name has been sent to the White House by Senator LEVIN. 
   He wants a simple hearing before the Judiciary Committee. Senator HARKIN from Iowa is also waiting for a nominee to be reported out of the committee. We think that should be done. This has nothing to do with the energy and water bill. It does, however, have something to do with the other bills. We could have moved forward on the energy and water bill on Friday until this glitch came up. 
   There is lots and lots of work to do around here. We believe it would be extremely and vitally important to move the provision that allows the Fish and Wildlife Service to publish its manual, and not have a legislative roadblock for the management of the rivers in an appropriate fashion. The Fish and Wildlife Service is not for the upper basin States or against the lower basin States. They try to be an impartial ruler. That is what they are trying to do. 
   I say to my friend: Let the Fish and Wildlife Service go ahead and do what they need to do and get the energy and water bill brought before this body. 
   Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Vermont leaves, let me say a few things. In this body, we tend not to give the accolades to our fellow Senators that we should. I want the Senator from Vermont to know how the entire Democratic caucus supports and follows the lead of this man on matters related to the judiciary. He has done an outstanding job leading the Democratic conference through this wide-ranging jurisdictional authority of the Judiciary Committee. 
   We are very proud of the work that PAT LEAHY does. The people of Vermont should know that, first of all, he is always looking after the people of Vermont. I am from a State 3,000 miles away from Vermont, the State of Nevada. People in Nevada should, every day, be thankful for the work the Senator does, not only for the State of Vermont but for the country. 
   I want the RECORD to be spread with the fact that we in the minority are so grateful for the work the Senator from Vermont does for our country. The statement made today certainly outlines many of the problems we are having in the Senate, none of which are caused by the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I say to my friend, the majority leader, on the minority side we also want to move on. We think there is a lot of work that could be done and should be done. For example, on Friday, with the energy and water appropriations bill, there was a provision in there that is very objectionable to a number of people on this side of the aisle, not the least of whom is the minority leader. The minority leader said take that out; it can be dealt with in conference. We think that is the case. 
   That is my bill. It is a very important bill, almost $23 billion. All of this money is discretionary money. It is a very important appropriation bill on which Senator DOMENICI and I have worked. We wish we could move that forward. We think it should move forward. 
   I also say to my friend, the majority leader, I think it is unfortunate that we have been unable today to deal with Senator HATCH. I understand there is a big celebration in Utah, Pioneer Day, on July 24, and he is committed to be there. I hope this evening or tomorrow we can sit down and talk. For example, I believe the judge's name is White, a Michigan judge, who has been before the committee and has not had a hearing; the nomination had been sent to the committee almost 1,200 days ago. In meeting with Senator HATCH and learning what his problems are, we will try to be as understanding as we can of his problems. I hope he will be as understanding of our problems as we are of his. 
   Senator DASCHLE and I said this on Thursday: We appreciate very much the work the majority leader has done. As powerful as he is, he still cannot overrule all the committee chairmen. They are here by virtue of their seniority. It makes it very tough to do that. We want to work to move this along. We believe the energy and water bill could move in a day or a day and a half. 
   Treasury-Postal: We don't believe that is a difficult bill. There are a couple touchy issues on that, but we believe we could work with the majority and move that along. We don't want it to appear that we are trying to hold things up. I think we have a pretty good record the past month or so of working with the leader. 
   In short, we hope in the meeting with Senator HATCH, either tonight or tomorrow, we will be in a position where we can expedite the rest of the work this week and move on to other things.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, before the leader leaves the floor, I want to say very quickly--and we need not discuss the issue of judges--this Senate really did well last week. Around the country, there were a series of editorials that were supportive of what the Senate did regarding the appellate judge; they were all positive for the majority and minority. That was a good move. 
   One reason, as I indicated, is that one of the Senators is upset because his judge is taking some 1,200 days before a hearing. Also, we recognize that the number of judges approved, while we have done quite well in the last few weeks, is still way behind what it should be. 
   I wanted to direct a question to the majority leader. Are we still going to have a vote at 6 o'clock? We are getting telephone calls in both Cloakrooms.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Kansas, if I could just have 2 minutes to respond to my friend, because I have a dual role as not only whip but also I am ranking member on the subcommittee, I say to my friend, I think the proposal the minority leader has made is eminently fair: This provision should be taken out, that there will not be an amendment offered on the floor, and whatever took place in conference he would be willing to live with. 
   I am not going to go through the merits of the case. I think there is significant merit on the side of the minority leader. Basically, sure, this provision has been in the appropriations bill before, but it has had no impact on the upper basin States. Now it does, because the Corps of Engineers is at a point where they want to change the manual to determine how the river is going to operate. 
   What this bill says is there can be no funds spent to change the manual. That is how the flow of the river is going to be impacted. We should leave this to bureaucrats. It should not be done, preventing money from going to change how the river is operated. 
   This is something that, as indicated by my friend from Missouri, we can debate at a subsequent time. But the bill will not be brought up until this provision is out of the bill. 
   We can, during the process of the bill, and before it gets to conference, decide what to do with it. This provision is unfair to the upper basin States. There should not be a provision preventing administrative agencies of this Government from spending money as to how that river system should be operated.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution which would designate November 18, 2000 as ``National Survivors of Suicide Day.'' The term ``survivor'' refers to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide. As such, having lost my father to suicide in 1972, I am viewed as a survivor in the suicide prevention community. Nationally, more than 30,000 people take their own lives each year. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and the third major cause of death among people aged 15-19. 
   The suicide rate among young people has more than tripled in the last four decades. Today in our country, countless suicide survivors go on with their lives, many of them grieving in a very private way. This is because there still remains a stigma towards those who take their own life as well as those who are left behind to cope with the suicide of a loved one. I can't begin to tell you how many survivors have written me expressing the shame and guilt they feel about their loved one's suicide, many of whom are still unable to deal honestly with the tragic conditions which ultimately led to someone they love taking their own life. 
   I am pleased that this resolution passed the Senate by unanimous consent last year. Since then, there has been a fervor of activity and collaboration in both the federal and private sectors around suicide prevention. Most recently, the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Subcommittee dedicated a hearing to suicide awareness and prevention. Among those who testified were Surgeon General Dr. David Satcher, National Institute of Mental Health Director Dr. Steve E. Hyman, psychologist and author Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, and novelist Danielle Steele. 
   While we have taken some important first steps, we still have a long way to go in the area of suicide prevention and awareness. It is my intent to recognize the countless survivors who all are at various stages of healing in addressing the loss of their loved one to suicide. I ask you to support me in turning their grief into hope, a hope that with acceptance and understanding, can lead our nation in effectively addressing this very preventable public health challenge.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution which would designate December 10, 2000 as ``National Children's Memorial Day.'' I am pleased that Senators EDWARDS, ABRAHAM, AKAKA, BAUCUS, BAYH, BENNETT, BRYAN, CLELAND, COCHRAN, CRAIG, DODD, DORGAN, FEINSTEIN, HELMS, HOLLINGS, INHOFE, JOHNSON, KERREY, KOHL, LANDRIEU, LAUTENBERG, LINCOLN, MURRAY, ROBB, SARBANES, and VOINOVICH are joining me as original cosponsors. The resolution would set aside this day to remember all the children who die in the United States each year. While I realize the families of these children deal with the grief of their loss every day, I would like to commemorate the lives of these children with a special day as well. 
   If passed, this will be the third consecutive year we will have designated the second Sunday in December as ``National Children's Memorial Day.'' I have had many constituents share their heart-wrenching stories with me about the death of their son or daughter. I have heard heroic stories of kids battling cancer or diabetes, and tragic stories of car accidents and drownings. Each of these families has had their own experience, but they must all continue with their lives and deal with the incredible pain of losing a child. 
   The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a family. By establishing a day to remember children that have passed away, bereaved families from all over the country will be encouraged and supported in the positive resolution of their grief. It is important to families who have suffered such a loss to know that they are  not alone. To commemorate the lives of these children with a special day would pay them an honor and would help to bring comfort to the hearts of their bereaved families.

He checked with the minority and there is nobody on the minority side who wishes to speak tonight. The Senator will be here in the morning to lead the debate for the minority on the marriage tax issue. I wanted the RECORD to be clear because my friend, Senator ROTH, indicated that the ranking member would be here. He was here and he checked to see if anybody on our side wished to speak and nobody did. So he has departed from the Chamber.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished citizen of Nevada, Joseph M. Gatt. Mr. Gatt's vision and innovation paved the way for millions of Americans to be able to secure a comfortable retirement. Nearly twenty-five years ago, he was instrumental in developing the prototype that was used for what ultimately became the 401(k) pension program. 
   Mr. Gatt has been a resident of Las Vegas, Nevada for almost forty years and was a pioneer in the field of financial planning. He worked as the Las Vegas agent for the Hartford Insurance Company when he initiated the new pension program for the benefits of the employees of the then MGM Grand Hotel in Las Vegas. The key to the program was the utilization of an existing IRA program on a joint funding basis; that is, with contributions from both the employer and the employees, which had never been done before. The incentive to the employee to contribute to the program was, of course, that the contribution was tax deductible. The Hartford program was so unique that it was necessary for the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to approve it. On August 25, 1976, the IRS gave final approval for the Hartford program, and it went into effect immediately. Features of this pension plan included portability, 100 percent vesting whether or not the employees remained at MGM Grand, and  generous company contibutions. Indeed, Mr. Gatt and the MGM Grand were ahead of their time. 
   The Las Vegas resorts of Caesar's Place and Circus Circus Hotels soon followed suit. Today, 401(k) plans are an almost standard part of benefit packages for employees. According to Cerrulli & Associaties, a marketing and research firm, there were 330,000 401(k) plans in the United States during the last quarter of 1999 in which $2.7 trillion were invested. The creation of this now universally accepted and acclaimed program is a considerable credit to the State of Nevada, the gaming industry for being the first employer participants, and Joe Gatt for his insight and vision. On behalf of the citizens of Nevada and all Americans, I congratulate Mr. Gatt on this achievement and wish him continued success.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I learned shortly before Senator LOTT came to the floor last night that Senator COVERDELL had passed away. I felt it was in my best interest to leave at that time and not be present on the floor, as I usually am. 
   It was unique, in that I am in the minority--Senator COVERDELL was in the majority--that I got to know him as well as I did. I always knew that things were moving along and that we were going to get legislation completed when I would look over and Senator COVERDELL had been called into the Chamber by Senator LOTT to help move legislation. 
   As I look back, I remember the bankruptcy legislation. We started out with a little over 300 amendments on that legislation. Everyone thought it was futile to even try to pass it, but, of course, Senator COVERDELL came in and worked with me and the Senators on his side and my side, and we were able to get that legislation cleared and basically completed. That was the story for many, many different pieces of legislation. 
   I got to know him. He was very calm and deliberate and extremely courteous and polite--a real gentleman. I think it speaks volumes to recognize that Senator LOTT's No. 1 person he called on when there was trouble on the floor was PAUL COVERDELL. I think it speaks volumes to indicate that Governor Bush's No. 1 person in the Senate was PAUL COVERDELL. 
   He was someone that the people of Georgia will miss, this country will miss, the Senate will miss. I personally will miss him. 
   I have the honor of working on the minority side to help move legislation along. I personally will miss him. He was very, very good at being a legislator, in addition, obviously, to being such a good friend to everyone.  
   I express my sympathy to Nancy and his staff. Speaking for the entire minority, we will miss a great legislator.

These standards are essential to ensuring continued progress in producing safer products by reducing these pathogen levels in meat and poultry products. They are an important part of the new meat and poultry inspection system adopted in 1996. 
   This amendment only clarifies USDA's authority to enforce pathogen standards. It will not codify existing salmonella performance standards.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, also in the form of a question, I hope that he has the opportunity to finish his description here of what the difference is between the two approaches. I also say to my friend, this issue is not over. People can yell and scream and declare victory, but in our Government, I think the Senator would agree, we have something called the Constitution. This tiny little document here establishes three separate but equal branches of Government. One of those branches of Government is called the executive branch. He is going to veto this and then it is going to come back. Then the legislative branch is going to sustain that veto. 
   Then they will have an opportunity, if they in good faith want to do something to help remove this marriage penalty tax, to work with the administration and the Democrats and come up with a compromise that would give true marriage penalty tax relief. In fact, what it would do is, instead of taking away three of the references where there is a penalty in our Tax Code, it would take care of all 67. Am I right, I say to my friend from Illinois?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Air Travelers' Fair Treatment Act of 2000. 
   Air travel is an increasingly unpleasant and stressful experience. Anyone who flies much at all knows that airports are crowded, flights too often delayed or canceled without explanation, ticket prices are unpredictable and hard to figure out, passengers are more unruly and occasionally violent. 
   Monday's edition of the Washington Post included a front-page story reporting that delays and cancellations are at an all-time high. According to Time Magazine, the number of air-rage incidents reported by flight crews from 66 in 1997, to 534 last year. It doesn't take a great leap of faith to see a relationship between the two. 
   Last year, Congress passed my ``air rage'' bill that increased penalties on passengers who commit acts that threaten the health or safety of other passengers or jeopardize the safety of the flight. That was a good bill, that I think will help passengers and airlines alike to reduce the amount of stress associated with flying. 
   But punishing unruly passengers is only half of the solution, because unruly passengers are not the only source of stress in air travel. Air rage is not only a cause, but a symptom, of stress. 
   The airlines have cut corners in recent years in ways that make traveling by air more and more difficult and unpleasant for customers. 
   A few weeks ago, the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation released a study on the performance of the airline industry. According to the study: 
   Through the first four months of this year, the number of passenger complaints to the Department has increased a whopping 74 percent compared to last year. 
   Complaints about delays, cancellations, and missed connections were up 115 percent since last year--in other words, they have more than doubled in only one year. 
   And even these numbers may be low, because the Inspector General estimates that the airlines receive anywhere from 100 to 400 complaints for every one that is filed with the government. 
   Last fall, the airlines announced that they would voluntarily implement their own reforms. They made a great show of implementing their ``12 Commandments for Customer Service'' last fall. 
   But this study reveals that things have become worse, not better. The study cites numerous instances where the airlines have violated their own so-called ``Commandments.'' 
   For example, one of these so-called Commandments is to notify customers about delays and cancellations. The Transportation Department's report indicated that airlines were, in fact, making an effort to communicate delays and cancellations--but that the information communicated was, to quote the Inspector General, ``frequently inaccurate, incomplete or unreliable.'' 
   Airlines are often poorly equipped to handle in-flight emergencies--some carriers have virtually no first-air or medical equipment on their flights, and the amount of first-aid training that flight crews received varies widely from carrier to carrier. 
   And airlines ticket prices are still confusing and arbitrary. Some carriers have enacted rules that prohibit customers from combining legs of different tickets to get the best prices. 
   Now, there are some explanations for the decline in service and the increase in the number of complaints. Last year, the airlines carried a total of 635 million passengers, a record number, double the number of passengers 20 years ago. The average load factor--which refers to the percentage of passengers compared to available seats--is 71 percent, also a record. 
   But crowded airports are no excuse for airlines to violate their own so-called Commandments for Customer Service. 
   It's no excuse for providing misleading or inaccurate explanations of delays or cancellations to air travelers. People make plans around posted flight schedules, important personal or business plans. If a flight is canceled or delayed, they should be able to find out what's going on, so that they can make alternative plans if they need to. 
   The bill I am introducing today will address some of these concerns. 
   The bill has seven provisions.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, before my friend leaves the floor, I want to tell him how very much I appreciate his statement. In years past, I offered amendments when we did not have a budget surplus to increase funding for our park system. I hope next year we can work together in a bipartisan fashion to increase significantly the funding for our National Park System. 
   I have not had the good fortune to be in the park to which the Senator referred, the Great Smoky Mountain National Park, but I have been to a number of national parks. For example, the living conditions our park rangers have to put up with in our national parks is a disgrace. My colleague should see what park rangers live in at the Grand Canyon National Park. They are from World War II. They look like icehouses; they are square. It is disgraceful. 
   We only have one national park in Nevada. It is one of the newer ones, so I really do not have the right to complain as many do, but we have so many things that need to be done there. We do not have a visitors center. Interpretive trails have not been built. There are parts of our great National Park System that we have closed as a result of dangerous conditions. The Park Service simply does not have the resources to keep up. 
   I commend and applaud my friend from Tennessee. He has given a great statement. I look forward to next year. Perhaps we can work together to come up with a funding formula that would be permanent in nature to take care of the $5 billion backlog in our National Park System.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Environmental Protection Agency has issued proposed regulations governing the emissions of snowmobiles in our National Park System. It is very clear that these vehicles cause big problems. Why do I say that? A single snowmobile belches out the same pollution that 20 automobiles do. One snowmobile equals the pollution of 20 passenger cars. 
   Also, my friend from Tennessee earlier talked about the air pollution in the Great Smoky Mountains because of coal-fired generating plants in that area. There isn't much that can be done, at this stage at least, to stop those longstanding power producers from generating the emissions they do. But there is something we can do to stop air pollution from developing as it has in our National Park System. 
   It is a national disgrace that the levels of toxic pollution, such as carbon monoxide--in Yellowstone National Park, to pick just one--rival major urban centers such as Los Angeles and Denver. I repeat, it is a national disgrace that levels of toxic pollutants such as carbon monoxide, in our national parks--especially Yellowstone--at times, rival major urban centers such as Los Angeles and Denver. That is significant. 
   But what is being proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency is nothing that is going to eliminate snowmobiling in our country. 
   For example, of the more than 130,000 miles of designated snowmobile trails in the United States, less than 1,000 of those miles are in national parks--to be exact, there are 600 miles. So this furor, and the offering of this amendment, to eliminate this proposal to stop the air pollution of snowmobiles in national parks is really a red herring. There are other places you can ride snowmobiles. In fact, you can ride them over 129,000 miles in the United States alone. We need not ride them this 600 miles in national parks. 
   Appropriate access to national parks is important, but such access does not include all forms of transportation at all times. Protecting parks from air, water, and noise pollution, for the enjoyment of all Americans, should be our No. 1 goal. 
   I am very happy that the Senator from Tennessee spoke earlier about how important national parks are. I agree with him. We are the envy of the rest of the world with our national parks. 
   Yosemite, Great Basin National Park, Yellowstone National Park--these wonderful gems of nature, that we are attempting to preserve, need to be preserved. 
   The amendment would prohibit the Park Service from doing its job to protect some of America's most awe-inspiring national treasures. The landscape of our national parks should reflect the wonders of our Creator, which I think we have an obligation to protect. National parks do not need to serve as racetracks for noisy, high-polluting snow machines. 
   The State of Nevada shares Lake Tahoe with California. We wish we had all of Lake Tahoe, but we do not mind sharing it with California. It is a wonderful, beautiful lake. There is only one other lake like it in the world, and that is Lake Bakal in the former Soviet Union, now Russia, an alpine glacial lake. Lake Tahoe it is very deep--not as deep as Lake Bakal, which is over 5,000 feet deep, but very deep. It was only 35 years ago they found the bottom of Lake Tahoe. It is extremely cold. It is beautiful. It is emerald colored. 
   But one of the things contributing to the ruination of Lake Tahoe is two-stroke engines. They were outlawed last year. I am glad they were outlawed. People may complain: What are we going to do for recreation? 
   There are plenty of things to do for recreation without these two-stroke engines. They are gone now. The lake is less polluted. It sounds better. Two-stroke engines are also the engines that snowmobiles use. They have been outlawed at Lake Tahoe. Why? Because they are inefficient, highly polluting, and contribute disproportionately to the decline of the lake's legendary clarity and degradation of its water quality. 
   Our national parks deserve similar protection from the pollution produced by these snow machines. 
   In sum, the use of snowmobiles currently prevents adequate protection of air and water quality for wildlife. Damage is being done to national parks not some time in the future but right now. The unnecessary delay caused by this amendment would allow further damage to our parks. 
   Congress should allow individual parks that currently allow snowmobiling to go through a public comment process to determine what course of action is appropriate. This amendment would eliminate that. 
   EPA agrees that the Park Service has the primary and immediate duty to take action to protect parks from snowmobile impacts. In comments on the draft EIS for winter use at Yellowstone, EPA said:  
   We encourage the National Park Service to take the steps necessary to protect human health and the environment immediately rather than to depend on future regulations of off-highway vehicle engines from EPA.  
   They are saying let's not wait for us to do it. The Park Service has an obligation to do it right now. Postponing Park Service action on the snowmobile issue is a delay tactic, pure and simple. 
   The amendment we are debating assumes there is an inherent right of snowmobiles to run wild in the national parks, irrespective of their impact on other users and the environment. This is a very flawed assumption. They have no inherent right to run wild in national parks. 
   All Americans have the right to enjoy our national parks but only in ways that do not damage the parks. Prohibiting snowmobiles in national parks will have an insignificant impact on recreational opportunities available to snowmobilers. Again, there are more than 130,000 miles of designated trails in the United States, and less than 1,000 of those miles are in national parks. That is less than 1 percent. 
   Because millions of acres of public lands are already open to public snowmobiling, banning snow machines in national parks does not prevent recreationists from using their vehicles. It just prevents them from using the most sensitive and heavily visited public lands. 
   Arguing that every form of recreational access should be allowed in national parks is silly. Visitors do not need to jet boat in Crater Lake National Park. Visitors do not need to ride dirt bikes in the Grand Canyon. Visitors do not need to bungee jump from the Washington Monument. 
   Prohibitions against such activities do not restrict Americans' access to our parks; rather, they indicate a willingness to protect parks for the enjoyment of all visitors. 
   Great Basin National Park in Nevada already prohibits snowmobile use. Glacier and Yosemite Parks do not allow snowmobile use. 
   What are some of the environmental problems caused by snowmobiles in national parks? 
   Environmental analyses done at Yellowstone and elsewhere have shown that snowmobiles can seriously damage park resources. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, existing scientific evidence ``clearly and convincingly demonstrates [that] current snowmobile use is adversely affecting the natural ..... aesthetic ..... and scenic values'' in Yellowstone. 
   Air pollution: Yellowstone and several other national parks are recognized as Class I airsheds under the Clean Air Act. The Park Service is required by law to protect these areas from any degradation. The presence of snowmobiles in the park makes that task virtually impossible. 
   Air quality monitors at Yellowstone's west entrance have found carbon monoxide levels that rival or exceed those found in major urban areas such as Denver and Los Angeles. 
   Snowmobiles account for up to 68 percent of Yellowstone's annual carbon monoxide emissions and up to 90 percent of hydrocarbon emissions, even through automobiles out number them 16 to 1. 
   Water pollution: Every winter, snowmobiles spew unburned fuel into the snow in national parks and ultimately into their rivers and lakes. 
   Contaminants released by snowmobiles two-stroke engines include polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and methyl tertiary butyl ether.  
   PAHs in water are toxic to aquatic life, and MTBE is an identified human health hazard 
   Noise pollution: The preservation of natural sounds is a major national park management objective, 
   A study of snowmobile noise interfered with visitors' ability to hear natural sounds at 12 out of 13 popular locations, including Morning Glory Pool, Grand Prismatic Spring, and other destinations. At Old Faithful, the world's most famous geyser, snowmobile engines were the dominant sound 100 percent of the time. 
   Wildlife impacts: The NPS Biological Resources Division found that ``snowmobile usage adversely affects wildlife.'' 
   Noise and the physical presence of snowmobiles cause animals to alter their activity patterns, This behavioral response is of concern because snowmobile use occurs when food supplies are low and an animal's ability to conserve energy may be critical to its survival. 
   Heavily used snowmobile routes can cut off winter migration paths used by park wildlife. 
   Conflicts with other park visitors: Snowmobiles detract from other people's experience in the national parks. A 1996 visitor use study conducted in Yellowstone found many people who reported that encounters with snowmobiles were the least enjoyable part of their park visit because of the noise, pollution, and impact on wildlife viewing. 
   How will restrictions on national parks affect other recreational snowmobiling opportunities? 
   According to the International Snowmobile Manufacturers Association there are approximately 230,000 miles of groomed and marked snowmobile trails in North America, and about 130,000 miles in the United States. This does not include areas such as national forest roads that are open to snowmobiles but not explicitly designated for snowmobiles. In contrast, there are only about 600 miles of roads and waterways open to snowmobile in national parks in the continental United States, and 300 of those miles are excluded from the NPS April 26 announcement. Closing national parks will not diminish recreation opportunities for snowmobiles, but it will help reduce noise, pollution, and congestion in Yellowstone and other parks. 
   Many states have thousands of miles of designated trails for snowmobilers to enjoy. Promotional material from the state of Wyoming does not even mention Yellowstone National Park, but does promise that ``with over 2,200 miles of snowmobile trails, you can access some of the most scenic back-country in the world.'' (See attachment #8) 
   Snowmobile opportunities in other States include: Colorado, over 3,000 miles of trails; Idaho, over 7,200 miles of trails; Maine, over 12,000 miles of trails; Michigan, 5,800 miles of trails; Minnesota, 14,000 miles of trails; and Montana, over 2,500 miles of trails. 
   How much snowmobile use is there in the national parks? 
   There are 42 units of the National Park System that allow snowmobiles, 28 of these parks are in the continental U.S. Over 175,000 snowmobiles use these 28 parks annually. The five parks with the most annual use are: Yellowstone, 65,000 are 1.5 million registered snowmobiles in the United States. 
   How will this affect individual national parks? 
   The National Park Service action DOES NOT immediately ban snowmobile use in all national parks. Late this summer, the Park Service plans to release a proposed rule that will amend its overall snowmobile regulation, 36 CFR 2.18 and address each of the parks that currently allow snowmobiles. This proposed rule would modify or amend those special regulations to bring parks into compliance with the Executive Orders, statutes, and regulations. Public comments will be incorporated before the rule is made final. 
   For example, approximately 80 percent of existing snowmobile use at Pictured Rocks National Lakeshore is expected to continue. and at St. Croix National Scenic Riverway, an annual ``Winterfest'' celebration that includes snowmobiles is expected to continue under a special use permit. 
   There are arguments by opponents of Park Service regulations. 
   Argument: A snowcoach system in Yellowstone would deny visitors access to the park. 
   Response: The snowcoach system proposed by the Park Service for Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks will provide park visitors access to all of the areas currently open to snowmobile visitors. 
   The only access proposed to be limited is that of backcountry ski and snowshoe visitors in off-trail areas of critical winter wildlife habitat. 
   The snowcoach system will allow the same number, if not more, of visitors to enter the park each winter, while reducing the number of vehicles by 90% (assuming average capacities of one person per snowmobile and the ten per snowcoach). 
   There is a tendency to confuse access with recreational use. Snowmobiles as currently used are a form of recreation. The parks have a duty to determine the means of access to park attractions that cause the least damage to resources. In no way is public access being eroded, rather a recreational pursuit is being eliminated due to its negative impacts on park resources. A less damaging mode of transportation will be substituted to allow visitor access to the parks. 
   Proposals to allow snowmobiles but to cap their numbers would essentially limit the numbers of winter visitors to the park. People are not the problem in the parks. Noisy, polluting machines are what's needed to be limited. 
   In relation to economic impacts--argument: The Yellowstone gateway communities are uniformly opposed to the removal of snowmobiles because it will destroy their winter economies. 
   Response: Scores of businesspeople in West Yellowstone, MT, the main winter gateway to Yellowstone, have raised their voices in support of removal of snowmobiles from the park. Several representatives of the community/business owner organization West Yellowstone Citizens for a Healthy Park traveled to Washington, D.C. this spring to tell Congress that the health of their local economy depends on the health of Yellowstone National Park. 
   Current snowmobile use in Yellowstone creates numerous problems of safety, noise and air pollution in gateway communities. A change in winter park transportation will allow for much-desired diversification of gateway economies. 
   In relation to improved technology--Argument: The regulation of snowmobiles in national parks should be delayed until new snowmobile technologies are available. 
   Response: The EPA has explicitly told the Park Service not to wait for upcoming EPA regulations: ``This DEIS includes extensive analysis of the effects from current winter use and that analysis demonstrates significant environmental and human health impacts. We encourage NPS to take the steps necessary to protect human health and the environment immediately rather than to depend on future regulation of OHV engines from EPA.'' EPA comments on Draft EIS for Winter Use Plans, Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks and John D. Rockefeller Jr. Memorial Parkway, Region 8 EPA, Denver, CO. 
   EPA regulations will not address noise emissions from snowmobiles and may not require air emissions stringent enough to protect park air quality. 
   Compliance with park regulations and laws regarding wildlife, noise and visitor conflict will not be addressed by the development of snowmobiles with less air pollution. 
   Less polluting snowmobiles would not address the mass transit needs of the parks. Many parks are adopting mass transit using the cleanest, quietest technologies available; this is also the case in Yellowstone. Transportation alternatives to the one-person, one vehicle model have been implemented in Acadia and Denali, and will soon be in place in Grand Canyon, Zion and Yosemite National Parks. The NPS should be a leader in promoting clean, quiet and affordable modes of group transportation that are protective of the natural qualities of the parks. 
   Recognizing that it is the vehicles, not the people at the root of the problem, Yellowstone in winter is a natural place to look next for expansion of the alternative transportation program already taking place in the Park System. 
   In relation to the history of Snowmobiling in Yellowstone National Park, in 1963, the first snowmobile enters Yellowstone. In 1973-1974, 30,000  snowmobiles enter Yellowstone. In 1972 the National Park Service Regional Director asked all parks to devise winter use plans. Glacier National Park undertook such a review and noted the variety of problems caused by snowmobiling in the park including air and noise pollution, wildlife disturbance and conflicts with other park users. For these reasons and because of strong public sentiment against disrupting the quiet and beauty of Glacier National Park with snowmobiles, the park decided to ban them. Yosemite, Sequoia/Kings Canyon, Lassen and others followed suit. 
   Yellowstone, however, did not follow the directive to assess the impact of snowmobiles on park resources. Complaints from visitors and park rangers concerning air and noise pollution grew commonplace and the first studies documenting adverse impacts to wildlife from snowmobile use were completed. Future superintendents of Yellowstone allowed further expansion of snowmobiling in the park despite ongoing concerns about air and noise pollution and wildlife impacts. Finally, in the 1990s conditions in Yellowstone and Grand Teton grew so bad that the parks were forced to take action.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment I offered on behalf of Senator BOXER would limit the use of dangerous pesticides in our national parks. In particular, it prohibits the routine use of highly toxic pesticides--those containing known or probable carcinogens, acute nerve toxins, organophosphates, carbamates, or organochlorines--in our national parks, where children may be present. 
   Such pesticides could be used in the case of an emergency. This is already the policy of the National Park Service. This amendment would codify this important policy.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment on behalf of Senators REED of Rhode Island and TORRICELLI that would enhance Medicaid coverage for childhood lead poisoning screening. 
   The Reed-Torricelli amendment is concerned about lead testing because, despite federal screening requirements for kids enrolled in Medicaid, many children are not getting tested. 
   Lead poisoning attacks a child's nervous system and can cause seizures, brain damage, comas, and even death. 
   The threat of lead poisoning is particularly great for those least able to confront it--our nation's poor children. 
   This is why in 1992 Congress required states to test every Medicaid recipient under age two for lead. 
   These children are 5 times more likely to have high blood levels. 
   Disturbingly, however, this federal law is being ignored. 
   A recent GAO study found that two-thirds of children on Medicaid have never been screened for lead. 
   For whatever reason, insufficient outreach, lax government oversight or parental ignorance, too many kids are not getting screened. 
   Therefore, the Reed-Torricelli amendment seeks to improve the lead screening rates for children enrolled in Medicaid.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amendment on behalf of Senator TORRICELLI that strives to improve the lives of patients with ALS, better known as the disease that struck down the famed Yankee Lou Gehrig. 
   First diagnosed over 130 years ago, ALS is a fatal neurological disorder that usually strikes individuals over 50 years old. Each year, 5,000 new cases are diagnosed; an estimated 300,000 Americans alive today will die of ALS. Life expectancy is only 3 to 5 years and the financial costs to families can be up to $200,000 a year. 
   Yet despite the rapid onset of symptoms and the extremely short life-expectancy, patients with ALS must endure a 24-month waiting period before receiving Medicare services. 
   Senator TORRICELLI's amendment will eliminate the 24-month waiting period so that patients will no longer need to wait until the final months of their illness to receive the care they need upon diagnosis. 
   This proposal is based on the legislation introduced by Senator TORRICELLI in 1998 and has achieved the bi-partisan support of 27 co-sponsors.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator TORRICELLI, I would like to offer the following amendment which seeks to ease the tax burden on those Americans who have suffered or will suffer from natural disasters. 
   This amendment agrees with the notion that rebuilding a community in the wake of a natural disaster is an enormous task. The Senator's amendment builds on this idea by stating that a heavy income tax burden should not be one of those obstacles to recovery. 
   Current tax law stipulates that taxpayers can only deduct those losses that exceed 10 percent of their income. Furthermore, the requirements only allow those taxpayers who itemize their returns to deduct their losses. 
   Given that only a quarter of all taxpayers itemize their returns, this means that these restrictive provisions disqualify many Americans who could benefit from this deduction. This legislation removes these barriers. 
   First, this amendment would lower the income threshold for disaster loss deductions from 10 percent to 5 percent. 
   Secondly, this provision would make these deductions ``above the line'' enabling the majority of non-itemizing tax payers to claim this deduction. 
   This amendment would also eliminate the marriage penalty a couple incurs when they deduct their uninsured disaster losses as joint filers by allowing married couples to claim their disaster losses as single filers in order to fully deduct their uninsured disaster losses. 
   Finally, it would allow taxpayers to defer their deduction for a period of up to two years or claim losses that have occurred two years previously. 
   Senator TORRICELLI'S amendment believes that those who rebuild their lives in the wake of a disaster should not have to overcome a heavy tax burden in order to recover. This provision will help ensure that this is not the case.

   Whenever a married couple with joint filing status seek to deduct their losses incurred from a natural disaster, they find that their deduction is significantly less than it would be if they claimed their losses as single filers. 
   This amendment seeks to rectify this inequity, by allowing joint filers to claim single filing status in order to deduct their disaster losses, so that they can enjoy the deduction that they are entitled to.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator leaves the floor, I want to be able to say some things publicly that I have said to him privately. My stay here in the Senate has been a great experience, but that experience has been heightened every day because of Senator MOYNIHAN. I loved when I was going to school, but being around Senator MOYNIHAN is even better because it is like going to school--and you don't have to take the tests. 
   I say to the Senator from New York, the State of New York and our country is so well-served by the wisdom and integrity and the brilliance that he has. I know he is going to be here for another 6 months, but the Senate will never be the same without DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. I and the country and the State of New York will miss him terribly.

   The Democrats could not be more proud of any Senator than we are of CARL LEVIN. We are so comfortable with him at the helm of this important aspect of what takes place in this country; that is, the preparedness of our military. He has a great working relationship with Senator WARNER. This bill was an extremely difficult bill. It simply could not have been completed without the expertise, the concern, and the respect Senator LEVIN has with his colleagues. I want to make sure the RECORD reflects that.

   Mr. REID. As I conferred with the Chairman of the Finance Committee, the first amendment that the two leaders wish to be offered today is the Democratic alternative, which the senior Senator, the ranking member of the Finance Committee, will offer as soon as he completes his business with the guest Chaplain. 
   I indicate to all Senators listening, this matter has 2 hours evenly divided. Of course, we note at 9:30 we are in a break for 3 votes. So there is no need that we necessarily have to have the full 2 hours of debate on each side. Our leader has directed me--I am trying to think of a gracious way of saying this. I am going to be the one who distributes the time on the bill, and inasmuch as we have only 20 minutes after time is evenly divided, on each of the 20 amendments we have today, we have to watch everything and make sure we follow the time guidelines. The leaders are not sure when votes will occur, other than the 9:30 votes. 
   At this time I yield to the Senator from Delaware.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I could bring everyone back to reality, the problem of the day--not next week or the week after--is that we have about 12 1/2 hours of debate time, excluding voting, and the leader indicated he wants to do that today. So that means about 2:30 or 3 o'clock 
   this morning unless something is done carrying this matter over or shortening the time. 
   I think it is great to talk about the future. That is important. But my concern is what we have here today and it is a tremendous burden. As I indicated, I think we have over 12 hours of debate time in the unanimous consent request alone.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the distinguished manager of this legislation, the Senator from Delaware, what we, the minority, would like to do. Everybody over here thinks the amendment of the Senator from Utah is well taken for a lot of different reasons. This legislation was developed in 1981 to spur the economy. It certainly has done that. It has expanded for 5 years. Since then, Congress has extended the tax credit every year or so, leaving terrible uncertainty in the community. This is important. It is good legislation. It is too bad it is not made permanent. 
   But I do say we will be willing to take this amendment and move on to the amendment of the Senator from New York. If a vote is required on that, we could vote around 2 o'clock. It is my understanding, though, the majority wants a vote on this amendment. 
   The uncertainty of whether or not this tax will be extended disrupts the marketplace and decreases the amount of revenue spent on research and development. Some companies with long-term research budgets have been forced to delay studies. The research and development credit benefits the entire community, the entire economy. Gains in productivity are not limited to sectors where investments in R&D take place. The gains which spill over are to all sectors of the economy--to agriculture, to mining, basic manufacturing, and high-tech services. Technological innovations improve productivity in industries that make innovations and in industries that make use of these innovations. 
   This credit would pay for itself and pay for itself very quickly. A permanent research and development credit would be an excellent investment for the Government to make because it would raise taxable incomes enough to more than pay for itself. In the long run, the $1.75 of additional revenue on a present value basis would be generated for each $1 the Government spends on the credit, creating a win-win situation for both taxpayers and the Government. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   What the Senator is telling me, if I understand it, is if this amendment passes, construction projects such as the one I just referred to in the State of Nevada and the renovations and repairs which go on all of the time on those large segments of highway in the State of Montana would basically be shut down.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have certainly made clear that in 1 day we would totally complete the debate on this legislation. Under the unanimous consent agreement we have offered, in 1 day we would be completed with H-1B. In fact, in the time we have spent procedurally trying to get this done, we would have already finished two amendments. 
   I think we would be much better off treating the Senate as the Senate. My friend from New Hampshire said for 200 years there has been a meaning of ``relevance'' in the Senate. Of course, that is true. It has changed under different precedents that have been set, but we think the one thing that has not changed--but they are trying very hard to change it--is how debate proceeds in the Senate. We are willing to even change how we feel we should proceed. We believe H-1B should be brought up and that debate should be completed on it. We would be through with that probably in 2 days. We are willing to cut that back to 1 day. I respectfully say that I object and I offer again, without restating it, the unanimous consent request.

On the Republican side, the speakers who have been requested are Senators BURNS, KYL, and GRAMS so far. We will alternate back and forth. The majority will fill in a couple more speakers so there would be a requisite number on each side.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, 308. 
   The other thing I ask the Senator is every State--I should not say every State because I am not certain it is true but I believe it is true--every State in the Union has an inheritance tax; if not every State, virtually every State. The State of Nevada 10 years ago passed its own inheritance tax. 
   Does the Senator realize there is an offset; that is, of the Federal tax that is collected, if a State has an inheritance tax of its own, it comes out first and goes to the State of Nevada or the State of California, for example, rather than the Federal Government? 
</TEXT>

   Mr. REID. I ask the Senator if she knows, as I said, a portion of the estate tax goes to the States via estate tax credits as a revenuesharing provision with the States? In Nevada, 100 percent of the amount received through this estate tax credit is used for education, 50 percent is used for State university support, and 50 percent is used for elementary and secondary education. I ask my friend: Is it more important that we continue that, paid by only a fraction of the people in this country? In Nevada, instead of 308, under the new formula, it would be probably less than 100 estates, maybe closer to 70 estates. 
   The question is, Isn't it better we have--and I do not mean to denigrate him because he has done good things for the country; Bill Gates is worth $70 billion. If some misfortune overtook Bill Gates, shouldn't that huge estate pay some amount of money for education to the people of the State of Washington?

Are we going to keep working after 6:30, or are we going to defense? We have a number of speakers lined up. When we learn what is going to happen, we can better arrange the order of speakers.

It seems we have been working on this for many months, which we have. In fact, it has been nearly a year. This is a very important time in the history of this country when this legislation will pass. I hope it will pass tomorrow.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the Senator from Utah leaves the floor, I want to tell him how much I appreciate his work on this issue. The work that has been done is very important. 
   I say to the Senator from Tennessee, he is a real advocate. He has worked very hard. He has a different view as to what should happen. He has formulated these ideas with great study and his staff has been easy to work with, but in this instance we believe we are right and that he is not quite right. 
   Based upon his advocacy, I, along with the Senator from Utah, am willing to work with the Senator from Tennessee. He has an idea that doesn't shorten the time whatsoever but would add another element; namely the General Accounting Office. Senator BENNETT has pledged that he would work with him on this issue, and I do so publicly also. We will try to find another vehicle to work with him on his legislation. 
   More than 50 percent of America's companies' revenues come from overseas sales. Also, more than 60 percent of the market for multiprocessor systems is outside the United States. What we are talking about is allowing the United States to maintain its position as a paramount producer of computers. That is what it amounts to. Things are changing very rapidly. 
   I can remember a few years ago I went to Clark County, in Las Vegas, NV, to the third floor of the courthouse. The entire third floor was the  computer processing system for Clark County. Then Clark County was much smaller than it is now. Today the work that is done on that entire third floor could be done with a personal computer, a laptop; things have changed so rapidly. That is why we need to allow changes. 
   This little computer that I carry around, this ``palm,'' as they call it, does remarkable things. I can store in this basically the Las Vegas phonebook. It has a calculator. It has numerous features that were impossible 2 years ago. It is now possible. That is what this amendment is all about: to allow the American computer industry to remain competitive and to allow sales overseas. 
   I appreciate the work of Senator PHIL GRAMM of Texas. He has worked on this matter for many months, along with Senator ENZI and Senator JOHNSON. I appreciate their support on this legislation. 
   The amendment, which has broad support from the high-tech industry and from a majority of the Members of the Senate, simply shortens the congressional review period for high performance computers from 180 days to 60 days and guarantees that the counting of those days not be tolled when Congress adjourns sine die. 
   We are operating under cold war era regulations and if we want to remain the world leader in computer manufacturing and in the high-tech arena, we must make this change immediately. 
   I have worked for the last year and a half with Senators GRAMM, ENZI, and JOHNSON on the Export Administration Act, but a few members of the majority have succeeded in blocking its passage. That bill is not moving and therefore, Senator BENNETT and I would like to simply pass this portion of the Export Administration Act to provide some temporary relief. The congressional review period for computer exports is six times longer than the review of munitions. 
   In February, the President, at my urging and the urging of others, proposed changes to the export controls on high performance computers, but because of the 180-day review period, these changes have yet to be implemented and U.S. companies are losing foreign market share to Chinese and other foreign competitors as we speak. This is already July and a February proposed change, which was appropriate at the time, and is nearly out-dated now, has yet to go into effect. 
   This amendment is a bipartisan effort and one that we need to pass. Congress is stifling U.S. companies' growth and we can't stand for it, I can't stand for it. This underscores another point: the importance of exports to the U.S. computer industry. More than 50 percent of America's companies revenues come from overseas sales. If we give the international market to foreign competition in the short term, we will never get it back in the long term, and not only our economy, but our national security will founder. 
   A strong economy and a strong U.S. military depend on our leadership. U.S. companies have to be given the opportunity to compete worldwide in order to continue to lead the world in technological advances. 
   According to the Computer Coalition for Responsible Exports, U.S. computer export regulations are the most stringent in the world and give foreign competitors a head start. More than 60 percent of the market for multiprocessor systems is outside of the U.S. The U.S. industry faces stiff competition, as foreign governments allow greater export flexibility. 
   The current export control system interferes with legitimate U.S. exports because it does not keep pace with technology. The MTOPS level of microprocessors increased nearly 5-fold from 1998 to 1999--and today's levels will more than double when the Intel Itanium, I-Tanium, chip is introduced in the middle of this year. New export control thresholds will not take effect until the completion of the required six month waiting period--by then, the thresholds will be obsolete and American companies will have lost considerable market share in foreign countries. 
   The current export control system does not protect U.S. national security. The ability of America's defense system to maintain its technological advantage relies increasingly on the U.S. computer industry's ability to be at the cutting edge of technology. It does not make sense to impose a 180-day waiting period for products that have a 3-month innovation cycle and are widely available in foreign countries. Right now American companies are forbidden from selling computers in tier three countries while foreign competitors are free to do so. 
   As I indicated earlier, the removal of items from export controls imposed by the Munitions List, such as tanks, rockets, warships, and high-performance aircraft, requires only a 30-day waiting period. The sale of sensitive weapons, such as tanks, rockets, warships and high-performance aircraft, under the Foreign Military Sales program requires only a 30-day congressional review period. One hundred eighty days is too long. 
   The new Intel microprocessor, the Itanium, is expected to be available sometime this summer with companies such as NEW, Hitachi and Siemens already signed on to use the microprocessor. The most recent export control announcement made by the Administration on February 1 will therefore be out of date in less than six months. 
   Lastly--a review period, comparable to that applied to other export control and national security regimes, will still give Congress adequate time to review national security ramifications of any changes in the U.S. computer export control regime. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment and to allow our country's computer companies to compete with their foreign competitors and thereby continue to drive our thriving economy. 
   I believe that 30 days is the proper amount of time for the review period, but have agreed, with my colleague from Utah, to offer the identical language that passed in the House by a vote of 415 to 8. Less stringent language passed out of committee in the Senate, and there is no reason that this shouldn't pass with a large majority.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, while the leader is on the floor, I state for the minority, we are here; we are ready to work; we understand the tremendous load of work that we have. We only have about 35 legislative days until we adjourn this Congress. 
   In addition to the appropriations bills, there are other pieces of legislation we can move along. The leader has indicated a couple of things he is interested in accomplishing this week. We are happy to work on those. It is also important that we don't lose sight of the fact we have a number of matters in conference. We have to complete the conference committee reports so we can come back and vote on those. We have issues that are out there, not the least of which are the Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs, gun safety, a minimum wage increase for families around America, and education. I hope we also can focus on some of these issues during the next 35 legislative days. 
   The minority is here; we are ready to move. I think we have worked very hard on these appropriations bills in the last 6 weeks. I think the last week we were able to get a lot done, including the emergency supplemental, which is so important. We would also direct the leader's attention to the fact that there are other matters originally contained in the supplemental we need to complete in the immediate future.

   Mr. REID. I have listened to the Democratic leader outline what we have not been able to do. I fully support, as does the entire Democratic caucus, what the Senator is trying to accomplish. The one thing the Democratic leader did not mention, though, I say to my leader--there has been a tremendous furor from the Republican side about how they want to help the high-tech community, but the one thing that has not been accomplished is a simple little bill to change the Export Administration Act so our high-tech industry can compete with the rest of the world. 
   As we speak, we are losing our business position in the world in selling computers. We lead the world in building and selling high-tech computers. That is being taken from us as a result of four or five people on the Republican side who are holding up this most important legislation. 
   I say to my leader, I hope this is something on which we can also move forward. We would be willing to debate it for 30 minutes, for an hour. There is all this talk about helping the high-tech industry. In my opinion, the most important thing we could do is to get some attention focused on what has not been done regarding the high-tech industry. H-1B visas, of course, that is important. 
   On the airplane ride back from Las Vegas, I had the good fortune to read a book the Democratic leader has already read and told me how much he has enjoyed called ``The New New Thing.'' That book indicates how important it is that we have the people to do the work of this scientific nature. We need to change the H-1B. We agree there. But we also need to change our ability to have more exports to improve our balance of trade. 
   I close by saying, 44 Senators are willing to come in early in the morning, to stay late at night, to give up our weekends, to do whatever is necessary these next 3 weeks to move this legislation the Democratic leader has outlined.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the leader, I know how difficult his job is, but, in spite of the difficulty of his job, H-1B is something that we on the minority side believe should have its day in the Senate. I have been assigned by our leader to come up with a number of amendments on our side. We have whittled it down from 10. I think we could get back on six or seven amendments. We would have short time agreements on every one of those. Most of them would be relevant, would be germane. They relate to the subject at issue. 
   I say to my friend from Mississippi, it reminds me of Senator MOYNIHAN. He wrote a very nice piece called ``Defining Deviancy Down'' a few years ago, indicating although we believed some things were real bad, with the encroachment of time and change of mores, we started accepting those things that at one time were bad. That does not make it good that we are accepting it, but that is what Senator MOYNIHAN wrote about, and I am confident he was right. 
   I say to my friend, the majority leader, that is kind of what we have here--not defining deviancy, but defining Senate procedure down. We are not filibustering H-1B. We want to have this. We believe it could be completed in 1 day. 
   If you look at the definition of ``filibuster,'' we are not filibustering anything. This is the definition from the dictionary: The use of irregular or obstructive tactics, such as exceptionally long speeches by a member of a minority in a legislative assembly to prevent the adoption of a measure generally favored or to force a decision almost unanimously disliked. 
   We are not filibustering. We want H-1B to come before this body. We want to work with you. We agree it is important legislation, but can't we have a few amendments? We are going to have short time agreements. We are not asking that things that are not relevant be brought up. We have matters that relate to immigration in this country. 
   As I say, I have been given the assignment by our leader to see how we can squeeze down these amendments. I feel almost as if we have lost by doing this. We do not like that, but we have agreed to work with the leader and have a number of amendments, have time agreements, to move this legislation forward. 
   I hope the leader will allow us that luxury, and I say ``luxury'' in the sense recognizing what Senator MOYNIHAN wrote. A year or two ago, we would never have considered this because that was not the way we did things in the Senate. We believe matters should be brought up and handled as they have for over 200 years in this body, unless someone else wants to speak.

The minority wants to move forward, as Senator DASCHLE indicated today. If the Senator persists in his unanimous consent request, I will object.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lander County Cemetery Conveyance Act. 
   The settlement of Kingston, Nevada was destination and home to pioneers that settled the isolated high desert valleys of the central Great Basin. The inhabitants of this community set aside a specific community cemetery to provide the final resting place for friends and family who passed away. The early settlers established and managed the cemetery in the late 1800's. The Kingston cemetery is on land now managed by the United States Forest Service (FS). The FS is selling approximately one acre to the Town of Kingston, but this conveyance does not allow for the long-term use and expansion beyond the undisturbed historic graves, the implementation of the community's original 10 acre site plan, nor the protection of the uncharted graves. 
   Mr. President, the site of this historic cemetery was established prior to the designation of the Forest Reserve surrounding the Town of Kingston. The surrounding Forest Reserve was established in 1908. Under current law, the agency must sell the encumbered land at fair market value to this community for continued use. My bill provides for the conveyance of the balance of the original, recognized cemetery location to Lander County, at no cost, contingent on the completed sale of the acre to the Town of Kingston. It is unconscionable to me that this landlocked, rural community is required to buy their ancestors back from the Federal government. 
   I sincerely hope that members of Congress recognize the benefit to the local community that the conveyance would provide and pass this legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, those who drop out of high school are at a greater risk of being unemployed or holding a position with no career advancement opportunities. These individuals also earn less, are more likely to be poverty stricken, and received public assistance. 
   To address the dropout problem, the Department of Education administers 11 programs. These programs resulted in a downward trend in the national dropout rate. Nonetheless, we have what we could call the ``dropout divide''--dropout rates in 1998 were higher for Hispanic (9.4%) than blacks (5.2%) and whites (3.9%). 
   This holds true in Nevada, where Hispanic students dropped out of school at a higher rate than other racial/ethnic groups. In the 1996-97 school year, the Hispanic dropout rate is 15.7 percent while White and Asian/Pacific Islander students had the lowest dropout rates at 8.3% each. 
   It is unacceptable that we allow students--of any race--to dropout. In our new high-tech economy, education is more important than ever. It is the key to a happy and secure future, and we must work harder to make sure that our children don't lose this valuable chance to get an education. We must convince them to stay in school. 
   For Nevada, the latest numbers show that 17 percent of our school students will drop out before they get their degrees. Almost one in five students in the 12th grade (19.4%) dropped out of school during the 1996-97 school year,  compared with a dropout rate for 9th grade students of 3.5 percent. 
   As a member of the HELP Committee, Senator BINGAMAN has been a strong advocate for dropout prevention programs and funding. I am pleased that the Bingaman/Reid amendment--adding $10 million of funding for dropout program grants--was accepted. 
   Our role is to provide needed resources to carry out innovate programs tailored to the specific circumstances encountered. This money goes to states and local school districts, in grants, to finance new dropout prevention programs. 
   Dropout prevention programs must remain a priority for educators, parents, and policymakers. All students deserve an opportunity to receive a quality and complete education.

I see your burdens, Mr. Majority Leader, but not as up close and personal as  I see Senator DASCHLE's. What he does for us, the minority, is extraordinary, as evidenced by the very quick, instantaneous decisions he made in conjunction with you today. You are both to be applauded. This is democracy in action. It is what is good about government. 
   I also extend accolades to the two of you. I have no military service in my background, but with the love and appreciation and dedication that Senators STEVENS and INOUYE have for the military, and Senator WARNER and others who work for the defense of this country, they see it from a little different perspective than a lot of us because they have seen military action. I think they deserve a great deal of credit. 
   Senator INOUYE has been ill and has not been here this week, but his spirit has been here. He was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor. He and Senator STEVENS have guided the military of this country for the last decade as no one in the history of this country, in my opinion. I express appreciation for everyone on our side of the aisle for what these two men do for the military. Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE have personally felt the need for this military construction bill, and every word they speak indicates that.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate considers the estate tax bill, it be considered under the following limitation: That the bill be limited to relevant amendments, with the following exemptions of the minority: estate taxes  and tuition tax deductibility; second, estate taxes and Medicare prescription drug benefit; third, estate taxes and long-term care tax credit; next, estate taxes and Medicare off budget; next, estate taxes and retirement savings tax incentives; and, finally, estate taxes and kid savings accounts; that all first-degree amendments be subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that there be a time limitation of 1 hour for debate, equally divided in the usual form, on all amendments. 
   I also say, just taking another brief minute, that at least one of our Members believes it would be appropriate that we should not be able to bring this estate tax legislation forward until we dispose of the China PNTR legislation.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, I think what we have done these last 4 days shows we can move through things very quickly. There were over 150 amendments after we worked on the bill a couple days. So we probably resolved over 200 amendments in the Labor-HHS bill. 
   But I also say, in the short time I have been in the Senate, we have had some tax bills with hundreds of amendments and we have been able to work our way through those in some way. 
   As with the leader, we on this side of the aisle think there should be some change in the estate taxes. We want to do that. We are getting the same calls you are. 
   But I say to my friend, we would be willing to take time agreements on these amendments. I am certain we could finish 
    the amendments in one good, long day. We would take time agreements on these amendments. 
   On tax bills that have traditionally been brought up in the Senate, we have not had any restrictions on them. We will agree to have some restrictions, but we think this would be appropriate. 
   We will be happy to have our staffs work on this during the break, and as soon as we get back, the two leaders can again talk about this. We do want to bring up the estate taxes.

   Mr. REID. Under my reservation, Mr. President, I also say we have worked very closely with Senator BAUCUS and Senator MOYNIHAN in trying to come up with an alternative, and some other matters that we believe should be brought up with this piece of legislation. 
   For example, in 1992, under a tax bill that came before the Senate, we, on the 25th, started considering that. We had 105 amendments, and a day and a half later it was all done. That legislation was totally passed. We had a number of amendments that were even offered by our majority leader on that important legislation. There was a wide range of amendments offered dealing with dental schools, tractors, and all kinds of things. 
   So we can work out a way through this. I think the proposal by the minority that we take up six amendments, with time limits, is something the majority leader should take another look at.

   I also say to the leader that it would be a big help to those of us on the floor if we could shorten the time of the votes. We wasted tremendous time yesterday. We wasted at least 2 1/2 hours on votes when people weren't here. We waited 20, 30 minutes for Senators on both sides. I believe that if a vote is completed within 15 or 18 
   minutes, we should go on to something else. If people miss a vote or two, everybody's record will be down a little bit, and it will be the same for everybody.

   I am willing to work with the Republican leadership and my leader to try to work out some kind of freestanding bill so this matter can be fully debated. This is not an appropriate time to do it. I say respectfully to the Senator from Kansas and the majority leader that we simply can't do this now.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a woman who has dedicated her career to public service and is a good friend, Lucy Calautti. 
   I have known Lucy Calautti for twenty years, since she was the Chief of Staff for then Congressman DORGAN, even before becoming his chief of staff in the U.S. Senate. Throughout the years I have been inspired by her intelligence and political skills in the service of the United States Congress. 
   Many people on the Hill know about Lucy's professional accomplishments, but few of them know about the incredible service she has rendered our nation before she can to Washington. Lucy Calautti's extensive and varied career in the interest of the public, includes service in the United States Navy as an aerial photographer during the Vietnam War. After that her inspiration to serve the American people never faded--in fact it was enhanced--as she photographed protesters outside the 1968 Democratic convention. Her experience in Chicago at the convention of the social turmoil in our country at that them were some of the experiences that has made Lucy the dynamic and sensitive person she is. 
   Lucy headed west to North Dakota from her birthplace in Queens, New York. She fell in love with the people and land of North Dakota as much as the people and land of North Dakota fell in love with her. She admired North Dakotans' independence, their hard work, and their idealism. It wasn't long after Lucy arrived in North Dakota that she began working with now Senator DORGAN when he became the elected State Tax Commissioner. Theirs was a unique working partnership--one that has lasted more than a quarter of a century. 
   In her lifetime, Lucy has also been a champion for the rights of women, children, and working families. Some may not know how tirelessly Lucy Calautti has fought for women's rights throughout her career. Lucy began her dedication to the rights of women when she participated in landmark anti-discrimination litigation. As a female GI, she was a courageous pioneer who realized first-hand that the benefits extended to women paled in comparison to the benefits extended to her male colleagues. Lucy took up the cause, and made sure that, for the first time, full GI benefits were provided to women serving in the military. Lucy continued her career in grassroots organizing on behalf of the Women's Democratic Caucus in North Dakota. In fact, The Hill newspaper would later anoint Lucy the ``best political organizer the state of North Dakota has ever seen.'' And while so many people would have stopped with just these accomplishments, Lucy continued to establish the first public child care center in North Dakota, extending the most necessary service to women who juggle work, family, and far too often, poverty. 
   Lucy's career in public service has also included one of the most important positions in American society today--teaching. Lucy shaped the minds of our future leaders through her years as a high school and college-level teacher. To this day, Lucy continues her commitment to our nation's children, reading to DC-area children every week. Truly, an inspiration. 
   Lucy has, literally, shifted the political landscape in North Dakota and the U.S. Senate. As campaign manager Lucy 
    Calautti engineered a come-from-behind victory for KENT CONRAD in the 1986 U.S. Senate race against a seated Republican, marking the first time since 1944 that an incumbent North Dakota Senator lost a reelection bid. Her knowledge of the people of North Dakota coupled with her superior grassroots organizing skills and her media savvy resulted in a campaign that is so respected, it was the subject of a book entitled ``When Incumbency Fails.'' 
   Contemporaries know Lucy most for her leadership in the office of Senator DORGAN, as she has served as Chief of Staff to Senator DORGAN for more than twenty years. During this time, Lucy performed a key role in shepherding key legislation through the United States Senate. It wasn't too long ago that Lucy played an instrumental role with the Democratic party, staving off the Republican push for a Balanced Budget Amendment, and worked to push an amendment that would not harm Social Security. In those tense days, Lucy was the calm inside the storm, as she quickly worked for a common-sense approach to the issue at the same time she helped bring the state of North Dakota into the limelight. For her skills in politics and legislation, Lucy has been praised universally by her peers. A former aide to the late Senator Quentin Burdick lauded Lucy Calautti as ``incredibly astute about politics and human nature, and absolutely brilliant at running a campaign.'' Former coworkers reserve the highest accolades for Lucy, including one, who praised Lucy as ``smart, analytical, meticulous, loyal, and a hard worker.'' The Hill newspaper even crowned Lucy Calautti with the title of ``most powerful woman in the nation's capital.'' 
   Now, we are losing Lucy to one of her lifetime loves--baseball. I suppose it is only natural that Lucy return to one of her first and most ardent interests. Growing up in Queens, Lucy lived not too far from Shea Stadium where she began her love of our nation's favorite pastime. Last week, her father passed away. He instilled in her a love of the game of baseball, among so many other attributes. She walks in her father's footsteps, and I'm sure he's the proudest Dad in the world. It is with a great deal of respect that I pay tribute to Lucy Calautti today. Soon, Lucy will join the Major League Baseball Organization as Director of Government Relations. She'll still be playing ball with us, and it's be fun. 
   Thank you, Lucy, for the time we have been able to enjoy your magnificent intellect and skills in the United States Senate. I thank you for your hard work, your dedication, your idealism, and your service to our country  and most of all for you and KENT being the good friends you have been to Landra and to me.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I follow boxing. When I was a younger man, I did some boxing of my own. 
   One of the things I remember more than anything else regarding fights is when Evander Holyfield fought Mike Tyson. You remember the famous fight where they were in the ring and suddenly Mike Tyson was chewing and biting on Evander Holyfield's ear. That was unfair. It was unnecessary. Mills Lane, the referee, said: You shouldn't do that. 
   They come out again. He does it again. 
   I feel, with all due respect to my good friend from Pennsylvania, that that is kind of what has happened here. 
   The two leaders want to speed up this very important bill. The minority will do everything we can. We have agreed to a time when the amendments could be filed. We have agreed that I will work, as other members of this conference will, to have some of the amendments disappear. The majority leader wants to finish this bill today. 
   Instead, we have an anti-GORE campaign speech coming from nowhere. 
   If we want to do something about campaign finance, why don't we do  something in the Senate Chamber such as trying to outlaw campaign soft money? That would be a good step to take. We have been trying for years to have campaign finance reform. We have narrowed the issues. We will now just take doing away with soft money. We will take that. But, no, we are prevented from having a vote on that. Why? Because the majority won't let us vote on it. So we have an anti-GORE campaign speech today by the manager of this bill. 
   I don't serve on the Judiciary Committee. I can't answer all the questions that have been asked. I read the newspapers. 
   We know that the Attorney General is an impeccably honest person. For example, when she was the chief law enforcement officer of Dade County, Miami, she would go to a car dealership to buy a car and would pay only the sticker price on the window. She didn't want anyone thinking she was getting some kind of a special deal from the car dealership. No one can question the veracity of Janet Reno. She is an honest woman and has been a good Attorney General and has called things the way she believes they should be. 
   I don't know anything about Conrad, other than he donated money to JESSE HELMS. The only donation he has made in his life was to JESSE HELMS. I also find it interesting that this came out as a result of a leak, a leak from supposedly secret information. 
   Then my friend from Pennsylvania has the audacity to talk about an independent counsel. We have had our fill of independent counsels, majority and minority. We don't want anymore. They have harassed and berated President Reagan, President Clinton. Independent counsel is out. Remember, we didn't reauthorize that. Of course, we can, because the law was in effect about the period of time the Senator from Pennsylvania was talking about. We could have another independent counsel, and maybe they could break the record of some of the others. For example, Walsh, he was at $50 million or thereabouts. We have had a tag team on the Whitewater stuff. We will probably break all records there. It will probably be about $75 or $80 million by the time that is finished. We all should be a little suspect that this great concern has taken place 4 months before the election. 
   To advance campaign finance reform, the House, in a bipartisan fashion, as they did last year, passed a bipartisan campaign finance bill that we had buried over here; it went no place--late at night passed a campaign finance bill to outlaw 527s. These are the secret committees that are formed. You don't have to list how much money you give, who gives it, or why they give it. You list nothing. They are secret. The House, in a bipartisan fashion, outlawed that yesterday. 
   Why don't we do that same thing in the Senate before the Fourth of July recess? If we want to do something to help the political process, let's do that, rather than gin up all this stuff that is so patently political from my friend from Pennsylvania that anybody could see through it. 
   This is simply an effort to hurt AL GORE in his election against George W. Bush. That is all it is about. Let's call it the way it is. You can dress it in all kinds of clothes and be very self-righteous about all this, but the fact is, this a campaign speech and a campaign effort to hurt Vice President GORE. 
   Let's talk about Vice President GORE. He also is an honest man, has a wonderful family; he is a religious man. 
   Now we have the ``bite on the ear'' this morning. I don't know how much we can take over here. We have worked very hard to move along the appropriations bills. The majority leader said: Work with us on these appropriations bills. It would be the right thing to. 
   We believe it is the right thing to do also. But we need the majority to go halfway. Do we now want Senators coming in here all day debating this? We have Senator LEAHY. We could have him come. He is ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. He would be happy to come over and spend an hour or two talking about what went on in the Judiciary Committee. We could have BOB TORRICELLI come over and spend an hour or two. He is articulate; he could do that. Is that what we want to happen today or do we want to go ahead with the Labor-HHS bill, a very important bill for the country? 
   I know the Presiding Officer believes strongly in the defense of this country. We should do the Defense authorization bill. We can't do the Defense authorization bill because it is tied up with campaign finance reform. If we did 527s, Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD would be happy to move on to another issue and allow us to complete the Defense authorization bill. A lot of items could be completed in the Senate. The minority needs a little help to move these things along. We can't be burdened, come Thursday afternoon or Wednesday night late, with: Why aren't we moving this bill along? We are not getting cooperation. 
   With regard to the work we have ahead of us on this bill, right now we have 88 amendments on the Democratic side--I don't know how many on the Republican side--to try to get rid of before we are able to complete the bill. That takes a lot of time. I don't think we should be diverted with this phony campaign finance issue, an attempt to interject it into the Presidential race 4 months before the election. 
   I think the majority leader has to make a decision. Are we going to spend the day on campaign finance? We would be happy to do that. What went on in the Judiciary Committee, we will come over and talk about it if that is what they want to do. I see my friend from Illinois, a member of the Judiciary Committee. I think he has something to say. I think he spent some time in the last few days in the Judiciary Committee. Is that fair?

   Mr. REID. Well, I didn't. I can only comment on what I read in the papers. But I know when somebody's ear is bitten, as Tyson did to Holyfield, and it is unfair; that is what happened here today. I am not a member of the Judiciary Committee, but I am not going to let this go on being unannounced. We are on a Labor-HHS bill, and we are getting a lot of pressure to do something about it. Here we have a campaign speech in the middle of this bill, and that isn't fair.

   Mr. REID. Well, if we want to do some work on this issue, then we will spend the day doing it on this issue, if that is what the majority wants. Or, as I say, I make an invitation: If we want to do something constructive about campaign finance reform, let's pass what the House did last night and do it before the Fourth of July recess. Let's make a goal when we get back, in that 3-week period, that we get rid of soft money, that corrupting influence on political campaigns. 
   Early in this century, there was a decision made by the Congress that we would not have soft money, corporate money, in Federal elections. The Supreme Court turned that on its head and now soft money is the money of choice, putting millions of dollars in these Federal elections. That is the invitation I make to the majority. Let's do 527 tomorrow and do soft money when we get back. 
   I know my time is gone. I want to move on with this bill. But the choice is that of the majority as to what we are going to do. Are we going to do appropriations bills? Are we going to debate what went on in the Judiciary Committee for the last several days?

   Mr. REID. If the Chair would be kind enough to advise me when I have used 15 minutes, I won't ask for a unanimous consent agreement, but there was an agreement that there would be approximately a half hour on this. 
   This amendment would provide $3 million to certified crisis centers. This deals with the plague of suicide that is sweeping this country. Every year in America, 31,000 people kill themselves. This is probably far fewer than the actual number. It is something that is very devastating to those who are survivors. But there is also a situation in this country that creates a tremendous loss of economic benefits for everyone concerned. 
   I offered this amendment on behalf of Senator WELLSTONE because I was asked to by his staff. Since Senator WELLSTONE is the prime sponsor of this amendment and is now on the floor, I would like for him to proceed. I will be happy to proceed when the Senator has completed his remarks. The amendment has been offered.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Minnesota has been a great partner on this issue. He has been very understanding. He is a very caring person, as indicated by the work he has done. He has outlined very generally and in many cases specifically the problems we have in America today relating to suicide. 
   There is no question about it. Suicides occur more often in this country than can be calculated. As I have indicated, the statistics that the Senator from Minnesota gave us are reported suicides. There are many deaths that appear to be accidents that are suicides, and they cannot be calculated. 
   The State of Nevada leads the Nation in suicide. It doesn't matter what age group it is. It doesn't matter whether they are teenagers or senior citizens. The State of Nevada has the dubious distinction of leading the Nation in suicide. That is too bad. 
   This amendment is a step in the direction of helping people not only in Nevada but all over the country. The amendment offered by the Senator from Minnesota and the Senator from Nevada will set up a number of crisis centers. Today, we have about 78 crisis centers that are certified. This would allow hundreds more to be certified. 
   What does this mean? It means that when you call 1-800-SUICIDE, which was activated a little more than a year ago --people who are depressed or suicidal or those concerned about someone else who is depressed or suicidal--you are automatically connected to someone who is at one of these centers and who is trained. These calls are routed to the crisis center nearest to the person where the call is placed. 
   The crisis center calls are answered by certified counselors 24 hours a day, 7 days a week--on Thanksgiving and on Christmas; it is sad to say but Christmas is one of the biggest suicide days in this country. 
   In the event the nearest crisis center is at a maximum volume, the call is routed to the next nearest center. There is never a busy signal, or a voice mail. People in crisis usually reach a trained counselor within two or three rings, or about 20 to 30 seconds from the moment they dial 1-800-SUICIDE. 
   What does this suicide crisis line mean? 
   Let me read excerpts from a few letters. 
   This one is written to the Northern Virginia hot line. It says, among other things: 
   I would like to name NVHL (Northern Virginia Hotline) as one of my beneficiaries on my life insurance policy...... 
   The reason for this act of kindness is to give back to your organization what your organization has given to me. You see, over the past twenty years I have used your listeners during moments of crises in my life. When I had no one to turn to, I could turn to your listeners for insight and support...... 
   I want to give back to the organization that has been responsible for helping me through many tough late nights over the past twenty years.  
   We have a letter from the Catholic Newman Association in Houston, TX. It is a three-paragraph letter. I will read only one paragraph.  
   I simply want to say that because of you, Karen, a girl named __X is alive today and has, for perhaps the first time in her life, a real hope and desire to live. She called you a few weeks ago, with a razor blade in her hand, and she had already begun to cut her wrist. You talked to her for almost an hour, though she tried to hang up a number of times. You were able to get information about the fact that she had recently talked to me, as well as where she lived. You were able to keep her on the line while you had someone contact me and I got to her apartment in time to keep her from completing the suicide attempt. She has been hospitalized and has undergone intensive therapy and is soon to be released, with real hope that there are good reasons to stay alive. You must have been very skillful, Karen because she is a very sharp girl and it was a true suicide attempt prevented only by the fact that she wanted to talk to one human being--you--before killing herself. Because you took her seriously, because you cared, because you knew what to say and do, she is alive today and wants to continue to live.  
   We also have a letter addressed to Arlene, someone who works at one of these hot line centers. 
   Among other things, this woman says:  
   A member of my staff had come to me with some family problems, both financial and emotional, which were causing that person to be very despondent ..... 
   Fortunately, I was able to refer my employee to the Hotline. I don't know the details of the conversations but I can see the results. Having someone available to talk to, combined with the follow-up counseling, has helped this person to find a solution to problems which had seemed overwhelming. I now have a valuable, productive employee and the individual now feels in control of life and circumstances.  
   Finally, I have a letter from the Fairfax County Police Department. This is from Capt. Art Rudat. He is a commander in the McLean substation. He is writing a letter to say having this hotline helps the police department, freeing them to do other things. He says:  
   Upon our arrival, we found the subject in his room and he was extremely upset and agitated. He was holding a 4" knife to his jugular vein, threatening to kill himself. This threat was not taken lightly because he had already cut his left wrist and was bleeding. The atmosphere at the time was tense, not knowing if anything that the officers would say would further upset the subject. There was a moment, when the subject stood up screaming and pressing the knife into his throat almost cutting his jugular vein, that it was thought the incident would have a tragic ending. *.*.* 
   Even this was occurring, the subject was on the phone, still deep in conversation with Miss Dicke. He would go from being out of control to a very peaceful state. Slowly though, he became less upset and eventually sat down and began listening to Miss Dicke reason with him and win him over. Of course, the officers didn't know what Miss Dicke was saying, but it was enough for him to eventually give up his knife and go to the hospital with rescue to receive much needed assistance. 
   It is my understanding that of the nearly 18,000 calls that are received at the hotline center per year, approximately 600 are suicide calls and only 5 involve weapons. We at Fairfax County Police Department were quite fortunate to have had both Miss Dicke and Miss Ross working that night. Without their teamwork, tenaciousness and training, this incident could have had a tragic end-ing. *.*.* 
   Although hotlines do not historically receive the fanfare and headlines that other public service groups do, we at the Police Department realize what a tremendous resource you are to us and the outstanding service which you provide to the community.

   Mr. REID. The Senator from South Dakota knows I had the misfortune of my father committing suicide. As the Senator from North Dakota, I saw my father lying there after having shot himself. This is something that never leaves you. 
   People think suicide always happens to someone else, but it doesn't. I say to my friend from North Dakota, we could go around this room and we would be surprised; almost everyone in this Senate Chamber has had a relative, a neighbor, or a friend who committed suicide. It is remarkable and sad. 
   I appreciate the Senator from North Dakota sharing his story. The reason it is important he shares it is to recognize what a universal problem this is, at 31,000 people a year. We know, as I indicated a number of other times on this floor, many more people commit suicide. 
   I think the mere fact that we talk about it is going to help the problem. We now have this crisis hotline established. We also, of course, have support groups that we didn't have 15, 20 years ago. The problem is not getting easier, but it is getting better with people better understanding the issue.

   to have people such as Danielle Steel and Kay Jamison, who are experts, to come in and talk about their experiences. I am grateful to you for doing this, as I think anyone is who has had the misfortune of having had some connection with suicide. You are to be applauded for having done this with schedule that was really a burden to you.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I spoke about these two amendments at some length yesterday. I will abbreviate what I said yesterday. Every year, 600,000 injuries occur as a result of nurses and other health care professionals being stuck accidentally by needles. It is not because of any negligence on their part. It is because of the dangerousness of their work. 
   Approximately every 35 seconds, someone--usually a nurse--is stuck with a needle. It is estimated that the number of reported cases is underestimated. It is probably every 15 seconds, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, that these individuals are injured. So we have at least 20 diseases that are transmitted very easily by being stuck with needles. 
   I gave the account yesterday of two nurses. We could have given hundreds of thousands of different examples, but we gave two people--one was a woman from Reno, NV, and the other a woman from Massachusetts--whose lives were dramatically altered as a result of being stuck with needles while being nurses. One of them takes 21 pills a day; the other takes 22 pills a day. They are very, very ill--HIV and hepatitis C.  
   The purpose of these amendments is to have there be a standard established so that this, in fact, will not take place in the future. There are already needle-less instruments that can be used, which work just as well. The only problem is they are a little bit more expensive, and the health care system wants to save every penny, so they don't use them. In the short term and in the long term, money would be saved if, in fact, we used these new devices. 
   The lost time from individuals being stuck with these needles is very significant. People become disabled very quickly. So we need to stop this practice and have the Federal Government join with the private sector, in effect, to do away with needles as we now know them. 
   I would be happy to answer any questions Senators may have. This is something that has been debated in the past. It should become effective immediately. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands the challenge made by the Senator from New Hampshire. We, the minority, are willing to take that at any time. There was an education bill on the floor that we did not have anything to do with pulling. We are willing to start debating the education bill 10 minutes from now, 10 days from now. We have a lot of things about which we want to talk regarding education. 
   The Senator says there is something keeping this education bill from going forward. It is not our fault. We are willing to spend whatever time is necessary to complete debate on the education bill that was before this body for a short time earlier this year. We want to debate the education issue. 
   For people to say it got pulled because we wanted to talk about campaign finance reform, you bet we do. We still want to talk about campaign finance reform. But we want to talk about education issues also. The fact that we have an education bill on the floor does not mean we cannot talk about other issues. We would be willing to have the education bill come back, and we have a lot of education issues we would bring up immediately.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is interesting, I say to my friend from New Hampshire. We are in the Senate. My friend from New Hampshire has had wide experience in government. He served in the House of Representatives. We had the pleasure of serving together. He was Governor of the State of New Hampshire and has been a Senator for many years. He understands what the Senate is about as well as anybody in this Chamber. That is, we have had rules which have engaged this Senate for over 200 years, and they have worked well. We are the envy of the world, how our legislative body has worked for more than 200 years. 
   What I am saying to my friend from New Hampshire is, yes, we are willing to bring the education bill back today, tomorrow, any other time, but we do not need these self-imposed constraints. We are not the House of Representatives. We are the Senate. We have the ability to amend bills that come before this body. Had we been allowed the opportunity to treat the elementary and secondary education bill as legislation has been treated for two centuries in this body, we would have been long since completed with that and would have been on to other issues. 
   No one should think we are afraid to debate education issues. We have a lot of education issues to debate. The Senator from New Mexico and I have worked for 3 years on high school dropouts. I am not proud of the fact that the State of Nevada leads the Nation in high school dropouts. We lead the Nation. But we are not the only State that has a problem. Every State in this Union has a problem with high school dropouts. 
   In the United States, 3,000 children drop out of high school every day; 500,000 a year. I want to talk on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act about what we can do to keep kids in school. 
   The Senator from New Mexico will have an amendment that passed the Senate 3 years ago. Last year, on a strictly partisan vote, our amendment was killed in the Senate. Democrats voted for it. Republicans voted against our dropout amendment. It is really ``radical.'' I am saying that facetiously. What it would do is create, in the Department of Education, a dropout czar, someone who could look at programs that are working around the country and have challenge grants in various States, if they were interested in the program. We would not jam anything down anyone's throat. A simple program such as that was defeated. 
   We would be happy to ask unanimous consent--as Senator DASCHLE has done on other occasions--to resume consideration of the elementary and secondary education bill, and that following the two amendments previously ordered, the Senate consider the following first-degree amendments, subject to relevant second-degree amendments, and that they may be considered in an alternating fashion as the sponsors become available, and that they all be limited to 1 hour each equally divided in the usual form----

   Are you aware there are precedents for gun control amendments to education bills? In fact, is the Senator aware that in 1994, Senator GRAMM of Texas offered an amendment on 
   mandatory sentences for criminals who use guns, and it was put to a vote on the education bill that year?

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-16-20000627</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we know there are other things to do, but there is nothing more important to the American people--I know there is nothing more important to the people of the State of Nevada--than to do something about education. The Senator from Iowa talked about guns. Of course, they don't want to debate that issue, even though we did more than a year ago. Remember the clamor here that we had to do something as a result of the Columbine killings. Then we had a series of killings by guns in schools. We just recently had one in Florida where a boy was sent home because he was dropping water balloons. He came back and killed the teacher. There was no safety lock on that gun. It was laying around. Some felon had it. I don't know who had it. Anyway, the kid was able to get it. 
   The majority's argument is simply a smokescreen. Of course, they don't want to talk about gun safety. They also don't want to vote on other priority issues such as modernizing schools. The average school in America is almost 50 years old. In Nevada, because we have to build one new school a month, we also need some help building schools, renovating schools. We have a tremendously difficult problem. People think of Nevada as the most rural place in America. It is the most urban place in America. Over 90 percent of the people live in two communities: Reno and Las Vegas. We have the seventh largest school district in America, with over 230,000 students. We need some help. The majority does not want to modernize the schools. 
   Wouldn't it be great if we could do something about afterschool programs? That is where kids get in trouble, latchkey children, without sufficient supervision. We have amendments, some of which were read by the Senator and I, that deal with afterschool programs. We want to do something about having not only more teachers but better teachers. That is what we want to consider. That is why we want to talk about education. 
   The Senator from New Mexico is shortly going to offer an amendment dealing with quality education. If not now, he will do it later. I know it is something he has talked about. Yes, Senator LAUTENBERG wants to offer an amendment joined by numerous others. He is the lead sponsor to deal with safety in schools, more accountability. If the majority doesn't think that guns in schools and school safety are priorities for the American people, then they have not been reading the papers. They have not been reading their own mail that comes from home. These are important issues. 
   All we are asking is that the pending business, Order No. 491, a bill to extend programs and activities under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, be the order of the day; that it be called off the calendar and we get back to working on it. It is the pending business right now. It is here in the 
   Senate calendar of business. We should get back to that. We offered strict time agreements on all amendments, and then we get the retort from our friend from New Hampshire: Relevant, relevant. 
   We know what happens here. We know who controls what goes on. It is the majority. If they don't want something, it is not relevant. We are adults. We know how things work around here. We give them the title of the amendments; we tell them what they are about. We limit the time on them. I don't know what we could do that would be more fair and would allow this agenda to move along.  
   We want the opportunity to vote. We don't want the opportunity to debate for more than a half hour. A half hour is all we get. We feel very confident that our priorities are the needs of the majority of the people of this country. We are not afraid to vote on them. 
   The real reason the majority doesn't want to vote on these proposals is because we are going to win. People over there are going to vote with us. We are going to win. There are only 45 of us. We know we can't win unless we get support from the majority. We will get support from the majority. This is a procedural effort to block the education agenda of the minority from going forward. It is too bad.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act. 
   Historically, the Western Shoshone were the residents land in the northeastern corner of Nevada and parts of California. For more than a hundred years, the Western Shoshone have received no compensation for the loss of their tribal lands. In the 1950's, the Indian Lands Claim Commission was established to compensate Indians for lands ceded to the United States. The commission determined that Western Shoshone land had been taken through ``gradual encroachment,'' and awarded the tribe 26 million dollars. The commission's decision was later approved by the United States Supreme Court. However, it was not until 1979 that the United States appropriated more than 26 million dollars to reimburse the descendants of these tribes for their loss. 
   Mr. President, the Western Shoshone are not a wealthy people. A third of the tribal members are unemployed; for many of those who do have jobs, it is a struggle to live from one paycheck to the next. Wood stoves often provide the only source of heat in their aging homes. Like other American Indians, the Western Shoshone continue to be disproportionately affected by poverty and low educational achievement. The high school completion rate for Indian people between the ages of 20 and 24 is dismally low. American Indians have a drop-out rate 12.5 percent higher than the rest of the nation. For the majority of the Western Shoshone, the money contained in the settlement funds could lead to drastic lifestyle improvements. 
   Yet twenty years later, those three judgement funds still remain in the United States Treasury. The Western Shoshone have not received a single penny of the money which is rightfully theirs. In those twenty years, the original trust fund has grown to more than 121 million dollars. It is long past the time that this money should be delivered into the hands of its owners. The Western Shoshone Steering Committee has officially requested that Congress enact legislation to affect this distribution. 
   It has become increasingly apparent in recent years that the vast majority of those who qualify to receive these funds support an immediate distribution of their money. This Act will provide payments to eligible Western Shoshone tribal members and ensure that future generations of Western Shoshone will be able to enjoy the benefit of the distribution in perpetuity. Through the establishment of a tribally controlled grant trust fund, individual members of the Western Shoshone will be able to apply for money for education and other needs within limits set by a self-appointed committee of tribal members. 
   It is clear that the Western Shoshone want the funds from their claim distributed with all due haste. Members of the Western Shoshone gathered in Fallon and Elko, Nevada in May of 1998. They cast a vote overwhelmingly in favor of distributing the funds. 1,230 supported the distribution in the statewide vote; only 53 were opposed. I rise today in support and recognition of their decision. The final distribution of this fund has lingered for more than twenty years and it is clear that the best interests of the tribes will not be served by prolonging their wait. 
   Mr. President, twenty years has been more than long enough.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Maybe we can have our very competent staff walk down the hall and discuss that. In the meantime, I will speak about my amendment, and if it is appropriate at a subsequent time to offer it, I will do so.  
   I also extend my appreciation to the Senator from Mississippi, who is always so cordial and easy to work with. I recognize that we all have things to do, sometimes over which we have no control. It happens to me all the time. 
   I have spent a lot of time in hospitals in the last 10 or so years because of the illness of my wife. She is doing very fine now, but she has spent a lot of time in the hospital. Last August, she spent 18 days in the hospital. Prior to that, she spent a month in the hospital. 
   During her hospitalizations, the one thing I recognized more than anything else was the extremely important work of nurses. I understand how we depend on the doctors and that they are lifesavers, to say the least. But the personnel who are underappreciated and undercompensated are nurses. They work so hard and do so much for so little. We need to do more to protect nurses, and the amendments that I am going to offer, when I have that opportunity, relate to nurses. 
   First of all, I am going to offer an amendment that is going to recognize how dangerous nurses' work is. Nurses spend every day of their lives afraid that they are going to be stuck by mistake with a needle. 
   One of my amendments would allow the Secretary of Labor to amend OSHA's blood-borne pathogen standard to require that employers use needle-less or safe needles and to require that employers create a sharp injury log to keep detailed information about on-the-job needle-stick injuries. 
   My second amendment would establish a new clearinghouse within the National Institutes of Occupational Safety and Health to collect data on engineered safety technology designed to prevent the risk of needle sticks. I have worked with the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, for a number of years on this problem. This amendment would relate directly to that problem. 
   Keep in mind that needle sticks occur routinely. About 600,000 needle sticks occur in America every year--not 60,000, not 600--600,000. Every 39 seconds, a nurse in America is accidentally stuck with a needle. This is a tremendously difficult problem. We could give example after example. I know we don't want to do that. But I am going to give a couple of examples. 
   In October 1997, a woman from Reno, NV, by the name of Lisa Black, a registered nurse, was nursing a man who had a terminal case of AIDS when a needle that had been used on him accidentally stuck her. Today, she is a very sick woman. She is infected not only with HIV, but she also has hepatitis C. Lisa Black, who was a totally healthy person prior to that day in October 1997 when she was accidentally stuck in the hand with a needle, now takes 22 pills a day to keep her HIV infection from progressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects of hepatitis C. 
   Karen Daley is a nurse from Massachusetts. In fact, she is presently in a nurses association in Massachusetts. She had been a nurse for more than 20 years when she sustained a needle-stick injury when she reached her gloved hand into a needle box to dispose of the needle from which she had drawn blood. She was stuck with another needle. 
   Just last week, in testimony before the House Subcommittee on Workforce Protection, Karen Daley described how the needle-stick injury caused her to contract both hepatitis C and HIV, which changed her life. I quote from part of her testimony.  
   In the first year of my treatment I took a daily regimen that consisted of 21 pills a day and an injection that caused a wide range of side effects, among them: weight loss, nausea, loss of appetite, hair loss, headaches, skin rashes, severe fatigue and bone marrow depression. To say these side effects interfered with my normal day-to-day routine is a gross understatement. The single moment when my injury occurred 18 months ago has changed many other things for me. In addition to the emotional turmoil it has created for myself, my family, my friends, my colleagues--it has cost me much more than I can ever describe in words. As a result of my injury, I have given up direct nursing practice, work that I love.  
   Karen Daley did everything in her power and took all the necessary precautions--including wearing gloves and following proper procedures--to reduce risk of exposure to bloodborne pathogens. Her injury did not occur because she was careless or distracted or not paying attention to what she was doing. 
   These needlesticks just occur. Karen Daley has good reason to believe that had a safer needle and disposal system been in place at her hospital, she would not be sick today. According to the CDC, eighty percent of all needlestick injuries can be prevented through the use of safer needles. 
   Senator BOXER and I have introduced legislation that would dramatically reduce the risk of needlestick injuries by requiring hospitals and health-care facilities to use safe needles and keep better track of needlestick injuries. 
   When I offered this bill as an amendment last year, many of my colleagues, including the chairman of the HELP Committee, assured me that they were concerned about this problem and were committed to working on it. 
   Another year has passed, and still, nothing has been accomplished. 
   In the year since I offered this amendment,there have been approximately 600,000 accidental needle wounds--that is one injury every 39 seconds. 
   If we don't do something this coming year, there will be 600,000 more needle sticks, and a number of them will wind up as did Karen Daley and Lisa Black--infected with HIV, hepatitis C, and other debilitating diseases. 
   The actual number of needlestick injuries is probably much higher, because these injuries are considered to be widely under-reported. Several studies show needlestick under-reporting rates of between 40 and 90 percent. 
   We could have over 1 million needle sticks every year instead of every 39 seconds and every 15 seconds. Some people do not report their injuries. 
   The longer we wait, the more people--nurses, housekeeping staff, and anyone who handles blood, blood products, and biological samples--will be at risk of contracting a number of debilitating, if not deadly, diseases. 
   There are more than a score of diseases we know of to which nurses and other related personnel are subject to being infected. I mentioned HIV. Hepatitis B and C and malaria may be transferred from just a speck of blood--a very small amount of blood. 
   Despite the fact that safer devices have been available since the 1970s and that we know that more than 80 percent of needlestick injuries can be prevented through their use, fewer than 15 percent of U.S. hospitals have switched over to these safer devices, except in states that have enacted laws requiring them. 
   My amendments would ensure that the necessary tools--better information and better medical devices--are made available to front-line health care workers in order to reduce the injuries and deaths that result from needle sticks. 
   My amendment would establish a new clearinghouse within NIOSH to collect data on engineering safety technology designed to help prevent the risk of needle sticks, would allow the Secretary of Labor to amend OSHA's blood-borne pathogen standard to require employers to use needle-less or safe needles, and would require that employers create a sharp injury log to keep data on on-the-job needle-stick injuries. 
   The companion measure Senator BOXER and I sponsored in the House received overwhelming support. To date, it has 181 cosponsors. In the Senate, we also have support for our legislation, in addition to Senator BOXER and the Senator offering the amendment at this time. 
   Protecting the health and safety of our front-line health care workers should not be a partisan issue. 
   I urge my colleagues to work with me to have the amendments agreed to so that injuries and deaths from needle-stick injuries can be avoided. 
   Again, having spent time in hospitals and seeing how hard the nurses work, I had not realized that in America every 15 to 30 seconds women or men working as nurses stab themselves accidentally and subject themselves to these terrible diseases. 
   I ask the Senator from Mississippi if we have any word from down the hall yet.

   I hope we can move this bill along quicker. There are lots of amendments.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, as this week progresses, we are going to be busier and busier and there will be less time to say what I want to say. 
   I said at our subcommittee hearing how much I admire and respect the work Senator HARKIN and Senator SPECTER do in the subcommittee. The audience there was very small. Hopefully, the audience here is bigger. I want everyone to understand what great work Senator HARKIN has done with Senator SPECTER on this subcommittee. 
   This year--and the President made an announcement today--we have a surplus of $217 billion. We have not had that in recent years. This subcommittee, in spite of the fact it has been fighting for money, has done wonderful things dealing with the National Institutes of Health. They have been the leaders in stem cell research. They held hearings. That work being done on stem cell research, together with the work being done on the human genome, is the same as the work we did with computers and the Internet. What we did 10 years ago with the computer is nothing compared to what we can do now, and the same is going to be true when we understand the genomes each of us has, together with stem cell research and some of the other things being done as the result of the funding of this subcommittee. 
   When the history books are written, the work the two Senators have done in funding this very important research is going to be a big chapter. There is hope, as the Senator mentioned. The people who have multiple sclerosis, diabetes, Alzheimer's, and Parkinson's are going to benefit from the work done with the funding of this subcommittee. 
   I hope the Senator from Iowa knows how much he is appreciated. This is as important as anything we have ever done in this Congress. Half the people  in the rest homes in America today are there because of two things: Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. Think what it will mean for not only the people who are sick but their loved ones. Think how good it will be if we can do something to delay the onset of these two diseases or, when the miracle does come, we can cure them. Think how important it will be for them and their families. In addition to that, think how important it will be for the American taxpayers. Billions of dollars go into taking care of people who have these two diseases. 
   On behalf of the people of the State of Nevada, and I think I can speak for the people of this country, the Senator is appreciated. I hope he understands that. It is great work. We hear so much negative in the press about no one will cooperate with anything. What this subcommittee does is an example of what the rest of the Congress should do. The work of the Senator from Pennsylvania and the Senator from Iowa has been good. I want the Senator to know how much I appreciate what he has done.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make sure we understand late today that we are not the ones who have offered this contentious amendment. This is a very important bill that involves hundreds of billions of dollars. The two managers have worked on this, and they have a bill we can make presentable to the rest of the Senate. I just want to make sure, when I am called upon, and others are called upon, we are not the ones who offered this contentious amendment. We are not going to move off this amendment--that is the point I am making--until it is resolved one way or the other. If there is some concern about that, I think the people who want this bill moved should try to invoke cloture. It won't be invoked, but that is the only alternative.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, in the capital city of India, a woman is burned to death every 12 hours. Earlier this week, NPR reported the story of a courageous survivor of a phenomenon that is commonly referred to as ``dowry deaths.'' Joti Dowan was held prisoner by her husband and mother-in-law for two years because she refused to ask her mother for a $1,000 dowry. 
   Locked in a tiny room, isolated from friends and family, and rationed only two pieces of bread a day, Joti weighed only 55 pounds when authorities found her. Frequent beatings and malnutrition left her too weak to stand without help. A long scar covers her arm because, at one point during her torture, her husband and his family tried to kill her by dousing her with kerosene. It was only because they feared her screams would alert the neighbors that they extinguished the fire. 
   Shelanie Agerwall was shot and killed by her husband when he became dissatisfied with the new car that originally came with her dowry. He traded in the vehicle for a more expensive one and demanded his wife's family compensate him for the extra cost. When Shelanie Agerwall's family did not pay him quickly enough, he murdered her. 
   Death resulting from dowry disputes are on the rise. In 1998, 12,600 women in India were victims of dowry deaths--a 15 percent increase from the previous year. Burning a woman to death is the most common form of dowry death. Commonly referred to as ``bride burning,'' women are doused with kerosene and lit on fire. In many cases, their murder is planned to look like a cooking accident. 
   The law provides little or no support for the victims of dowry disputes. Corruption is rampant throughout the system--police are bribed by the husbands' families to destroy evidence, doctors are persuaded to change their testimony, and the legal system rarely convicts husbands and families guilty of dowry deaths. 
   Dowry has evolved from a custom to a form of extortion. The demand for quick money to buy consumer goods has increased the demands for so-called ``dowries'' throughout India. As a result, the use of dowries has spread to communities which never before had a dowry custom. The growing middle class has been met by eager manufacturers. Conspicuous consumption demands greater dowry payments. 
   In April, a 29-year-old Pakistani woman was shot dead in the law office of a leading human rights activist. Her parents had ordered the killing because she had shamed the family by seeking a divorce. 
   Perveen Aktar, a 37-year-old woman living in Pakistan, was severely burned in September when her husband, a fruit peddler, threw acid on her. According to Aktar, whose face, back, and chest are badly scarred, her husband wanted to return to his first wife, and she refused. She went to the police, but her husband paid them a series of bribes, and they did not investigate. 
   These women's struggles are a part of a larger epidemic of ``honor killings''--or culturally sanctioned killing of women in the name of preserving a family's honor. ``Honor crimes'' remain a serious problem in many countries, including: Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and Egypt. 
   Few statistics are available on honor crimes, but the independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan reported that in 1998 and 1999, more than 850 women were killed by their husbands, brothers, fathers or other relatives in Punjab, Pakistan's most populous province. 
   In many of those cases, the woman was suspected of what was considered ``immoral behavior.'' According to lawyers and women's rights advocates, many such cases are never brought to trial. Police are easily bribed or persuaded by the men's families to dismiss the complaints as ``domestic accidents.'' 
   Some say that the problems of ``dowry deaths'' and ``honor killings'' are cultural. These problems are criminal, not cultural, and we have an obligation to do something about it. 
   The amendment I offered would encourage the Secretary of State to meet with representatives from countries that have a high incidence of ``dowry deaths'' and ``honor killings'' to assess ways to work together to increase awareness about these problems and to  develop strategies to end these practices. 
   The United States, as a world leader, needs to realize its influence in the world. I do not believe it is our place to go into other countries and dictate their traditions. But at the same time, we need to send a message to those countries that condone the brutal killings of innocent women.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, over the years, I have come to the Senate floor on many occasions to talk about female genital mutilation (FGM). Still, it is very difficult for me to stand here and talk about something as repulsive, as cruel and as unusual as the practice of FGM. But ignoring this issue because of the discomfort it causes us does nothing but perpetuate the silent acquiescence of its practice. 
   For those who are unfamiliar with this ritual, FGM is the cutting away of the female genitals and then sewing up the opening, leaving only a small hole for urine and menstrual flow. In many cases, the girl's legs are bound together for weeks while a permanent scar forms. It is performed on girls between the ages of 4 and 12. 
   This is a practice that has been around for thousands of years and is not going to go away overnight. We need to continue to talk about it and insist upon aggressive education of the African communities that practice it, as well as the implementation of laws prohibiting it. 
   Several years ago, I passed legislation that requires the Health and Human Services Secretary to identify and compile data on immigrant communities in the United States who are practicing FGM. I worked to pass legislation, that is now law, to make criminal the practice of FGM in the United States. 
   I have offered two amendments that would keep the United States focused on its work to eliminate FGM abroad. One amendment would allow US AID (US Agency for International Development) to spend up to $1.5 million on its activities to eradicate FGM. My second amendment requires the Secretary of State to further study FGM and to submit her findings along with a set of recommendations on how the United States can best work to eliminate the practice of FGM to Congress by June 1, 2001.

   I suggest the best thing to do, as I think the leader has already said he is going to do, is move forward with the debate on this amendment. There are tremendous feelings on both sides of the issue. People feel strongly about it. We should debate it for a while and see if something can be resolved. I hope, if we cannot do that, we might be able to move on to something else that needs to be completed.

I think it is going to be real difficult to do that. We won't know for sure until we get our amendments at 3 o'clock. Considering that the first amendment is going to take until after noon, it is going to be difficult to do all the amendments that need to be done. I know there is going to be a number of them filed. We are all anxious to get to the Labor-HHS bill. It is very important, and it is going to take several days to do that. As I have indicated, the majority will have our cooperation, but we have to be realistic as to when we will be able to finish this bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I personally appreciate the Senator from South Carolina recognizing Senator INOUYE. I have not served in Congress nearly as long, of course, as the Senator from South Carolina, but during my term in Congress, which is now 18 years, there is no one that I have more admiration for than Senator INOUYE. He has been like a father to me in the Senate. He has been an adviser and a confidant. He is someone for whom I have the deepest respect. 
   I have followed, as have others, his war record. And that is what it is; he is certainly a warrior. The outline that was given by the Senator from South Carolina of Senator INOUYE's extraordinary deeds is dramatic, but it did not cover everything that Senator INOUYE did on that day of valor. 
   I think it is wonderful that finally Senator INOUYE is going to be recognized, as he should be, with the Congressional Medal of Honor. 
   Senator INOUYE has many stories to tell. I hope someday they are told. During the time he spent in the hospital with Senator Dole, their friendship developed. That is one of the friendships that has served the American people well. 
   Even though Senator INOUYE lost a limb, he does remarkable things. He plays the piano. One of our colleagues has a broken arm, Senator HOLLINGS. With his wit and with a lot of humility, Senator INOUYE asked Senator HOLLINGS who had tied his tie that morning. Senator HOLLINGS said he had had help doing that. Senator INOUYE ties his tie himself with one arm. 
   Senator INOUYE is someone who has not only been valiant on the battlefield in Italy but he has also been valiant on the battlefield in the Congress of the United States, having served in the U.S. House of Representatives and having served in the Senate. 
   I had the good fortune to come to the Senate and be placed on the Appropriations Committee, and I was able to watch this master legislator in action. He is someone who doesn't talk a lot, even though he is an extremely fine speaker. But he is a good legislator; he gets things done. I have watched him maneuver bills through the legislative process as no one else can. 
   Mr. President, I am so grateful that he is being recognized today. There will be a ceremony at the White House where he will be given this long overdue award. Having this award is only part of what this man deserves. I want to spread across this RECORD how much I and everyone in the Senate--Democrat and Republican--respect and admire this great legislator and this great soul. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, in Las Vegas a gay man was shot to death because he was gay. In Reno, someone went to a city park with the specific purpose to find someone who was gay, found him, and killed him. These types of incidents have happened not once, not twice, but numerous times in Nevada, and thousands of times around this country. 
   I only mention two of the occasions where someone's son, someone's brother was killed. They were human beings. These people were killed not because of wanting to steal from them, not because of wanting to do anything other than to kill them because of who they were. They were killed because someone hated them. 
   Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Local Law Enforcement Act of 2000. I am an original cosponsor of the freestanding legislation authored by the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY. I commend Senator KENNEDY for his tireless efforts to ensure that the Senate consider and pass this important and much-needed measure. This is important legislation, and I am very happy that we are now at a point where this legislation can be debated in the Senate. 
   Hate crimes legislation is needed because, according to the FBI, nearly 60,000 hate crimes incidents have been reported in the last 8 years. In 1998, the latest year for which FBI figures are available, nearly 8,000 hate crimes incidents were reported. But these figures are more frightening when we ponder how many hate crimes are not reported to law enforcement authorities. 
   Unfortunately, the Federal statutes currently used to prosecute hate-based violence need to be updated. That is what Senator KENNEDY is doing. These Federal laws, many of which were passed during the Reconstruction era as a response to widespread violence against former slaves, do not cover incidents of hate-based crimes based upon a person's sexual orientation, gender, or disability. In 1998, again, the last year for which statistics are available, there were 1,260 hate crimes incidents based on sexual orientation reported to law enforcement. Many more took place. These are only the ones that were reported. This figure, which represents about 16 percent of all hate crimes reported in 1998, demonstrates that current law must be changed to include sexual orientation under the definition of hate crimes. 
   I have listened to the debate on the floor today. I think we all have some remembrance of the terrible series of events which occurred in Jasper, TX, a couple years ago. On June 7, the country paused to remember the second anniversary of James Byrd, Jr.'s horrific death, when he was dragged along a rural back road in Texas. This man was just walking along the road when certain people, because of the color of his skin, grabbed him, beat him, and if that wasn't enough, they tied him, while he was still alive, to the back of their pickup and dragged him until he died. 
   Due to the race-based nature of the Byrd murder, Federal authorities were able to offer significant assistance, including Federal dollars, to aid in the investigation and prosecution of that case to ensure that justice was served. 
   Unfortunately, the same cannot be said about another case that has already been talked about here on the floor today; the case of Matthew Shepard. He was a very small man. In spite of his small size, two men, assisted by one or both of their girlfriends, took this man from a bar because he was gay, and, among other things, tied him to a fencepost and killed him. 
   This was gruesome. It was a terrible beating and murder of this student from the University of Wyoming. But, what makes this 
   case even more disturbing is that Wyoming authorities did not have enough money to prosecute the case. They did, of course, but in order to finalize the prosecution of that case, they had to lay off five of their law enforcement employees. The local authorities could not get any Federal resources because current hate crimes legislation does not extend to victims of hate crimes based upon sexual orientation. 
   If there were no other reason in the world that we pass this legislation than the Matthew Shepard case, we should do it. I have great respect for those people in Wyoming who went to great sacrifice to prosecute that case. 
   The hate crimes legislation being offered to the Defense Authorization bill is a sensible approach to combat these crimes based upon hate. The measure would extend basic hate crimes protections to all Americans, in all communities, by adding real or perceived sexual orientation, gender, or disability categories to be covered. 
   The amendment would also remove limitations under current law which require that victims of hate crimes be engaged in a federally protected activity. 
   There may be those who are listening to this debate and wondering why we need to protect those people who are handicapped or disabled? We need only look back at some of the genocide of the Second World War and recognize that Hitler was totally opposed to anyone who was not, in his opinion, quite right. He went after people who had disabilities. 
   So there are people, as sad as it may seem, who not only are hateful of people who are of a different color, a different religion, a different sexual orientation, but also someone who does not have all their physical or mental capacities. 
   We must give law enforcement the tools they need to combat this kind of  violence, to help ensure that every American can live in an environment free of terror brought on by hatred and violence. 
   As Senator KENNEDY will say, this amendment has been carefully drafted and modified to assure its constitutionality under current Supreme Court precedents and has been reexamined in light of the recent Morrison decision which invalidated the civil rights remedy in the Violence Against Women Act. I appreciate the work done by Senator KENNEDY and the Judiciary Committee for taking such a close look at this legislation. 
   I have shared with my colleagues two incidents in Nevada. There are many, many others. There are incidents in all 50 States and the District of Columbia of people who have been kidnaped, beaten, raped, and murdered as a result of their sexual orientation. Court records reveal that in each of these cases, with rare exception, there is hate that spews out of these people's mouths before the act takes place, derogatory names and slurs as they are taking people to their deaths, brutal sadistic murders. 
   These victims are someone's son, someone's daughter, someone's brother, someone's sister, someone's loved one. People should not be killed because they are different; they should not be killed because someone has a certain, misguided standard of how someone else should be. People should not be killed because of hate. 
   We live in America, the land of freedom and opportunity. We should make sure we stand for morality based upon people's accomplishments, not because of their race, color, creed, or sexual orientation. 
   I extend my congratulations to Senator KENNEDY for the work he has done. I hope these two men, Senators HATCH and KENNEDY, who have worked so closely on legislation over the years, will see that this important aspect of the law which needs to be revised is revised in such a way that we can all hold our heads high and say: When these crimes take place in the future, authorities in States such as Wyoming will not have to lay off five law enforcement officers to prosecute the crime.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have the pleasure to stand today and celebrate the career of a very fine public school teacher. She is Mrs. Susan Wargo, a third grade school teacher at Franklin Sherman Elementary School in Fairfax County, Virginia. She is retiring this year, after teaching school for 28 years. She and her husband Mike, will be relocating to Aiken, South Carolina. 
   I know about Mrs. Wargo because she teaches my granddaughter, Mattie  Barringer. Mattie loves Mrs. Wargo, and its not hard to figure out why. She has captured Mattie's imagination and won her heart. Mattie has learned ancient history, economics, math, and literature from Mrs. Wargo, but she could have learned those things from anybody. Mrs. Wargo's lasting contribution to Mattie's education is the atmosphere she created in her classroom. She embraced her students, made them feel comfortable, taught them how to learn, and got them to accomplish great things--more than they ever thought they were capable of doing. Mrs. Wargo is that amazing teacher that we all can remember: the one that cared about us, that took an interest in us, that rooted for us, and made us passionate to learn. 
   I had a teacher like Mrs. Wargo when I was a young boy--her name was Mrs. Pickard and I am glad my granddaughter was lucky enough to have such a teacher so early in her education. Teachers like Mrs. Wargo immeasurably enrich our lives. My daughter Lana--Mattie's mother--tells me that when talking about Mattie in a parent-teacher conference, Mrs. Wargo's voice seemed to break just slightly with emotion as she spoke passionately about Mattie's talents and potential. My daughter came away from that conference amazed at this great teacher. 
   It is hard to express these feelings we have about great teachers. Mattie did a much better job than I have done here in a recent letter to Mrs. Wargo. She wrote: ``When I came to this school, you made me feel special. You always make me feel good about myself. I'll miss you.'' 
   With those words, I am delighted to pay tribute to Mrs. Wargo, and to her colleagues like her who serve in the public schools. Mrs. Wargo, my family thanks you for your many gifts to Mattie. We want you to know that the good you have done so far in your life has been noticed, and much appreciated.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the California Trail Interpretive Act. 
   The nineteenth century westward emigration on the California National Historic Trail, which occurred from 1840 until the completion of the transcontinental railroad in 1869, was an important cultural and historical era in the settlement of the West. This influx of settlers contributed to the development of lands in the western United States by Americans and immigrants and to the prevention of colonization of the west coast by Russia and the British Empire. More than 300,000 settlers traveled the California Trail and many documented their amazing experiences in detailed journals. Under the National Trails System Act, the Secretary of Interior may establish interpretation centers to document and celebrate pioneer trails such as the California National Historic Trail. In Nevada, Elko County alone contains over 435 miles of National Historic Trails. 
   Mr. President, recognition and interpretation of the pioneer experience on the Trail is appropriate in light of Americans' strong interest in understanding our history and heritage. Those who pursue Western Americana, and thousands do, will find physical evidence of the documented hardships facing the original pioneers. One pioneer journal bemoaned the death of an elderly lady traveling west with her family. Her grave and its marker are in evidence in the Beowawe Cemetery near the trail river crossing known as Gravely Ford for those searching for historical confirmation. And, if the present-day explorers choose to walk part of the California Trail, they may do so at this place. To the east of this river crossing is around five miles of undisturbed trail that leads down from what is known as ``Emigrant Pass''. 
   This Act authorizes the planning, construction and operation of a visitor center. The cooperative parties include the State of Nevada, the Advisory Board for the National Historic California Emigrant Trails Interpretive Center, Elko County, the City of Elko, and Bureau of Land Management. 
   This interpretive center will be located near the city of Elko, in northeastern Nevada. The location is the junction of the California Trail and the Hastings Cutoff. The ill-fated Reed-Donner party spent an additional 31 days meandering over the so-called Hastings Cutoff route; precious time wasted that kept them from crossing the deadly Sierra Nevada before winter struck in 1846. 
   This act will recognize the California Trail, including the Hastings Cutoff, for its national historical and cultural significance through the construction of an interpretive facility devoted to the vital role of Pioneer trails in the West in the development of the United States.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Las Vegas Wash Wetland Restoration and Lake Mead Water Quality Improvement Act of 2000. This bill is important for Nevada's families and for the environment, because water is our most precious natural resource. 
   My bill is the product of a visionary, locally-led initiative designed to develop and implement a plan that would enhance and protect water quality in the Las Vegas basin. 
   Importantly, my bill would safeguard southern Nevada's water supply and improve the unique desert wetlands environment of the Las Vegas Wash. 
   I would like to review some of the history that contributed to the development of this bill. 
   In 1998, in response to a recommendation by a citizens' water quality advisory committee, the Las Vegas Wash Coordination Committee was formed to develop a comprehensive Adaptive Management Plan (AMP) for the Las Vegas Wash ecosystem. 
   The AMP, which was developed by the Las Vegas Wash Coordinating Committee over the past two years and approved early this year by the Southern Nevada Water Authority, represents a vision for how local, State, and Federal stakeholders can work together to achieve shared water quality and ecosystem restoration goals in the Las Vegas basin. 
   First and foremost, the AMP is a locally-driven strategy. The stakeholder working group, coordinated by the Southern Nevada Water Authority and comprised of 28 groups, contributed their varied perspectives and good ideas to the development of this plan. 
   A draft of the AMP was published for public comment in October 1999. In January 2000, the Southern Nevada Water Authority finalized and approved the AMP. 
   Chief among the recommendations in the AMP was the call for development of a partnership consisting of local, State, Federal agencies with interests in the Las Vegas Wash ecosystem. 
   I view this plan as a Nevada solution to a tremendous local challenge of accelerated erosion and deteriorating water quality. 
   I commend the local, State, and Federal stakeholders that helped create the AMP for their hard work, cooperation, and dedication to improving Southern Nevada's environment for Nevada's families today and for future generations. 
   The Federal government, by virtue of its land ownership in Nevada and responsibilities at Lake Mead, has an obligation to help make the plan work. 
   In addition, the Federal government is uniquely responsible for the perchlorate contamination which contributes to the groundwater contamination that pollutes Las Vegas Wash run-off. 
   My bill directs the relevant Federal agencies to participate in efforts to restore Las Vegas Wash and protect Lake Mead's water quality. These agencies include: the Environmental Protection Agency, the Bureau of Land Management, the Bureau of Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Natural Resources Conservation Service, the Fish and Wildlife Service, and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   I hope that the Senate will move quickly to consider and pass this bill so that Federal agencies can become full partners in the effort to rehabilitate and conserve the Las Vegas Wash desert ecosystem and to improve water quality in southern Nevada's most heavily used watershed.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Washoe Tribe Lake Tahoe Access Act. 
   In 1997, I helped convene a Presidential Forum at Lake Tahoe to discuss the future of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Together with President Clinton, Federal, State, and local government leaders, we addressed the protection of the extraordinary natural, recreational, and ecological resources of the Lake Tahoe region. Goals and an action plan developed during the Lake Tahoe Forum were codified as the ``Presidential Forum Deliverables.'' These Deliverables included supporting the traditional and customary use of the Lake Tahoe Basin by the Washoe Tribe. Perhaps, most importantly, the Deliverables include a provision designed to provide the Washoe Tribe access to the shore of Lake Tahoe for cultural purposes. 
   Mr. President, the ancestral homeland of the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California included an area of over 10,000 square miles in and around Lake Tahoe. The purpose of this Act is to ensure that the members of the Washoe Tribe have the opportunity to engage in traditional and customary cultural practices on the shore of Lake Tahoe including spiritual renewal, land stewardship, Washoe horticulture and ethnobotany, subsistence gathering, traditional learning, and reunification of tribal and family bonds as was envisioned by the parties involved in the Lake Tahoe Presidential Forum. 
   Mr. President, this Act will convey 24.3 acres from the Secretary of Agriculture to the Secretary of the Interior to be held in trust for the Washoe Tribe. This is land located within the Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit north of Skunk Harbor, Nevada. The land in question would be conveyed with the expectation that it would be used for traditional and customary uses and stewardship conservation of the Washoe Tribe and will not permit any commercial use. In the unlikely event this land were used for any commercial development purpose, title to the land will revert to the Secretary of Agriculture. It is my sincere hope that Congress will pass this bill thereby making the Presidential Deliverables of the Lake Tahoe forum a reality by ensuring that the Washoe Tribe once again enjoy access to Lake Tahoe.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I want to make sure that everyone understands the minority. 
   We are doing our best to be cooperative here. But the original arrangement was that we would be able to spend some time on the Defense authorization bill. Under this agreement that will be entered shortly, we will be very lucky to finish a vote on the CAFE instructions to conferees by 7 o'clock tonight. That is an inappropriate time for us to begin some very serious deliberations that we have on a matter relating to Cuba, to abortion, and to military hospitals. 
   So I want the majority to be put on notice that we expect, next week, to have adequate time to go into these issues, and others. There has been a gentlemen's understanding between the two leaders that we would do half and half. We just haven't been getting our half over here on the authorization matters. We hope there will be something done next week to allow us to do that. Otherwise, we could have some problems. 
   I have no objection.

   I further ask consent that when the Senate resumes the DOD authorization bill at 3 p.m. on Monday, it be considered under the following terms: 
   That the pending B. Smith amendment and the Warner amendment be laid aside and Senator KENNEDY be recognized to offer his amendment regarding hate crimes, and immediately following that offering, the amendment be laid aside and Senator HATCH or his designee be recognized to offer his hate crimes amendment. 
   I further ask that the two amendments be debated concurrently and that no amendments be in order to either amendment prior to the votes in relation thereto and that the vote occur in relation to the Hatch amendment to be followed by the Kennedy amendment following the vote in relation to the Murray amendment on Tuesday. 
   I also ask that at 9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Senator DODD be recognized to offer his amendment relative to a Cuba commission and there be 120 minutes equally divided on the amendment prior to a motion to table and no amendments be in order prior to the vote, with the vote occurring in a stacked sequence following the two votes ordered regarding hate crimes. 
   I further ask consent that at 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, the Dodd amendment be laid aside and Senator MURRAY be recognized to offer her amendment relative to abortions and there be a time limit of 2 hours under the same terms as outlined above with the vote occurring at 3:15 p.m. on Tuesday. 
   I further ask consent that the Senate stand in recess between the hours of 12:30 p.m. and 2:15 p.m. on Tuesday in order for the weekly party conferences to meet. 
   I also ask that there be 4 minutes of debate prior to each vote in the voting sequence on Tuesday and no further amendments be in order prior to the 3:15 p.m. votes. 
   I finally ask consent that the Senate proceed to S. 2522, the foreign operations appropriations bill following the disposition of the above mentioned amendments and any amendments thereto and no call for the regular order serve to displace this bill, except one made by the majority leader or minority leader.

I hope we can move in an orderly fashion to dispose of the Smith amendment, as amended. We can move forward and give Senator DODD an opportunity to move forward with what he desires to do. 
   In effect, I hope we can do more than just deal with cleared amendments. The arrangement between Senators LOTT and DASCHLE is that we would have the right on a subsequent piece of legislation to legislate. That is what we want to do. We have cooperated. We have moved expeditiously in getting rid of that very large Defense appropriations bill in a matter of a day and a half.

We are the great superpower. We are also the superpower of computer development. But in spite of that fact, about 60 percent of the computers manufactured in the United States are sold overseas. Only 40 percent of the computers manufactured in this great country are sold internally. 
   The problem is there is now a provision requiring a 180-day review period to sell a computer, meaning that we are slowly but surely losing our ability to control the computer market. Why is that?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, they set forth the problem in this letter. Among other things, this letter says:  
   .....the current provision in law would understandably be aimed at protecting the highest performing computers from being exported to countries of particular foreign policy concern. Yet just last year, a late threshold adjustment coupled with the 6-month waiting period, led to American companies, Apple and IBM, being effectively denied the ability to sell single-processor personal computers in some markets because technology has advanced so rapidly that yesterday's supercomputers had literally become today's personal computers.  
   It wasn't many years ago that I went to the fifth floor of the Clark County Courthouse in Las Vegas. I took a tour of the fifth floor. On the entire fifth floor of this big building was a big computer that handled all of the processing for Clark County. The temperature had to be perfectly controlled. That floor is now gone. It is used for other things. That same processing of information can now be accomplished with a computer the size of a personal computer. 
   I was able, fortunately, to work with Congress and obtain a supercomputer for the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. We had a big celebration. At that time, the computer was very large. It was probably the size of two of these Senate desks. That supercomputer is now 10 years old. A supercomputer today is not a big piece of equipment. 
   We are living in the Dark Ages. We have to change the law. 
   In an effort to compromise, the House established a 60-day waiting period. It passed by a vote of 415-8. 
   We worked very hard to get a bill in the Senate. We have been stymied, quite frankly. 
   There has been a bipartisan effort by Senator GRAMM of Texas, Senator ENZI, Senator JOHNSON, and I. We worked very hard last year. 
   The amendment that I am going to offer today is cosponsored by Senator BENNETT of Utah, a Republican. This is not a partisan issue. It shouldn't be. But it is being held up for reasons that are so antiquated. The cold war is over. There is no need to have this legislation stymied. We are hurting the American manufacturing base. 
   We are going to get letters from the Chamber of Commerce. Literally all business in America wants this to pass. But in the Senate, two or three people are holding this up and preventing it from moving forward. 
   As I indicated, this amendment has the broad support from the high-tech industry. 
   I would bet, if we get a chance to vote on this, that 90 Senators will vote for it. 
   This amendment will shorten the congressional review period for high-performance computers from 180 days to 30 days. 
   On the Appropriations Committee alone, just to pick out one committee, Senators BENNETT, MURRAY, and GORTON are cosponsors of this legislation introduced in the Senate, and there will probably be more today. 
   We are operating, as I have said, under cold-war-era regulations. If we want to remain the world leader in computers and the high-tech arena, we must make this change immediately. 
   As I have indicated, I worked for the past year to try to get an amendment up so we could do this. We started debate on one measure. It was pulled from the floor. The congressional review period is six times longer than the review period for munitions. 
   If there is a company that wants to sell rockets, tanks, warships, or high-performance aircraft under the foreign military sales program, it requires a 30-day review period. But if you want to sell a laptop computer such as the one I have in my office, you have to wait 6 months. In that period of time, American industry could not meet the demand. We are falling behind. Manufacturing is already beginning in other places. We don't have a lock on how to manufacture computers. We are ahead of the world right now. 
   I repeat that 60 percent of the computers we manufacture in the United States are sold outside the United States. The review period for computers is six times longer than for selling to another country a battleship, a high-performance aircraft, or a rocket. 
   In February, the President, at the urging of Members of Congress, proposed changes to the controls on high-performance computers, the so-called MTOPS, but because of the 180-day review period, the changes have yet to be implemented. The U.S. companies are losing foreign market share to many different entities. This is a bipartisan effort, and we should pass it. We are stifling U.S. companies' growth. 
   Last week, I had a meeting in my office with a number of CEOs of big companies--IBM, Compaq, and others. This is their No. 1 agenda item. It is the base of their business. They make computers, and they want to be able to sell them. A strong economy and a strong U.S. military depend on our leadership. U.S. companies have to be given the opportunity to compete worldwide in order to continue to lead the world in technological advances. Our export regulations are the most stringent in the world, giving foreign competitors a head start, to say the least. 
   U.S. industry faces stiff competition as foreign governments allow greater export flexibility, placing America at a greater disadvantage. Many of the manufacturers have no export controls. The current export control system interferes with legitimate U.S. exports because it doesn't keep pace with technology. The MTOPS level of microprocessors increased fivefold from 1998 to 1999. This is the speed of computers for my base description. 
   From 1998 to 1999, there has been a fivefold increase. Today's level will  more than double in 6 months because they are introducing something called the Intel Itanium chip. In a period of 2 years, there is going to be a tenfold increase in the ability of these microprocessors. New export controls will not take effect until the completion of the required 6-month waiting period. By then, the thresholds will be obsolete and American companies will have lost considerable market share again to foreign markets. The current export control system doesn't protect U.S. national security. 
   The ability of American defense systems to maintain technological advantages relies increasingly on the U.S. computer industry's ability to be on the cutting edge of technology. We need to move forward with this legislation. Protection of capabilities and technologies readily available in the world market is, at best, unhelpful for maintenance of military dominance and, at worst, counterproductive, according to the final report of the Defense Science Board Task Force on Globalization Security that came out in December of last year. 
   It doesn't make sense to impose a 180 waiting-day period for products with a 3-month innovation period that are available for foreign countries. We have to keep changing. 
   Right now, American companies are forbidden from selling computers in tier III countries, while foreign competitors are free to do so. 
   The removal of items from export controls imposed by the munitions list, such as tanks, rockets, warships, and high-performance aircraft, requires a 30-day waiting period. We need to put our priorities in order; 180 days is too long. It is way too long. 
   The new Intel microprocessor will be available very soon, with companies all over America already signed on to use this microprocessor. Foreign countries have signed on to using it, including Hitachi and Siemens. They will be so far ahead of us in sales to other countries that we will never catch up unless 
   we change this law. 
   The most recent export controls announcements made by the administration on February 1 will therefore be out of date in less than 6 months. 
   Lastly, a review period, comparable to that applied to other export control and national security regimes, will still give Congress adequate time to review national security ramifications of change in the U.S. computer export control regime. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. There is no doubt in my mind that this amendment would pass overwhelmingly. I hope the managers of this bill will allow this amendment to go forward. It would be too bad if we were stymied, once again, from allowing something that has the overwhelming support of the American people, including the American business sector, whether they are in the computer industry or not. It has the total support of the computer industry. It also has the support of Members of Congress, as I have indicated. It passed the House of Representatives overwhelmingly. The vote was 415-8. In the Senate, it will get 90 votes. It would be a shame that a point of order, some technicality, would prevent the Senate from going forward on this legislation. This is a Defense appropriations bill. There could be no finer vehicle to consider this amendment. I hope some technicality does not prevent me from having this voted upon.

We want to make sure the majority understands we will do everything we can to cooperate with the majority. We would like to move this bill along as quickly as possible and get back to the Defense authorization bill at an early time. But I suggest, as I have indicated, there are more Republican amendments than Democratic amendments. We are going to do what we can to work on this side. I have spoken to Senator INOUYE and he has indicated the two managers would accept a number of these amendments. Throughout the day we will work on these to see what we can do to move this bill along. I hope the same will happen on the Senator's side if we are to complete this legislation.

I think you should spend more time urging Members on your side of the aisle. We only have one amendment that is going to take any amount of time. The Senator offering that amendment has been tied up in hearings all day and has been unavailable. 
   Senator BOXER has offered three amendments. She has said she will be back in an hour to offer her last one. As I say, we have just a few amendments. So I think if you can get rid of a lot on your side, we might be able to make some more progress. We are literally down to maybe seven or eight amendments on our side.

   Mr. REID. I thank my colleagues and good friends from Alaska and Hawaii for their hard work on this bill. This is an important bill, a good bill, and I commend their efforts. 
   I rise to engage the senior Senator from Alaska in a colloquy on an important issue. Recent studies have suggested that civilians living near Army Depots which dispose of munitions through open burning and open detonation (OB/OD) suffer from cancer and other maladies at rates higher than would normally be expected. I have asked the Secretary of the Army to study whether open burning represents a health risk to civilian communities, and he has agreed to do so. This study will not be completed for some months. 
   In the meantime, the Army should be studying possible alternative disposal methods to open burning that are environmentally sealed and are not open to the atmosphere, and evaluate whether open burning should eventually be phased out over time in favor of other, safer approaches. In the event that evidence shows open burning to be dangerous to civilians, these alternatives would give the Army and the Congress a range of alternatives that they will be able to quickly consider and rapidly implement in order to minimize the danger to the public. 
   I would ask the Senator from Alaska if he would seek to include language in the conference report to accompany this bill directing the Army to conduct such a study?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I extend my appreciation for the work done by the  managers of this bill. Also, I want to briefly focus on one amendment that was adopted. 
   The fact that these amendments were agreed to en bloc doesn't take away from the importance of this legislation. We can come out here and talk for hours on a piece of legislation, and it has no more meaning than some of these that have just been adopted by the managers of the bill. The one I want to discuss is by Senators THOMPSON, VOINOVICH, REID, and a number of other people, dealing with nuclear test site worker compensation. 
   I had a meeting last week in Las Vegas with a woman named Dorothy Clayton, who, coincidentally, is in town today. Her husband was one of the people working at the test site for over three decades. One of his first duties was to go in after the blast was set off in one of these tunnels and bring out the devices. He had protective equipment on, but of course it didn't work. We didn't know that at the time. 
   This man, who literally gave his life for the country, developed numerous cancers and died a very difficult death. This legislation would compensate people such as Dorothy Clayton's husband and many others who worked at the Nevada Test Site and other nuclear complexes around the country. People such as this made the cold war something we now look back on saying that we won. 
   I want everyone to know that this legislation, which has been around for a long time, is now passed. Not only was the meeting in Las Vegas one where Mrs. Clayton talked about her husband's death, but we had Assistant Secretary of Energy Michaels there, who came to express his apologies to Mrs. Clayton and all such people who have been injured and died over the years. He did this by saying that we, the Federal Government, didn't know at the time that problems would develop. It was a very moving occasion, where the Federal Government--looked upon by many as a big brother--stepped forth and said we made a mistake. 
   With this legislation, we hope to be able to compensate these people in a minimal way for their efforts. So the veil of secrecy in existence for many years is lifted. People have attempted through litigation to have a right to protect themselves, and they could not because it was against the law. Through this legislation, other things we are doing will be made part of the law, and through the appropriations process we will be able to compensate these people. 
   I very much appreciate the managers agreeing to this amendment. It is extremely important to the thousands and thousands of people in America today, some of whom have lost loved ones.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, 109 years ago, for reasons no one can quite understand, a law was passed that prevented someone who had a service-connected disability from drawing disability at the time they were drawing retirement pay from the U.S. military. 
   If someone is injured, for example, in combat, they are eligible for a disability pension. If they have military service for 20 or 30 years, they are eligible for retirement. But under a quirk in the law that has been around for 109 years--let's assume the disability is $200 a month, and the retirement is $500 a month--the person who has been injured in combat must either waive his entire disability or take $200 from retirement to receive the $200 of disability. 
   To say the least, this is certainly not an incentive for someone to stay in the military, in addition to its basic unfairness. For example, someone can retire from the Forest Service or the Department of Energy or the Department of Treasury --any executive office--and have a disability from the military. They could draw both retirements. But if you retire from the military, you can't. Certainly this is a nonincentive to stay in the military. 
   If an individual leaves the military and begins a career in the executive branch, that person may receive both entitlements, but not if they choose to serve our country in the U.S. military. 
   It seems unusual to me at a time when the military is having difficulty retaining personnel. This is, to say the least, ridiculous. This amendment will encourage improvement and retention for armed services. 
   This bill has been introduced in its substantive form in this body. There is a similar measure in the House of Representatives that has approximately 250 sponsors. 
   In effect, this amendment will permit retired members of the armed services who have a service-connected disability to receive military retired pay concurrently with veterans' disability compensation. 
   The original law was passed in 1891 to prohibit concurrent receipt. It is time we eliminate this unfair law that has been an injustice for 109 years. This law discriminates against military men and women who decide to serve their country as a career, whereas a civil service retiree's pension may be received in its total in addition to the disability from the U.S. military. 
   Totally unfair. 
   This discriminates unfairly against disabled career soldiers. In effect, they must pay their own disability as a result of this quirk in the law. Military retirement pay and disability compensation are earned and awarded for entirely different purposes: One is for having served your country for a specific period of time; the other is for having been injured while you were a member of the U.S. military. 
   Retirement with service disability compensation for injury incurred in the line of duty certainly is deserved. This amendment represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice that existed for far too long. It affects approximately 437,000 disabled military men and women. Each day, this great country of ours loses 1,000 patriots who served as military combatants in World War II. Every day, there are 1,000 deaths of World War II veterans. Each day we delay the passage of this legislation, thousands of men and women are denied their benefits. 
   Some say this is too expensive. I say no amount of money can equal the sacrifices these military men and women have made. Yesterday, in this Senate, STROM THURMOND, who is approaching 100 years of age, spoke eloquently of his feelings about World War II. Following his statement, Senator DURBIN of Illinois gave a very compelling statement regarding STROM THURMOND. STROM THURMOND is an example of the sacrifices people made in World War II. Even though he was over the age where people would normally go into the armed services, he went into the armed services as a combat military man and, in a glider, went into Europe where he was injured and still suffers some disability from his injuries. 
   In this Chamber there are many others who sacrificed significantly as a result of World War II: Senator DAN INOUYE, who I am happy to say is going to receive a Congressional Medal of Honor for his valiant service in Italy; Senator FRITZ HOLLINGS served valiantly in World War II; Senator WARNER served toward the end of World War II, as he stated on the floor today. This amendment recognizes the people who served in World War II, the Korean conflict, Vietnam, and the other skirmishes we have had since then. People who have been injured and have service-connected disability who have been able to finish their full term in the U.S. military deserve both benefits. That is what this amendment is all about. 
   Recently, the Congressional Budget Office reported a budget surplus of about $160 billion. A few of those dollars should be used to take care of this  anomaly in the law. The best use of the budget surplus is to support this concurrent receipt legislation. Our veterans earned this. Now is our chance to honor their service to our Nation. It comes a little late for many of these service-connected veterans. 
   This amendment is supported by veteran service organizations: the Disabled Veterans, the American Legion, and the Paralyzed Veterans of America. 
   The interesting thing about this law that prevents this concurrent receipt now is that nobody knows why it originally was passed. There is a lot of conjecture. Maybe it was to relate to the fact that we didn't have large standing armies in 1891; maybe it was that only a small portion of what we did have in the military consisted of career soldiers. We don't know. What we know now, 109 years later, is it is unfair. It is unfair that a person who served this country, was discharged honorably, and has a service-connected disability, can't draw both benefits. That is what this amendment does. 
   The present law discriminates against career military men and women, when you consider when they retire from some other branch of our Government they can draw both benefits. 
   I respectfully request of the managers of this legislation that this amendment be accepted. I am happy to have a vote, if that is what is required. I think if there were ever an example of where we should send this to the House by unanimous vote, this is it. This is fair. This amendment is supported by many veterans organizations; to name only a few, the Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. They and the American public deserve to have this injustice corrected. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we have made progress. Sometimes it has been painfully slow. But this is a very big and important bill. We have a number of Senators on the minority side who expressed their desire to offer some amendments. We have a hotline  going out from our cloakroom asking that we try to develop a finite list of amendments. Once that is done, we will be in a better position to determine approximately how long it will take to complete this bill. 
   I should say to both managers of this bill that the minority is desirous of having this bill completed as quickly as possible. 
   As the managers of this bill know, in the past this bill has taken a long time. We are going to try to move it more quickly than in the past. But we still have a lot of amendments. But by the end of the day, I hope we will be in some kind of position to indicate to the managers of the bill how many amendments we have on this side. We hope the majority will tell us how many amendments they have.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Eureka County Cemetery Conveyance Act. 
   The settlement of Beowawe, Nevada was destination and home to pioneers that settled the isolated high desert of the central Great Basin. The inhabitants of this community set aside a specific community cemetery to provide the final resting place for friends and family who passed away. The early settlers established and managed the cemetery in the late 1800's. The Beowawe cemetery is on land currently managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM).  
   The site of these historic cemetery was established prior to the creation of the BLM as an agency. The BLM was created in 1946. Under current law, the agency must sell the encumbered land at fair market value to this community. My bill provides for conveyance of this cemetery to Eureka County, at no cost. It is unconscionable to me that this community would have to buy their ancestors back from the Federal government. 
   I sincerely hope that members of Congress recognize the benefit to the local community that the conveyances would provide and pass this legislation.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished Nevadan, a good man, and a good friend, Mr. Richard Bunker. Richard will be receiving the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's Humanitarian Award on June 3, 2000. The Humanitarian Award recognizes individuals who have made significant civic and charitable contributions, and whose concern is not personal, but for the greater community. There is no one more deserving of this honor than Richard Bunker. 
   Richard's legacy of service to the state of Nevada is long and remarkable. He has served as Assistant City Manager of Las Vegas and Clark County Manager, before being appointed Chairman of the prestigious State Gaming Control Board. He is currently a member of the Colorado River Commission and a member of the Board of Trustee for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union Welfare/Pension Funds. 
   As Chairman of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, Richard is Nevada's ambassador on the Colorado River. With shrewdness and finesse, he has developed positive relations with officials of the Colorado River basin states. His political skill has firmly reestablished Nevada as a player on the important issues of the Colorado River community. He also made the critically needed expansion of Southern Nevada water facilities a reality when he brokered a financial plan with the business, developer, and gaming communities. 
   Over the years, Richard Bunker has also been recognized by a variety of distinguished organizations. In 1993, he received the prestigious Nevadan of the Year award from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The Anti-Defamation League honored Richard with the Distinguished Community Service Award in 1996. In June 1999, he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Nevada Gaming Attorneys and the Clark County Bar Association. 
   For those of us who have had the pleasure to work closely with Richard, as I have, the above awards pale in comparison to his true grit. He is knowledgeable of the system of government and totally aware of the magic of our system of free enterprise. For the growth and development of southern Nevada, no one for the past twenty-five years has played a more key role than Richard Bunker. 
   On a more personal note, Richard has played an important part in my political endeavors. He has been an advisor, counselor, and sounding board. Above all else, he is a god listener, for this Richard, I am grateful. 
   I extend to you my congratulations and the appreciation of all Nevadans for your good work on their behalf.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President. I rise today to introduce the Civic Participation Act of 2000. This legislation would guarantee that individuals who have fully served their sentences have the right to vote in Federal elections. 
   The right to vote in a democracy is the most basic act of citizenship. It is a right that may not be abridged or denied by the United States, or any State, on account of race, color, gender or previous condition of servitude. This fundamental right is truly the most glaring example of a free society. 
   I can't help but think of Nelson Mandela's perspective on the right to vote. One would think that the most significant day in Mr. Mandela's life would have been the day he walked out of a South African prison after more than 27 years behind bars. Or perhaps, it might be the day he assumed the Presidency of post-apartheid South Africa. In fact, Mr. Mandela has said that the most important day in his life was the day he voted for the first time. 
   Mr. President, I am troubled that many people in this country are denied the right to vote, even when any sentence of imprisonment, parole or probation has been fully completed. Additionally, many individuals who have fully served their sentences and wish to regain their right to vote, must petition a pardon board, their State Governors, or even, in some States, must obtain a Presidential pardon. Few people have the financial or political resources needed to succeed in such efforts. 
   Furthermore, the denial of suffrage disproportionately affects ethnic minorities. Recent studies have indicated that an estimated thirteen percent of adult African-American males are unable to vote as a result of varying state disenfranchisement laws. This is even more troubling when we consider that voter turnout, especially among America's youth, is at a record low. As elected officials who have been given the privilege to serve by our fellow Americans, we need to recognize that the strength of a democracy depends upon the voluntary participation of its citizens. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear. Criminal activity must be punished. Stiff and appropriate sentences should be imposed upon those who violate our laws. However, we should not be disenfranchising those citizens who have fully completed their prescribed sentences, especially when those citizens should be reintegrated into society and our citizen-dependent democracy. 
   I want to make it perfectly clear that this legislation, in no way, extends voting rights to prisoners. In fact, my colleagues in the Senate know that I have led the fight in this body against frivolous lawsuits filed by prisoners. Furthermore, this legislation does not extend voting rights to persons on parole or probation. This legislation simply states that anyone who has successfully, and completely, served their entire sentence, including any parole and probation, may not be denied the right to vote. 
   Finally, this legislation would apply only to Federal elections, thereby protecting the rights of individual States to establish voting procedures for State elections. 
   In conclusion, Mr. President, I want to reiterate that this legislation is narrowly drafted to guarantee one of the most fundamental rights of citizens of our democracy, and I urge my colleagues to support this worthy endeavor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, it seems just a day or two ago--the fact of the matter is, it was almost 40 years ago--that I served as a Capitol policeman. I can remember being out on the steps on the east front of the Capitol. I worked the night shift while I attended law school during the day. I remember one of my first duty stations was to be present during the concerts which took place every night. 
   I can remember a lot of things. One thing I remember is Senator Carl Hayden coming to the concerts every night. He had been in Congress more than 50 years at that time. He was still mentally alert but physically infirm. He would come in his wheelchair. As a Capitol policeman, I would stand near him during these concerts. 
   Quite frankly, Mr. President, the most dangerous thing I did as a Capitol policeman was to direct traffic. Directing traffic was a little dangerous in those days. I can remember that on Constitution Avenue, they had railroad tracks. And there were cars all over the place. It sounds a little facetious when I say it was the most dangerous thing I did, but it was true. I was barely old enough to carry a gun. One had to be 21. I carried a pistol. Thank goodness, I never took it out of the holster during the time I was a Capitol policeman. 
   I have very fond memories of being a Capitol policeman. Like Senator BYRD, I can remember coming from a town of 200 at the southern tip of the State of Nevada where we had a policeman by the name of Big John. Growing up in Searchlight, he was ``the law.'' But here in Washington, for me to walk in a uniform at night down these Halls--there was nobody in these Halls when I made my rounds--it brought a chill to my soul, thinking I was able to work in this Capitol and walk past the statues of the great men and women who made this country what it is. 
   For me now, to think I have served in the House of Representatives, the greatest democratic body in the history of the world--no one has ever served in the House unless they have been elected. In the Senate, there have been people who have served who had been appointed, but never in the House of Representatives. And then to serve in the Senate. I told one of my friends I was lucky. He said: ``You are not lucky, you are blessed.'' That is really true. I was wrong, and he was right. 
   I am blessed to serve in the Senate of the United States. I walk down these Halls many times a week to Senator BYRD's old office. As you know, the Democratic whip's office is down on the next floor. Senator, did you know that the fireplace was put in that office in 1824? When I walk down there, even with people around, I get that same chill I had as a young man in a police uniform. This is truly a wonderful building. I sometimes wonder why I am so fortunate to serve here. I am, and I accept those responsibilities along with the privilege. 
   I have never forgotten that I was a Capitol Police officer. I can remember when I was transferred to the House. In 1961, Henry Gonzalez from Texas, was a freshman Congressman. I can remember the very lonely duty I had over there. This freshman Congressman from Texas worked late at night, and he would say to me: ``Can I bring you something to eat? Can I bring you something to drink?'' 
   Another Member I remember was Congressman Lindsay from New York, who later became the mayor of New York City. These are the two people I remember reaching out to a police officer, reaching out in kindness. It made me feel good about my job. 
   Like Senator WELLSTONE so eloquently stated, I have tried to be kind, thoughtful, and considerate to police officers. They have such an important job, and are often overlooked because things get so crazy around here. 
   The world is so different than it was 40 years ago. 
   Unfortunately, there are people who are hellbent upon destroying this facility, not just damaging the Rayburn Building. I say to my friend from West Virginia, immediately before that bomb went off in the Rayburn Building, the Nevada State Society held a meeting there. We were the last group to meet in that room. I was a Member of the House at the time that explosion took place, and I remember the incident as if it happened yesterday. 
   Today, it seems that people are no longer content with blowing out a few windows. They want to destroy this facility, and, if given the opportunity, they could. That is why we have to reach out to the men and women who provide security for us on a daily basis. But, it's not just us, Mr. President. The Capitol Police provides security for all the staff we see throughout these buildings, the people without whom we would not be able to do our jobs. Most importantly, the Capitol Police is also charged with providing security for the millions of people who come to this beautiful Capitol complex each year. 
   We simply must ensure that we take care of the Capitol Police. The Capitol Police are very well trained. Today, as I was proceeding to a meeting in the Dirksen Building, I saw a man climb out of a car dressed in SWAT team apparel. I asked the officer with whom I was walking about him, and he told me that he was a member of the SWAT team. He was dressed like you would see in a movie. He is here because he is needed. We have demolition experts, people who are experts in defusing bombs. They are called upon to do that more often than we know. Again, they are here because, unfortunate as it may be, they are needed. 
   Often time, we only hear about the heroics of the Capitol Police when something goes wrong. We know when someone breaks a bottle and tries to attack other people because the press is there to capture the event-in-the-making. We know about the tragic deaths of Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson because the press covered it in such detail. The many things we do not know about are the tragedies that are averted because of the skill and proficiency of the Capitol Police. Their training is as good as any police force in America. 
   When I served on the Capitol Police, all that training was not necessary. When people came to this building, we did not check to see what they had in their bags. We didn't have electronic machines for visitors to pass through. We did not check to see if they were staff. Our responsibilities were much different, much simpler. 
   Every day, these men and women put their lives on the line for America--not for me, not for the Presiding Officer, but for America, to protect this beautiful structure and the people who visit it. 
   Without belaboring the point, I have been fortunate to do a few things in my adult life. I am so privileged to represent the people of Nevada in this body. But this Senator is just as proud to have been a police officer, and I am proud of the fact I was a Capitol policeman. 
   I extend to my friend from Utah, the chairman of this subcommittee, and my friend from California, the ranking member, my appreciation for crafting this bill on a bipartisan basis. Not only have they reached out to protect the Capitol Police, which is so important, but they have also reached out to protect the rest of the staff. 
   I had the good fortune to serve as chairman of the legislative branch appropriations subcommittee when I first came to the Senate. I loved that job, because we did some very constructive things. 
   We see things in the other body on the other side of the Capitol that have not been very constructive. In fact, they have been destructive. I would say to my colleagues that the chairman and ranking member have brought about some dignity to the legislative branch of Government. 
   The other body, for example, drastically cut the Government Printing Office which does very important things for this country. In the State of Nevada, the Government Printing Office has 11 different institutions to which they supply periodicals and other materials. 
   Across the country, there are more than 1,300 institutions that serve as official depository libraries which disseminate more than 16.1 million official Government documents to the general public every year--every year, over 16 million documents the public gets from the Government Printing Office. 
   In Nevada, there are 11 such libraries, the 2 largest of which exist on the campuses of the University of Nevada at Las Vegas and Reno. 
   The depository is a bargain when one considers the program as a whole.  
   While the GPO supplies the printed materials, the university, college, and other public libraries which participate in the Federal Depository Library Program supply the space to house the documents, the staff to assist the public, as well as the computers, the photocopiers, and other equipment needed to use this information. In other words, the GPO embodies the public's access to government. 
   What if we were to cut off that access? There would be--rightfully so--a public outcry that such access to government had been denied. If we were to cut back the staff the way the other body did, that is what we would have to do--limit the public's access to their government. The ranking member and the chairman have made every effort to stop this, and that is very important. 
   I also think that it is very important we recognize that the General Accounting Office--because of the work you have done--has been, in effect, spared. We complain because we do not get our reports and other information fast enough from the General Accounting Office. Why? Because in the past we have cut them back a significant amount. They are already working with a very lean staff. Thank goodness the ranking member and the chairman have taken care of this. This Senator appreciates that very much.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the things I say to my two colleagues, the chairman and the ranking member, is, if the other body is looking for additional sources of money, I think they should take a closer look at their franking practices. I am the last person to tell the other body what to do with franking, even though in the past, when I was chairman of the Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee, we had some real battles dealing with franking. We cut our Senate franking practices tremendously. In fact, we now hear complaints that we do not have enough money to mail to our constituents. We have really tightened our belts, especially with mass mailings. 
   But, let's talk about the other body. In 1994, as part of a bipartisan effort that was initiated by Senator MACK and myself, our subcommittee successfully instituted sweeping reforms regarding franking privileges in the Senate. In fact, we cut overall mail costs by 50 percent between 1994 and 1995. 
   As part of the same initiative, the House, in 1995, combined its mail, staff, and office expense accounts, and instituted an expenditure limit on mail based upon an allowance fund. 
   However, Mr. President, that was changed. In 1999, according to the Congressional Research Service, the House, unfortunately, eliminated any expenditure limit on franking privileges. 
   So if the House is looking for some ways to get some money, they can always use some of the money they reapplied to franking just last year. 
   Also, I want to talk about the Congressional Research Service, for which I have the greatest respect. It is a great program, the Congressional Research Service. If we have a problem, we can have some research done. That is what it is. It helps our constituents, our staffs, and helps us Members of Congress. 
   These cutbacks that have been requested in the other body are simply not wise. I think it goes without saying that we need the Congressional Research Service so that we are not forced to rely upon a group of lobbyists. 
   I, again, commend the chairman and ranking member for their work to ensure that the Congressional Research Service is protected. 
   Finally, let me say, in closing, we have appropriated $100 million for the Visitors Center. I am not happy with the fact we are reaching out to the private sector to get money to help build what I think should be a totally Government institution.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Town of Kingston Emergency Landing Strip Conveyance Act. 
   The Town of Kingston, Nevada, currently uses federal land as an emergency landing strip at Kingston in southern Lander County, Nevada. Kingston is a rural town located on a small island of private land in the center of the state and is surrounded by both United States Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management (BLM) public lands. The isolation constrains the growth, economic diversity, and public services available to those who live in or visit Kingston. Medic Air of Reno has an agreement with local Fire and Rescue to provide 24-hour emergency medical service to this landing strip. BLM has extended the existing airport lease to the Kingston Town  Board until September 30, 2000, but cannot renew the lease because the strip does not meet FAA standards. 
   This Act will convey a total of 144.88 acres to the Town of Kingston. Seventy acres will be conveyed at fair market value and 74.88 acres at no cost. The 70 acres contains the main landing strip. The 74.88 acres contains the balance of the approach and the disposal of this land for no consideration will benefit the United States by disposing of an isolated, segregated parcel that would be difficult to manage for public use. It is my sincere hope that Congress will pass this bill thereby allowing a win-win situation for both the United States and Kingston, Nevada.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Barbara F. Vucanovich Post Office Building Naming Act. 
   As many of my colleagues know, Congresswoman Barbara Vucanovich was the first female elected to represent the State of Nevada in Congress. She was first elected in 1983 and retired in 1996, after serving in the House of Representatives for 14 years. In her final year, she was an influential member of the House Appropriations Committee and the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Military Construction. Barbara and I came to the House together as a result of the 1982 election. We both represented all of Nevada; not solely Congressional Districts. Barbara was a fine member of Congress. I miss her. 
   Mr. President, it gives me pleasure to introduce this bill to commemorate Barbara Vucanovich's exemplary service to the State of Nevada and the United States of America by renaming the main post office in Reno, Nevada, as the ``Barbara F. Vucanovich Post Office Building.'' Representatives GIBBONS and BERKLEY introduced identical legislation in the House on April 4, 2000. Nevada Governor Kenny Guinn and former Senator Paul Laxalt join Nevada's congressional delegation in thanking Barbara Vucanovich for her dedicated public service.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a distinguished Nevadan, a good man, and a good friend, Mr. Richard Bunker. Richard will be receiving the National Jewish Medical and Research Center's Humanitarian Award on June 3, 2000. The Humanitarian Award recognizes individuals who have made significant civic and charitable contributions, and whose concern is not personal, but for the greater community. There is no one more deserving of this honor than Richard Bunker. 
   Richard's legacy of service to the state of Nevada is long and remarkable. He has served as Assistant City Manager of Las Vegas and Clark County Manager, before being appointed Chairman of the prestigious State Gaming Control Board, and is now a member of the Colorado River Commission while being a member of the Board of Trustees for the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees International Union Welfare/Pension Funds. I was Chairman of the Gaming Commission when Richard was Chairman of the Gaming Control Board. We were partners then and still are. 
   As Chairman of the Colorado River Commission of Nevada, Richard is Nevada's ambassador on the Colorado River. With shrewdness and finesse, he has developed positive relations with officials of the Colorado River basin states. His political skill has firmly reestablished Nevada as a player on the important issues of the Colorado River  community. He also made the critically needed expansion of Southern Nevada water facilities a reality when he brokered a financial plan with the business, developer, and gaming communities. 
   Over the years, Richard Bunker has also been recognized by a variety of distinguished organizations. In 1993, he received the prestigious Distinguished Nevadan of the Year award from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The Anti-Defamation League honored Richard with the Distinguished Community Service Award in 1996. In June 1999, he was presented with the Lifetime Achievement Award by the Nevada Gaming Attorneys and the Clark County Bar Association. 
   For those of us who have had the pleasure to work closely with Richard, as I have, the above awards pale in comparison to his true grit. He is knowledgeable of the system of government and totally aware of the magic of our system of free enterprise. For the growth and development of southern Nevada, no one for the past twenty-five years has played a more key role than Richard Bunker. 
   On a more personal note, Richard has played an important part in my political endeavors. He has been an advisor, counselor, and sounding board. Above all else, he is a good listener, for this Richard, I am grateful. 
   I extend to you my congratulations and the appreciation of all Nevadans for your good work on their behalf.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan bill that is critical to maintaining our nation's lead in the high-tech sector. In specific, this bill is crucial to the computer industry. This is an issue that I have been very interested in for quite some time, and in particular, have done a lot of work on this session. 
   I first want to talk a little bit about the U.S. computer industry. According to an article in Computers Today, dated July 19, 1998, American computer technology has led the world since the first commercial electronic computer was deployed at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. 
   This industry is constantly changing with new companies and new products emerging every day. A statistic that I find fascinating is that more than 75 percent of the revenues of computer companies come from products that did not exist two years before. That statistic is from the CSPP Freedom to Grow. 
   Through research and development, another issue I strongly favor, the computer industry has been able to remain competitive for all of these years. 
   The challenge that we not face, and frankly a challenge that we haven't lived up to in the past as a Congress, is to allow our export control policies to change with the times, and not to overly restrict our nation's computer companies. 
   We need to stop trying to control technology that is readily available, as we are doing today. The technology that we are regulating is readily available from many foreign companies. Companies from countries like China and other Tier 3 countries. 
   I remember, not too long ago, I was able to secure funding for a Super-Computer for the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. That computer, which required its own room, is now about as powerful as a laptop computer. That is exactly the kind of computer that we are still regulating. 
   Computers that are now considered Super-Computers operate at more than one million MTOPS, or about 500 times the current level of regulation. 
   The bottom line is that by placing artificially low limits on the level of technology that can be exported, we may be denying market realities and could very quickly cripple America's global competitiveness for this vital industry. If Congress doesn't act quickly, we will substantially disadvantage American companies in an extremely competitive global market.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, on Friday, May 12, 2000, Nevadans will pause to honor the outstanding achievements and retirement of Clark County Superintendent of Schools, Dr. Brian Cram. Throughout his 34 years as an educator, Dr. Cram has touched the lives of hundreds of thousands of youth in the Las Vegas Valley as a teacher, assistant principal, principal, assistant superintendent and superintendent, all within the Clark County School District. He is retiring after serving more than eleven years as superintendent. The fact that his tenure has been approximately nine years longer than the average for a superintendent demonstrates his excellence and commitment to our community Southern Nevada. 
   Dr. Cram can be appreciated most for his outstanding management of the fastest growing school district in the country. During his tenure, the district has grown from 111,000 to more than 215,000 students, and is currently the eighth largest school district in the country. Dr. Cram is a self-proclaimed ``poster boy for school bonds,'' having successfully secured billions of dollars for the construction of more than 100 new schools for the students, teachers and staff of the Clark County School District. He recently was successful in obtaining voter approval of school construction funding for the next ten years, a legacy that will carry on well beyond his tenure. This achievement takes on added significance when one considers that Nevada, as my Senate colleagues have heard me state on numerous occasions, must build approximately one school a month just to keep up with the unprecedented growth in the Silver State. 
   Although he spent many years in administration, Dr. Cram has always been happiest when working with children. He has never been one to sit behind a desk, preferring instead to be out working with children, families and staff. His tenure as superintendent will be characterized by strong personal relationships with the students, teachers, families and employees of the school district and the entire community. 
   Above all, Dr. Cram is a true believer in the value of education. He hails from a home which stressed the importance of sound learning and lifelong education, and he has been driven by a fundamental belief that education is the great equalizer and provider in life. 
   It is my distinct pleasure and honor to join all Nevadans in wishing Dr. Brian Cram all the best upon his retirement. His genuine commitment of the youth of Nevada will be appreciated for many generations to come.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, to alert the membership of what we are trying to do, we have been in touch, of course, with the majority. We would like to finish the pending amendments the Abraham and Kennedy amendments, in the near future. Then what is anticipated by the leadership, as I understand it, is to go to the Murray amendment. 
   Senator MURRAY has graciously agreed to the time agreement of an hour and a half, evenly divided. Then we would go to the LIEBERMAN amendment. I have spoken to Senator Lieberman. He agrees to 2 hours on his side, and the majority could take whatever time they believe appropriate on that amendment. Then we would go to the Gregg amendment. 
   The only thing we are waiting on is a copy of the Gregg amendment. We have not seen that. As soon as that is done, with the concurrence of the majority--which we have kept advised during the entire morning--we would be able to enter into an agreement. It is up to the majority leader, of course, as to when the votes would take place. 
   I see the majority leader on the floor. What we would like to do, prior to an agreement--we have had Senators waiting here most of the morning. They would like to speak. Senator DORGAN would like a half hour; the two Senators from New York would use 10 minutes of Senator DORGAN's time to speak about the death of Cardinal O'Connor. Senator FEINGOLD wants 12 minutes to speak on some matter. I really don't know what that is. 
   I did not know the majority leader was on the floor. I was just trying to alert everyone as to what we are trying to do.

   Mr. REID. If the Senator would yield, what we would like to do when we finish this, which should be momentarily--either having a vote now or setting it aside--is to go to the other amendments after Abraham, Kennedy. Senator MURRAY, who has the next amendment in order on our side, will agree to an hour and a half on her class size amendment. Following that would be Senator LIEBERMAN. There has been agreement his would be the next amendment. He has agreed to 2 hours on his side on that. He indicated he did not know if the majority would need that much time. But whatever the majority wants, that would be the case. 
   Then it is my understanding we would go to the Gregg amendment, with no time agreement as far as we are concerned. We have not seen the Gregg amendment. We have been waiting for some time now. It is on its way. But the route sometimes is circuitous to get here. I did indicate, I think we have some Members who have been wanting to speak all morning.

I don't want Senator MCCAIN or anyone supporting Senator MCCAIN's amendment to think I am doing this simply because it deals with the NCAA. It is because we are trying to move this education bill along. At some subsequent time on this bill or at some other time, if he offers that, I will be prepared to do whatever is necessary to put my views forward. But I just want the RECORD to reflect that it is not because of the content of this amendment. It is just an attempt to move education matters along with this bill. 
   I withdraw any objection I have.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, on May 6-8, 2000, more than 1,200 students from across the United States will be in Washington, D.C. to compete in the national finals of the We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution program. I am proud to announce that the class from Basic High School from Henderson will represent the State of Nevada in this national event. These young scholars have worked diligently to reach the national finals and through their experience have gained a deep knowledge and understanding of the fundamental principles and values of our constitutional democracy. 
   The names of the students are; Katie Bair, Joshua Bitsko, Ryan Black, Daniel Croy, Scott Devoge, Danielle Dodgen, Courtney England, Starlyn Hackney, Jill Hales, Alia Holm, Janae Jeffrey, Ryan Johnson, Aimee Lucero, Nathan Lund, Jessica Magro, Jasmine Miller, Holli Mitchell, Gary Nelson, Krystaly Nielsen, Mark Niewinski, Amanda Reed, Jeni Riddle, Leslie Roland, Landin Ryan, Alena Sivertson, Ashley Stolworthy, Sarah Strohm, Tyler Watson, Kara Williams, and Ricky Zeedyk. I would also like to recognize their teacher, John Wallace, who deserves much of the credit for the success of the class. 
   The We the People ..... The Citizen and the Constitution program is the most extensive educational program in the country developed specifically to educate young people about the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. The three-day national competition is modeled after hearings in the United States Congress. These hearings consist of oral presentations by high school students before a panel of adult judges. The students testify as constitutional experts before a panel of judges representing various regions of the country and a variety of appropriate professional fields. The students' testimony is followed by a period of questioning by the simulated congressional committee. The judges probe students for their depth of understanding and ability to apply their constitutional knowledge. Columnist David Broder described the national finals as ``the place to have your faith in the younger generation restored.'' 
   Administered by the Center for civic Education, the We the People ..... program has provided curricular materials at upper elementary, middle, and high school levels for more than 26.5 million students nationwide. The program provides students with a working knowledge of our Constitution, Bill of Rights, and the principles of democratic government. Members of Congress and their staff enhance the program by discussing current constitutional issues with students and teachers and by participating in other educational activities. 
   The class from Basic High School is currently conducting research and preparing for the upcoming national competition in Washington, D.C. I wish these young ``constitutional experts'' the best of luck at the We the People ..... national finals and my staff and I look forward to greeting them when they visit Capitol Hill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I learned Mike was sick, I thought I should come down and say a few words. I thought: What can I say? I do not want to say anything that will not be appropriate. I went to my person who does my floor work in the Senate, Peter Arapis. I said: Tell me about Mike Epstein. What do you know about Mike Epstein? 
   He said--and I made some notes--he always told us some jokes and he was always funny, always had a smile, and he appears to be Senator WELLSTONE's best friend. Those are the same things I felt about Mike Epstein. 
   The feelings about Mike are pretty well known in the Senate. He has a great sense of humor. He always had that sly grin on his face when he was in the Senate, which I appreciated a lot. 
   Mike, I always appreciated your being so courteous to me. I had a lot of dealings with you because as we proceed in the Senate--and I say this through Senator WELLSTONE to Mike--it seems one of my responsibilities is to get the legislation moving. A lot of times Senator WELLSTONE threw a monkey wrench into legislation moving. Who would I go to to find out what really was happening? I would go to the back row and talk to Mike and say: Mike, what is going on here? He would have a grin on his face as he would tell me what was going on. He was always the person I would go to to break through the Wellstone logjam that was created. 
   I was looking this morning for something to describe you, Mike. I found a quote by James Barrie that is pretty good. I believe it really sizes up what you appear to be to me. Barrie said, ``Always be a little kinder than necessary.'' 
   Certainly with Mike Epstein, that is the case. Mike was always a little kinder than necessary to me. Always kind. A lot of times I thought to myself: Wow, that is really a nice person. I guess I thought maybe he was a little kinder to me than was necessary. 
   I never looked at Mike's r&#233;sum&#233;. My staff gave me a little background r&#233;sum&#233; of Mike today. Here is a man who graduated from Brown University. Brown is an Ivy League school. It is a wonderful school; some say the best school in America. It is very hard to get in. It is a small school, and they only take the best people whom they think can academically be a success. 
   Then, of course, he went to Boston University Law School, which is one of the top law schools in the country. 
   He had a r&#233;sum&#233;. He could have gone anyplace in the world to work in the legal field. He could have gone anyplace in the legal field in America to work. He decided very early on that he wanted a life in public service, and that is what he did. As soon as he got out of law school, he served in the Justice Department as staff counsel, prosecuting attorney, special assistant to the Attorney General, and worked in the Criminal Division. 
   In 1970 or 1971, Mike moved to Capitol Hill where he spent the rest of his career. What a career it was. I repeat, at any juncture of Mike's career, he could have gone anyplace in Washington to make the big bucks as a lobbyist, as an attorney in one of the big law firms, but he decided not to do that. 
   He decided to be a counsel to the special commission to investigate intelligence activities--Senate counsel on the Intelligence Committee. He was counsel to one of the Senate Democratic leaders. He was chief counsel to the Foreign Relations Committee. And he, of course, for the last 10 years or so has been the legislative director for Senator WELLSTONE. 
   At any juncture of his career, including any time he worked for Senator WELLSTONE, he could have gone anyplace in town to make a lot of money. 
   He has a great academic background, and of course his experience is tremendous. 
   So I feel very moved to say nice things about Mike Epstein, things I wish I had said earlier. 
   So, Mike, I certainly wish you the best. I know your health isn't as good as we would like it. But I certainly hope you have some peace and rest in the next little bit and that you recognize how much we would like to see you in this back row, helping Senator WELLSTONE--kind of the ``Mini-Me'' of the Wellstone operation. 
   I think it is also important that Jonathan and Bob--your two children--recognize the great contributions you have made to Government in America. Things are better because of you. Certainly, I know the many contributions Senator WELLSTONE has made during his career have been directly related to your expertise. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alaska talked about a little history this morning, or words to that effect. ``Heard a little history'' is not very accurate. For example, the chart they just took down shows the Nevada Test Site. Yucca Mountain is not the Nevada Test Site. It is a mountain in Nye County. It is separate and apart from the Nevada Test Site. 
   What my friends from Alaska should do is pull out new notes, not the old ones. That is what they were trying to do previously with interim storage: take it to the Nevada Test Site. This is a new bill. They are back at Yucca Mountain, which is not the Nevada Test Site. Of course, the Nevada Test Site had a lot of aboveground tests and some underground tests. That whole area is contaminated, and it is going to cost billions and billions of dollars to clean up that area. 
   Nevada has sacrificed a great deal. We have done it for national security. 
   I, as a young boy, watched the tests go off above ground. We did not know this would kill people. The dust clouds did not blow toward where I was watching, thank goodness, at least to my perspective. It blew the other way, causing the highest rate of cancer in America. People in southern Utah and parts of Nevada suffered and still today suffer from the effects of those aboveground tests. 
   As to the underground tests, the Department of Energy and this administration recently included Nevada Test Site workers for the ability to be compensated for exposure to radiation-type injuries and illnesses as a result of working on the underground tests. So Nevada has given a great deal. But, I repeat, the Nevada Test Site is not Yucca Mountain. History--but the wrong history. 
   I also say, there is some intimation here, by my friend, for whom I have the greatest respect, the chairman of the Energy Committee, who is attempting to override the President's veto, talking about radiation standards. He talks about the manager's amendment. No one should be fooled. This bill the President vetoed is the same one--the identical one--that Members of the Senate voted on just a few months ago. Nothing has changed. For my friend to intimate that the managers suddenly changed things from the national Nuclear Regulatory Commission back at the EPA--that was in the bill to begin with. 
   My friend, interestingly, pointed out and showed pictures of States where  Senators had the courage to vote for the right principle. Every State he talked about--Colorado, New York, Oregon, North Carolina, Massachusetts--is a State where Senators had the courage to vote, and they will vote to sustain the Presidential veto. And why? Because every--I am not talking about 90 percent or 98 percent; I am talking about every--environmental group in America supports the sustainment of the Presidential veto--every environmental group. 
   My friend says, I do not understand what Vice President GORE is saying when he says this veto is protecting the environment. Of course it is protecting the environment. 
   My colleague also brings up something that took place--a resolution--25 years ago in the Nevada State Legislature. That was 25 years ago. We, in Nevada, in 1982, suddenly began to learn very quickly that there were 70,000 tons of nuclear waste stored around the country. Nevadans--everyone in this country--have a different perspective than they did before. 
   I show my colleagues a chart. This is a chart that is comparable to the one my friend from Alaska showed. What this chart shows is that there are nuclear-generating facilities all over America. In fact, there are 100-some-odd sites where nuclear power is generated in America today. 
   He showed his chart. He said: Wouldn't it be wonderful? And the nuclear power industry runs ads around the country costing hundreds of thousands of dollars--full-page ads, newspaper ads. What they do in these adds is say: Instead of having all these sites, wouldn't it be wonderful to wind up having just one? That is a sleight of hand, if there ever was one. 
   I will show you another chart. 
   What will happen is, we will not wind up with simply one site, we will wind up with one more site. These other places will still be generating nuclear waste. There will be nuclear waste stored in those sites. Even those sites that are closed down will still have nuclear waste. They will be nuclear waste sites for many years to come. 
   Why do we want to establish a new repository at Yucca Mountain? 
   Let me show you what this chart shows. This chart illustrates a nuclear nightmare. It does not show the highways. We could show highways here, too. But we just wanted to make this relatively simple for illustrative purposes. This chart shows the railroads 
   in America where nuclear waste will be carried to this one site. If this does not send a chill down your spine, nothing will. Why? Because accidents happen on the railways all the time. 
   The chart shows an accident that happened very recently. It happened on March 21, 2000. This is a picture of an accident that happened in Oregon. The part of Oregon where this accident took place has dense farmland, lots of water. In this instance, there was a track slightly out of line. There was no notice for the accident. Train cars went tumbling over each other. 
   Let's see what the newspaper reported about this accident. 
   On this chart, you can see an article from this newspaper, the LaGrande Observer, of March 21, 2000. We thought we would get a fairly recently one. But you can pick any time of the year. These accidents happen all the time. 
   But this article shown on the chart is about the same accident that is depicted in the previous picture. In the picture, you can see one locomotive, and down here you can see another locomotive in yellow. They are tumbled--turned all over. You can see that it crumpled everything in its path. You can see railcars with stuff pouring out of them. This is what they are going to haul nuclear waste in. 
   One problem: They have not figured out any way to safely store nuclear waste for transportation purposes. They have come up with some dry cask storage containers. These dry cask storage containers, they say, are fine--unless you have an accident and are going more than 30 miles per hour. If you go more than 30 miles per hour, it will breach the container. 
   They also say these containers they have developed are really safe in a fire--unless it is fueled by diesel and burns for more than 30 minutes. We have one train in recent months that burned for 4 days. 
   Also, the point is always raised, what are we going to do with nuclear waste? In 1982, that was probably a pretty good question. But as the years roll on, that is not a very good question because there is an easy answer. You do just as they do out at Calvert Cliffs in Southern Maryland--a nuclear-power-generating facility--you store it onsite. 
   Dry cask storage--it is pretty safe if you leave it onsite because you are not going to be traveling 30 miles per hour; it is going to be stationary. And, likely, there will not be a diesel fire. Diesel burns very hot. So the odds are very good that if you store it onsite, it will be safe. That is what they are doing at Calvert Cliffs and other places around the country. We do not need to transport all this stuff across America. 
   I show my colleagues again the chart with the train tracks. We do not need to have this nuclear nightmare. Remember, this chart I am showing you now does not have the highways on it. This is only the railroads. We do not need to establish this very dangerous precedent of hauling nuclear waste all over America. 
   The situation is beyond my ability to comprehend except, when I think about it, it is easier to understand because the very powerful, greedy nuclear power industry knows it will be safer to leave it where it is. They helped defeat a provision that said the United States of America will take title to this waste. They would not allow that to take place in one of the previous bills. 
   They want an issue because they do not want any responsibility for the poison they have created. They want to be able to wash their hands of it and send it someplace else. But they cannot do that, even though they might try, because there are always going to be the nuclear waste sites where the nuclear-generating facilities exist. 
   We know there are all kinds of problems--problems that relate to transportation. Transportation problems are replete with danger. We know terrorist threats are significant. We know that no matter how hard you try, you cannot keep the trainloads or the truckloads of nuclear waste secret. For example--this is in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD from previous debates--one organization wanted to see if they could follow things nuclear on the highways and railways in this country. Yes, they could. 
   Ground water protection. Not only in Nevada, but all along the routes where 50-plus million people are within a slingshot of these trains and highways, they are all going to be exposed. 
   The risk to children is significant. Radiation standards are not only serious in Nevada but wherever these trains and trucks travel. 
   The other question the American public should ask is, Why are we having this debate? We have voted on nuclear waste time after time. Every vote we have taken has shown we have enough votes to sustain a Presidential veto. In fact, it shows there is ground being lost by the nuclear power industry. For the first time since 1982, in the House of Representatives there was a vote taken that had 51 votes more than necessary to sustain a Presidential veto. That was the first time they have had enough votes to sustain a Presidential veto, and they did it by more than 50 votes in the House. 
   One reason we are on this path is to take up time. The Senate should be doing other things, but we are here debating whether or not the Presidential veto will be sustained. 
   We should be talking about the juvenile justice bill. Why should we be talking about juvenile justice? Let's see the chart. One of my staff went on a short vacation to New Orleans. In the paper they had a number of cartoons, and one he brought home to me was from the Dayton Daily News. This is one reason we should be debating things other than nuclear waste on the Senate floor today. The number of Americans who died from all our wars since 1775: 650,858. That is the number of Americans who died in all our wars since 1775. The number of Americans who died from guns in the last 20 years tops that: 700,000. All the wars since 1775 compared to 700,000. I say maybe we should be doing some work here on the Senate floor dealing with guns. 
   I am from a Western State. I have been a police officer. I have been a prosecutor. I have been involved in things relating to guns all my life. As I have said on the floor before, when I  was 12 years old I was given a 12-gauge shotgun for my birthday. I still have that gun. I am very proud of it. I have a rifle my brothers had when they were younger, and I now have that, and I have all kinds of pistols. I have guns. I believe in the second amendment. But I also believe we have to stop certain things. 
   For example, I think we have to stop crazy people, people with emotional problems, and people who are felons, from purchasing guns. That is something we need to debate because there are gun loopholes that allow people to buy guns who should not be able to buy guns. You can go to a gun show in Las Vegas or Denver or Hartford and there are no restrictions; anybody can sell to anybody. We should close that loophole. Pawn shops--there are loopholes there. 
   We need to constructively determine why in America, in the last 20 years, 700,000 people have been killed by guns--700,000. But no, after the Columbine killings, we passed a juvenile justice bill and nothing has happened. The House passed something. We passed something. We have waited more than a year for a conference to be appointed to deal with that issue. No, we are here debating nuclear waste. 
   There are a lot of other issues we should talk about, such as Medicare. For 35 years Medicare has been in existence. When Medicare came into being, there was no need for a prescription drug benefit because doctors didn't use them to keep people well --they didn't exist. In the 35 years since Medicare came into being, there are many prescription drugs that save lives and make for people having very good years in those so-called golden years. We should do something to change Medicare. The average senior citizen now has 18 prescriptions filled every year. 
   We need to debate this issue. We need to spend some time on this floor determining why senior citizens on Medicare do not have a prescription drug benefit. But no, this is an issue we are not going to get to right away. Perhaps we won't get to it this year. We are going to spend our time talking about nuclear waste and other issues that are simply fillers of time. 
   Paying down the debt? I think it would be good if we had a little discussion on paying down the debt. There is always a 
   constant harangue. George W. Bush, his answer to every problem in the world is lower taxes. International problems? Lower the taxes. What to do about the surplus? Lower the taxes. That is his one-liner: Lower the taxes. I guess he learned it from his dad who said ``Read my lips.'' But the fact of the matter is, paying down the debt is something we should talk about here because before lowering taxes we should talk about the $5.7 trillion debt we have and figure out a way to reduce that significantly. 
   Patients' Bill of Rights? We had a hearing, and Senator DORGAN and I are going to come to the floor this week, or the first chance we get, to talk about that hearing we had in Las Vegas. At the hearing we had in Las Vegas, I guarantee everyone in this room, had they heard these stories, tears would come to their eyes and some would break down and cry, as they did in that room. 
   One man had two broken legs. He was covered by the managed care industry. They won't get him a wheelchair. He crawled to the orthopedic surgeon, and the surgeon said: I can't help you, go to the HMO. Somebody drove him there. He crawled in on his hands and knees and then finally got a wheelchair. He said he has been so denigrated, his spirit has been so broken at how he has been treated by his managed care provider, he felt what he wanted to do was buy a quart of gasoline, douse himself with gasoline, and set himself afire. 
   Another woman who had cancer--she was a nurse--she told of the hurdles she had to jump to receive minimal treatment. 
   We had a doctor come in and talk about the impossibility patients have in trying to get care. He is one of the physicians who acknowledged that he has lied to insurance companies in an effort to get treatment that patients badly need. 
   That is what the Patients' Bill of Rights is all about, and that is what we should be talking about on the Senate floor today, doing something to protect people who are sick and need help. They may need to go to an emergency room. A woman may need to go to a gynecologist. They are prevented from doing so because of managed care entities that have a lock on this country. 
   What about saving Social Security? Why are we not talking about Social Security? Social Security is not in the danger that people say it is in, but it is something we need to take a look at and debate here. How we are going to prolong Social Security past the year 2040 so people can draw 100 percent of their benefits, not 75 to 80 percent? 
   Public schools? It seems everything the majority does regarding schools is something to tear down public schools. We need to talk about our need for more teachers. We need to give school districts help in school construction. This great Nation is the only superpower left in the world. Doesn't it seem this Nation could spend more than one-half of 1 percent of its budget on education? We spend one-half of 1 percent of the Federal budget on education. We can do better than that. This has nothing to do with taking away from the power of local schools, from school districts, to control their schools. There are national problems in which the Federal Government must be involved. 
   There are lots of things we should be working on, but wasting a day of time in sustaining a Presidential veto is not one of them. As I said before, the people who have the courage to vote to sustain the Presidential veto are doing the right thing. They are doing the right thing for their States. They are doing the right thing for the country. They are doing the right thing in the process for the environment. So when Vice President GORE said, following the veto by the President, that this is a proenvironmental stand the President took--he said it. I do not think there is anyone in this body who can question the Vice President's credentials on the environment. 
   We have a lot more to say. The fact of the matter is this is an important issue. It is important to the country. 
   I look forward to the President's veto being sustained. I acknowledge and congratulate and applaud the President for doing this. It would have been easy for him to go with the States with all the power and the money, but he decided to do what he thought was right for the environment. I think he has done a very courageous thing. I will always remember the President's stand on this issue.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I yield myself 12 minutes. 
   This debate is not about nuclear power. It is not about whether you are in favor of nuclear power generation or opposed to it. But it is about health and safety concerns in America we should have for nuclear waste and other such issues. It is about health and safety. That is what S. 1287 is all about--lowering health and safety standards relevant to nuclear waste. 
   My good friend, with whom I have worked for many years on the water subcommittee of Appropriations--I have great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee--came to this floor this morning and spoke in favor of overriding the Presidential veto. My friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, said ``radiation standards are irrelevant.'' That is a quote. I can't imagine anyone saying that, including my good friend from New Mexico, who is someone who should know better--``radiation standards are irrelevant.'' 
   I guess that is what they said earlier in this century when we had patent medicines. They advertised, saying they would cure all kinds of diseases--arthritis, lumbago, and pleurisy--and the medicines wound up killing people. It is the same when they talk about x rays being irrelevant. Radiation from x rays is irrelevant, except it kills people. My father-in-law was an x ray technician. He died as a young man from cancer of the blood as a result of being exposed to x rays. 
   Radiation standards are relevant. They are as relevant today as they were then. They are as relevant today as they were when we were told 50 years ago that aboveground nuclear tests were OK, that radiation was not relevant. We sent soldiers and others into these nuclear clouds and they died, and some are still sick as a result of that. 
   Radiation is relevant. It is relevant in the transportation of nuclear waste. It is relevant in the storage of nuclear waste. That is what this debate is all about. 
   Of course, this is a challenge. We have 100 sites that are generating nuclear power today. They are indicated on this chart. But to say we are going to eliminate all 100 sites and wind up with one in Nevada is not true. We will wind up with 100 of them. With the one additional nuclear waste site in Nevada, instead of 108 we will have 109. These places aren't going away. Some are generating nuclear waste. Those that aren't generating nuclear waste will be nuclear repositories for many years to come. 
   The reason radiation is relevant is we have a nuclear nightmare. I have placed on this chart only the railways where nuclear waste will be transported. I haven't added the highways. This is a nuclear nightmare because accidents are happening every day, literally. 
   This is from a recent newspaper account in LaGrande, OR. An accident happened because a rail was a little out of line, causing this terrible accident. Locomotives are dumped all over. Here are locomotives which you can just barely see. You can see a little bit of yellow down here. Here is one dumped in the marsh. 
   We have a farm back here. One of my staff members happens to be here on the floor today, Kai Anderson. This was his family's farm. This train derailed where people lived. 
   These accidents happen all the time--3 engines, 29 cars derailed. You can see stuff dumped out all over. 
   Radiation matters. Radiation is not, as my friend said, ``irrelevant.'' We have a challenge, as we indicated. But this 
   debate is not about whether or not you are in favor of nuclear power generation. This debate is not about Nevada. It is about our country. It is about health and safety standards for our country. 
   If this bill is allowed to pass, 43 States will have nuclear waste passing through them without appropriate health and safety standards. 
   My friend from North Carolina talked about not understanding why the veto took place. I made notes as he spoke. He said it was ``political.'' If the President were political, he certainly wouldn't go against 40 States, many of them very heavily populated States. He wouldn't go against the biggest businesses in those States--utilities. He did it because he believed in the health and safety of the people of this country. He could have gone with where the numbers were. He decided not to do that. 
   The citizens of North Carolina, he said, deserve to know why he is doing it. It is an easy answer why the President did this--because the people of North Carolina deserve health and safety standards just as everyone else. They may have some stored nuclear waste there. But they need to have it stored in a safe manner. 
   As I said this morning, if you are wondering what we are going to do with our nuclear waste, it is an easy question to answer. What we are going to do with our nuclear waste is what they are doing at various sites around the country. They are storing it onsite. 
   We have already spent in the State of Nevada over $7 billion characterizing Yucca Mountain. You could store it onsite safely in dry cask storage containers. You could establish a nuclear waste repository site where the waste is generated--where the power is generated. You could do that for $5 million. It would be safe. It would not be subject to terrorist threats. 
   We don't have to worry about transportation. We don't have to worry about the loss of public confidence. It would be cheap. We could save this country and the utilities money. My friend from North Carolina talked about not millions but billions of dollars. Ground water would be protected. There would be no risk to children.  There would be decent radiation protection standards. 
   I can't express enough my appreciation to the President and the Vice President for their support on this issue, and also the courageous Senators--Democrats and the two Republicans. The Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Colorado, with untold pressure being placed on them, are going to vote to sustain the Presidential veto. The 33 very powerful and courageous Democrats--and I say the same about my 2 Republican friends--I am very appreciative of their support and courage. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alabama said if there was an accident it would not be nearly as bad as a chemical accident, a trainload of chemicals compared to a trainload of nuclear waste because the container would not breach. 
   I do not know where my friend got that information because we have already established there is no container that can sustain an accident where the vehicle is going more than 30 miles an hour or, in fact, if it was a diesel fire.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on this legislation we are talking about 12,000 shipments through Illinois, 11,000 shipments through Nebraska and Wyoming, 14,000 shipments through Utah. We have already had seven nuclear waste transportation accidents. The average has been one accident for every 300 shipments.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, if the leader does not mind--I see him standing--I also extend my hand of congratulations to the Senator from Alaska. He has been a gentleman during this entire debate. We have appreciated his courtesies. We also appreciate the leader working out a time arrangement for us. It saved everybody a lot of time and effort. 
   Of course, part of the wait was because there were a number of Republicans who were missing last week, and  we thought it appropriate they be here when the vote took place. 
   We are in a parliamentary position now where the leader, at any time he desires, can call this forward. It is a nondebatable motion to proceed. I hope, however, that the leader will continue the good faith that has been shown by all parties on this issue for many years, not only this year, and that if, in fact, something comes up because of travel or illness the leader will give us an opportunity to know when this matter will come forward.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the reason I want to talk today is I think it is important for the minority to have its voice heard around here. The first of May is approaching, and we are again being called on to vote on the so-called marriage penalty bill. The majority will argue that if you support the marriage penalty, you must vote for cloture. That certainly is transparently false. Here is why. 
   This procedural vote has nothing to do with limiting the marriage penalty, which the Democrats support certainly just as strongly as the Republicans. In fact, the vote is another attempt by Republicans to shield their deeply flawed tax bill from scrutiny by the Senate and by the public. In effect, we are being gagged. 
   Republicans don't want to debate this bill because they don't want anyone to know what is really in it. In truth, it is marriage penalty relief in  name only. Sixty percent of the measure on which we are going to vote today is for matters that have nothing to do with the marriage penalty. Sixty percent of the $248 billion proposal goes to people who do not face a marriage penalty. 
   The majority likes to talk about relevance. I know a little bit about relevance, as I think most people do. Sixty percent of this bill is irrelevant to the marriage penalty. 
   The majority is seeking to cut off debate on this bill before it is even begun. Invoking cloture would also block Democratic amendments that propose better ways to eliminate the marriage penalty and to address other urgent priorities such as prescription drug benefits for seniors. 
   Democratic amendments say, yes, let's fix the marriage penalty for people who actually pay it. In fact, one of the amendments proposed by Senators MOYNIHAN and BAUCUS, the lead Democrats in the Finance Committee, says: There are 65 marriage penalty provisions in the Tax Code with one sentence; let's eliminate all of them. That is one of the things we are being prevented from bringing forward. 
   We want to move forward and start legislating the way this Senate has debated for over 200 years. We have agreed to say, OK, we are not going to go along with what the Senate has done for 200 years. We will play the game of the majority in an effort to allow our voices to be heard just a little bit. 
   Even though the Standing Rules of the Senate don't require it, we have bent over backwards to keep our list of amendments short. We have 10 amendments, and we have agreed to limit debate on those amendments to 1 hour each. 
   These are amendments by Senators MOYNIHAN and BAUCUS on the tax proposal. Senator BAYH, one of the most thoughtful Senators we have ever had in the Senate, has talked about another alternative. 
   We have amendments offered by Senator SCHUMER from New York dealing with the college tuition tax credit. We have one amendment by Senator DORGAN who represents the farm community. He wants to do something about CRP in the tax bill. 
   These are amendments that should take several hours if they were debated properly. We are willing to take a half an hour and have the majority have a half an hour. That seems fair, but we have been prevented from doing that. 
   We could finish this bill in 1 day. The question is, Why will Republicans not stop casting blame and get on with the marriage tax penalty vote? Sadly, the answer is somewhere blowing in the wind. Republicans know Democrats have better proposals. Republicans also know that given a choice, the American people prefer the minority's approach. The American people say give us marriage tax penalty relief and a few other things such as prescription drug benefits for senior citizens, who simply are desperate for some relief. The average senior citizen gets 18 drug prescriptions filled a year with no benefit at all from Medicare, and we need to get that benefit to them. That is what we are trying to do. 
   The majority, once again, is afraid, despite having the majority. They have a 10-Member majority in the Senate and they are afraid to cast votes on our amendments. That goes to other issues, too, not only marriage tax penalty. The majority never tire of using procedural maneuvers to block or delay on the issues the American people care about most. 
   The majority today is out of step with the American people on issue after issue, so this majority spends most of its energy plotting ways to disguise its own extreme agenda, scurrying to avoid responsibility for its continuing failure to take up the problems the voters sent us to address. That is why the majority constantly resorts to procedural devices such as cloture, or another favorite, the conference committee ``deep freeze,'' like they have done on the conference report on bankruptcy. We have been prevented from going forward with the Export Administration Act, which the high-tech community is very desirous of moving forward. Why? Because certain members of the majority think we are still in the cold war and we cannot go forward with bringing high-tech industry into the modern world. That also takes into consideration our inability to go forward on the Juvenile Justice Act, which deals with gun safety for children, Patients' Bill of Rights, and a number of other things. 
   The majority leader said on February 3:  
   We're out of town 2 months and our approval rating went up 11 points. I think I've got this thing figured out.  
   He is right. Whenever the majority, the Republicans who control Congress, are out of the public eye they seem to be better off. It is when the public sees how out of step they are that they get into trouble. That is what is going on. No one should be deceived. We are ready to go to work right now. We are simply waiting for the majority to stop their foot-dragging and blame games, stop hiding their faulty legislation behind procedural votes and get serious. 
   When the majority works up the courage to have a real debate on these issues, to stand up and be counted on their ideas versus our ideas, we hope they will let us know. Until then, Republicans can file cloture as often as they like. It is a cynical and not very clever blame game. The Democrats are sick and tired of playing it, but we will continue to fight.

Mr. President, I hope in the process of the debate this week we get some information from the majority as to when we are going to be taking up the conference report on juvenile justice, when we will be taking up the conference report on the Patients' Bill of Rights, when we are going to start doing some substantive things on education. The session is winding down. We have 13 appropriations bills with which we must deal in the process. I think it would be a real shame if we finished the year without having worked on some of these issues the American public want most, including doing something about prescription drugs for senior citizens and the rest of the American public.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past Tuesday, the Washington Post carried a story reporting that Independent Counsel Robert Ray, a lawyer who was trained in prosecutorial ethics by Rudolph Giuliani and who took over the special prosecutor duties from Ken Starr, is planning on continuing and even expanding his investigation of President Clinton. Mr. Ray has hired six new prosecutors and another investigator and plans to increase spending over the next 6 months by $3.5 million. Under this plan, he is seriously considering indicting the President after he leaves office for a number of things. He includes perjury, obstruction of justice, making false statements, and even conspiracy. 
   When I read this story, to say the least, I was surprised. One year ago, I stood in this Chamber at this same seat during the impeachment trial of the President of the United States and compared what was happening then to literature. I can no longer make that comparison because what is happening here is too outlandish and unbelievable to qualify anymore as literature. Every great story has an ending. Every play has a denouement. 
   This investigation has already lasted 6 years. It has cost Nevada taxpayers and the taxpayers of this country more than $52 million, not counting the money this new prosecutor wants to spend in the next 6 months. 
   More than the length of this proceeding, more than the cost of this proceeding, this story has crossed the line from Kafka to ``The Twilight Zone.'' It has drifted from prosecutorial intemperance to the brink of lunacy. 
   A number of years ago, the very articulate, brilliant Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the independent counsel statute. He pointed out that with the typical criminal case, the prosecutor starts with a crime and then looks for the perpetrator. 
   But with an independent counsel, the prosecutor starts with a suspect and searches to find a crime--any crime--to charge him or her with. Once placed in office, the prosecutor has built-in pressure to bring a charge rather than exonerate his target in order to justify his very existence; and in this instance, the tens of millions of dollars already spent. There is no more perfect example to what Justice Scalia was talking about than this so-called case. 
   Let's trace the confused and wandering thread of this narrative. This all began with the 20-year-old land deal called Whitewater--an Arkansas land deal 1,500 miles from here. The special prosecutor spent millions of dollars. Nothing turned up. But he kept going. He put a woman by the name of Susan McDougal in jail for 2 years, even though she had committed no crime. There is no debate about that. And she had never been convicted in a court of law. There is no debate about that. 
   Why? He wanted her to change her testimony and implicate the President and the people at the White House. 
   She would not do that. She went to jail. Eventually, after an innocent person, who had never been accused of a crime, had languished in jail for years, he gave up on Whitewater. He, the prosecutor, gave up on Whitewater, but he did not give up on looking for something on the White House. 
   First, he investigated the unfortunate death of Vince Foster and reached  the same conclusion other investigators had already reached. It was a suicide. 
   I am personally resentful of what the prosecutor did in this instance. What he put the Foster family through is untoward, unfair, and immoral. My father committed suicide. It is very difficult for a family to go through a suicide. 
   Vince Foster was a good man. No one ever disputed that. He was despondent. He killed himself. That should have ended it. But no, what Starr wanted to do was to bring in all these conspiratorial theories that the President had had him killed. 
   Can you imagine that? One of the President's best friends, and he not only drags the President through this, but he also drags the Foster family through this. 
   This not only was immoral, in my opinion, but it cost millions of dollars. What did he get to show for it? Nothing. Then this prosecutor--persecutor, some would call him--took a look at the 1993 firings at the White House Travel Office, and reached the same conclusion that other investigators had reached. There was nothing there. Millions of dollars more, and nothing to show for it. 
   Then he took a look at a deposition in a civil suit brought by Paula Jones. That suit was dismissed by a Federal judge. But no matter, the prosecutor hired to look at a land deal had struck gold with a lie about a sex act in a case that was dismissed. He latched on to it, and refused to let go. 
   It did not matter that he did not have jurisdiction over this issue. He created jurisdiction by filing a statement with the Attorney General of the United States asserting the case had fallen into his lap by accident, when in fact there was credible evidence, sound evidence, that his staff had been in close contact with Paula Jones' lawyers from the very beginning and had worked with them and fed them information. 
   This is supposedly an unbiased prosecutor. He was obviously so excited about what he had found that he began leaking information to the press in violation of Federal law and Justice Department regulations. The court appointed an 
   investigator to investigate the investigator. But no matter, he had found something that he could use to justify the millions of dollars he was spending, and he was not about to give it up. 
   His investigators questioned Monica Lewinsky alone in a hotel room. Can you imagine the audacity of this young woman asking for a lawyer? She asked for a lawyer. They denied her request. They would not let legal niceties get in their way. 
   A first-year law student knows a person being investigated for a crime is entitled to a lawyer. But not Ken Starr's minions. 
   The main evidence he had in this case were the tapes, the surreptitious tapes made by one Linda Tripp, who has been charged criminally by a Maryland grand jury for wiretapping. It did not matter that the tapes were made illegally. He was going to use them anyway. He kept on going. Still not enough. 
   When Monica Lewinsky would not cooperate with his probe, he dragged her parents before the grand jury. He subpoenaed bookstores to find out what kind of books they were buying and reading. The public was appalled. I was appalled. But he was still going to go ahead. Still not enough. 
   After investigating for a year, the independent counsel released a report to Congress that was embarrassing in its sexual explicitness and even more embarrassing in its biased reporting of the facts. 
   Monica Lewinsky said she had never been asked to lie and was never promised a job. But Prosecutor Starr never mentioned this once in the hundreds of pages of his report. It was so biased and so one sided that this, among other things, turned the public against the independent counsel and his unethical practices and unethical tactics. But no matter, he kept on going. Still not enough. 
   The House of Representatives voted to impeach on a straight party-line vote. This body, the Senate of the United States, voted on a bipartisan basis not to convict the President on any charge. Democrats and Republicans, listening to the evidence, voted not to convict. 
   The Congress of the United States then decided not to renew this awful law that authorized the independent counsel. I always opposed it. The law died last summer. And rightfully so. For 200 years, the Justice Department has done a good job. Over time, with the independent counsel we have had some real travesties. During the Reagan administration, what was done to that President by the independent counsel was wrong. We could go through other examples. 
   But even though the law died last summer, and it should have stopped there, it did not. Still, Starr had not had enough. 
   After failing to convict the President, in one last, desperate grab at the glory that he thought had escaped him, Starr focused the power of his office on a story told by a person by the name of Kathleen Willey--a story of an alleged touch that was completely irrelevant to his mandate. 
   Remember--Whitewater, Arkansas, 1,500 miles away. 
   When a friend of Ms. Willey, named Julie Hyatt Steele, dared to contradict the story, in effect, saying that Kathleen Willey was lying--how could she dare do such a thing?--Starr indicted her for perjury. And not only that--she could probably handle the perjury charge, which 
   was so baseless--he threatened to have her children taken away from her. Who are these children? This good woman adopted orphans from Romania; and he threatened to send them back to Romania. What a guy--an innocent woman and her orphan-adopted children. These are the trophies that special prosecutor Ken Starr had to show for all of his efforts and all the pain he had caused. But, no, still not enough. 
   Our weary Nation was thankful when Starr began scaling down his investigation and, in October, finally resigned. 
   I thought that was the end of the story. Most Americans thought that was the end of the story. But surprisingly, apparently, shockingly, it is not the end. Still not enough. 
   The lynch mob, though, now has a new leader, one who is willing to prejudge the facts and unbalance the law in the spirit of his mentor, Rudy Giuliani, and, of course, his predecessor, Ken Starr. The new mob leader is Robert Ray. Apparently, he is not going to let the acquittal by this body, or the resignation of his predecessor, or the expiration of the statute under which he supposedly is acting, stand in his way. Still not enough. 
   This is a long, sad, and sordid story that should have ended long ago. The Office of the Independent Counsel has repeatedly stepped over the line of decency in its quest to find something--anything--on the President. 
   Now, the new special prosecutor says he is considering indicting the President after he leaves office next year. I say, enough is enough. 
   The President has been tried in this body. He has been acquitted. He suffered. His family suffered. His legacy is forever tarnished. He is deeply in debt to his lawyers. The Arkansas bar is considering withdrawing his license to practice law. He has not gone unpunished. Apparently, that is not enough for Mr. Ray; still, not enough. 
   In primitive legal systems, such as those of Communist countries and other totalitarian dictatorships, every minor technical violation of the law is met with the full force and fury of the government. Police are to be feared. But the greatness of our legal system is that it recognizes that because human beings are frail and fall short of perfection, mercy must season justice. At its heart, criminal law and the prosecutors charged with enforcing it exist to serve and protect the public. Our legal system contemplates discretion. Not every violation of the law should be pursued to the fullest extent because not every crime is the same. The decision not to prosecute or not to bring certain charges is as much of a prosecutor's job as a decision to bring charges. 
   When the impeachment hearings began, I cosponsored a censure resolution that in lieu of impeachment proceedings would have specifically provided the President remain subject to criminal actions in a court of law, such as any other citizen. That resolution was opposed in this body by Senators who instead voted to go down the impeachment road. 
   I was a trial lawyer before I came here. I understand there are offers of  settlement made and withdrawn. That was an offer of settlement that attempted to expedite things and not have the spectacle that took place in the Senate. But once it was decided that the proper legal course of action was to pursue the constitutional impeachment proceeding, the decision should have been final and binding. It was still not enough. 
   Even Ken Starr, the original prosecutor, is quoted in published reports as holding the belief that once the Senate acts on an impeachment vote, further criminal actions are 
   totally inappropriate. 
   There is a concept in our system of justice known as double jeopardy. It applies here. That doctrine holds that there is a limit to what a Government prosecutor can do to a United States citizen. It recognizes that there comes a point where continued investigation crosses the line into inappropriate Government harassment. An investigation into the truth should not be allowed to become a vendetta against an individual. It does recognize that enough is enough. 
   Many of his critics suggest that the President does not have greater rights under the law than any other citizen of this country. I agree. That is true. But equally true is the fact that the President should not have fewer rights than any other citizen. What the President did should not be lightly or easily forgiven, but it should not be blown out of proportion either by an unrelenting, unfair, trophy-seeking prosecutor with an unlimited budget in search of a conviction that won't serve the cause of justice. This case has gone on far too long. Tens of millions of dollars, tragedy, embarrassment, double jeopardy--enough is enough. 
   It can best be summed up, Mr. President, by syndicated columnist Richard Cohen in today's Washington Post, printed in newspapers all over America, entitled, ``Independent Counsel Overkill'', which ends by saying:  
   Give it up, Bob. Your best way of serving the country is to close down your office, lock the door and put Clinton behind you. 
   The country already has.  
   Mr. President, I yield whatever time I have remaining to the Senator from South Dakota.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves, I say respectfully that we appreciate his efforts to try to move legislation along. But I just want to make sure the record is clear. We were generous in offering the majority the opportunity to review our amendments. There is no requirement, of course, that we do so. 
   I also say to the leader that I think if we had started the marriage penalty legislation Monday or Tuesday of this week, we would be finished with it by now. 
   There may have been a lot of amendments offered, but the way we used to do things around here, we had lots and lots of amendments. In fact, there were a number of occasions when we had well over 100 amendments without any restriction of who offered them or what the subject matter was. And we completed the legislation. 
   I believe and predict if we go right to work on the marriage penalty legislation on the Tuesday when we return, we will complete it within 2 or 3 days, at the very most; maybe even in 2 days. 
   I think the majority leader should allow us--I say this not in a pejorative way; we don't need to be allowed in the true sense of the word--to have the Senate work its will the way we have done it for a couple hundred years. I think he would be surprised at how much legislation we could move.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today along with the Senior Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, to introduce the Date of Registry Act of 2000. 
   The Date of Registry Act of 2000, complements similar legislation I introduced last year in an effort to fix a terrible mistake made by the Congress in 1996. Tucked into the massive piece of legislation known as IIRA IRA, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, was an obscure, but lethal, provision which stripped the federal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate legalization claims against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Most troubling is the fact that this provision nullified legitimate claims based upon substantiated evidence that the Immigration and Nationalization Service had bypassed Congressional intent in denying benefits to certain undocumented persons who have come to be known as the ``late amnesty'' class of immigrants. Through this limitation, Section 377 of IIRA IRA has caused significant hardships, and denied due process and fundamental fairness, for hundreds of thousands of hard working immigrants, including several thousand in my home State of Nevada. These are good, hard-working people who have been in the United States and had been paying taxes for more than ten years, who suddenly lost their jobs and the ability to support their families. 
   In an effort to repeal the limitation on judicial jurisdiction imposed by Section 377 of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, I introduced S. 1552, the Legal Amnesty Restoration Act of 1999. In addition to repealing Section 377, S. 1552 would also change the date of registry for those immigrants seeking legalized, documented status in the United States from January 1, 1972, to January 1, 1984. The legislation I am introducing today focuses on this aspect of last year's legislation, and would change the date of registry from January 1, 1972, to January 1, 1986. 
   The date of registry exists as a matter of public policy, with the recognition that immigrants who have remained in the country continuously for an extended period of time--in some cases, up to thirty years--are highly unlikely to leave. Today, we must accept the reality that many of the people living in the United States are undocumented immigrants who have been here for quite a long time. Consequently, many people living in this country do not pay their fair share of taxes because they are unable to work legally. Furthermore, the businesses who employ these undocumented persons also do not pay their fair share of taxes. These are the facts, and coupled with the knowledge that we can't simply solve this problem by wishing that it will go away, is the reality we must face when considering our immigration policies. 
   We last changed the date of registry in 1986, with the passage of the Immigration Reform and Control Act, which changed the date to January 1, 1972. In doing so, the 99th Congress employed the same rationale I have outlined above in support of a registry date change. Furthermore, I have mirrored the 99th Congress in another, critical aspect, by establishing an approximate fifteen-year differential between the date of enactment and the updated date of registry. 
   Mr. President, I should note one more thing about the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That legislation which last changed the date of registry was passed by a Democratic House of Representatives and a Republican Senate, and was signed into law by President Reagan. I mention these facts to highlight my hope that support for this legislation will be bi-partisan and based upon our desire to ensure fundamental fairness as a matter of public policy in this country. 
   Finally, the legislation I am introducing today builds upon the fifteen year differential standard established in the 1986 reform legislation by implementing a ``rolling registry'' date which would sunset in five years without Congressional reauthorization. In other words, on January 2002, the date of registry would automatically change to January 1, 1987, thereby maintaining the fifteen year differential. The date of registry would continue to change on a rolling basis through January 1, 2006, when the date of registry would be January 1, 1991. Limiting this annual, automatic change to five years will allow the Congress to examine both the positive and negative effects of a rolling date of registry and make an informed decision on reauthorization. 
   Mr. President, as I stated when I introduced S. 1552 last year, I don't pretend that this legislation will solve all the problems of our immigration and legalization procedures. However, we have an obligation to face our problems, and the reality is that there are many, many undocumented immigrants who live in this country who would be much more productive contributors to American society if they were legal residents, workers and taxpayers. We know this to be true, as evidenced by the thousands of immigrants in Southern Nevada whose status had yet to be adjusted, but were working legally and paying taxes--in some instances for more than ten years--when their employment permits were revoked as a result of the 1996 IIRA IRA legislation. I have met with many of these people on several occasions and I have witnessed, firsthand, their pain and genuine suffering. Good people who have worked hard and paid their taxes in order to live the American dream only to see their efforts turn into a nightmare. 
   As I stated when I introduced S. 1552 last year, I don't pretend that my legislation will solve all the problems of immigration and legalization policies. However, we must face these problems head on, and that is precisely my intent in introducing this legislation today.

This is make-believe senatorial activity. We are not really being Senators. My friend, the majority leader, is treating us as if we are in the House and he is the Rules Committee--the one-man Rules Committee. He is now being so generous to us that he is saying we can offer one amendment, and he designates what the amendment is. We, the minority, believe that we have rights that have been developed in this body for over 200 years, and we are tired of playing make-believe Senators.

   Mr. REID. If I could respond to my friend from Texas, I think maybe we have watched the Senate operate the way it is not supposed to for so long, we think the way it has operated the past year is the way it is supposed to operate. The way the Senate is supposed to operate is when bringing a piece of legislation to the floor, it is open for debate and amendment--not morning business, not debate only. 
   We have the opportunity under the Standing Rules of the Senate to offer amendments to pieces of legislation. That is all we are asking. We have been here for some time. This session of Congress is about over. We have had two opportunities to offer amendments to pieces of legislation, two amendments that were agreed upon by our distinguished majority leader, and also the ad hoc chairman of the Rules Committee in the Senate. 
   I think it is time we have legislation brought to this floor and we treat it the way the Senate has always treated it for 200-plus years.

I say, first of all, that is not substantive in nature. The President has no right to veto that bill. The amendments are basically set by statute. So that is not a good example.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we were able to work our way through the budget this past week. It took a lot of time and cooperation, but I think we were able to make a lot of headway. We are disappointed that a number of our amendments were not adopted. 
   The good news--and I think we should focus on this a little bit this morning--is the fact that gas prices are actually declining, on an average of almost 3 cents a gallon this past week. There is a long way to go to decline to where they first started picking up, but progress has been made. 
   With the vote on the gas tax bill coming up this week, I think we should recognize that the crisis we did see is certainly being diminished, if not alleviated. No one is happy about the cost of a gallon of gasoline. I stopped over the weekend with my daughter, and she filled up their vehicle's gas tank and commented about the price of gasoline. That is the way it is. Gas is too high. However, what we are attempting to do this week is something we should reexamine. We should recognize that if this bill is passed by the Senate, it will either be held at the desk indefinitely or would be what we call blue slipped, if it is sent to the House of Representatives. 
   We should focus on things other than this legislation. For example, if the majority is serious about this matter, we could call up H.R. 3081, the House-passed tax bill which concerns the minimum wage. That is on the Senate Calendar. We could work on that. That would allow other amendments to be offered that are meaningful. 
   There isn't anyone in this body who does not want to see a decrease in the cost of fuel prices. Simply stated, this is not the way to go about it. OPEC has signaled its willingness to produce more oil. Non-OPEC nations have agreed to contribute some 700,000 barrels a day to alleviate this crisis. 
   We would be better off focusing on doing things so we are not as dependent on foreign oil. We have to import 55 percent of the oil we consume in this country. For example, we need to do something to make sure that the oil that is produced in Alaska is used in the United States and not shipped to Asia. We have to do something to make sure we develop a long-term energy policy and do something with alternative fuels. Solar, wind, and geothermal are areas we need to explore. We have spent very small amounts of money each year on hydrogen fuel development; this, some day, will overtake the fossil fuels that we use. 
   There are a lot of things we need to do. One of the things we need not do is try to explain to the American public that we are doing something by reducing the 4.3-cent-a-gallon tax for part of this year. No. 1, in a number of States, if the Federal tax is knocked off, the States are obligated by law to pick up that extra 4.3 cents, or whatever it is, that the Federal Government knocks off. 
   In short, I think we could be using this time in a much more productive fashion than debating the 4.3-cent-per gallon tax reduction which is cosmetic in nature only and is certainly not even a short-term fix. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have lined up five votes on each side. I say, however, to my friend, the manager of the bill, there is a tremendous amount of staff time that is still going to be required. Each side has not been able to review each other's amendments. I respectfully suggest to the majority that the minority doesn't think we have done anything untoward in offering amendments. We have offered half as many as the majority. This doesn't mean they should have twice as many cleared as we have cleared. If both sides can work out the clearance, that is fine. 
   The point I am trying to make is that we are trying to work our way through this amendment process. If there is some effort, in effect, to try to punish us by staying here late to work through these amendments, we are willing to do that. I think the more logical way to go would be to work our way through the amendments. 
   I say to the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, we would be much better off if we gave the staff a matter of hours, perhaps days, to work their way through these amendments. These are very difficult subjects. As to the sense-of-the-Senate aspect, most of those have been resolved. There are some that are very substantive in nature, and we need to work our way through them. 
   I personally think it is going to be impossible to finish this bill today. If we have to vote on all these amendments, we are not talking about 6 o'clock tonight; we are talking about 6 o'clock Monday morning. It is up to the majority whether they want to put us through this. I think the more logical way to do it would be to have our very proficient staffs work on these amendments over the weekend and get it down to a reasonable number so we can complete this bill next week.

The reason the absence of a quorum was suggested was so we could have time to read the amendment. The majority has been trying to supply us with the second-degree amendments. They were unable to do that at this time. 
   So, if it is appropriate, will my friend withdraw his objection? Will the Senator withdraw his objection to the waiving of the reading?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the statements of the Vice President that my good friend from Texas referred to are certainly valid. He stands by those. 
   I am wondering if the Senator from Texas stands by the statement he made on August 5, 1993, when we were working on the budget Deficit Reduction Act, which has set this economy on fire doing great things for the economy. 
   My friend from Texas, speaking about the President's deficit reduction plan, said:  
   This program is going to make the economy weaker. Hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a result of this program.  
   He also went on to say:  
   I believe hundreds of thousands of people are going to lose their jobs as a result of this program. I believe that Bill Clinton will be one of those people.  
   He further said:  
   I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill the American economy is going to get weaker and not stronger, the deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today and not lower. When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes, the economy will create fewer jobs, Government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off.  
   I yield to the Senator, under the resolution, 20 minutes. If the Senator needs more time, it is available.

   Is the Senator from Illinois aware that we have created 21 million jobs since this statement was made that hundreds of thousands of people would lose their jobs?

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, there has been a lot of discussion in the last few weeks about the cost of fossil fuel, gasoline, and diesel fuel being so expensive. It has come to my attention that 56 percent of the fuel that we use in this country comes from foreign nations. Does the Senator think the 
   Vice President was concerned about that and was trying to do something so we would be less dependent on the oil barons of the Middle East?

   Mr. REID. The Senator outlined very clearly the importance of certain spending taking place in this country. I would like the Senator to comment on the fact that when President Bush took office, the yearly deficits, not counting the Social Security surpluses which made the deficit look smaller, were about $300 billion a year. 
   In addition to the President requesting some spending that the Senator outlined so clearly, what is the status of the deficits of this country since President Clinton became President?

In all due respect, if their amendment had been prepared properly, there wouldn't have been an opportunity for us to do our amendment. We think there should be an up-or-down vote. We said all along we are going to get an up-or-down vote, no matter how long it takes, whether the majority is going to approve their Presidential nominee's tax cut; it is as simple as that. We asked for an up-or-down vote for the last 24 hours.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as a matter of formality, I will yield time off the resolution to the manager of this bill. I do it for a specific reason. There has been a lot of attention focused in recent months on gun violence in America. The Senator from New Jersey, who has decided to retire from the Senate, has been the leader on this issue for many years. For example, 33,000 people have been prevented from having guns as a result of the initial work done by the Senator from New Jersey. Those are people who commit acts of domestic violence and are convicted of crimes dealing with domestic violence. Those people can no longer have permits to carry weapons. They can no longer have handguns. 
   One of the few pioneers in the Senate on the Brady bill was the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. LAUTENBERG. He was the person who initially started the work in the Senate and in the Congress on the Brady bill. What does that mean? It means that over 400,000 felons who have attempted to purchase weapons have been prevented from buying those guns. 
   In addition to that, of course, he sponsored a law eliminating funding of an ATF program that allowed convicted felons with weapons violations to apply for and waive probation. In short, it is very good that we have so much attention focused on guns and gun violence and legislation dealing with guns. 
   Before yielding time to the Senator from New Jersey, I want the record to reflect that we are dealing with gun legislation more easily today than we were when this man had the vision to act on some of these laws. Jim Brady depended on FRANK LAUTENBERG to pass the Brady bill. 
   I commend and applaud the Senator from New Jersey for the work he has done, and I yield to him such time as he may consume, off the resolution.

Her half hour will be on the digital divide, not on the Reed amendment. You, of course, would have your half hour to speak about anything the majority cares to.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce legislation along with my esteemed colleague Senator INOUYE that will correct an inequity for veterans who have retired from our Armed Forces with a service-connected disability. 
   Our legislation will permit retired members of the Armed Forces who have a service connected disability to receive military retired pay concurrently with veterans' disability compensation. 
   Mr. President, disabled military retirees are only entitled to receive disability compensation if they agree to wave a portion of their retired pay equal to the amount of compensation. This requirement discriminates unfairly against disabled career soldiers by requiring them to essentially pay their own disability compensation. 
   Military retirement pay and disability compensation were earned and awarded for entirely different purposes. Current law ignores the distinction between these two entitlements. Members of our Armed Forces have dedicated 20 or more years to our country's defense earning their retirement for service. Whereas disability compensation is awarded to a veteran for injury incurred in the line of duty. 
   It is inequitable and unfair for our veterans not to receive both of these payments concurrently. We have an opportunity to show our gratitude to these remarkable men and women who have sacrificed so much for this great country of ours. I hope the Senate will seriously consider passing this legislation, to end at last, this disservice to our retired military men and women. 
   Mr. President, this legislation represents an honest attempt to correct an injustice that has existed for far too long. Allowing disabled veterans to receive military retired pay and veterans disability compensation concurrently will restore fairness to Federal retirement policy. 
   This legislation is supported by veterans service organizations, including the Disabled American Veterans, the American Legion, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. This is simply the right thing to do. Our veterans have earned this and now it is our chance to honor their service to our nation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the leader is right, this is a historic time. It is historic because this is the week we are going to begin deliberations on the budget that will guide all of our spending for this year. We have 13 appropriations bills and as soon as the budget is adopted, we can start appropriating. 
   I hope my friends on the majority side of the Senate will understand that we really are doing quite well as a country. This all began in 1993 when we voted on the deficit reduction plan. I am sorry to report it was not done in a bipartisan fashion. Every vote for that deficit reduction plan was cast by a Democrat. It passed the House of Representatives by one vote. In the Senate, it resulted in a tie that was broken by the Vice President of the United States, AL GORE. As a result of that action, the United States has seen on an unprecedented amount of economic expansion. 
   In April, we reached 107 months of consecutive economic growth, the longest period of economic growth in the history of this country. We are now 2 months beyond that and still growing. We have created about 21 million new jobs. The majority of these jobs are high-wage jobs, high-paying jobs. We have had the lowest unemployment and the lowest inflation in 30 years. 
   We talk about the size of Government. Well, we have actually done something about the size of Government as a result of the program President Clinton initiated and which was supported in the Senate in 1993 by a tie-breaking vote of Vice President GORE and in the House by one vote. We have cut the size of Government. We have talked about the Government continually getting smaller. Now it is about the same size as when President Eisenhower was President. We talked for a year or two about it being the size when President Kennedy was President. We have gone even beyond that. 
   Home ownership is the highest in the history of this country. The country is doing very well. I hope we continue the record economic expansion because it does give us a historic opportunity. 
   We need to save Social Security. We need to make sure it is strengthened. Now that it is going to be OK until about the year 2035, the President wants to move forward and make sure it is OK for another 20 to 30 years. We should do that as soon as we can. 
   We should do something to expand Medicare so that prescription drugs are part of the program. It is no longer adequate that we have hospitalization and some doctor care for senior citizens. It is important we realize they also need help with prescription drugs. 
   People over the age of 65 get an average of 18 prescriptions filled every year. We need to do something about that. Sixty percent of senior citizens have trouble paying for prescription drugs. Some do not get the prescription drugs they need. Some, because they do not have enough money, take half a pill a day when they should take one pill a day. They split the pills. People are actually going without food for medicine. We need to make sure that we, in this richest country in the history of the world, the only superpower in the world, have some program for prescription drugs. I hope we do not squander this opportunity. 
   This already is a Presidential campaign issue. I think we should take a look at what the Republicans are saying about Governor George W. Bush's budget which there is going to be a tremendous tendency to adopt on behalf of the majority. 
   Senator JOHN MCCAIN says:  
   But, more importantly, there is a fundamental difference here. I believe we must save Social Security. We must pay down the debt. We have to make an investment in Medicare. For us to put all the tax cuts--all of the surplus into tax cuts I think is not a conservative effort--I think it's a mistake.  
   Senator MCCAIN is right. This country has a debt of over $5 
   trillion. We should address that in this budget. We should not be going on speculative tax cuts. It seems the only thing the Governor of Texas understands as a solution to a problem is a tax cut. We have an energy crisis. What does he recommend? A tax cut, about which I am sure the oil barons, the oil moguls in the Middle East, are jumping for joy. I guess George W. Bush thinks anytime the price of gas goes up, all the Government has to do is lower the tax and continue producing as much oil as before, and it makes the Middle Eastern oil producers very happy.  
   He also suggested an income tax cut, even though a week ago it was reported in the press all over the country that income tax rates are at their lowest in the majority of categories. Our taxes are lower than they have been for 40 to 50 years, depending on which category one is in. Yet George W. Bush wants an income tax cut. Again, what Senator MCCAIN says about that is:  
   Thirty-eight percent of Governor Bush's tax cut goes to the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans.  
   We have Members in the House who disagree with the budget of George W. Bush. LINDSEY GRAHAM says:  
   It is a large tax cut that's going to eat up all the surpluses if they come about. It does nothing, in my opinion, fiscally responsible to reduce the national debt. It doesn't address the Social Security issue. Here's what Governor Bush said: ``There's plenty of money to take care of the debt, take care of Social Security and give you a big tax cut. The truth is this money is a projection 10 years in the future and Congress' spending plan is going to destroy the projection. If the economy goes south, he--  
   Meaning George W. Bush--  
   has dedicated all the surpluses to a tax cut. The $5.8 trillion debt needs to be addressed quickly.  
   I could not agree more with Representative LINDSEY GRAHAM. We have to address the debt. If we address the debt, we reduce the debt and it is a tax cut for everybody. We pay hundreds of billions of dollars on interest on the debt. If we did not do that, it would be money in everyone's pocket, not just the 38 percent that goes to the wealthiest 1 percent of people in this country. 
   We are going to debate the budget this week to find out if we are going to adequately take care of the needs of this country. Can we meet the demands we have? What demands do we have? One can look at all the appropriations bills and, at random pick, for example, the Interior appropriations bill. Our national parks are the envy of the world, but our national parks have a backlog of renovations and repairs of almost $10 billion. We are closing national parks. The national parks deserve some attention. In the State of Nevada, we only have one national park and it too has a backlog of needed repairs. The people who work for the National Park System live in quarters that are unbelievable. They are bad. 
   In Grand Canyon National Park, in the sister State of Arizona, they live in facilities that are difficult to describe. They look like big tin cans. People who work to preserve or national parks should not have to live in facilities such as that. 
   We need to help our National Park System, not only with the living quarters of the people who work in the parks, but also simply to make it so that when tourists visit them, they can visit all the parks, and that the roads are OK, the trails are OK, and, in fact, that we do a better job of preserving our parks. 
   We can look at every appropriations bill we have to consider this year and there are things that need to be dealt with. 
   The point I am trying to make is, the American people recognize that there are things we need to do other than cutting taxes. We need to make sure we take care of Social Security, we address education, and, as I have already talked about, we need to do something about Medicare. There are priorities the American people have that are more important than reducing Federal income taxes, which are the lowest they have been in 40 to 50 years. 
   I hope, as this debate unfolds this week, we will be able to seize upon this opportunity to continue the record economic expansion that was started in the 1993 Budget Deficit Reduction Act. I hope we can meet this historic opportunity, on a bipartisan basis, and vote on amendments that come before us on this budget bill not on strictly a partisan basis but on what is best for this country. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to take a little while this morning to lay the foundation for a vote we will be taking later today. There is going to be a limited amount of time to talk about the cloture vote on the gas tax repeal. 
   No one is happy about the cost of gasoline in America today. It is something of which we are all aware, especially those of us on the west coast. In the State of Nevada, there are places where gas can cost more than $2 a gallon. In California, that is the rule rather than the exception. 
   However, what the majority is attempting to do today, in moving this legislation forward, is something that should not take place. The bill was placed on the calendar under what we call rule XIV. That means it is acted on in an expedited fashion. It goes right here. It has not had a single hearing in the Finance Committee, the committee of jurisdiction. There is no companion bill that has passed the House. If this bill is passed by this body, only two things can happen: No. 1, it will lie here on the desk indefinitely; or, No. 2, it can be sent to the  House where it will be automatically blue slipped, meaning that the bill is dead. So it is quite clear the repeal of the gas tax is nothing more than an effort to make a political statement, and I think the political statement is not appropriate. 
   If the majority is serious about this matter, it should call up, for example, the House-passed tax bill. There is one there, H.R. 3081, dealing with minimum wage and various other tax matters. 
   I do not believe there is anyone in this body who does not want a tax decrease on fuel. But this is not the way to go about it. Let's keep in mind where we are. OPEC has agreed to produce more oil. In addition to that, there are other nations, such as Mexico and Norway, that have agreed to produce more oil. It is going to take some time before these gas prices go down, but they will. 
   To show how really frail in logic the majority is on this matter, they recognize it should be just a short-term fix. That is, by the end of the year a certain mechanical thing would happen that would reestablish the tax. Remember, we are talking about a tax of 4.3 cents per gallon. So I think the action by the majority leader is wrong. 
   There are a lot of things we can do, I think, to meet some of the demands for fuel we have in this country. For example, there are 300,000 barrels of oil every day produced in our country, in Alaska, that are shipped to Asia. Should that oil not be shipped to the United States? Obviously, the answer is yes. 
   There is also every reason to believe there are things we can do to lessen our dependency on this foreign oil. We could develop alternative fuels. I think we could improve the efficiency of energy use through different economy measures. One of the things we have not done for many years is advance and enhance fuel efficiency standards, what we call CAFE. Given the modern technology that we have, there is no reason in the world we cannot produce automobiles in America that are more fuel efficient. We did it once before, and it was tremendous. It was unheard of, that cars would get over 20 miles to the gallon of gasoline, but we were able to do that through modern technology. 
   We need to promote renewable energy. In what ways? Geothermal, solar, wind. As soon as the energy crisis was over, it seemed we backed off from that as a government. We fight every year in this Senate Chamber. Every year, there is a battle. I am the ranking member of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee on Appropriations. Senator DOMENICI, from New Mexico, is the chairman. We have an ongoing battle in here every year, trying to get more money for alternative energy programs--geothermal, solar, wind. 
   There are other things that simply need to be done that are not being done. Reducing the price of fuel by 4.3 cents a gallon for part of a year is not the solution to the problem. 
   It is important that we recognize some of the things that are being written around the country. There are lots of things being written about how foolish it would be to reduce the price of gas for part of the year by 4.3 cents a gallon, especially when one keeps in mind the tremendous infrastructure needs in this country. 
   Take, for instance, the State of Nevada. I hope to travel to Nevada tomorrow to be part of a very large celebration. That celebration will deal with cutting a ribbon to open a highway project, the largest public works project in the history of the State of Nevada, except for Hoover Dam and a few other programs. Certainly, without question, it is the largest public works project that relates to highways. This one thing we call the spaghetti bowl cost $100 million. 
   Those moneys came from this tax. When the American consumer goes to the fuel pump and buys gasoline, there is money taken every time, about 18 cents a gallon, and put into a trust fund. That money can be used for the construction of roads, bridges, highways. That is why I am able to go to Las Vegas tomorrow and cut the ribbon on this project. It will alleviate traffic problems significantly in that area. 
   These programs take place all over America, and if we cut this program, if we eliminate this 4.3-cents-a-gallon gasoline tax, it will mean we will not have approximately $6 billion a year for construction projects around the country. 
   That is why there is a bipartisan effort to defeat this foolish proposal to take away this tax. 
   I was here yesterday afternoon when Senator WARNER of Virginia, who serves, and has served for many years, on the Environment and Public Works Committee and is one of the senior members of that committee, said it is not the right thing to do. Sitting in the position of Presiding Officer yesterday was Senator VOINOVICH of Ohio. He was relieved of his duties as Presiding Officer and came down and gave a speech as to why this should not be done. 
   I hope we will look at this and realize that papers all over America, not the least of which is the New York Times, talks about the ``Gasoline Tax Follies.'' This means it is simply a foolish thing to do. 
   Quoting from the New York Times:  
   Let's start with why the oil cartel should love this proposal. 
   Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister: What sets the limits to how high you want to push oil prices? The answer is that you are afraid that too high a price will lead people to use less gasoline, heating oil and so on. Suppose, however, that you can count on the U.S. Government to reduce gasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. Then Americans are less likely to reduce their oil consumption if you conspire to drive prices up--which makes such a conspiracy a considerably more attractive proposition.  
   They go on to say:  
   A cynic might suggest that that is the point.  
   They are being critical in this article, among other things, about Gov. George W. Bush pushing for repeal of this gas tax. In fact, they say, as others say, it appears his solution to all the problems in America today is tax reduction. For example, we know he wants over a $1 trillion tax cut over the next few years. The American people do not accept this. Why? Because they think it is more important that we have targeted tax cuts and we also spend these moneys, if we have extra moneys, to do something about education, to fix the prescription drug problem we have with Medicare, make sure we bolster Social Security, and, most 
   important, that we do something to reduce the $5 trillion debt that has accumulated. 
   This New York Times article goes on to state:  
   A cynic might suggest that that is the point. But I'd rather think that Mr. Bush isn't deliberately trying to throw his friends in the oil industry a few extra billions; I prefer to believe that the candidate, or whichever adviser decided to make gasoline taxes an issue, was playing a political rather than a financial game....... 
   This is one case in which a tax cut would lead directly to cutbacks in a necessary and popular government service.  
   I hope the Senate, in a bipartisan fashion, will resoundingly defeat this effort to roll back this 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax. There are other places we can look to move taxes back or adjust taxes. Certainly, this is not one of those places. We need to do better than this. 
   I repeat, I hope in a bipartisan fashion this afternoon we will defeat the motion to invoke cloture on the repeal of the 4.3-cents-a-gallon gas tax.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Virginia leaves the floor, I want to say a couple of things in his presence. 
   When I came to the Senate, the Senator from Virginia was a Member of the Senate. I had the good fortune of being assigned to the Environment and Public Works Committee, as was the Presiding Officer when he came to the Senate. 
   I worked putting myself through law school in the Capitol complex. 
   I never talked to a Senator during that period of time. I always had a kind of a vision of what a Senator was like. I have to say, the Senator from Virginia fills what I think a Senator should be. If there were ever a gentleman Senator, the Senator from Virginia fits that bill. 
   We have worked together on committees over the years. When we were in the majority, I was the chairman of a subcommittee. I was a junior Member of the Senate at the time, but the respect shown as the chairman of that subcommittee was as it should be from the Senator from Virginia. 
   We are no longer in the majority, and the Senator from Virginia is now the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. Even though we have not always worked together on issues, and we have voted differently on occasion, I have the greatest admiration for the way the Senator from Virginia handles himself as a person and as a Senator.  
   I say with the deepest respect, the Senator's statement today amplifies--and the people of Virginia should understand--the courage it takes to be, in this instance, a minority in a majority who speaks out against what, at first glance, seems very popular--reducing taxes. 
   In short, I commend, applaud, and appreciate this Senator for the courage he has shown. One of my jobs on this side of the aisle is to make sure we have enough votes on issues or at least know where the votes are. The Senator's statement today will allow the Senate to act tomorrow in a bipartisan fashion and defeat this motion to invoke cloture. We need to do more things in the Senate in a bipartisan fashion. We do not always need this line dividing us. We need to work together more often. 
   I hope this will be the beginning of this Senate working together on more issues. I appreciate the example set by the gentleman Senator from Virginia.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I came to the floor when I heard the Senator from Virginia beginning to speak on this issue and, of course, stayed to hear him complete his remarks. I underscore and underline what the Senator said. 
   It was maybe 10 or 12 years ago that every weekly publication in America, and many newspapers, featured articles about the deteriorating infrastructure of this country--highways, roads, bridges, dams. They were falling apart. They still are, but we have made great progress. Why? Because we dedicated money in a trust fund to be used for only one purpose, and that is highways. 
   When someone buys a gallon of gasoline in Ohio, Virginia, or Nevada, they can rest assured that money is going to go toward our deteriorating infrastructure. It is so badly needed. 
   I am going to Nevada on Friday, and we are going to have a celebration. Why are we going to have a celebration? Because we are going to cut the ribbon to the largest highway public works project in the history of Nevada. It was done with the help of the Senator from Virginia. It was a direct allocation to the people of the State of Nevada to take care of a very serious traffic problem we had in downtown Las Vegas. It is something known as the spaghetti bowl. That will be completed on Friday. It is a project that cost over $100 million. 
   From where did that money come? From people all over the country, including the people in Nevada, buying gasoline and diesel fuel and paying the taxes on that gallon of fuel. It went into the 
   fund. There are other spaghetti bowls around America to which this tax has gone. 
   No one is happy about the cost of a gallon of gasoline, and I am not here to justify the cost of gas. I think it is too high. I wish it were lower. We, in America, should look at this as a glass being half full, not half empty. The reason I say that is, in spite of the spiraling gas prices which none of us like, we have the lowest gas costs in the world. Other countries buy gas by the liter, and they pay a lot for it. 
   I hope, with the OPEC nations going to produce 1.7 million barrels of gasoline a day extra and Norway and Mexico and other countries producing more, we are going to get over 2 million barrels of gasoline a day. It will take some time for the price of gas to drop. We cannot be rushing forward on these issues. We have to be calm and deliberate. 
   This is a tax bill, and we should handle tax bills by having hearings in the Finance Committee. We have two very fine people there, some of the most experienced legislators not only in the Senate today, but in the history of the country--the Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, the chairman of the committee, and the ranking member, the Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. They have wide-ranging experience. 
   Senator MOYNIHAN is not only a ranking Democrat on the Finance Committee, he was chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. They should have a hearing on this and talk about--the good and the bad about lowering this gas tax. We have not had a single hearing. This bill is here as a result of what we call rule XIV. There is no companion bill in the House. If this bill is passed, it will either be held here at the desk indefinitely, or if we send it to the House, it will be blue slipped. It is a tax bill. It will go nowhere. I am sorry to say, this is for show. 
   We have a tax bill, H.R. 3081. This is what we need to do. There is no one in this body who does not want to see a decrease in the price of gasoline. This is not the way to go about it. 
   The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, has suggested maybe we should direct the 300,000 barrels a day that flow from Alaska to places, other than the United States, to the United States. Use Alaska oil for us, not them. That would help. 
   In fact, this legislative action that is going to take place tomorrow is a step in the wrong direction. I will not go into the details. The Senator from Virginia has done a good job of that. Let's be more careful and more calculating in what we do. 
   Because my two colleagues from Virginia and Ohio are here, both members of the majority, I am only going to touch briefly--because I do not think this should be a partisan issue--on George W. Bush's stand on this issue. I am disappointed in Governor Bush. I hope he does not think the solution to every problem is lowering taxes. I wish he would reassess his view on this. He has come out for lowering this gas tax. I am sorry he has done that. 
   That is enough on partisan issues. We have been very bipartisan and will continue to do so. 
   Mr. President, do you know who would love this proposal? The oil cartel. Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister. You set these limits as high as you want or as low as you want, and the oil prices are pushed up. You are afraid, the higher the price of gasoline, that people will use less gasoline and heating oil and cut your exports. Suppose, however, you can count on the U.S. Government to reduce gasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. They have a great deal going then. Then Americans are less likely to reduce their oil consumption and conspire to drive prices up, which makes such a conspiracy considered more attractive. 
   This is directly from the New York Times. 
   It is not original with me. 
   They further go on to state: This tax cutback would lead directly to cutbacks in necessary and popular Government services. This is one instance where everyone agrees that if you cut taxes, it would lead directly to cutbacks in necessary and popular Government services. 
   We have talked about what those Government services are; namely, taking care of the deteriorating bridges, roads, and highways we have in America. 
   Tax cuts are not the answer to this problem. 
   I hope people on this side of the aisle and people on that side of the aisle will come here tomorrow and vote this down and, hopefully, pave the way, in the ensuing weeks and months, so that we can do other things in a bipartisan fashion. 
   I say to my friend, again, from Virginia, thank you very much for your leadership on this issue. I say to the Presiding Officer, a member of our committee, the Environment and Public Works Committee, thank you very much for your courage and your leadership on this issue. Obviously, from what has been read by the Senator from Virginia from the newspapers at home, they see that you have your eye on the prize and know what you are doing. Congratulations.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, last year we spent a great deal of time talking about whether or not we should have an $800 billion tax cut. We spent an inordinate amount of time working on that. The minority, the Democrats, thought we should not do that, that it was too much; that instead of having this large tax cut, we should have some targeted tax cut, much, much, much smaller. This debate went on for months. The sad part about it is, when we came to the appropriations bills, the 13 appropriations bills, suddenly there was no money. Even though there had been $800 billion set aside, supposedly for tax cuts, there was no money to take care of the expenses that were necessary in the funding of this country. 
   Day after day we were talked to--some say talked down to--by our friends on the other side of the aisle, that the economy would come to a grinding halt if we did not pass this $800 billion tax bill. Of course, that has not happened. Not only did the minority not buy the plan of the majority, but the American people did not buy the plan. In any poll taken, the American people decided there were more important priorities. 
   What were those priorities? 
   Education--when you have 3,000 children dropping out of high school every day, you would think that would be a priority. 
   Social Security is a priority. We have to make sure in the outyears Social Security is as good to people as it is today. Social Security is going to be doing just fine until the year 2035, maybe 2036. But after that period of time, people will only be able to draw 75 percent or 80 percent of their benefits. We need to make sure after that time they can draw all their benefits. 
   We have to make sure Medicare is taken care of, that we do 
   something on this program that has been in existence for 35 years to take care of people who need prescription drugs; that is, all seniors. The average senior over age 65 fills 18 prescriptions a year. So we have to make sure Medicare, a very important program that has done a great deal to help the American senior population, that has allowed them to live longer and live more productive lives--we have to make sure that as a component of that there are some benefits for prescription drugs. 
   We have to make sure the debt is paid down. During the Bush-Reagan years, we accumulated a huge debt of some $5 trillion. It is time we started paying down that debt. We are not going to have the rosy economic scenario we now have forever. We are in the longest economic growth period in the history of this country. We are now in the 108th or 109th month, but that does not mean it will go on forever. It will not. I hope when the economic downturn comes, we will have paid down that debt and not have voted for irresponsible tax cuts. 
   It is interesting that the demagoguery and rhetoric has not stopped. It is at full blast--again, talking about tax cuts. Governor George W. Bush has recently proposed tax cuts which would add up to $1 trillion over 10 years. House Majority Whip DELAY from Texas--Congressman DELAY--last week, when asked about this, said let's do that and even more. He wants even larger tax cuts than George W. Bush has called for. I think there could be no better example of ignoring the wishes of the American people and ignoring what the economy needs. 
   As justification for this $1 trillion worth of tax cuts over programs such as saving Social Security, doing something about education, Medicare, and of course doing something about the national debt, the Governor and others in the majority continually point to the overwhelming tax burden on the American people. I imagine there were a few people around America this past Sunday wondering why have we been talking about that after reading newspapers all over America. 
   A column in the Washington Post from the front page reads: ``Federal Tax Level Falls for Most; Studies Show Burden Now Less Than 10%.'' 
   This was not a partisan poll put out by the Democrats or some liberal think tank. This information is from a series of studies by liberal and conservative tax experts. It shows that taxes are at their lowest point in more than 40 years; Federal income taxes are at their lowest point in more than 40 years.

   Mr. REID. I draw my colleagues' attention to this front-page story and a few of the statistics the article discusses. 
   The middle fifth of American families with average incomes of $39,100 paid 5.4 percent in income tax in 1999, down from 8.3 percent in 1981. Families with an income of $54,900 paid 7.46 percent in income tax, the lowest level since 1965. Even the median two-earner families making $68,605 a year were at 8.8 percent, paying their lowest level of income tax in 50 years. 
   According to the Washington Post and other newspapers around America, even conservative think tanks see the writing on the wall. A spokesperson for the Conservative Tax Foundation said:  
   It's a shocker.  
   That was referring to the 8.8-percent income tax level.  
   Low Federal taxes make it harder to make a case for tax cuts. With the lower- to middle-income tax payers paying so little there won't be pressure [for change].  
   Bruce Bartlett, senior policy analyst at the Dallas-based National Center for Policy Analysis, another conservative group:  
   Taxes are never showing up as a major factor. As far as people wanting a big Reaganesque tax cut, I just don't see it. People are satisfied with their economic situation.  
   It is time we start addressing the real problems facing this country. Sure, we would all like less taxes, but let's look where the taxes are coming from. They are coming from State and local government, not from the Federal Government. Take a look at payroll taxes, but get off the income tax kick. The taxes are the lowest they have been in some 40 to 50 years, according to your tax category. Even a Bush adviser acknowledges that taxes have declined for many low- and middle-income Americans. I don't know if this adviser for Governor Bush will continue working for him. 
   The problem, which is what we have been saying, as quoted in the article:  
   Federal income taxes are so low for so many Americans that it is little wonder many voters place taxes near the bottom of their priorities in many opinion polls.  
   Why are our friends on the other side of the aisle not listening to the American people? The public continues to demand first things first. What are they? Save Social Security, especially when we have the budget surpluses which allow extending Social Security's long-term solvency. The fact  can't be ignored. We must do something about Social Security in the outyears. Republicans basically want to ignore Social Security, ignore the debt of $5 trillion, and squander this surplus with rhetoric which champions more than $1 trillion worth of tax cuts. 
   Remember, we have the lowest taxes in some 40 to 50 years, according to your tax category, yet most of the rhetoric on that side of the aisle has been: Lower Federal income taxes. 
   As I said on numerous occasions, paying down the debt is a tax cut for everyone. If we cut down the $5 trillion debt, which means we pay less interest every year as the Federal Government's biggest obligation, other than military, we would save billions and billions of dollars every month. It seems to me that is where we should put our priorities. Paying down the debt is a tax cut for everyone. Interest saved from paying down the debt could be credited to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds, which would extend their solvency and give us flexibility to target tax cuts. In other words, let's do tax cuts we can afford. 
   Certainly, there are some tax cuts that are necessary. We can increase the standard deduction for both single and married filers. We can provide tax relief to married couples who suffer as a result of their having been married. We can offer a long-term tax credit, providing a deduction for long-term-care insurance premiums. In America today, people are living longer, more productive lives. As a result, there are a lot of people going to extended-care facilities. It has become a tremendous burden for people placed in these institutions. We need to provide some tax credits for people who buy insurance for their golden years. This tax cut makes it easier not only for the people who buy the insurance but for families who care for their elderly family members. 
   We need to increase deductions to make health insurance more affordable and accessible, especially for self-employed Americans. We need to increase the maximum amount of child care expenses eligible for tax credit. These are targeted, reasonable tax cuts that would more evenly distribute the load. 
   I think it is remarkable we can pick up the paper Sunday and get the good news. The good news is, Federal income taxes are the lowest they have been in America for 40 to 50 years. I think that says a lot for the 1993 Budget Deficit Reduction Act that passed without a single Republican vote; we passed it. The Vice President came to the Senate and broke the tie. As a result of that, America has been put on a long-term economic upturn. Not only has there been great economic news in that the economy is doing well for a record amount of time but, in addition to that, taxes are lower than they have been in 40 to 50 years.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this morning I want to talk about export controls. We all brag and are enthused about what is going on in the high-tech industry in America. There are stories we can tell of friends who have made huge amounts of money in the new economy. 
   It is truly unbelievable and remarkable what we can do today. This little thing I carry in my pocket has all my addresses and phone numbers. It has in it a dictionary. It has in it a calculator. It has in it the Old and New Testaments. It is unbelievable what is in this little, tiny thing I carry around in my pocket. With the flick of my hand, I can get anything I want out of this. 
   While we are talking a good game in Washington, we are not doing a good job to support this strong economy and to make sure the high-tech industry is allowed to continue. 
   We need to pass the Export Administration Act. We have not passed it. As a result--and it will happen if we do not pass a law--this industry is going to go someplace else with the jobs. The Bureau of Export Administration and the Defense Department are still conducting their business as if we were in the cold war. The cold war is over, and we have to really understand the economic and political world has changed dramatically. 
   Last year, Senators GRAMM, ENZI, and JOHNSON, together with the leader, Senator LOTT, agreed to move forward the Export Administration Act before the end of 1999. Each one of those Senators has lived up to what they said they would do. They have tried to move the bill forward. The chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM, has worked very hard to move this legislation forward. Senators ENZI and JOHNSON have worked hard. The  majority leader has tried to move this legislation forward. 
   Frankly, the majority is unable to join together to allow us to move this bill forward. It was on the floor for an hour or so 2 weeks ago. I repeat, it is not for lack of trying by Senators GRAMM, ENZI, and JOHNSON. They all worked in good faith and have tried to accommodate everyone. 
   When the bill passed out of the Banking Committee, it had the full support of the committee, while still protecting our national security. I am afraid, due to the serious disagreements within the majority, this bill will not come to the floor anytime soon. That is really too bad. 
   I have the greatest respect and admiration for the ability of Senator GRAMM of Texas to legislate. He has done many things from the time he was in the House to his time in the Senate. I hope he can use some of the experience and wisdom he has to move this forward. The majority must move this bill. I do not believe we are living up to what is necessary for this burgeoning economy if we do not move this legislation. 
   A couple days ago, I met with members of the high-tech industry. They voiced concerns about the need to update our export policies. They said it was one of their two or three top concerns and, frankly, a few Members of the majority are stopping our Nation's progress in this area. 
   As with many issues, I often hear Congress will best serve the public and industry by doing nothing at all. That is simply not true. This is one of the areas in which we can be of great help to the high-tech community, in export controls. It is essential. There are currently a number of U.S. products that cannot compete with our foreign competitors due to export control limitations, not because of national security interests but because of the slow review process in Congress. We are trying to change that. That is what I am talking about. 
   In June of 1999 and January of this year, with the urging of the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, myself, and others, the administration agreed to ease the level of controls which are referred to as MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. MTOPS. We, as well as those in the computer industry, were elated by the news. 
   However, as it stands now, there is a 6-month congressional review period for raising the level of MTOPS. The Banking Committee bill reduces the time from 180 days to 60 days. This is a step in the right direction. But I, along with Senator BENNETT of Utah, Senator DASCHLE, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts, Senator MURRAY, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator KENNEDY, and Senator BOXER, believe a further reduction is necessary; that is, to 30 days. There is an amendment pending, if this bill ever comes back up, to change it to 30 days. I am confident it will be adopted overwhelmingly. 
   The reality of the situation is, by limiting American companies to this degree, we are not only losing short-term market share but we are allowing foreign companies to make more money and, in turn, create better products in the future, to which we will never catch up. 
   This could lead to the eventual loss of our Nation's lead, and it is an absolute lead in computer technology, which has propelled the United States to the good economic standing we are experiencing today. The issue of updating our export controls is critical to our Nation's economy and the success of our high-tech industry. 
   I urge the majority to move this bill forward, to allow the amendment process, and let's get on with it. The cold war is over. People must understand the cold war is over. If American companies can make more money overseas, they will simply invest more money into research and development there, and that is wrong. 
   I extend my appreciation to my friend from Colorado for allowing me to proceed.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to leaving the floor, I hope the leader gets the message that we have a lot of work to do. There was a dialog that went on in the Chamber today talking about the many things that need to be done. Minimum wage was talked about at some length. I also remind the majority that there are other things we need to get to work on. We are not doing anything related to education. We have health care delivery problems that need to be addressed, including Patients' Bill of Rights, prescription drugs for seniors, and Medicare. 
   There are other things that may not sound as important but are just as important. I met again today with some high-tech people. I know the Senator from Tennessee has spent some time on the Export Administration Act. I hope the majority will allow us to move forward on that legislation. It is extremely important to the high-tech industry, which is the flagship that is now driving this economy. 
   The minority is ready to work day and night on all these issues. The reason I am so concerned is I have worked since my time in the Senate with Senator BYRD. He has been whip, he has been majority leader, minority leader, chairman as well as ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, and many other positions, but I have worked with him my entire 14 years in the Senate on the Appropriations Committee. I know how long it takes to work the appropriations process. We have 13 appropriations bills we must move, and it must be done before October 1. 
   We don't have a budget yet. We have 13 subcommittees with the appropriators waiting to move their bills. We cannot do it until we get a budget. I don't think we are at a point of desperation yet, but there is a lot of work to do and not much time to do it. I hope the majority allows the Senate to move forward on all these important things as quickly as possible.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Missouri wants to speak in morning business. 
   We are ready to proceed on the issues that have been outlined. We are anxious to get to the Social Security earnings limit withdrawal. Also, we are anxious and look forward to the budget debate which will take place, we hope, next week. We must keep our eyes on the prize, and that is to do something about the $5 trillion debt that has accumulated, recognizing that is necessary for a tax cut for everybody in America.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we on this side of the aisle look forward to working on eliminating the Social Security earnings limitation. I just returned from Nevada. It was amazing the number of people who came up to me and said, Are you going to do finally something about eliminating the earnings test on Social Security? As the leader has said, we have talked about this a long time but done nothing. It is time now that we join together, as we are going to do Wednesday, to pass this important bill. 
   This legislation will pass overwhelmingly with both Democrats and Republicans voting for it. Why? Because the America of today is much different from the America of 1935 when Social Security came into being. People are living much longer lives, healthier lives, more productive lives, and there is no reason in the world why we do not have people working as long as they want and as hard as they want. We need to remove this limitation. We have a problem in America today in its lack of productivity. This legislation will help a great deal because some of the most productive people in the world are people who are over age 65. So I look forward to joining Senators on both sides of the aisle to make sure we pass this bill as quickly as possible. As the leader said, we should do it Wednesday afternoon. 
   In looking forward to next week, to the budget resolution, this is a time where we have an opportunity to look at what the Nation is going to do financially for the coming year. I think it is important we all prepare for this debate. There is a limited amount of time we can debate this issue. There is no limitation on the number of amendments that can be offered. We certainly hope there is not an unlimited number of amendments, but that people will give thought and consideration to the ones that are most important. 
   The Democrats today are going to take some time to talk about a number of issues, and leading the debate will be the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, Senator BYRON DORGAN. When he is called upon, he is going to talk about a number of issues. 
   The Senator from North Dakota has certainly been a leader on the issue of the Federal Reserve System, and there is no one who has been more articulate when talking about the need to do something about the Federal Reserve System and its secretive nature, and the fact that, as an example, they have a $3.5 billion slush fund that is there to be used for many other programs in the Federal Government. 
   There is no need to have the Federal Reserve with this amount of money, this pot of money, this $3.5 billion that they simply have never used since its inception. This money can be used for education. It can be used for many of the other programs for which we are searching for money. I hope during today we will have a good discussion on issues that are affecting this country and that tomorrow we move forward on the social security earnings legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we look forward to today's activities. We hope we can move forward with an up-or-down vote on these two nominations. We also are looking forward to the legislative skills of the chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator GRAMM, to get us to the point where we can again work on the Export Administration Act, which was considered yesterday for a brief period of time. This legislation is extremely important to the country. It is important not only to the high-tech industry but our economy generally. There is not a piece of legislation that is more important to move along than this one as it will allow us to compete with foreign nations in the exportation of computers and other high-tech equipment. This is something that needs to be done, and we hope that in the week we get back from our break, we can move into a very productive session, taking care of the Export Administration Act, doing something about prescription drugs, and other waiting legislative matters, also recognizing that the minority is willing to work in conjunction with the majority in any way to move all legislation. I think we showed our good faith last week when we were able to move such a large amount of legislation including amendments on the education tax initiative that was put forth by the majority. 
   So we look forward to completing today's work and, after next week, doing the many things that burden us legislatively.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the sincerity of the Senator from New Hampshire. But I also recognize that sincerity sometimes does not create the facts that are necessary to substantiate the sincerity.  
   With the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, what we have to understand is that, yes, they have been reversed a lot of times. For example, during the 1995-1996 term, five other circuits had higher reversal rates than the Ninth Circuit. 
   I also say to my friend that if you take, for example, this past year, we have had seven reversals so far. Four of them 
   have come from judges who wrote the opinions and were appointed by Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
   The Supreme Court reverses most cases they take from the circuits. That is what they do. With the Ninth Circuit, they have thousands of cases. There are 51 million people who live within it. Mr. President, I think there is some substance to the fact that we need to take a look at the Ninth Circuit. Maybe it is too big. Maybe we need to revamp how it operates. But don't pick on Berzon and Paez because of that. 
   Also, Judge Paez is a very nice man. He graduated from one of the most conservative universities in the entire country, Brigham Young University. He went to one of the finest law schools in America, Boalt Hall, University of California Berkeley. It is always rated in the top 10. It is a fine, fine law school. His record is one of significant distinction. Here is a man who is unquestionably qualified for the Ninth Circuit or any other court. He has been a judge for 18 years. They have pored over all of the decisions he has made and they found relatively nothing. 
   I can't help what the ACLU says, but I can relate to you that there are many organizations that support his nomination and that are law enforcement-oriented organizations. We can talk about the National Association of Police Organizations; the Los Angeles Police Protective Association; the Los Angeles County Sheriff, Sherman Block, who recognizes his skills; Los Angeles District Attorney Garcetti; JAMES ROGAN, a Republican House Member and member of the impeachment team here just a year ago, supports Judge Paez. The Los Angeles County Police Chiefs Association, the Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, Incorporated, and its president, Pete Brodie, support him. 
   Also, there has been some talk about how antibusiness Judge Paez is. I don't really want to get into this, but the simple fact is that in a very important decision in California--an issue in a very important discovery matter--he ruled for Philip Morris, the largest tobacco company in America. Does that mean he is protobacco? He also ruled in favor of the Isuzu Motor Company in a suit against the Consumers Union. Does that mean he is pro-foreign car manufacturers? Does that mean he is pro-big business? The answer is no. The Unocal case shows that he is a judge who follows the law and plays no favorites, as indicated in the Philip Morris case and the Isuzu Motor Company case. 
   His preliminary ruling in the Unocal case to dismiss may have displeased the company. His decision on that issue no more proves he is antibusiness than he is protobacco or pro-big automobile manufacturer. 
   There has been some talk that this man is antireligion. He is not antireligion. In fact, the case they continually refer to is a case where they are saying he said you can't use a Bible in the courtroom. Here is an exact transcript as to what he told the defendant. This is in court. Everybody was there. He says:  
   I don't have a problem with the Bible. I don't care if you have it there on the table. My concern is I don't want any attempt to sway the jury. I don't want any demonstrative gesture that is not proper.  
   That is the end of the quote. 
   The report also says he told the defendants he would consider permitting the defendants to quote the Bible during closing arguments or to carry the book to the witness stand when they testified. I am not sure I would allow that if I were a judge. But he decided he would do it. 
   I have tried a lot of cases. When somebody comes up to that jury stand, it would be my personal opinion that it is improper to carry the Bible up there. I just do not think it is appropriate. Judge Paez believed it would be. 
   There has been some talk that he has bad judicial temperament. The Almanac of the Federal Judiciary isn't written about Democrats, Republicans, conservatives, or liberals. It includes reviews from attorneys who have appeared before all the Federal judges. They not only have the ability to look at his Federal judicial record but also his 13 years as a State judge in California where he served in the courts of unlimited jurisdiction. The Almanac for 1999 that reviews both his State court experience and his Federal court experience says:  
   Lawyers reported that Paez had an excellent judicial temperament.  
   Some of the quotes from these lawyers include:  
   I think he has great temperament. 
   He has a very good demeanor. 
   He is professional. 
   He doesn't have any quirks. 
   He is very good in the courtroom. 
   He is courteous to everyone.  
   I think we should have an up-or-down vote on Judge Paez and Ms. Berzon. 
   I heard the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, the senior Senator from the State of Utah, talk about Ms. Berzon. He talked about what a great legal mind she has. You may not like her clients. She has done a lot of work for organized labor. But no one questions her qualities. She has a very fine, incisive political mind and will be a great addition to the Ninth Circuit. 
   As I have said, the Ninth Circuit is something of which I am very proud. I am proud of the Ninth Circuit. I fought when there was an attempt to split Nevada off from California. I practiced law in Nevada and in the courts in Nevada. Whether we like it or not, I fought the landmark decision made in the State of California. I fought to make sure Nevada would remain part of the California circuit. 
   I also am very proud of the Ninth Circuit because the senior judge, the man who is the administrative head of the Ninth Circuit Court and the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, is a Nevadan, Judge Proctor Hug, Jr. He is a man who has a great legal mind. He excelled academically at Stanford Law School, and he has excelled on the Ninth Circuit. 
   I don't know, but I would bet that Judge Hug has written some opinions that have been reversed. That doesn't make him a bad man or a bad lawyer. 
   I hope we will look closely at what we are doing here. Judge Paez has a great record in the courtroom, in the classroom, and in the world and society in which he lives. He is a fine man, as is Marsha Berzon. 
   I hope we can move forward with these nominations. I hope there is an overwhelming vote. I think it would send a great message out of this Senate that we need to start doing things on a bipartisan basis. We hear the call for that all the time. 
   There is no clearer example to show that than by voting overwhelmingly for these fine people--Judge Paez and Marsha Berzon. Both have established in their lives records of superior quality.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator GRAMM is not here. The manager of the bill for the Democrats, Senator JOHNSON, has graciously consented so that I can say a word or two about this legislation. 
   I rise to speak about an issue that is of particular interest to me and our national economy. The issue I wish to discuss is export controls. As I stated previously, it is critical that the Congress support the engine of our thriving economy while still protecting the integrity of our national security. 
   Today in America consumer confidence is at a record high. Unemployment is at a 30-year low. New home sales set a record last year. The rate of inflation is less than 2 percent. The stock market has been surging, and corporation profits are better than analysts dreamed. 
   It was announced last month that we are experiencing a record 107 months of economic expansion. This is all proof that Congress and the administration has done a stellar job in steering the country in the right direction. And yet, thus far, we have been unable to pass legislation to update our export controls. The Bureau of Export Administration and the Defense Department are still conducting business under cold war era regulations. The economic and political world has changed dramatically. That is why I am so pleased that this bill has come to the floor today. 
   Last year, I met with Senators GRAMM, ENZI, and JOHNSON, in my office, to discuss export controls. They informed me that The majority leader pledged to them that the Export Administration Act would come to the floor before the end of 1999. 
   Everyone tried, but as happens a lot of times at the end of the session, it was unable to be brought to the floor. That is not because the Senators I visited with--ENZI, GRAMM, and JOHNSON--didn't try. These three Senators, for whom I have the greatest respect, have all worked hard and in good faith to bring all parties to an accommodation. 
   When this bill passed out of the Banking Committee, it had the full support of the committee and the business community, while still protecting our Nation's national security. I am afraid with the addition of many of the amendments in the so-called managers' package that this bill is losing support both from the business community and the national security interests. I hope we can work something out and not have to adopt the managers' amendment as it is written. 
   In January of last year, along with the distinguished majority leader, I, Senator DASCHLE, and a group of Senate Democrats, got together to form a high-tech working group. This group came about because we as Democrats realize the importance of high tech to the Nation's economy. Senator JOHN KERRY, through his leadership capacity, has worked very hard in this regard. 
   We also recognize that Congress can have a large impact on the growth, or potential growth, of this sector of our economy. Our initial goal was to educate our caucus on the high-tech issues. Because of the generation gap between those who run this industry and most Members in the Senate, this took a little time. However, we got to speed very quickly. We toured sites all over the United States, including high-tech sites in Maryland, Virginia, and Silicon Valley. 
   As with many issues, I often hear that Congress would best serve the public and industry by doing nothing at all. One of the areas most believe we can be of help is in the area of export controls of high-performance computers. There are currently a number of U.S. products that cannot compete with national competitors due to export control limitations, not because of national security interests but because of the slow review process here in Congress. 
   In June of 1999, and then in January of this year, with the urging of Senator DASCHLE, myself, and other Senators, the administration agreed to ease the level of controls which were referred to as MTOPS--million theoretical operations per second. 
   We, as well as those in the computer industry, were elated. There is a 6-month congressional review period for raising the level of MTOPS. The Banking Committee bill reduces the review from 180 to 60 days. By the Senate Banking Committee agreeing to the shortened review period of 60 days, the committee recognized a few important things: 
   No. 1, 180 days is too long for an industry whose success depends on its ability to beat its foreign competition to the marketplace;  
   No. 2, a shorter time period gives the Congress adequate time to review the national security ramifications of any changes in the U.S. computer export control regime. 
   While this is a good step in the right direction, I, along with Senators BENNETT, DASCHLE, KERRY, MURRAY, BINGAMAN, KENNEDY, and BOXER, believe that further reduction of this to 30 days makes more sense. 
   The high-performance computers we are talking about have a 3-month innovation cycle. Therefore, if 60 days are taken up in 
   Congress, on top of the turnaround time for new regulations at the administration, the innovation cycle is long overdue. 
   There is no precedent for such a long review period. Even the sales of items on the munitions such as tanks, rockets, and high-performance aircraft only require a 30-day review period. The reality of the situation is that by limiting American companies to this degree we are not only losing short-term market share, but we are allowing foreign companies to make more money and, in turn, create better products in the future. This could lead to the eventual loss of our Nation's lead in computer technology, which has propelled the United States to the good economic standing we see today. 
   This amendment is critical to our Nation's economy and the success of our high-tech industry.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I, first of all, state how appreciative I am of the work done by Senator JOHNSON and Senator GRAMM, the chairman of the Banking Committee. I feel badly that we are not going to be able to go forward on this legislation. 
   We are going to agree to the unanimous consent request, but not because this bill shouldn't be considered. We should be legislating on it today. It is important legislation. It is being held up on the other side of the aisle. This is legislation that the high-tech industry feels confident should be passed. 
   I simply say that the cold war is over, but the high-tech war is just beginning. We need to be the winners of that war. 
   The minority is reluctantly agreeing to this unanimous consent request. We hope the rest of the day and tomorrow can be used in a constructive fashion. We hope the chairman of the Banking Committee can use his experience--he certainly has experience; he proved that when he was in the House of Representatives, and here--to be able to get the warring parties together and move this legislation forward. 
   We have no objection.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to speak a little earlier, but I didn't have the opportunity. The minority is very happy that we are going to move forward on some judicial nominations. One of the nominations holds a record. It is a record that Judge Paez has. He has been waiting more than 4 years to have the Senate decide whether or not he can be elevated to the Ninth Circuit. We feel Judge Paez is eminently qualified. I think we will find that a majority of the majority will also feel that way. 
   Here is a man whose record is unsurpassed. He is a person who has been said to be--these are different quotes--``a well-respected, experienced judge.''  ``Judge Paez has bipartisan support.'' ``Judge Paez is not an `activist', nor is he `anti-business.' '' Judge Paez has outstanding judicial temperament and is not `antireligion.''' Judge Paez has not acted ``unethically.'' ``Judge Paez has committed to follow the law on the death penalty,'' and to follow the law generally. 
   I hope when we look at this man and his qualifications, he will receive an overwhelming vote. He is qualified for the Ninth Circuit. 
   Judge Paez is a graduate of Brigham Young University and he received his law degree from the University of California at Berkeley in 1972. He has received the highest rating given by the American Bar Association to Federal judicial nominees, which is well qualified. 
   It is important to note his nomination swept through here earlier when he was confirmed to the trial court on the Federal judicial level. He served with distinction after we, the Senate, approved his nomination. He has done that for 5 years, where he has served, as I have indicated, as a U.S. District Judge for the Central District of California. He has presided over numerous trials. Prior to being a Federal district court judge, he had a distinguished career as a State court judge. He served as a California State judge for 13 years. He is somebody who has been active in charitable and community affairs. He is a family man. His mother and father and 10 brothers and sisters live in another Western State, the State of Utah. 
   As I have indicated, Judge Paez has bipartisan support from, for example, JAMES ROGAN, a Republican Congressman from California, and a former judge himself; he supports Judge Paez. He has support from Los Angeles district attorney, Gil Garcetti; Los Angeles County Sheriff, Sherman Block; Los Angeles Police Protective League; National Association of Police Organizations; former California judge and president of the Los Angeles Bar Association, Sheldon Sloan; Association for Los Angeles Deputy Sheriffs, President Pete Brodie; Los Angeles County Police Chiefs' Association. It goes on and on. It is a shame we have not worked and gotten this nomination approved earlier. I hope, as I have indicated, this will not become related to some extraneous issue. It should be decided on its merits. 
   Mr. President, I recognize that my friend from Alaska, the chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is going to speak on the Ninth Circuit. I have some familiarity with it because the chief judge in the Ninth Circuit is from Nevada, Procter Hug. We are proud of the fact that he is the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit. He also has rave reviews. He is a graduate of Stanford University School of Law. He has administered the Ninth Circuit very well. I hope those who feel there should be something done about the Ninth Circuit would look at what we have already done. This has become an issue. As a result of that, there was a commission appointed, led by former Supreme Court Justice Byron ``Whizzer'' White. They made a decision on what should be done with the Ninth Circuit, and that it should be kept intact and be administered differently. 
   So I hope the committee of jurisdiction which will review the Ninth Circuit matters will take into consideration what has already been done, and that there will be hearings held as to what should be done, if anything, with the Ninth Circuit.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is important this week that we move forward with the Export Administration Act. This is something that is more than 10 years overdue. We must move forward on that. We are talking about being friendly in the Senate to the high-tech industry. There is nothing we could do that would be more friendly to the high-tech industry today than passing the Export Administration Act. If we are going to continue to be the leader in the high-tech industry in the world, we have to pass this act immediately. If not, we are going to have these businesses move offshore. That is, in effect, what this Export Administration Act does. 
   I commend Chairman GRAMM of Texas. He indicated he would do what he could to move this forward. He has kept his word. This is being held up by just a few of the chairmen of committees. It should not be. This is not a partisan issue. We should move forward, recognizing we are no longer in a cold war, that defense issues can be resolved very easily, and this is something we should finish before we take our break next week. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks of the Senator from Alaska, Senator DORGAN be recognized, in keeping with the previous order entered for 20 minutes.

   Mr. REID. I rise to speak on the comments and statements made by Senator HATCH, chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
   First, Senator HATCH and I don't always agree on substantive issues. I think the country is well served with the leadership of the Judiciary Committee, the Senator from Utah, and the Senator from Vermont. These two men worked tireless hours to try to clear one of the busiest committees we have. I personally wish there were more nominations cleared. I have the greatest respect for Senator HATCH, and, of course, my dear friend, the Senator from Vermont. 
   However, this Ninth Circuit issue is something that should be approached cautiously. We have done that. I say to my friend from Utah and the Senator from Alaska, who introduced legislation, as I said earlier today, we need to take a look at what the White commission said should be done with the Ninth Circuit. They spent a year's period of time listening to witnesses and using their experience and his experience as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court as to what should happen to the Ninth Circuit. They came up with the decision after they reviewed all the alternatives, and the decision was not to split the Ninth Circuit but to change the way it was administered. I think that is something at which we need to take a close look. 
   Senator LOTT, the majority leader, talked about his son being involved in the last issue before the body. I say candidly I have had two sons, one of whom was the administrative assistant for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, my son Leif; and my son Key, who is presently a clerk for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, Procter Hug. I have a keen interest there not only because my two sons have worked for the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit, but, in fact, the chief judge of the Ninth Circuit is a Nevadan, a graduate of the University of Nevada at Reno and Stanford School of Law, and has rendered great credit to this country, the Ninth Circuit, and the State of Nevada. 
   In short, let's not beat up on the Ninth Circuit because there are a lot of people in the circuit. Let's take a look at what should be done with the Ninth Circuit. I think the starting point should be what Justice White's commission said. If there were a few hearings held in the Judiciary Committee, I think we could move on to resolve this problem. 
   I am happy we are moving forward on these two nominations. It is something that should have happened some time ago. We are moving forward on them. Based upon the statements made by Senator HATCH, there should be bipartisan support for both of these nominees. I hope tomorrow, or whenever it is decided by the leadership that we will vote on them, that there are overwhelming votes in support for Judge Paez and Judge Berzon.

   Mr. REID. Will the Senator from New Hampshire yield for a brief time? 
</TEXT>
</DOC>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-3-20000307</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to have a colloquy between the two of us based on some statements made to this point. If I could say to my friend--and there is nobody in the Senate I have more respect for than the Senator from New Hampshire. We have served together on the MIA/POW Committee, and for many years, until he became a full committee chairman, we served as the two leaders of our parties with the Ethics Committee. I have the greatest respect for the Senator. I say, of course, he has a right to filibuster if that is what he chooses. Since the time I have been in the Senate, there have been a number of occasions when there has been, if not a filibuster, at least a delaying of judicial nominees. That is part of the tradition of the Senate. I have no problem with that. 
   I say, though, to my friend that the year the Senator has talked about in some detail--1992--holds the record for confirming more judges than during any other presidential election year. Sixty-six judges were confirmed at that time. That is when we had a Democratic Senate and a Republican President. So that year, 1992, should stand out as an example of how you can move these nominees, in spite of the fact that you have a majority of one party in the Senate, and the other party is represented in the Presidency. I will not take a lot of time, but I want the record to reflect that in 1996 we only had 17 confirmations. 
   So I think what we have been able to do in 1988 and 1992 when we got 42 nominees and 66, which is an all-time record--there is no question because I was there then. Toward the end of the session, there were a lot of nominees who didn't come forward. There was a line drawn and they said no more. Some were submitted too late. 
   What I am saying to my friend is that in addition to what I have just said, we now have 30 nominations pending. Once they get out of committee, let's bring them here and vote up or down on them. I don't know Richard Paez. I talked to him on the phone. I have talked to his mother. I think anybody who has to wait 4 years deserves an up-or-down vote. 
   I say to my friend that if there is something wrong with Judge Paez or Ms. Berzon, come out here and vote them down. But I think we need to move forward with these nominations as quickly as we can. 
   I can only say to my dear friend from New Hampshire that the State of Nevada for 14 years has been the fastest growing State in the Union. We have tremendous problems with the administration of justice. At this time, when the Senator and I are speaking, we are short four judges. It is not Senator LEAHY's fault, it is not Senator HATCH's fault, that these are not being voted on now. They are in the pipeline, so to speak. But we are desperate for judges. That is the way it is in other parts of the country. 
   We really need to move forward. I understand the Senator's feelings on the Ninth Circuit. I have heard them expressed several times today: It is too big. It is unwieldy. They have been reversed too much. That is a problem. I think we need to do something about it. 
   I would be happy to join with my friend. A number of Senators were really upset about this a number of years ago. The commission was appointed led by Justice White. He made recommendations. I think that is a starting point as to how we resolve it. 
   I close by saying, yes, there were people in 1992 who were not given the chance to vote. Keep in mind that the record for the Senate in 1992--when we had a Republican President and a Democratic Senate--is that we approved 66 nominees. There were 17 in 1996 when there was a Democratic President and a Republican Senate.

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield with his right to have the floor, I agree. If there is a Senator who believes there is a problem with any judge, whether it is the one we are going to vote on at 5 o'clock or the two we are going to vote on tomorrow, or Thursday, they have every right to come to talk at whatever length they want. But with Judge Paez, it has been 4 years. There has been ample opportunity to talk about this man. He has bipartisan support. I have no problem with people talking about the decisions he has rendered. He has been a judge for about 18 years in State and Federal courts. I think there has been an exhaustive review of those. 
   If the Senator from Alabama, who has a fine legal mind and is former attorney general of Alabama, and the Senator from New Hampshire, who has had wide-ranging experience in government and in the Senate and House of Representatives, want to talk, more power to them. My only point is, 4 years is too long. 
   I also repeat some of the things the ranking member of the committee has said. It is a myth that judges are not traditionally confirmed in Presidential election years. It is simply not true. Recall that in 1980, a Presidential election year, 64 judges were confirmed; in 1984, 44; in 1988--we talked about that when we had a Democrat Senate and Republican President--42 were confirmed; in 1992, we had 66. That is the record. I think that really says a lot. 
   When we had President Bush and a Democratic majority, and a significant majority, we could have stalled things. We approved 66 nominees--I repeat that for the Record--whereas, in President Clinton's last year of his first term, 17 were approved. That is really not fair. 
   My point is that we need to move these along. I think as part of the legacy of the Republican leadership of this Congress, you can't hold your heads high when you have up to this point confirmed three or four nominees. You need to move up and have 40, 50, or 60. Otherwise, I think you are not fulfilling the need the country has to take care of the tremendous backlog of 30 pending judges and probably 35 or 40 more in the pipeline as we speak. 
   I hope Senator SESSIONS and Senator SMITH of New Hampshire, who are both very fine legislators, will say all they want to say negative or positive about the nominees. But let us move forward and vote on them. 
   I again repeat, I don't think it is a good legacy for the Republican leadership of the Senate to break a record that you certainly don't want to break; that is, in the country that is rapidly growing with all kinds of Federal crimes being committed, we have fewer judges to do the job. It is very desperate. 
   In the State of Nevada, a fine judge in the prime of his judicial life and a senior judge took senior status. It was the only way we could get another judge. It is that way all over the country. 
   I have no problem, I repeat, with what the Senator is doing. I think it is commendable. 
   I also think when we talk about the Ninth Circuit, which I have defended, I have, as I have stated, I guess some could say, a conflict of interest because one of my two sons was administrative assistant to the chief judge and my other boy is presently working there. 
   It is a circuit in which I live and practice law. Let Members not denigrate that circuit. 
   Of course, they have so many cases; and it is true, their reversal rate is high. They decided almost 5,000 cases in a year. Out of approximately 5,000 cases, they have had about 12 or 14 reversals. That is not so bad. The cases that are taken up are ripe for the Supreme Court because they are in conflict with other circuits. 
   That reversal rate has improved. The numbers, as indicated by Senator MURKOWSKI earlier today, are from another year. 
   I think criticism of the Ninth Circuit is certainly in order. Go ahead and criticize the Ninth Circuit. As far as the Senator doing anything unconstitutional, it isn't even close. The Senator has every right to do what he is doing. 
   I appreciate very much the courtesy of the Senator. He did not have to allow me to speak out of order. I know the Senator has a lot to say.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to make an observation. We have heard a lot about the reversal rate of the Ninth Circuit. There has been a lot of talk that the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate in 1996 was some 90 percent, but that was less than five other circuits' reversal rates of 100 percent. 
   In the 1997-1998 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 76 percent, equivalent to that of the First Circuit and less than other circuits because those circuits continued to have a 100-percent reversal rate. 
   In the 1998-1999 term, the Ninth Circuit's reversal rate was 78 percent, which was far less than several other circuits. 
   The point I am making is the Ninth Circuit decides thousands of cases, and they acknowledge, we acknowledge, everyone acknowledges, that 12 to 14 cases are reversed. That is not bad. Remember, the Supreme Court picks cases they believe will make good law, and that is why all these other circuits have a huge reversal rate. That is the way it is. That is the job of the U.S. Supreme Court, to look at these circuits and find cases it believes deserve to be interpreted one way or the other. 
   I hope my friends do not continue harping on the 90-percent reversal rate. It is lower than other circuits. 
   Also, Judges Paez and Berzon are qualified to sit on the court. I went over at some length earlier today the qualifications of Judge Paez, with whom I have spoken on the telephone, and I have talked with his mother. I do not have that same familiarity with Judge Berzon. 
   These are nominations that should go forward. These are good people who deserve the attention of the Senate. Certainly, Paez, after 4 years, deserves an up-or-down vote. I hope we can get to that at the earliest possible date. Judge Paez is not going to go away. He is a good man who is well educated and has been a judge for 18 years, 13 years in State court, some 5 years as a Federal district court judge. Everyone speaks highly of him, not the least of whom is a member of the House Judiciary Committee, a former State judge in California, a devout Republican, James Rogan, who supports Paez. He has bipartisan support. I hope we can move forward on these as quickly as possible. 
   Also, to illustrate what I said earlier, my friend from New Hampshire talked about the fact that in 1992 certain judges were not approved. More judges were approved in 1992 than in the entire history of the country, and we had a Democratic Senate and a Republican President. 
   In Presidential election years, we had a large number of judges approved. 
   Look what happened the last year of President Clinton's first term: 17 judges. And this year we are starting out worse than that. 
   I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, this is not a legacy of which one should be proud. My colleagues need to move these nominations. If there are some nominees whom they do not like, vote them down or do not bring them forward, but let's get these numbers up this year into the fifties or sixties. We need that badly. States all over this country are in desperate need of judges, especially at the trial level. 
   Let's not be so hard on the Ninth Circuit. There are those of us who have practiced law in the Ninth Circuit. We are willing to move forward and do something to improve it. The Presiding Officer is a person who has argued before the Supreme Court--I do not think there is any doubt about this--far more times than anybody else in this body. I could be wrong, but I doubt it. He certainly understands the appellate process very well. 
   The Ninth Circuit needs some changes. Justice White, the leader of a study commission, sat down and decided what needed to be done. Let's start from there and see if we can do  something constructive rather than berate this appellate division that has 51 million people in it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the majority leader leaves the floor, I would like to direct a couple of comments to him. I hope the majority leader saw what happened last week. After some work, we had a bill before the Senate that was almost open. The education savings bill allowed all amendments dealing with taxation, amendments dealing with education, and we threw in a few other amendments as part of the unanimous consent agreement. I might add, I think what happened last week was exemplary as how the Senate should operate. 
   There were no quorum calls, or if there were some, they were momentary in nature. When an amendment was offered, it was debated; there were no dilatory tactics. Even though the minority did not like the bill that was before the Senate, I think we proceeded, showing our good faith that we can work on legislation and move things along. In fact, regarding the one amendment we added, the Wellstone amendment we had a time agreement on it, and I think that amendment was the one of several amendments that was agreed to. There may have been only one other. 
   The point I am making to the majority leader is I hope the majority would allow more business to come before the Senate in the same manner because I think, while it wasn't necessary to show our good faith, the minority showed we can move legislation and move it quite rapidly. That bill had scores of amendments, more Democratic amendments than Republican amendments, but I repeat: We moved that bill well, and I think we showed how the Senate should really operate.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the leader, I think we should be given even more leeway. I think we can get a lot more done. I don't think, on legislation, there would be the disaster that the leader believes. But I think we have made some progress, and I look forward to seeing if we can make more progress. The export administration bill, as the leader said, is a bill that has wide bipartisan support, and we should move forward on this, even though we have some people concerned about it. That is what the process is all about. They should come down and talk about their concerns, vote on it, and move it on. If there were ever a high-tech issue this congressional session, it is this bill. So the high-tech industry can remain competitive and keep that business we so value in the United States, we have to pass this bill or very quickly the business will be going offshore. 
   I thank the leader very much, and I look forward to continued progress on legislation to help the country.

I have had the good fortune over my career--in the business part of it as an attorney and as a government official--to work with people who, for lack of a better description, are very smart. I have to say I have not seen anyone who has more intellectual capacity than ROBERT BYRD. 
   How many people do you know who can recite poetry for 8 hours without ever reciting the same poem twice? He can do that. 
   How many people do you know have actually studied and read the Encyclopedia Britannica? Senator BYRD has. 
   How many people do you know have used a congressional break to study the dictionary and read every word in the dictionary? Senator BYRD has done that. 
   Those of us who serve with him in the Senate, and especially those who serve with him on the Appropriations Committee, are every day amazed at his brilliance. His congressional service has been brilliant. I look forward to his reelection this year and his continued service in the Senate. It has been a remarkable pleasure for me to serve with Senator BYRD.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I was a little boy, I lived in the town of Searchlight, NV. One of my brothers, who is 10 years older than I, worked for Standard Stations. He was assigned to a place called Ashfork, AZ, which to me could have been as far away as New York City because I had never traveled anyplace. 
   When I was a young boy of 11 years, he allowed me to spend a week with him in Ashfork, AZ. My brother had a girlfriend. The thing I remember most about my journey to Ashfork, AZ. The girlfriend had a brother about my age, or a year or so older. We would play games. I never won a single game, not because I should not have, but because he kept changing the rules in the middle of the game. It does not matter what the game was; as I started to win, he would change the rules. So I returned from Ashfork never having won anything, even though I should have won everything. 
   The reason I mention that today is that is kind of what campaign finance is all about in America. The rules keep changing, not for the better, but for the worse. They are complicated. They are impossible to understand. 
   I was recently criticized because I did not disclose the names of people who gave to my leadership fund. Why didn't I? The reason I did not is that I did not legally have to. The most important reason, however, is that people who gave to my fund said: Do you have to disclose my name? And I said no, which was true. That is the law; I did not have to. 
   Over the last several weeks, there have been a number of people writing about the fact I have not disclosed who gave me the money and how much it was. I made a decision that even though it was unnecessary legally for me to do that, I would disclose those names. I could not do that, however, until I went back to the people whom I told I would not make a disclosure and got their permission to do so. I am happy to report I was able to do that. Everyone understood, and they said: Go ahead, I would rather you did not do it, but you have told me why you have to do it; go ahead and do that. 
   That goes right to the heart of what is wrong with the campaign finance system in America today. There is no end to what is politically correct, but yet if a person follows the legal rules, it still may not be politically correct. It is a Catch-22. No matter what one does in the system, it is wrong; people of goodwill trying to do the right thing are criticized. 
   We have to do something. Everything I have done with my Searchlight fund, as it is called, is totally legal. I have not done anything wrong. It has been checked with lawyers and accountants. In fact, when people came to me and said, do you have to disclose my name? I checked to make sure I was giving them the right information when I said no. 
   I thought it was important to follow the law, and I have done that. It was important for me to keep my word. Where I grew up, there was not a church and there was not a courthouse; everything was done based on people's word. If you shook hands with someone or you told them you were going to do something, that was the way it had to be, and that is the way I felt about disclosing these names. 
   It was very hard for me and somewhat embarrassing to go back to these people, and say: May I have your permission to disclose your name, even if you did not want it done? Even though they consented, it was not an easy thing to do. 
   I have disclosed these names and the money. The problem is the system is simply broken. There are traps set up all along the way for people who are trying to comply with the law. If we comply with the law, sometimes we lose the confidence of the public, who come to believe we are all in the grip of wealthy special interests whose cash carves out ordinary Americans from the system. 
   Under our current system, money is the largest single factor, some say, in winning a Federal political election, and a lot of times that is true. The dilemma we face is: Too little money,  and you may very well lose your political position; too much money, and the public thinks you are in someone's pocket, for lack of a better description. 
   I finished an election last year. The State of Nevada at the time of that election had a population of fewer than 2 million people. My opponent and I spent the same amount in State party money and funds from our campaigns. We each spent over $10 million for a total of $20 million in a State of less than 2 million people. That does not count all the money spent in that election because there were independent expenditures also. We do not know the amount because there is no legal reason they be disclosed, but I estimate another $3 million at least. 
   In the State of Nevada, a State of fewer than 2 million people, we had spent $23 million. If that is not an example of why we need campaign finance reform, there is not an example. We need to do something now. 
   I have talked about the State of Nevada, but there are other States in which more money is spent. It is not unusual or uncommon to hear about races costing more money than the $20 million spent in the State of Nevada. Most of those States have more population, but that is still lot of money. 
   We know presently there is a controversy in the election that is going to be held in New York tomorrow. Why? In the Republican primary, there has been an independent expenditure of $2.5 million berating JOHN MCCAIN for his environmental record and for not being supportive of breast cancer research. 
   Every candidate who is running for President of the United States is for breast cancer research. I have already given one example of how much it costs in the State of Nevada and why we need to do something about campaign finance reform. Certainly, in New York, because of independent expenditures, we need to do something. They are gross; they are absurd; they are obscene--$2.5 million to distort the record of a fine person, JOHN MCCAIN, indicating that he is opposed to breast cancer research. I am not going to belabor the point and talk about his environmental record, but if one compares it to whom he is running against, it is not that bad. These independent expenditures are wrong, and we should do something about them. 
   I repeat, our current system is broken and it needs to be fixed. 
   I have spoken many times in this chamber, going back more than 12 years, about the need to reform the system. I have sponsored and cosponsored many bills for reforming the system, including variations of the McCain-Feingold bill. These bills have never even had a decent debate in this body, let alone passed. We have never been able to invoke cloture. 
   Those of us who represent our States and want to accomplish good and meaningful things, who want to make this country work better, have to work within the system the way it is, not the way we wish it were. 
   As the example shows that I just gave, that is difficult. I follow the law; someone comes to me and says: I want to give you some money. Do you have to disclose it? I say: No. The answer is accurate legally, but I later have to go to that person and say: Well, is it OK if I disclose this? 
   This is a bad system and it should be changed. 
   The criticism that has occurred as a result of campaign finance generally should cause us to do a better job. We at least should debate the issues, and ultimately change the law. Should we have campaign ceilings? Do you only spend so much money? Shouldn't we shorten the election cycle somewhat? Can't we do better than what we have? Can't we make it easier for people to register to vote? 
   I repeat, for the fourth time, the system is broken. It is up to us to save it before people are totally turned off by American politics. 
   I yield the floor and apologize to my friends for taking so much time.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Oregon, I think one of the things that is happening in Oregon is exemplary; that is, people can vote at home. That was an experiment in the Senator's election. We were all worried it would not work out right, but it worked out fine. But that is something we need to do: Make it easier for people to vote. 
   We have a Presidential election that is heating up now. But you know, people are talking about getting ready to run in the next election already. This is not good for the system. As the Senator has said, we have to do something to shorten the election cycle so people have more condensed elections. 
   There are many different ways to communicate now. We have all this cable, and we have to look for a better way of doing it, and making it so money is not the predominant factor in the political race.

Of course, there could be others offered, but we think we have been moving well on this legislation. I alert my colleagues, Senators BOXER, FEINSTEIN, SCHUMER, KENNEDY, DORGAN, GRAHAM, KERRY, HARKIN, and WELLSTONE, that they should be ready to offer their amendments in the approximate order I have read off their names, and we will try to alert their offices to give them adequate notice to get over here.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is interesting that on a bill pertaining to education, we are talking about how we can help 4 or 5 percent of the people in this country. First of all, I have nothing against people making $150,000 a year. I think that is wonderful, and I hope they make even more money. But the Hatch amendment will allow married couples earning between $150,000 and $190,000 to make full contributions to ESAs and will allow couples with incomes up to $220,000 to make partial contributions. 
   Under current law, the maximum income a married couple can earn for an ESA contribution is $150,000. The proponents of this amendment describe this amendment as a marriage penalty relief. Well, I guess from one perspective they are right. The ability of the single tax payer to make ESA contributions phases out between $95,000 and $110,000. For married couples filing jointly, the phaseout range is $150,000 to $165,000. 
   The Hatch amendment would make the phaseout range for married couples twice that of single individuals; that is, $190,000, twice $95,000, to $220,000, twice the $110,000 previously spoken of. 
   Accordingly, the only beneficiaries of this amendment are married couples filing joint returns earning more than $150,000 but less than $220,000 in a year. As I have said before, people making up to $220,000 a year can make partial contributions. 
   We have yet to obtain an estimate from the Joint Tax Committee. Notice, no one has talked about how much this is going to cost. It will cost plenty. We do know that families earning $150,000 in income are in the top 5 percent of all American families. For 1997, the top 5 percent was $137,080 and has likely increased since then. In other words, 95 or 96 percent of American families would not benefit from this amendment. 
   I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD tabular matter from the Department of Commerce setting this forth.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I have said, this is the time that we are debating public education, I hope. And we are talking about taking taxpayer money--that is what this is about--and giving tax relief to the top 4 or 5 percent of people in America. I am not too sure that is a proper allocation of income. 
   We have limited resources. We can talk about all the surpluses we want, but, as we know, when it comes time to allocating moneys in the appropriations process, there are very scarce dollars. There are very scarce dollars for public education. As has been established in this debate, the Federal Government contributes 2 percent of its resources to public education in America. The Governors were in town from all 50 States crying for more money for all kinds of things, especially education. Of course, we don't want to take the control of education away from the local schools, but local schools, as Senator MURRAY from Washington talked about yesterday, a former school board member, need to get some financial relief. We should be spending these limited resources not on trying to help somebody who makes up to $220,000 a year; we should be getting resources to these schools with tight budgets. We must focus on what we know works, what is going to help children in school more. Is it this tax relief to 4 or 5 percent of the American people or to do something about getting teachers who are better trained? We need to recruit and monitor high-quality teachers and principals. We need to do something about creating smaller classes. 
   With all due respect to the majority, they talk about smaller class size--the Senator from New Hampshire talked about that yesterday. Common sense dictates that if a teacher has 25 or 30 children as compared to 15 children, where is that teacher going to do the better job? Of course, it would be with 15 children. We need to have smaller classes and we need to work on having smaller schools because we know that works, too. We need to hold schools accountable for results. This takes resources that local school districts don't have. We need to ensure that children learn in modern, safe classrooms. 
   Some schools are badly in need of repair. It has been established in the debate we have had over the last few days that the average school in America is 42 years old. Well, I am sure those schools need some renovation and repair. We need to expand access to technology. We rush down--Democrats and Republicans--sponsoring and voting for a bill to give these big corporations tax credits for donating computers to schools. I think that is wonderful, but we should also be concerned about the many schools that aren't properly equipped to use these computers. They are not wired properly. They can't be wired properly a lot of times because the schools are simply too old. We need to spend money to ensure universal access to high-quality preschool programs and to make college affordable. 
   I hope we all understand what we are here talking about. We are talking about helping kids become better citizens of this country, and the best way is through education. I respectfully submit that helping people making up to $220,000, that is, 4 to 5 percent of the American people, is not the best way to expend our very limited resources.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator COVERDELL has offered an amendment that expresses the sense of the Senate that the Safe and Drug Free Schools Program should target the elimination of illegal drugs and violence in our schools. 
   Those on this side of the aisle agree with his sentiment and, accordingly, I expect this amendment will receive nearly unanimous support. 
   What we want to make clear, however, is that we do not agree with his one-sided attack in this resolution about the administration's gun prosecutions record. 
   What this amendment fails to recognize is that, in fact, firearms convictions are up dramatically. In 1996, 22 percent more criminals were incarcerated for either State or Federal weapons offenses than in 1992. I am sure we could go forward with the statistics--that we do not have--for 1997, 1998, and 1999 that would show it would be up even more. 
   The proof is in the pudding. The Nation's rate of violent crimes committed with guns has dropped by 35 percent since 1993. Something this administration is doing must be working. For instance, it could be the passage of the Brady bill, which has stopped more than 400,000 felons and fugitives from receiving firearms, preventing untold crimes and violence. 
   Finally, let's be serious. It will be a lot easier to prosecute gun crimes once we close the loopholes that riddle our code. So while Democrats support Senator COVERDELL's conclusion, we cannot and do not support these one-sided findings in the amendment. 
   Mrs. BOXER addressed the Chair.

People are up there talking to them, asking them to repeat votes. Could we ask that everyone sit in their seats as they are supposed to do and vote from their seats.

   Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Washington leaves the floor, I say to her and Members of the Senate how much I appreciate her leadership on this issue. She has been the voice speaking out on this issue time and time again. I think we in the Senate should listen to someone with experience. She served in the school boards we hear so much about. Why do we not do what the school boards want? That is what we are trying to do. We are doing that through the voice of someone who has served on a school board, who taught in preschool, who has been a voice on education. 
   On behalf of the people of the State of Nevada, I express my appreciation to Senator MURRAY for leading the Senate down this road of talking about the important matters that affect public education. That is what the debate should be: What can we do to provide a better education for the more than 90 percent of children in America today who go to public schools.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, Senator DODD has worked on this issue for many years. He will be here shortly. 
   I am very happy we are finally getting the opportunity to have a serious debate about some of the educational  problems we face in America today. It doesn't matter which of the 50 States you go to, there are problems dealing with education. I would be very happy if, rather than debating alternatives to public education, we started debating how to improve public education. More than 90 percent of the children in America go to public schools. We should be focused on how best to educate that 90-plus percent of children in America today. 
   The Federal Government provides 6 percent of the total education spending--roughly $38 billion. That $38 billion, by the way, is just 2 percent of the total Federal Government's budget. So we spend in America, the greatest nation in the world, the only superpower, 2 percent of our budget to educate our kids. Most Americans do not realize how little the Federal Government contributes to education. 
   I repeat that figure. The Federal Government spends about 2 percent of its budget on education. Within these tight budget constraints, we must focus on what works. I hope we will start talking about what works and about some of the things that maybe don't work as well and some new things we need to do in the area of education. I hope we can spend some time talking about and providing money for recruiting and training high-quality teachers, principals, and administrators. I hope we can spend some time talking about creating smaller classes and smaller learning communities in large schools. We have had experiences around the country from which we know that smaller schools work better than larger schools. 
   Deborah Meyer is an expert in this field. She was a school administrator in New York--a large school that is not doing well. She decided, because they were doing so poorly in all areas, that they had to do something radically different. She spoke to her superiors. They agreed to break the school up into four separate schools, with teachers who would report to separate administrators--four distinct schools. Within a very short period of time, all test scores skyrocketed. Everything about those schools improved. Having four schools instead of one school made it easier to teach the kids. The kids felt like they were part of the community. 
   We need to talk about how we can create smaller schools and smaller classes generally. 
   We all agree that we need to spend some time and provide resources so we can have schools, teachers and administrators more accountable. We have to ensure that children learn in modern, safe classrooms and repair schools in urgent need of renovation. 
   When I was growing up in Southern Nevada, the place we all looked to with great admiration was Boulder City, NV. It was the town that was formed as a result of Boulder Dam, now Hoover Dam. It was a wonderful community. In southern Nevada, it was one of the few places that had grass. It was a company town. They did not allow gambling. The only kind of alcohol that was allowed to be served was 3.2-percent beer. It was really a unique town in Nevada. 
   Kids did very well on all their tests. Their athletic teams were tremendous, even though it was a small school. 
   A while ago, I was asked to visit that school. They wanted to show me how that school had deteriorated physically--the plan, which had been the admiration of all Nevada, had gone downhill. The gymnasium was rundown. The track where the kids would participate in athletics was in very bad shape. In some places they did not even have hot water. They could not bring in computers because the wiring was so bad. 
   A lot of schools are that way. There have been some improvements made to Boulder City High School, but it is still an old, old facility. It is a perfect example of a school that needs renovation. You may ask why isn't it renovated. Well, the Clark County school district, which is the seventh or eighth largest school district in America, is growing very rapidly; it is the fastest growing school district in all of America, with approximately 220,000 kids. In 1 year, to try to meet the demands of the children of Clark County, they dedicated 18 new schools--in one school district. They have to build an elementary school every month to keep up with the growth in Clark County. They need to have the resources to be able to renovate schools. They have been too busy building new schools. 
   That is why it is important that we do something to help local school districts renovate and build new schools. Of course, we need to expand access to technology. One way of doing that is to have modern schools. We have to ensure universal access to high-quality preschool programs and make college more affordable. 
   I have talked about Nevada; there is probably no better State than Nevada to see the struggles with which our public schools in this country are dealing. Today, they are having a Governor's conference in Washington. Governors from around the United States are gathered here. In the Nevada papers today, they are reporting a conversation with Governor Guinn, newly elected from Nevada. He was formerly the superintendent of schools of Clark County when it was a relatively small school district. He is saying that one of the problems they are having in Nevada is the Federal Government is not helping enough, that they are running $75 million to $80 million short just in the Clark County school district every year in the ability to take care of special ed students. 
   Well, that is what this amendment is all about. This amendment would provide all or part of that $75 million for the Clark County school district, so the Federal Government would, in effect, meet the obligation that it has. When it came to be that, instead of having separate school districts, setting a different standard for children who are handicapped, the Federal Government set standards. Now all school districts have to meet the same standards. Prior to that time, different school districts would have different standards for handicapped children. The agreement, or reasoning, or idea was that it would cost about 40 cents for each dollar extra to educate a handicapped child. But the Federal Government hasn't met that obligation. Now it has even dropped in recent years. Instead of 40 cents, it is 6 cents. This amendment is an effort to raise that, to take money and provide it to the handicapped children--those in need of help, the special needs children. 
   Clark County, as I have indicated, is exploding in population. In just 10 years, Clark County school district enrollment has more than doubled. We can pick any school to show the growth, but let's take the school called Silverado, a high school in Las Vegas. The school now has about 3,800 students, which is 42, 45 percent over capacity. It is expected to grow. Next year, they think Silverado will have over 4,000 students in it. For children at Silverado, it is not only a difficult learning environment, but just to go to a restroom is a real problem. They have the same number of restrooms that they would have for 40 percent less children. This problem at 
   Silverado is true throughout the Clark County school district. I am sorry to report that it is this way around many parts of the country. We have the need for new schools in Clark County, some need renovations. Around many parts of the country, the need is as bad for renovating schools as for building new ones. 
   In Clark County, we are struggling to find qualified teachers. Last year, we had to hire almost 2,000 new schoolteachers in 1 year. That is a real job. Our university system can't produce nearly enough teachers to meet the demands--almost 2,000 new teachers in one school district. We need help in recruiting and training highly qualified teachers. 
   Nevada is a State--I am not happy to report--which has the highest dropout rate of any State in the country. But there is no State in the Union that should feel smug about dropout rates. In America today, 3,000 children drop out of school every day. These are children who are going to wind up being less than they could be. They certainly won't be as educated as they should be, or as productive economically as they should be; they won't be able to provide for a family the way they could. So high school dropouts is a problem. About 500,000 children drop out of school in America every year. We need to do something about that. That is a major problem that we need to address. I think and hope that this amendment would relate directly to that and provide school districts with money for  those with special needs so they can use their money for other things such as renovating schools, doing something as it relates to making sure they have high quality teachers. 
   If we can come up with something that would keep some of those children in school--I am sure there is nothing we can do to keep all 500,000 of them in school every year, but if we can reduce the number of dropouts by 100 a day, 200 a day, 500 a day, so at the end of the year, instead of having 500,000 students dropping out of school, we would have 400,000, or 300,000. The fact is that we have to do something about this problem. 
   The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, and I offered amendments in the past two Congresses. The year before last we offered an amendment that passed the Senate and was killed in the House last year, I am sorry to report, on a strictly partisan vote. Our amendment dealing with dropouts was defeated. It was strictly a party-line vote. 
   What would our amendment have done? It would have created, within the Department of Education, a dropout czar, someone whose job it would be to focus only on high school dropouts in this country. There are programs around the country that work quite well. Many of them are very small, but we need somebody to help each school district, to be available, not to force the will of the Federal Government on local school districts, but to be available with resources to see if they can do something to help kids stay in school. If the school district wanted help, they could come to the dropout czar in the Department of Education and get help. 
   I hope we can look at that during this debate to see what we can do to keep kids in school. As I said, the underlying amendment that we are debating now certainly would allow us to take some of that money now being used for special education and use it for programs such as high school dropouts. 
   The Federal Government has no intention of taking away the ability of local school districts to make their decisions, but what we need to be is a resource, to be a resource to help public education in America today. School districts all over America are begging for our help. They recognize there is not a movement in Washington to take over local school districts. 
   We have to recognize that schools should be controlled at the local level. Resources should be provided by the Federal Government, and, in my opinion, far more resources than 2 percent of the Federal budget. Why? Because we need to recognize that schools all over America are struggling. They are struggling because they cannot meet the high interest payments on the bonds they had to let to borrow money to build these schools. We recognize that around the country they are having trouble passing bond issues to provide for new schools and for renovating new schools. 
   We know there is a shortage of teachers. We have to do a better job of making sure teachers, who are educated at teachers colleges and other university systems around the country, are well qualified and meet certain minimum standards. We have to focus on this to make sure we have high-quality teachers and good administrators. 
   We have to recognize that smaller classes are important. We have to recognize on a Federal level we have a national problem across this country with school construction. We have to have a national program to help local school districts. 
   We have recognized for years that something has to be done about accountability. Goals 2000 is a step in that direction. We have to move on to that. 
   We have to make sure that children are allowed to go to school in safer schools--schools where the roofs don't leak. We have to make sure that children have access to computer equipment. That is a standard. When I was going to school, you had to have teeter-totters and swings. Now you need to have computers. Expanding activities in technology is vitally important. We have to make sure there is universal access to high-quality preschool programs. 
   I see on the floor today my friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, who more than any other person in America has made sure that we have a continuing dialog on preschool programs. Head Start programs and other programs are the brainchild of the Senator from Massachusetts. 
   We have to continue making sure we have high-quality preschool programs, which have been long established. The better preschool programs we have, the better students we have coming to school. 
   The way the family situation has developed, both parents are working. Because of the need they have, it is more important than ever that there be good, high-quality preschool programs. 
   The amendment now before us will allow that because it will free up money that simply isn't available to local school districts. I hope the amendment offered by Senator DODD will receive bipartisan support. The $1.2 billion set forth in this bill will be used to go directly to school districts. That is what this amendment does. Again, I hope it will receive bipartisan support.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, older Americans pay the highest prescription drug costs in the entire world. Because of the high cost and the lack of coverage, many of our seniors are being forced to make tough choices. In fact, one in eight seniors is forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine. Many seniors simply do not take drugs their doctors prescribe because they cannot afford them. Some seniors do not fill one or more of their prescriptions. Others divide their pills in half. Others, instead of taking half a pill a day, skip days and take them every other day. Some older Americans do not buy their own prescription medicine so they can buy the prescription medicine their spouse needs. 
   In a country that is blessed with the economy that we have, and some of the best medical researchers in the world, it is disgraceful that lifesaving drugs are not being made accessible to our seniors. Prescription drugs are a necessary component of modern medicine, and our seniors are dependent on them to maintain healthy lives. 
   It used to be, before Medicare came into being, that 4 out of every 10 seniors who were hospitalized had no health insurance. Now virtually all have health insurance. At the time we started Medicare, it was not necessary that we have a prescription drug benefit. Thirty-five years later, it is absolutely important. 
   I have in hand a couple of communications I have received from people from Nevada. Let me share with you what Michael Rose said:  
   I am aware that Medicare reform will be the congressional agenda this year and I would like to share my thoughts with you.  
   Skipping one paragraph and getting to the meat of this communication:  
   I cannot afford the 5 medications that I currently take if I have to get care elsewhere. Although I will be on the Medicare rolls as of January 2000, I will still not be able to afford my meds. As a manic-depressive, this means that I cannot afford sanity and I am scared beyond your wildest dreams about what will happen to me when the medications run out because I can't afford them. 
   Please vote in favor of including prescription drugs in any Medicare reform package that is considered by the Senate.   
   Mr. President, I repeat what he says: I will not be able to afford sanity. He takes pills to keep himself sane. 
   I have a communication from Gail Rattigan, who is a registered nurse. She lives in Henderson, NV.  
   Senator REID: I am a [registered nurse] who recently cared for an 82 year old woman who tried to commit suicide because she couldn't afford the medications her doctor had told her were necessary to prevent a stroke. It would be much more cost effective for the government to pay for medications that prevent these serious illnesses than expensive hospitalizations. These include but are not limited to blood pressure medications, anti-stroke anticoagulants, and cholesterol medications. The government's current policy of paying for medications only in the hospital is backward. Get into health promotion and disease promotion and save money. Please share this message with your republican colleagues. Thanks for your support. Sincerely, Gail Rattigan.  
   She is right. We need to move on and do something about giving senior citizens who are on Medicare prescription drug benefits. We need to do that at the earliest possible time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the New York Times reported last Wednesday that education stands out as the single most important issue nationally, and voters support action at the national level to improve the Nation's schools. I agree with the leader. It is important we talk about education. My own feeling, and I have mentioned this previously, is we should talk about all aspects of education. There are a lot of things that need to be done. 
   Overwhelmingly, the American people support a national role in education. I hope as we proceed down this legislative road dealing with education that we are allowed to go beyond what the Senator from Georgia, Mr. COVERDELL, has suggested. We need to go beyond this. That is why we are working so hard to get an agreement to go beyond this. 
   We have to make sure we talk about why kids are dropping out of school at the rate they are, why school construction is not taking place where it is needed, why we are not able to reduce class size. As this debate goes forward, let's make sure it covers all education, not just a little bit of education which we all agree needs to be looked at, but let's broaden our scope. 
   In light of the fact the Senator from Arizona has something scheduled, I will cut my remarks short.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my appreciation to my friend from Georgia for his courtesy. 
   First of all, in brief response to my friend from Arizona when he mentioned--I made a note here--political maneuvering by the minority to keep this bill from moving forward, the fact is we are not maneuvering anything. We are willing to go forward on this legislation and have it treated the same as all legislation has been treated for more than two centuries in the Senate--move forward on the legislation and allow amendments. But recognizing that the majority is not going to allow us to do that, we are trying to work out some kind of compromise so there will be the ability to offer some amendments. I am hopeful we can do that. Certainly I hope so. 
   I talk about the need for us to discuss education. We need to discuss education but not just a piece of education here and a piece of education there. We need to talk about education in general. 
   Overwhelmingly, as I mentioned earlier, the American people support a national role on education. The New York Times reported last Wednesday it is the most important issue facing the American people. When we talk about a national role, we are not talking about interference with decisions by local communities when it comes to schools. We are talking about giving them the resources--that is, school districts--to reduce class size, to strengthen the connection with parents, teachers, and students. We are talking about giving our children the best teachers in the world and programs to help schools attract and keep those teachers. We are talking about giving communities the resources to build new schools and to repair those crumbling schools that are all around us. 
   I believe in public education. I was educated in public schools. My father never graduated from the eighth grade. My mother never graduated from high school. But as a result of the public school system we have in America, I was able to achieve the American dream of getting a good education. 
   We should give all of our young people the tools to achieve their dreams. We can help them do this by modernizing our schools, raising our expectations and standards, and reducing class size. That is the right thing to do.  
   When we talk about political maneuvering, we are not maneuvering anything political. We simply want to go forward and treat the Senate as the Senate and not the House of Representatives. We should have been allowing amendments on this legislation last week. We would have been drawing this debate to a close today. But we are not doing that. Instead of that--because of the political maneuvering going on with the majority, not the minority--we are unable to move forward. I hope we can set aside partisan differences and move forward on this legislation. If we do so, the people who will benefit the most are the American people.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--I will not object--I am very happy that we have been able to arrive at a point where within the next few minutes we will be able to start debating education issues. 
   I extend my appreciation to the Senator from Georgia and to the majority leader for this agreement. I think it is something with which we can work. I look forward to a good debate in the next few days on education and education-related matters.

We hope to be able to do that, and with notification to the leader, we hope there can be some votes tomorrow morning, or at least when we finish our conferences. We expect to have at least one amendment offered today. That would take a little while in the morning but is something we think we can get our teeth into and work quickly.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before the roll is called, I would like to make a comment. 
   Representative James Garfield, who later became President of the United States, in trying to get a bill through Congress, said in a letter to an adviser:  
   When the shadow of the Presidential and Congressional election is lifted, we shall, I hope, be in a better temper to legislate.  
   I hope that we would all keep that in mind. We have congressional elections and we have a Presidential election upcoming. I hope we can work our way through to get to some of the issues we need to be talking about. I hope that the majority would allow us, if we are going to talk about education, to go to an education bill and offer amendments and work our way through the process. The fact that we are in the midst of Presidential primaries and congressional elections coming should not prevent us from going to the things we need to be doing. Education is certainly one of them. I hope we could do that in a full and fair debate on education.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, I say to the leader, we appreciated very much the minority having the opportunity yesterday to speak about education. We believe this is a time we should be talking about education; it is that important to the American people. But this is the first amendable vehicle we have had this session. I respectfully suggest to the majority, on behalf of the minority let's have the opportunity to have a vehicle we can amend. 
   We hope that very shortly the majority will understand we are trying to move education along. We have no great plan in mind to move off education into some other area. But we would like to do that. If the leader believes that cannot be done, we are willing to continue working to see if we can come up with some reasonable effort to move forward on this legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been able to consider every piece of legislation so far this year in this session of Congress under unanimous consent agreements. 
   This is the first amendable vehicle that Members have had to try to amend this year. There is no attempt by the minority to filibuster, to delay this bill in any manner. Members on our side simply want the bill considered in the regular order, open to amendment. 
   Like the majority leader, I had the good fortune of serving in the House of Representatives. I loved my job in the House of Representatives, but there we worked under different rules. We had a Rules Committee. Before any bill came to the House floor--in fact, the majority leader served on the Rules Committee--there had to be a rule on that bill as to how long the debate would take, how many amendments would be offered, and how long for each amendment. Those are not the rules that have governed the Senate for 200-plus years, and they should not be the rules that govern the Senate today. 
   We have clearly heard what the majority leader said today, that other things we may want to bring up will be scheduled at a later time. But we are not part of that scheduling process. There are issues we believe are necessary now in this country to be the subject of legislation. The only way we can do that is through the amendment process. We believe the minority should be entitled to offer 
   amendments of their choosing. There is no germaneness requirement, nor is there any necessity that there be a rules committee such as in the House of Representatives. Just because a Member's amendment may not be relevant does not mean it is not important and it is not something about which we should be able to talk. 
   I say to the majority leader, we object. I would hope he would reconsider and allow this matter to proceed in the regular order so amendments can be offered.

We are very anxious to move forward. We believe there is a lot to be done in education. We certainly want to do that, but we want to proceed under the regular rules of the Senate. That does not seem to be asking too much. We are not going to object to the waiver of the quorum and those kinds of things, but I will say, if we are not able to work something out before Tuesday at 2:30, I will recommend to all Democratic Senators, all the minority, that we vote against invoking cloture on this issue. That would be too bad.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to carry on a little bit regarding the colloquy we have had on the floor during the day about the need for us to proceed as the Senate has always worked in the 200-plus years of this Republic. I asked staff during this intermission time to pull for me at random a bill we worked on when we were in the majority. They chose a bill that doesn't have a really sexy title but which is very important; it is called the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentives Act. On that piece of legislation, there were 109 amendments filed. This bill was taken up on September 25, 1992. 
   We completed this bill 3 or 4 days later and it was passed. The Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act dealt with scholarship tax, dental schools, tractors--many things that really weren't relevant or germane to this particular piece of legislation. But we dealt with it. We allowed the minority to offer whatever amendments they wanted, and we proceeded with the legislation. That is what we need to do. That is what the Senate is all about. I hope everybody will understand we are not asking to break some new territory, new ground, or do something that was never done before. We simply want to say that once in a while we need a piece of legislation to which we can offer amendments. 
   Now, we are very happy to be discussing education. I believe it is the most important issue facing the country today, and my pet project on which I have worked for a number of years with the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, is high school dropouts. Three-thousand kids a day--500,000 children each year--drop out of school in America. 
   That is something we need to work on. That is only one aspect of education that is important. We know about school construction. We know about smaller class sizes. There are lots of things we need to do in education. There are other important things we need to work on. I think we should have a debate about Social Security. I think we have to do something right away about Medicare and the attachment of prescription drug benefits. Which is very important to our seniors. 
   In the 35 years since Medicare came into being, we now have people's lives being saved as a result of people being able to get prescription drugs. Senior citizens have an average of 18 different prescriptions filled during a period of a year. That is the average. Some have more than that. We need to do something about prescription drug benefits. 
   Certainly we need to do something to have reasonable gun control. All we are asking is that you are not able to buy weapons at gun shows without a background check. With pawnshops, the same should apply, as it applies every place else where you buy a gun in stores. 
   We think we should do something updating the minimum wage. We think there are so many issues that deserve our attention, notwithstanding the terrible health care delivery system we have in this country. Over 40 million people have no health insurance. Every year it is going up 1.5 million. 
   We need to pass a comprehensive Patients' Bill of Rights. The lucky people are those with insurance, but even they aren't being treated fairly. 
   Referring again to the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act, H.R. 11, in September of 1992, we spent less than 4 days on this piece of legislation. We dealt with 109 amendments and passed a bill. 
   If we had gone to work on this education bill on Monday, the bill would have been completed today. But the way things are happening, we are not working the will of the Senate, and we are not working the will of the people of this country. I think we need to do that as quickly as possible.

   Mr. REID. The answer is yes. They have the right to offer amendments. Sometimes they offer an amendment and debate it. 
   I see my friend, who I came to Congress with in 1982, from Florida, the senior Senator from Florida. I have been talking about this H.R. 11. On that particular piece of legislation, the Senator from Florida offered five amendments. 
   The Senator from Florida had some good reasons to offer every one of these amendments. For example, you would ask: Why did he offer an amendment dealing with tractors to the Enterprise Zone Tax Incentive Act? I don't know. I am sure he had a good reason for doing so. They had a right to offer the amendments, and they offered them.

   As I said earlier, I say to my friend from Minnesota, we need opportunities. It should be all the time, but I will settle for opportunities once in awhile to have a bill on which we can offer amendments. We might want to offer an amendment dealing with tractors. I should be able to do that.

   Mr. REID. We are very grateful that we have an opportunity to talk about education. There are many things that we need to talk about as it relates to education. Certainly, this is a step in the right direction. 
   I personally believe very strongly about the fact that in America we have 3,000 children dropping out of high school every day--3,000 children who are going to be less than they could be. I think we need to do something about that. 
   On a number of occasions we have attempted to move legislation forward that would help create a dropout czar in the Department of Education to adopt some of the educational programs that are working around the country. 
   We in Nevada are particularly concerned with the dropout rate. We have the dubious distinction of leading the Nation in the rate of high school dropouts. We really need to do something about that. This problem is making our country less productive. It is making the State of Nevada less productive. For this reason alone, I think it is important that we start talking about education. 
   I do say that on the education savings account issue--of which there will be some discussion today by the ranking member of the Education Labor Committee, who will talk in more detail about this--but as the Senator from Massachusetts knows, we could take all these programs, including education savings accounts, and lump them together, and very few people would be helped. We need something to help public education generally.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my first elected job was as a member of the board of trustees of then the largest hospital district in the State of Nevada, Southern Nevada Memorial Hospital. During the time I was on the board, we were gratified to see Medicare come into being because 40 percent of the senior citizens coming to our hospital had no insurance. People arrived at the hospital with their husband, their wife, their sons and daughters, and they had to sign papers agreeing to pay the bill. If patients did not pay the bill, a collection company pursued people to see that the bills were paid. We garnished wages and made sure the government institution received the money to which it was entitled. 
   Approximately 35 years later there are some problems, but of course it is a great medical program. Now instead of 40 percent of seniors having no health insurance when they come into a hospital, virtually all seniors have some type of health insurance when they come to the hospital. That is a result of Medicare. 
   In 1965, when I was a member of that hospital board, coverage was important to pay a hospital bill and to be able to see a doctor. What we did not cover and was not necessary when Congress passed the act was prescription drug coverage. Now we need prescription drug coverage. It is a tremendous lacking in the Medicare program. 
   We have had breakthroughs in the interim years in the pharmaceutical industry that are among the greatest advances in medical history. Today, prescription drugs alone have the power to reduce heart attacks by lowering cholesterol and blood pressure, using all kinds of drugs, including aspirin. Drugs such as Zocor, Mevacor, Inderal, Corgard, and Calan are great in lowering cholesterol and blood pressure. These are lifesaving. Drugs can minimize death from cancer. These include Taxol and Tamoxifen. They slow the progress of AIDS with AZT and other protease inhibitors. They treat depression and mood disorders with Prozac and Zoloft. Bacterial infections can be cleared up, including ear and bladder infections, with a string of antibiotics called Cephalosphorin. We can reduce the possibility of organ rejection. We could not have organ transplants until they came up with something called Cyclosporin. Now people can have kidney transplants almost routinely. Other transplants are becoming more common. 
   The Presiding Officer and I served in the House of Representatives with a Member of Congress who had a heart and lung transplant many years ago. He leads a very productive life. 
   That is because of the pharmaceutical industry. 
   For migraine headaches, I am sure, Mr. President, you have, as I have, had family members who benefited tremendously from something called Imitrix. People would go to doctors and use all kind of special pillows and heat and cold and all kinds of things, but what has worked well is this thing called Imitrix. It really, basically, takes away headaches. 
   For enlarged prostate, there is something called Proscar. To treat arthritis pain, one wonder drug is called Imuran; for allergies, Caritan, Allegra, and other things. Allergies take tremendous amounts of time away from the workplace. At certain times of the year they can be debilitating. 
   To slow the progression and control the symptoms of Parkinson's disease--we have a long way to go; about 50 percent of the people in rest homes are there because of Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's--but we have made some progress treating Parkinson's disease with drugs called Amatadine and Deprenyl. There are drugs to reduce muscle spasticity associated with multiple sclerosis. 
   There are things there we need to work on, but we are making progress. I had a hearing a number of years ago where a doctor said we are making great progress, and indeed progress has been made since then. 
   Mr. President, 75 percent of older Americans, 3 out of every 4 seniors,  lack decent, dependable private-sector coverage for prescription drugs, and at least 13 million Medicare beneficiaries have absolutely no prescription drug coverage at all. That is wrong. That is why the Medicare legislation, which passed in 1965, needs to be updated. 
   Many seniors, and especially senior women, struggle to meet the rising cost of filling their prescriptions. Why do I say women? Because, according to the Older Women's League, total prescription drug spending for women on Medicare averages about $1,200 a year, 20 percent more than that for men. In many cases, seniors simply do not take the drugs their doctors prescribe because they cannot afford them. 
   You do not have to be a doctor to understand this is bad medicine. Without access to important medication, seniors run the risk of developing complications that require expensive treatments and hospital stays. While some seniors enroll in Medicare managed care plans because they provide some drug coverage, we cannot depend on this option, and many of these plans are no longer around. The Medicare managed care plans have found they cannot afford them, so they are dropping seniors. This is an unstable source of coverage because many Medicare managed care plans have decreased their drug coverage. The number of beneficiaries enrolling in these Medicare plans is declining because the promises are not what they are supposed to be. 
   Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health costs for seniors. On average, seniors fill 18 prescriptions a year and take 4 to 6 prescription drugs a day. Because of the high cost and lack of coverage, one study shows that one in eight seniors is forced to choose between buying food and buying medicine. That is drastic. One in eight seniors is forced to choose between buying food or medicine. Every day this takes place in America. To make matters worse, studies show that seniors without drug coverage pay more for drugs than those who have insurance. 
   Prescription drugs are a necessary component of modern medicine, and our seniors are dependent on them to maintain a healthy, active lifestyle. This is something that has come about in the last 35 years. The special health needs of our seniors are often those that respond best to treatment by prescription drugs. For millions of seniors, prescription medicines are lifesavers. It is time to show our seniors we are serious about creating a Medicare prescription drug benefit, and I hope we can work together to do that as quickly as possible. We need Medicare to include prescription drugs.

   Mr. REID. Before the leader leaves the floor, I say it is important that we, on matters relating to foreign policy, do as much as we can on a bipartisan basis. I think moving this legislation along speaks well of that. I am confident that the legislation will be signed. 
   I also extend my congratulations to the Senator from Connecticut, who has worked on this for a long time, well more than a year. It is because of him, working with the full committee, that we have been able to move this measure along. 
   I also say to the leader, I think when the votes are counted in Iran, we should consider a resolution congratulating the people of Iran for what appears to be the moderate tone of the election results. I think that is very important. That is a positive sign, as it is a positive sign today that there appears to be developing in Russia a stable government. 
   I extend my appreciation to the leader for the manner in which this measure is moving along. On an issue such as this, we should not have acrimonious debate. We have been able to avoid that with the work that has been done behind the scenes. That is very important.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I said yesterday, when I practiced law, I represented car dealers, and there were times when they got cars in their inventory that simply were bad cars, lemons. There wasn't anything they could do to fix them. They would take them into the shop two, three, four times, and they turned out to be lemons. I represented a car dealer who sold a car to someone and he said, ``They have a car out in front of my place painted yellow that looks like a float; it is a lemon.'' He said, ``You have to settle this case.'' 
   That is what we have. This legislation is a lemon. Whatever the esteemed chairman of the full committee tries to do, he can't make an orange out of a lemon. This is bad legislation. The Senator from New Mexico is known in the Senate as being a very thoughtful man. He has tried very hard to get a piece of legislation that improves the process for Yucca Mountain. Now, this situation has been amply described by anybody who is willing to read this legislation as being a travesty. This legislation doesn't help anything. It is opposed by the environmental community, the President of the United States, the Director of the EPA, and the Department of Energy Secretary. This is bad legislation and it should be voted against. 
   Talking about the land in Nevada, nobody knows what that is. There are about 74 million acres in Nevada. They are talking about maps that don't exist. What the chairman has tried to do in this legislation is satisfy one group of people and, in the process, he eliminates others. 
   For the first time in the history of this legislation, the utilities are opposed to the States. The utilities wanted to get rid of this nuclear waste. Now they own it more than they ever owned it. They will be stuck with it forever if this legislation passes. 
   I think this legislation should be taken back to the drawing board to see if anything can be done to improve it. In the meantime, at Yucca Mountain the characterization is still taking place. I think we should let the 1987 act stand for what is going to take place at Yucca Mountain--not some cockamamie piece of legislation that is trying to give the nuclear industry a reward they don't deserve.

   Mr. REID. We have gone through two very big, complicated pieces of legislation: The bankruptcy bill, with over 300 amendments, and the nuclear waste bill, with the potential of well over 100 amendments. Those have gone through now. 
   I appreciate, commend, and applaud the leader for being a man of his word, as we knew he would be. I hope the Senator from 
   Oklahoma, recognizing how strongly he feels about the issue, would understand it is not only the State of Florida. In Nevada, we are four judges short. We do not want the bandits to take over the town. 
   We appreciate very much the majority leader's efforts to move these four. We hope the Senator from Oklahoma will understand the personal situations in States such as Nevada, where we are desperate for new judges.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the outline of today's activities by the acting leader. I would say, however, I think we had better understand that there is a unanimous consent agreement floating around now that is not even close, and so unless there is more work done in this regard, I think there will be a number of people on this side who simply will object to the proposal. But I am always open to suggestions, and I say to the acting leader that if the manager of the bill, Senator MURKOWSKI, has some ideas in this regard, we are certainly a phone call away.

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, one thing we have to do is get you to Nevada to hear how to pronounce some of those names. 
   In the early 1940s and 1950s, we had great football teams at the University of Nevada. They would bring in these football players from around the country, as was done in those days. Marion Motley was a great all-pro Hall of Fame football player. He came and signed up for school. He was going through registration. They asked him where he was from. He said Ely, NV; it is pronounced ``Elee,'' NV. That is how you pronounced the names. Beatty and Amargosa and Pahrump--we are going to have to give some lessons to you on how to pronounce the names. Just as if I went to Alaska, it would be hard for me to pronounce those names.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will be brief. I did want to respond to some of the things that were mentioned by the Senator from Alaska, the manager of this bill. 
   When I practiced law, I represented a number of automobile dealers. I remember one of the big problems we had is that once in awhile someone would buy a lemon. That is what they were called. Something just went wrong in the manufacture of that car, and whatever was done, it turned out bad; you just could not fix it. 
   I remember one dealer I represented. There was a man who was picketing his place of business. He had his car painted yellow, and he had it so it looked like a float that looked like a lemon. The dealer told me: You have to settle this case. You have to get rid of this case. 
   That is kind of how I feel about this legislation. This legislation is a big lemon. Whatever they do with it, it is still bad. It is just like those cars that are lemons. 
   Senator MURKOWSKI, the manager of this bill, I have no doubt, is doing his very best, and that is usually good enough. In this instance, he is dealing with a lemon and it is not good enough. Take, for example, the fact that everyone knows the 1987 act deleted the State of Washington and the State of Texas and began the characterization of Nevada, Yucca Mountain. That is going forward as we speak, the characterization of Yucca Mountain. S. 1287 was supposed to streamline the process. It would not do that. 
   For example, there is a provision in S. 1287 that the utilities badly wanted. What did that legislation call for? It said the utilities would no longer hold title to the nuclear waste but title would instead be transferred to the Department of Energy. That was the big purpose of S. 1287. That was the bill, S. 1287. The big part of it was what they call ``take title.'' 
   We were here yesterday at 5:55; 5 minutes before the deadline, amendments were filed, and take title is gone. S. 1287, the take title provision is out of this bill. It is like the proverbial lemon from which we try to protect automobile dealers. For the first time in the history of this legislation, we now have the utilities fighting the States. 
   The EPA provision that the managers of the bill worked so hard to try to get resolved has made it worse. The problem we have here with the EPA provision is that the manager, recognizing he would rather deal with a Republican President, has inserted a provision in this amendment that puts off the decision by the Environmental Protection Agency until the next administration. He is hoping, of course, that either President MCCAIN or President Bush will be elected. 
   The fact is, that is a crapshoot, I guess, but it should not be part of this legislation. All it does is further ``lemonize'' this legislation.'' The EPA is concerned about this. The President is concerned about it because it is attempting to make him a lame duck President, attempting to dissipate and do away with the rulemaking power of his agencies. Secretary Richardson is totally opposed to this legislation. As I said, Carol Browner is opposed to it. The League of Conservation Voters is opposed to it; most every other environmental organization is opposed to this bill. So we understand why the League of Conservation Voters--I am using them as just a representative because they speak for everyone, really--are concerned. 
   This legislation is placed ahead of the Patients' Bill of Rights, public schools, Social Security, prescription drug benefits, and all the other things we need to be talking about, including minimum wage and the juvenile justice bill. 
   The environmental community considers defeating this bill a major priority during this election year. In fact, I have a letter from Deb Callahan, who is head of the League of Conservation Voters, who has made it clear they may score S. 1287 as it poses ``unacceptable risks to public health and the environment.'' 
   The League of Conservation Voters is not some radical environmental group driving stakes in trees; it is a middle-of-the-road environmental group that speaks for the American public. They are decidedly and appropriately bipartisan. 
   It is interesting. I prepared these remarks long before the junior Senator from the State of Rhode Island started presiding, but just last year, the League of Conservation Voters honored Senator JOHN CHAFEE, a Republican, for his lifetime and stalwart support for environmental protection. Voting against this bill is about protecting the environment, not just in Nevada, but as the letter indicates, in the 43 States where S. 1287 will accelerate nuclear waste trafficking.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my friend from Alaska talked about conveyances of Federal public lands to Nevada. The Senator from Alaska has been very good working with Nevada which has 87 percent of its land owned by the Federal Government. We have worked very well with him. His committee has helped us get parcels of land put in the private sector, but in this instance, the State of Nevada has had no input. 
   There are about 20 maps on file at the DOE showing where these lands are located. The Governor of the State of Nevada knows nothing about this. Our public lands administrator in the State of Nevada knows nothing about this. I have not been provided copies of these maps, so I assume none of my colleagues have either. No hearings have been held to find out whether the land conveyances are good or bad. We want land in the private sector, but we do not want land conveyed that will have  a negative effect on the people of the State of Nevada. We need to review the proposed land conveyances. These are not small conveyances. This bill could convey land larger than the State of Connecticut from public lands to private lands in the State of Nevada. 
   This legislation is a big fat yellow lemon. In addition to that, although I usually like the looks of lemons, this is an ugly lemon, and the best thing we can do is vote against this legislation. It is bad legislation, and the amendment of my friend, the Senator from Alaska, is not going to improve it. It just further, as I say, ``lemonizes'' this legislation.

   While the Senator from New Mexico is here, I want to say I personally appreciate his hours of time, and the tens of hours his staff has spent--probably hundreds of hours--on this legislation. I am grateful to the Senator for the work he has put into this legislation and for the fairness he has demonstrated to the chairman of the committee and the Senators from Nevada. The fact that Senator BINGAMAN has done everything within his power to get satisfactory legislation passed should be spread throughout the RECORD. That does not mean the Senators from Nevada would be happy with it, perhaps, but I think he has tried to work on something that would bring a general consensus in this Senate and would satisfy the administration. 
   The Senator worked very hard to do that, and I commend and applaud his legislative abilities and constant fairness in this regard, keeping us informed, keeping the majority informed. I think it bodes well for the Senate to have the Senator as the ranking member and, hopefully, in the not-too-distant future, chairman of this very important committee.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, six years ago we passed a crime bill which, while controversial at the time, has led to an unprecedented decrease in criminal activity. It was a tough bill that was aimed at cracking down on illegal criminal activity. It gave law enforcement the tools it needed to prevent and crack down on criminal conduct. The legislation has been so effective that I believe it should be the model for future federal anti-crime initiatives. At the time, however, supporters of the Crime Bill were attacked for focusing on the root causes of criminal activity. Today, as evidenced by declining crime rates, we see that this was an effective approach. 
   I raise this issue today because I am concerned that some may be moving in the wrong direction in the worthwhile effort to crack down on illegal gambling on college sports. Recently introduced legislation attempts to crack down on dorm room and bar hall bookies by shutting down legal and highly-regulated sports book operations in Nevada. Mr. President, this is like closing the Bank of America to eliminate loan sharking. It simply does not solve the problem. 
   Mr. President, the collegiate gambling legislation recently introduced in the Senate is flawed because it incorrectly assumes that the elimination of legal sports book wagering in Nevada will mean the end of illegal wagering on college sports. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) is on record stating that there is an illegal bookie on every college campus. ``Sports Illustrated'' ran a series in 1995, stating that ``gambling is the dirty little secret on college campuses, where it's rampant and prospering,'' and that ``the bookies catering to most college gamblers are fellow students.'' Banning legal college sports gambling in Nevada, where it is controlled and heavily regulated, is not going to put these bookies out of business. Just as the Twenty-First Amendment did not stop the illegal consumption of alcohol, but rather, drove it underground, banning regulated, legal college sports wagering in Nevada is simply not going to end illegal college sports gambling. 
   Mr. President, illegal gambling on college sports is a very serious problem, and I commend my colleagues for their willingness to address this issue. The problem with gambling on collegiate sporting events, however, does not rest with what is legal, but rather, with what is illegal. While there are currently numerous state laws that prohibit gambling on college sports, illegal practices still occur and there is little, if anything, that is being done to address or understand the problem. A recent NCAA report noted that there are no comprehensive studies available that analyze the prevalence of illegal gambling on college sports. Furthermore, the report found that ``the issue of illegal gambling on college sports is still largely overlooked by college administrators.'' 
   Mr. President, to respond to this very serious problem, I rise today, along with Senators BAUCUS, TORRICELLI, and BRYAN, to introduce alternative legislation that would examine the root causes of illegal gambling on college sports. My legislation addresses several  key aspects of the problem of illegal gambling on collegiate sporting events, namely, what is being done by federal and state officials to enforce existing laws, whether law enforcement has the proper tools and adequate funding to address illegal gambling on college sports, and, what colleges and universities are doing to address the problem of illegal gambling, especially on their own campuses. The legislation I am introducing today would follow the recommendations of the NCAA report by directing the Justice Department to examine these issues and report back to the Congress. 
   Mr. President, the growing attraction of illegal gambling among our college youth is a serious national problem that requires a serious response. We must have a solution to this problem, however, that accurately addressed the source of illegal college sports gambling. The alternative legislation I am introducing today, which focuses on stronger enforcement of existing laws and education campaigns, follows the correct path toward addressing the root causes of this problem and finding the most effective and appropriate solution.

   I have been in conversation with the minority leader and the majority leader and they know that all of us--Senators MURKOWSKI, BINGAMAN, REID, and BRYAN--are trying to work something out so that we have a document from which we can all take a position. Again I repeat, until that is done, we are going to have to continue waiting until we can determine how to proceed on this issue. 
   I spoke with Senator MURKOWSKI on several occasions. He and his staff and that of Senator BINGAMAN, the chairman and ranking member of the committee, are coming up with a document that Senator BRYAN and I can review. We hope that is going to be within a matter of hours.

   Mr. REID. Before the Senator from Minnesota leaves the floor, I would like to have a brief colloquy with the Senator. 
   I say to my friend, I have watched very closely your public statement regarding law enforcement on Capitol Hill. I want to be as direct and forthright as I can be in underscoring the work you have done. I think I am the only U.S. Senator who has served as a Capitol policeman. I worked, when I went to law school, on the night shift and went to law school in the daytime. I think I have some familiarity with what the Capitol Police go through. 
   I have to acknowledge and admit the work they do today, compared to when I was a Capitol policeman more than 30 years ago, is much more dangerous, much more terrorist threatened. They face many more dangers than I have. I said on many occasions the most dangerous assignment I had was directing traffic. But the fact of the matter is, I carried a gun and was responsible for maintaining the safety and security of the U.S. Capitol. I am very proud of that. I still have my badge that I carried. I still have that in my office in the Hart Building. 
   The Senator from Minnesota has recognized that these men and women work in harm's way every day. What the Senator from Minnesota has stated is when we have these doors, and these men and women are there alone, it is dangerous. Two of our law enforcement officers were killed as a result of a terrorist act, the act of a madman. I think the people who maintain the Capitol Police should come to us. We are in an appropriations cycle. If they need more money, let them tell us they need more money. We are in a period of time where we need to get the real facts. 
   I say also to my friend from Minnesota, I am very concerned we have waited all these many years and we still do not have a visitors center.

   Mr. REID. We have taxpaying people who come to the U.S. Capitol and spend hours standing in the cold and the heat waiting to get in, without the opportunity to use a bathroom. There are no  parking facilities around here, so they have all had to walk or take public transportation for a long period of time. 
   I think it is below the dignity of the United States of America that people wanting to visit this beautiful Capitol do not have a place where they can come and have a soft drink, a cup of coffee, a doughnut, or go to the bathroom. That is also a law enforcement issue. One of the reasons these Capitol policemen who protect us and the American public are threatened every day is because we don't have a visitors center where people can be screened, away from these doors. 
   So I commend, I applaud the Senator from Minnesota for standing up for the American public and basically standing up for these people who have no voice, the Capitol Police who protect us.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, when I was a young man, I used to box. I fought in the ring. I can remember as a 20-year-old, I thought I was in pretty good shape. I weighed 160 pounds or thereabouts. I had trained for a fight near the place where they were building the Glen Canyon Dam, which forms Lake Powell. I was ready to go and had trained for this fight. I arrived there and was told the opponent was not going to fight, so I would not be able to fight that night. I was very disappointed. 
   A manager came out and said: We have somebody here who could fight you, but he has no experience. I know how badly you would like to fight, so if you agree to kind of take it easy on him, I will go ahead and let him fight. He is a little bigger than you are, but I am sure everything will be fine if you take it easy on him. 
   Mr. President, he worked me over really good. It was one of the worst beatings I ever took. It was the first time I had ever had broken ribs from a fight. 
   The reason I mention this story is, I have learned since then that if you are going to have a fight, you have to know the rules, you have to know whom you are fighting. Ever since then, I have never gotten into a fight unless I pretty well understood who the opponent was. 
   With the matter now before the Senate, I am having some difficulty finding out who the opponent is. We had been told there was going to be an amendment last Friday. We got an amendment last Friday, but it was not the one we thought it was going to be. 
   I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, whatever happens in the Senate these next few days on the matter that is now before the Senate, S. 1287, it is not the bill that directs nuclear waste to go to the State of Nevada. If nothing happens in this Chamber regarding S. 1287, as we speak, there is characterization taking place at Yucca Mountain to determine if, in fact, Yucca Mountain is suitable for a nuclear repository. At a time subsequent, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission will make a determination as to whether or not Yucca Mountain is suitable to be licensed. 
   It does not matter what we do today, tomorrow, the next day, or whenever we finish S. 1287. Characterization is still taking place; the decision on licensing the site is up to the NRC. 
   What is happening in S. 1287 is the same thing that has happened in the last 4 or 5 years with interim storage. The very powerful nuclear industry wants to short-circuit the system, wants to do an end run around the system, wants to speed up the disposal of nuclear waste. Good sense dictated, and the President of the United States said he would veto the interim storage bill. 
   As a result, interim storage is no longer an issue we are debating, for that I am very grateful. I appreciate the chairman of the full committee taking another approach. That approach is S. 1287. I say to everyone in the Senate and others within the sound of my voice that S. 1287, unfortunately, is still an attempt to short-circuit the system. It is not the mass outage that interim storage would have caused, but it is still a short-circuit. 
   What does this bill do? Originally, the main purpose was to take the Environmental Protection Agency out of the business of setting standards for radiation at Yucca Mountain. Again, the President issued a veto statement and said: If that is in there, I am going to veto this bill. 
   There have been conversations between the chairman and the ranking member that that is going to be taken out of the legislation and EPA will still be in the driver's seat. We were told just the other day one of the standards in it was, you could not take nuclear waste through Colorado. We understand that may be taken out of the bill. 
   The point I am making is this, we do not yet know what the vehicle is. We do not yet know whom we are going to be fighting. By the way, the man I fought in Kanab, Utah was named  Swaderski. I never forget that name. I do not know if this is a Swaderski or it is something else. Until the Senators from Nevada and the rest of the Senate have an idea of what is going to be the vehicle we are going to be debating, what the amendment is, we are at a real loss as to how we should proceed. 
   We have other problems with S. 1287, but the main problem is with the nuclear radiation standards we have talked about. 
   There are all kinds of things which at the right time we can talk about in some detail--about radiation protection, what the standard should be. What we have not talked about at all, and which we certainly need to talk about, is not only the radiation standard generally, but a radiation standard for children. 
   For example, I did a lot of work on lead abatement. Lead in the environment is dangerous to adults, but not as dangerous and it is disastrous to children. Little children's nervous systems cannot take lead. Most of the work we did with lead abatement was directed toward children. 
   As with lead, radiation more drastically affects children than it does adults, and this is something about which we will have the opportunity to speak at a subsequent time--the risk to children. 
   We are learning a lot about ground water protection as it relates to radiation. We know that ground water must be protected. There is such a shortage of it in Nevada and especially in the Yucca Mountain area. We want to make sure that ground water which we believe flows into the Amargosa aquifer is something that is not going to be damaged. 
   We know during the last 3 years we have had a significant number of very serious earthquakes at Yucca Mountain. We can talk about this in some detail, but it is something that goes to the ultimate licensing of this repository. 
   The cost of the program is in the billions of dollars. We were told originally it would cost $200 million to do the characterization for three sites, a total of $600 million. For just Yucca Mountain alone, we are now over $7 billion for the characterization. There has been a loss of confidence. We have various organizations that are concerned. 
   I have heard people come to the Senate floor and talk about, how they are taking care of nuclear waste in Europe. That is really not quite true. 
   They are having all kinds of difficulty transporting the nuclear waste. Of course, those are very small countries. Here in the United States, we are talking about transporting nuclear waste not hundreds of miles, as they have had difficulty doing in the European countries, but transporting waste for thousands and thousands of miles. That is something we need to talk about. We need to discuss the loss of public confidence in how we handle nuclear waste. Of course, transportation, as I have just mentioned, is a very serious problem. 
   Senator BRYAN and I have had the good fortune of being able to travel to St. Louis, Denver, and a number of other places. But to take those two places alone, we met with the city council in both of those entities, and they immediately passed resolutions saying they did not want nuclear waste in their cities and counties. If people know how dangerous it is to transport nuclear waste, they, of course, do not want it. 
   Nuclear waste has to be transported either by truck or by train. In years past, we have talked on this floor in great detail about how dangerous the transportation of anything is but especially something that is the most poisonous substance known to man--plutonium. 
   Terrorist threat: We have recognized there is a terrorist threat with respect to transporting nuclear waste. The sad part about it is, this is something that does not seem to concern some people. They simply want to have a repository and will worry about how to transport it at a later time. 
   We have a lot to talk about in relation to this legislation. But until we get a bill, until we know who we are fighting, and not only who we are fighting but the whole context of the fight, we are not in a position to work in detail to improve this legislation. 
   There will be amendments filed by the deadline tonight by some. I think the Senators from Nevada, based on the situation now before us, are not going to file amendments because this legislation is such that we do not know what amendments should be offered based upon the RECORD, which is now before us. 
   Cloture has been filed on the underlying bill, S. 1287. At a subsequent time, we are going to have to take a look at that to determine whether or not we are going to ask our colleagues to support us in relation to the cloture motion, whether or not we should be for or against that. 
   I hope there can be a distribution of the proposed amendment at a rapid time so our staffs can have an opportunity to look at it. At this stage, there is an amendment out there somewhere, but it has not been given to our offices. We are having difficulty understanding what the amendment is. It is a moving target, to say the least. It keeps changing. Until that is defined, I think we are going to have a great deal of difficulty talking to the White House as to whether or not this legislation is in keeping with fairness, equity; whether the rulemaking power of this administration is being jeopardized. 
   We do know one of the provisions in the bill is to make sure this decision made by the EPA is not going to be made until the next Presidential election, for obvious reasons; that is, the proponents of this bill are hoping that a Republican will be elected because Vice President GORE has been a stalwart on this, recognizing the environmental dangers of what has been attempted by those people who want to jam nuclear waste not only down the throat of Nevada but expose all the people along the transportation routes to Nevada. 
   So, again, at such time as we get this legislation, I will come back and revisit the legislation. At this time, I have no legislation to visit and will have to wait until a subsequent time to make that determination as to how the legislation affects the State of Nevada and the country. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the statement of the Senator from Iowa where he tried to indicate that the Vice President was coming here because of some problem in the campaign. I direct the attention of the Senator from Iowa to what really took place in New Hampshire last night. As every political pundit in America has stated, Democrat and Republican, those who are neutral, Bush was bushwhacked in New Hampshire. That is the real problem. I appreciate the Senator's attempt to divert attention from the fact that there really was a problem in New Hampshire for Governor Bush. 
   In the year 1215, in a meadow in England, a group of barons were with King John. King John couldn't sign his name, but he did affix his cross, his X, to a document that we now call the Magna Carta. The reason that was so important in our history is because it was the beginning of common law. It was the beginning of the rule of law that we adopted when we became a nation. We followed the English common law which started with Runnymeade and the Magna Carta. It established the rule of law, not a rule of kings, not a rule of demagogues, not a rule of zealots but a rule where we follow the law. 
   That is what this debate is about today. There are a group of people in America today who recognize there is a law, but they are above it. They don't have to follow it. They can go and use butyric acid, fire, bullets, guns, causing murder, disruption of businesses. 
   They can, of course, cause all these blockades, and people who disagree have said what you are doing is wrong. You are avoiding the law, and we are going to take you to court and have a court of law determine that you are wrong, and you are going to have to respond in money damages for the violence and the disruption in business and the damage that you have caused. They have gone to court and they have won those lawsuits. They have had money judgments rendered against them. These people who caused this disruption of business, who threw this acid in people's faces in clinics, who set fires, who murdered people, they say we are above the law; we don't have to follow it because we disagree with the law. 
   We are a country that has a rule of law. These people should not be able to discharge these debts in bankruptcy. That is what this amendment is all about. 
   We recognize that violence and terror are worsening every day in this world, and we have to stop it. This is one method of stopping it. One of the reasons these people flout the law is they say don't have to follow the law. 
   Mr. President, these people intimidate. They recognize that they do not have to be held accountable. Today, what we are saying is we must act to ensure that we live in a law-abiding society. This amendment does that by saying that those who have a judgment rendered against them in a court of law, where the court has determined that they engaged in unlawful acts of intimidation and violence, can't escape responsibility for their actions in bankruptcy court. 
   I believe in our system of justice, where courts and juries make decisions that we as the American public must follow. Some people don't believe in our system of justice; they don't believe in our system of trial by jury and court determinations. They believe money damages awarded against them mean nothing because they are going to discharge them in bankruptcy. In effect, they believe the law is for everybody else but them. We think that is wrong and that is why we should have an overwhelming vote in the Senate. The Vice President, even though he is going to be here, should not have to break a tie. People of good conscience on both sides of the aisle should vote in favor of this amendment. It is the right thing to do because it upholds the rule of law.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are experiencing the longest economic expansion in the history of this country. As of the end of January, we underwent 107 consecutive months of economic growth. Much of this can be attributed to the economic policies of Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
   In the midst of this unprecedented prosperity, it's easy to say, let's not change anything. Let's not rock the boat. Things are great, why rain on the parade? Why even ask tough questions that might upset the delicate and fine-tuned mechanism of the economy? 
   But I think that we have to ask those questions. 
   Today the Senate is considering the President's nomination of Mr. Greenspan to his fourth consecutive four-year term as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors. In my opinion, if we are to confirm him to serve in that post again, we should not do so simply to reward him for the good that he has accomplished over the last few years--we should only do so because we think that he is the best person for the job for the next four years. 
   In making that decision, we have to take a hard look at everything that has happened under Chairman Greenspan's watch--the bad as well as the good. 
   We are considering him not only for his views on the economy, but for his ability as a manager, as the head of the largest, most powerful institutions in the world. 
   Viewing his record as a whole, Mr. President, I am not convinced that Chairman Greenspan is the best man to guide the Fed for the next four years. I intend to vote against his confirmation. 
   Let me make this clear: I rise today not to criticize Alan Greenspan as a person, or to criticize his economic policies. Chairman Greenspan is a fine man, who has worked hard for this Nation. The results of Chairman Greenspan's monetary policies over the last 10 years speak for themselves, in rather eloquent terms. 
   The Federal Reserve is one of the most powerful institutions in the world. It makes decisions that fundamentally change our economy, and the world economy. 
   It is also, as columnist Jack Anderson wrote, a secret government of unaccountable, unelected bankers and bureaucrats that has long resisted Congressional oversight, and that is completely exempt from the Congressional budgeting process. 
   For the past six years, Senator DORGAN and I have worked to try to achieve greater accountability over the Federal Reserve. Last year, we added an amendment to the Financial Services Modernization Bill that would have required a consolidated yearly audit covering the operations of each Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Federal Reserve System. 
   Our amendment was all about accountability in the day-to-day operations of the Fed. It did not seek to interfere with monetary policy. That is an area that should be kept separate, for good reason. Our amendment sought to open the doors of a taxpayer-financed institution which has been closed to Congressional oversight or review for more than 80 years. 
   Unfortunately, our amendment was stripped down in conference. That happened in part because the Federal Reserve strongly opposed any kind of audit or oversight. 
   In 1993, Senator DORGAN and I asked the GAO conduct a review of the Fed's operation and practices. The review found a number of disturbing revelations about the way the Federal Reserve does its business, including evidence of serious mismanagement at the highest levels. 
   Significantly, many of the incidents of waste and mismanagement have increased since 1988, the year Mr. Greenspan first became Chairman.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been interested in watching both the Democratic and Republican battles in New Hampshire for the nomination of the respective parties. I was not able to watch personally, but I understand that yesterday Mr. MCCAIN, the senior Senator from Arizona, was interviewed on one of the national shows and talked about campaign finance reform and, in effect, the difficult sledding it has been for him, a Republican, to move forward on this issue. 
   Based on what the Supreme Court did just last week, I think it is significant to keep our eye on the prize, and that is to recognize that the Supreme Court has now given us the latitude and leeway to be able to do something about campaign finance reform. Senator MCCAIN is to be congratulated for being so responsive to what I think the American public is asking from us. That is to do something about lessening the need for the huge amounts of money in Federal elections. 
   Senator MCCAIN has been very lonely out there, for being a member of the majority. He has not had a lot of support. I think it has taken a lot of courage for him to move forward with campaign finance reform. I believe if we start talking about the issue, as I have heard Governor Bush say: Well, I can't support campaign finance reform because it will simply help the Democrats----Mr. 
   President, it would help the American public if people took a more realistic view regarding this vital legislation. Let's move forward with legislation that will take the demand for money out of the mix. 
   I have said it on this floor before, but I think it is worth repeating. In the small State of Nevada, with less than 2 million people, $23 million was spent in my last reelection. No one outspent the other. My opponent spent the same amount of money I did--a little over $4 million, for the individual campaigns. We each spent, through the various parties, money on our behalf, basically, $6 million each. That is $20 million. Plus, we don't know, but I have estimated there was another $3 million on independent expenditures. 
   That is out of line. It is obnoxious, it is obscene, it is too much money. We have to arrive at a point where we have to take this soft money mix out of campaigns. We may not be able to do everything included in the McCain-Feingold bill that we need to do, but let's work toward a compromise that at least takes corporate money out of campaigns. 
   Earlier in this century, the decision was made by Congress that corporate money should not be allowed in Federal elections. Over the years, that has worked fine. But in a ruling the Supreme Court said, well, you still can't use corporate money on individual campaigns, but State parties can use it basically any way they want. As a result of that, there has been this tremendous rush by both parties for corporate money, and they spend it on behalf of individual candidates. I think that is wrong. We should reverse that statutorily. As I reviewed the Supreme Court decision, it was clear that, in fact, was the case. Justice Souter did a very good job in writing that opinion. It is clear and concise. I think we should move forward and have campaign finance reform. 
   Mr. President, beginning this congressional session, the last year of this Congress, it is important that we reflect on where we are and where we need to go. It seems pretty clear we have made great progress in getting the country's fiscal house in order. Just 7 years ago, when President Clinton came into office, the yearly budget deficit was more than $300 billion, especially if you add in the Social Security surplus, which was being used for years to mask the annual deficit. Instead of having these $300 billion-plus deficits every year, we will now, for the second year in a row, have a surplus. 
   It is difficult for those of us who have served in this body for a few years to understand that we are now talking about what we should do with our surplus. During this period of time, we have created over 20 million new jobs. The vast majority of the jobs are high-wage jobs, good jobs. We have low unemployment, low inflation, strong economic growth, and lower Government spending. We have cut the payroll of the Federal Government by over 300,000 individuals, excluding the cuts that have been made within the military. 
   We are doing a much better job. We are at 18.7-percent Federal Government spending as a share of gross domestic product, and that is the lowest since 1974. That is real progress. Real hourly wages are up. We also have strong private sector growth, and as I have indicated, low inflation. The underlying core rate of inflation is at its lowest since 1965. In the last four quarters, the GDP price index has risen only 1.3 percent, which is the lowest rate of increase since 1963. 
   We are talking about decades and decades of improvement. We have reduced welfare rolls. Both parties worked together to bring about less welfare. That is important. Not only are we seeing people move off the welfare rolls, we are putting people to work. We have high-home ownership. We have jobs in the auto industry. People said a few years ago that the American automobile industry was dead and that we should forget about again being somebody who produces most of the cars in the world. That was reversed because 
   of good decisions by management and tremendous production by labor. 
   Since 1993, we have added almost 200,000 new auto jobs. The annual rate of adding auto jobs is the fastest we have ever had. I think we are doing very well. 
   Regarding the construction industry, all we have to do is look at the State of Nevada which leads the Nation, and has for 14 years, as the fastest growing State in the Union. We have cranes--some use the old term that it is the ``national bird''--all over the State of Nevada, with construction going on. But Nevada is not the only place; this country is in a period of phenomenal economic growth. There are still sectors that need improvement, but we have done fine. We are looking now to improving people's lives. We are now looking into issues that we never have before. 
   I am sure that you, just as the Senator from Nevada, find all this Internet stuff kind of new. It is something we didn't have when we were growing up, and it has taken some training and some real education to become somewhat computer literate. It is so easy to become computer literate. You can order anything you want off the Internet. You can order CDs, water, and many other items. 
   The other Saturday morning, I turned on my computer to find out what the news was in Nevada. They have a little teaser there almost every time you turn on the computer about different services rendered. One of the things on my computer said, ``Do you want to sell your house?'' My wife and I, with our children being raised now, are considering moving from our home where the kids were raised to a smaller place. And so I clicked on that little thing on my computer, and within 5 minutes, on my screen in McLean, VA, where we have our home locally, I found places where homes were sold in the last 2 years and for how much they were sold. 
   There is so much on the computer that it is difficult for me to comprehend. That brings about another problem, and that is our privacy. Is our privacy being protected with all the things happening on the Internet? Some say yes, some say they are not too sure, and some say no. This is something at which we as a Congress need to take a look. We need extensive hearings to determine how safe information is on the Internet. 
   Are our medical records being protected? If your wife, your father, your brother, your sister goes to the hospital, are their records being protected? Is your privacy being protected? Is your credit card protected on the Internet? Are, in fact, these people who are getting information on the net selling this information to other people? These are questions raised in this new, modern society in which we live and at which Congress must take a look. We didn't have to look at those things just a short time ago. 
   In addition to recognizing that our economy is in great shape, we have things on which we have to work. We have to realize we have new challenges ahead of us. Privacy is one of them. 
   I talked about campaign finance reform. That is so important to us. We need to take a look at that. But also we have to take a look at what is happening to the health care delivery system in our country. Every year, over a  million people become uninsured. We have now well over 40 million people who have no health insurance. That is not something that we can say is someone else's problem. It is our problem, just as it is someone else's problem. 
   Why do I say that? Because when a person who has no health insurance is in an automobile accident, they go to the emergency room--that is the most expensive care that can be rendered. As a result of this, the fact that people who have no health insurance are taking care of that way causes my premiums to go up and yours. It causes higher taxes to be charged for health care, and it, of course, causes hospital and doctor bills to be increased more than they should to take care of those people who have no health insurance. 
   We must do something about inadequate health care. The fact is that in America, the most powerful nation in the world, we have over 40 million people today with no health insurance. We could add in all of the little things people have talked about such as medical savings accounts and all other such things. If we added all of those and accepted them--some would say no, that is not good, and some of us disagree about the way to go. But let's say we did. We would then take care of only about 3.5 million people, still leaving almost 40 million people with no health insurance. We have to be real and stop talking about these little gimmicks and start talking about the fact that health care is something of which too many people do not have the benefit. Those people who do not have health insurance are being jerked around. 
   The fact is that we have tried to pass a Patients' Bill of Rights giving people the ability to have health insurance and not to be taken advantage of by big-interest companies and HMOs. That is why we have worked very hard to have a real Patients' Bill of Rights passed, one where people can go to a specialist when they want to; to a health care plan that allows a woman to be taken care of by a gynecologist when she believes it is necessary; a provision so that when somebody does something negligent and wrong, they can be sued. People don't like lawyers unless they need one themselves. With health care, there are times when people do things that are wrong. Individuals need the right to go to court to redress wrongs. 
   We have a lot to do in this Congress. We don't need to come here and boast about how well we are doing with the economy. We need to do something about the campaign finance problems we have in this country, about our health care delivery system. 
   It is clear, with all that is going on in our country today, that we need to look at how guns are handled. I have said on this floor before and I say again that I was, in effect, raised with guns. As a 12-year-old boy, I was given a 12-gauge shotgun for my birthday. I still have that gun. My parents ordered it out of the Sears & Roebuck catalog. I learned how to handle weapons as a young boy. We would hunt and do the other things you do with guns. I have been a police officer. I personally have a number of firearms in Nevada. 
   I have no problem with the fact that if I want to purchase a handgun, I tell people who I am and they can make a determination by checking my identification and whether or not I am a felon or in fact mentally unstable. That is what the Brady bill is all about. Hundreds of thousands of people are granted weapons as a result of that. I am willing to be checked each time I purchase a gun. I don't think that is unreasonable. But there are those who are trying to avoid that by going to pawnshops and purchasing pistols, and, as a result of that, checks aren't made--or they are going to gun shows. We need to close those loopholes. Here on this floor last year, we did that. That was done by virtue of Vice President GORE breaking the tie vote. But the problem is, we haven't gone to conference. We need to take that loophole out of the law. The American public believe that is appropriate. We should at least do that. That is the minimum we can do with guns. 
   My knowledge about weapons is, I think, average or above, and I don't need an assault weapon to go hunting or to protect my family. These assault weapons need some restrictions placed on them. I am a believer in the second amendment. Nothing that 
   I have talked about today deprives anyone of their second amendment rights. 
   In this Congress, I hope we can work in a bipartisan fashion to solve some of these problems that everyone recognizes: Campaign finance reform, health care, problems with guns in our society, and other things on which we need to work together to come up with bipartisan solutions to the problems that face this country. 
   One of the things we worked very hard on last year as a minority--we hope the majority will join with us this year--was to do something about raising the minimum wage. Why is it important that we raise the minimum wage? That is all the money some people get to support their family. In fact, 60 percent of the people who draw minimum wage are women, and for 40 percent of those women who draw minimum wage, that is the only money they get for themselves and their families. It is important that we increase the minimum wage. The minimum wage is something more than a bunch of kids at McDonald's flipping hamburgers; it is for people who need to support their families. 
   Speaking for the minority, we reach out our hands to the majority. We want to work with the majority to pass meaningful legislation. But I also say we want to approach legislation in the way it has been traditionally handled in this body: For example, the bankruptcy bill, which at 2 o'clock this afternoon will be brought up and we will move forward. We have worked very hard in spite of the fact that there are in the minority some people who support the underlying legislation and some who don't support the legislation. But we have worked to move this legislation forward to have the battles here on the Senate floor. That is why we were disappointed at the end of the last session when the majority leader filed cloture on this legislation when there were only a few amendments left that would take up any time at all. As a result of that, some of us joined together during the break and said: We are not going to let this legislation move forward, we are going to have 45 Democrats voting against cloture, until we have the opportunity to debate these measures which we believe are important. 
   What were the two things holding it up? One was legislation that said do not do violence to a clinic that gives advice on birth control measures and gives counsel to people as to whether or not they should terminate a pregnancy. This is something that is enforced by the laws in this country. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that these kinds of clinics are legal. Whether or not you agree or disagree with abortion is not the issue. A person has no right to throw acid in these facilities and do everything they can to stop the business from going forward. There have been lawsuits filed against people who do this. This amendment says if you do that, you can't discharge that debt in bankruptcy. That is what this amendment is all about. 
   We are going to have an opportunity to vote on this in the next few days. That is the way it should be. 
   The other amendment that was holding things up and caused cloture to be filed was an amendment by the Senator from Michigan that says if you manufacture guns and there is a lawsuit filed against you because of something you did which was wrong, you can't discharge that debt in bankruptcy. I am paraphrasing the amendment. Senator LEVIN will explain it in more detail. 
   But we have said, no matter how you feel on the gun issue and abortion, these are issues that have nothing to do directly with these issues; this issue deals with bankruptcy. As a result of that, the minority held firm. 
   I applaud the majority leader. He withdrew the motion for cloture. We are going to debate this and complete this legislation in the next couple of days. We are willing to work with the majority if we go through the normal legislative process allowing us to bring up our amendment. We worked hard to try to reduce the number of amendments. Some amendments are difficult. Some amendments we don't want to vote on, but that is what we are elected to do--vote on tough issues. We can't avoid those tough votes by filing cloture and knocking all of these amendments out. 
   Again, on behalf of the minority, we look forward to a productive session  and we will do everything we can to make sure we not only keep the economy moving but also handle some of the more difficult issues that face us in this society. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I say to my friend, the majority leader, that on the surface it does appear that something needs to be done with nuclear waste. If you get under the surface, of course, there should be something done. 
   I am not going to give a long dissertation now on nuclear waste. We have had that in the past. But the fact of the matter is, really what should happen is, it should stay where it is. That is what the scientists say. It could be safely stored on site in dry cast storage containment, as is done in Calvert Cliffs, MD, for the next 100 years. 
   The nuclear power industry, which has created this fiasco, wants someone else to clean up their mess. They want it out of their hands. They want their hands washed of it. 
   The fact of the matter is, we are looking at this 
   legislation. Senator MURKOWSKI is trying to come up with some alternative. I have been told by the minority on the Energy Committee that if that is the case, he is going to try to change the legislation that is now before this body. That is, the legislation now before this body would take the Environmental Protection Agency out of the mix; that is, the Environmental Protection Agency would not be setting the standards for Yucca Mountain, but it would be given to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which, in fact, is the one that does licensing. That really is literally having the fox guard the hen house. 
   In this legislation, we simply want things to remain the way they are--have the Environmental Protection Agency set the standards. But we understand there is a lot of agitation by the very powerful nuclear power industry, that wants to move this forward in spite of the fact that it could damage  the country. We understand that. We hope good sense will prevail because the President has said he will veto this legislation. I think that is the reason Senator MURKOWSKI, the chairman of the committee, wants to come up with something that is going to be such that it will not create a fight here on the floor. 
   As the majority leader knows, we have enough votes to sustain a Presidential veto. We hope we will not get to the point where that is necessary. 
   Will the leader again state what the request is?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, about a year ago, I was still celebrating my victory from the election of 1998. It was a tough election. The reason I mention that today is because in the small State of Nevada, with less than 2 million people, the two candidates running for the Senate spent over $20 million. We had less than 500,000 people who voted in that election but we spent over $20 million. We spent approximately $4 million in our campaign accounts, and then each party spent about $6 million. So it was a total of $20 million, plus an undisclosed amount of money that was spent by people who represented the National Rifle Association, the truckers' association, and other groups. These independent expenditures on both sides were something that added to the cost of that election in Nevada. 
   The reason I mention this is when I first came to the Senate, I had an election I thought cost too much money. It cost about $3 million. In this election I spent over $10 million--that is, counting the money spent mostly on my behalf and on behalf of the others in that election cycle. 
   Something has to be done to stop the amount of money being spent on these elections. We know that on the Presidential level, Senator MCCAIN, who is running for the Republican nomination for the Presidency, is spending a lot of his time talking about the need for campaign finance reform. I admire and appreciate the work of Senator MCCAIN in this regard. On the Democratic side, both Senators Bradley and Vice President GORE are talking about the need for campaign finance reform. Those who support campaign finance reform got a real boost, a real shot in the arm, in the last few days when the U.S. Supreme Court, in a case that came out of Missouri, rendered a 6-3 opinion. In effect, that opinion said in the case of Shrink v. Missouri Government that the Court had a right to set maximums as to how much somebody could spend. The Court held that the Missouri law imposing a little over a $1,000 limit on contributions to State candidates did comply with the Constitution, despite a challenge claimed that the limit was so low it affected the ability of interested people to give to the candidate of his choice. 
   The reason this case was so important is that everybody has been waiting for almost 25 years to determine what the Court would do about Buckley v. Valeo, were the Court held that political contributions are speech protected by the first amendment. Though certain limits could be enforced, the Government could not put too many restrictions on when and what a person could spend on political candidates. Some hoped and wished the Shrink case, cited by the Supreme Court, would throw out all the limitations and, in effect, there would be a free-for-all as to how much money could be raised, and there would be no restrictions as to from where the money would come. The Shrink case, while it didn't cite all the problems with campaign finance money, decided there could be limits established in campaign finance spending. That is an important step. 
   I think what we need is to have elections that are shorter in time. We have to have limitations on how much people can spend on elections. We can't do anything in light of the present law with having individuals spend unlimited amounts of money until we pass a constitutional amendment, which has been pushed by Senator FRITZ HOLLINGS for many years. In spite of our being unable to stop people from spending personal moneys of unlimited amounts, the Court clearly said limits  can be set. I think this should add impetus to the Presidential campaign now underway. What Senator MCCAIN is saying is that we should go with the Feingold-McCain bill that is going to stop the flow of soft money, corporate money, in campaigns. That seems to be something that certainly can be done. We know in the past it has been done in Federal elections, and this should be reestablished. 
   So I hope Senator MCCAIN, Bill Bradley, and Vice President 
   GORE will continue talking about this. I hope it becomes an issue in the Presidential campaign, which will be shortly upon us. 
   I do appreciate the Supreme Court. There are some who come here and berate them very often. I think it is time we throw them a bouquet. This was a tough opinion, decided by a 6-3 margin. I think this is important. Justice Stevens noted:  
   Money is not speech, it is property. Every American is entitled to speak, but not every American has the same amount of property.  
   That is something I hope will be carried over into future discussions by the Supreme Court in reviewing Buckley v. Valeo, as to what it means regarding whether or not free speech is the ability to spend as much money as you want in a campaign. I don't think it is. I think the Supreme Court will agree with me. 
   In short, the Supreme Court did the right thing. It should give us, as a body, the ability to change the law and revisit some of the things taking place in America today. What Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN have tried to do is the right approach. We should do that. All the arguments made about how it would be unconstitutional to do that certainly fail in light of what the Supreme Court recently decided.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, prior to coming here I was a trial lawyer. I started out representing insurance companies. I was a defense lawyer representing insureds who were involved in automobile accidents and other problems. I went to court and tried those cases--lots of them. Then, in the second part of my career, I represented people who had been injured. We sued, in effect, insurance companies. I also had the opportunity and the experience to represent people charged with crimes. I took those cases to juries. I had the good fortune to ask juries approximately 100 times to understand my client's plight and to, hopefully, be an advocate for what was right. I came to the conclusion that what juries do, with rare exception, is arrive at the right decision. It may not always be for the right reason, but it is usually the right decision. I believe in our system of justice, where juries make decisions. 
   I believe in following the law. What I mean by that is, if there is a law on the books, or the Supreme Court has interpreted that law, I believe it should be followed. There is a very controversial issue that is always before this body dealing with the reproductive rights of women. It doesn't matter how you feel, whether you are a so-called pro-choice or pro-life person; a group of Senators and Congressmen, Democrats and Republicans, pro-life and pro-choice Members, joined together to pass what is called the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrance Act, called FACE. 
   In effect, the law said if there is a legally constituted entity, such as planned Parenthood, that is giving women reproductive advice, and on occasion they also perform abortions --it is legal. Some of us may not agree with what they are doing. But, it is a legal entity. They are doing legal things. But FACE said you can't go to one of these entities and stop them from doing business, because if you do, you will violate the law. 
   A number of people who were unwilling to follow the law were sued as a result of their doing the wrong thing in the FACE States, and a court of law--like those courts I just talked about--ruled against them. 
   For example, Randall Terry is a person who is opposed to abortion. He sought to intimidate and do acts of violence at abortion clinics. A court awarded $1.6 million to the people who sued him. He acknowledged his intent in doing harm, and he said: I am going to file bankruptcy. Indeed, He filed bankruptcy to avoid the judgement. 
   Another person by the name of Bonnie Behn of Buffalo, NC, filed for bankruptcy to discharge a debt of some $36,000 because she violated a court order regarding a local clinic where there was an established buffer zone around the clinic. Money damages were assessed against her. She filed for bankruptcy. 
   These and other acts I think are just out of line. People who do not believe in our system of justice obviously don't believe in our trial by jury system. They don't believe in courts having the ability to award damages when they do something wrong. In effect, they believe the law is for everybody but them. Having violated the law, the judgment is rendered against them. They say: We are going to discharge this debt in bankruptcy. The debt lien means nothing. 
   That is why I joined with Senator CHARLES SCHUMER of New York in amendment No. 2763 to say that if people do this, they cannot discharge these debts in bankruptcy. I believe that very strongly. 
   When I practiced law, I also did some bankruptcy work. I learned very quickly that people who willfully violate the law by willful, wanton acts should not discharge their debts to bankruptcy. In fact, one of the things we looked at was, if somebody was a drunk driver, they should not be able to discharge that debt in bankruptcy. 
   We have made sure that is now the law because the court said, well, there wasn't intent and therefore it wasn't willful and wanton. The courts have said in various cases, for example, that if one is charged with drunk driving, they can discharge those debts in bankruptcy. In these cases, we have allowed these individuals to discharge their debts in bankruptcy. They should not be able to do that. This amendment would stop that. 
   We have had some real difficulties in recent years. We have to have people respond in monetary damages. Why do we have to have them respond in money damages? Because there have been in the last 10 years 2,000 reported acts of violence against abortion providers, including bombing, arson, death threats, kidnaping, assaults, and over 38,000 reported acts of disruption, excluding bomb threats and pickets. Murders have taken place. Clinic workers constantly face the threat of murder. Since 1993, doctors, clinic employees, clinic escorts, and security guards have been murdered. In addition to the murders that have been accomplished, we have had 16 attempted murders. 
   These providers face violence, threat, and intimidation. In addition to the two murders in 1998, we have had 19 cases where people threw what they called butyric acid. It burns people who come in contact with it. It smells very bad. In fact, the facility where this acid is thrown becomes inoperable. Clinic workers must take extraordinary measures for protection. They have to vary routes to work and call police if they receive suspicion packages, which they do all the time. They are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on glass, guards, security cameras, metal detectors, and security devices. These are lawful businesses. We have to make sure we live in a law-abiding society. 
   Anti-choice violence and terror is worsening every day, and one of the reasons is that these people flaunt the law. They throw this acid. They intimidate people, recognizing that there is no way they are going to have to respond in money damages. 
   I commend and applaud Senator SCHUMER for offering this amendment. The amendment is part of those that have been accepted as amendments that will be taken up on the bankruptcy bill. There is only a half hour of time that Senator SCHUMER has to make his case. 
   I hope this body, both the majority and minority, will overwhelmingly support this legislation. This has nothing to do with how you feel about the matter of choice; that is, whether you are pro-choice or pro-life. What it has to do with is whether or not you are going to support the law and whether you believe in our system of justice. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I think we have become kind of spoiled back here in Washington; we have had such mild winters. If we reflect back on the days of our service in the House, which was not too long ago, I say to the majority leader, it seems to me we used to have bad weather and we had to make preparations for snow days. I remember the Reagan inaugurations; those were bitter cold events about this time of year. So the right decision was made.

   Mr. President, this new unanimous consent request literally just came to our attention. I want the record to be very clear that the minority, the Democrats, have worked very hard throughout today to obtain the unanimous consent we have already agreed to. If the bankruptcy bill does not go forward, it is not the fault of the minority. 
   We have done everything we can. We have spent all day coming up with a unanimous consent agreement. I have talked to Senators literally all over the country, getting them to agree to the unanimous consent which has already been agreed to and is now spread across the record of this Senate. 
   In short, I hope that the majority leader would not object to the unanimous consent agreement that is already in the record. I acknowledge that the majority leader wants permission, and we are going to grant him that permission, to vitiate the unanimous consent agreement prior to noon tomorrow. I hope he does not do that. It would be a shame for this body and a shame for the country if this objection is made because it will take down the bankruptcy bill for the rest of the year. That would be a shame because we have already worked too hard in the effort to get this legislation passed.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope in the final hours of the session in the final day we will not forget the progress that has been made on the bankruptcy bill. I spoke to the manager of the bill, the subcommittee chair, late yesterday evening, and he indicated that there was some thought by the Republican majority leadership they would accept the unanimous-consent agreement that I suggested yesterday morning. As I indicated at that time, we have gone from some 320 amendments down to 14, 7 of which have either been accepted or they will be resolved in some manner. We only have seven contested amendments. 
   I hope we do not lose the initiative that has taken place to this point in the next few hours, or the next few minutes, really, that we could enter into that unanimous-consent agreement so that at such time as we return to the bankruptcy bill, we have a finite number of amendments and can proceed to wrapping that up. I repeat that it is not the minority but, rather, the majority that is holding up this most important bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Illinois leaves the floor, I want to direct a few questions to him. I appreciate very much the outline of this congressional session made by my friend from Illinois. The Senator from Illinois and I came to the Senate from the House of Representatives. I feel a great affinity for my friend, not only for the great work he does but because we came as part of the same class. I made a number of notations as he gave his speech. 
   Isn't it about time we updated, revised, modernized Medicare? I say that because it was almost 40 years ago, certainly 35, 36 years ago, that Medicare passed. Almost 40 years ago, 4 decades ago, we didn't have prescription drugs; we didn't have drug therapies that extended lives or made life more comfortable for most people. 
   I say to my friend from Illinois, isn't it about time Medicare became modern? Isn't it about time senior citizens have a program where they can get an affordable prescription drug program to keep them alive, to keep them healthy?

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-3-19991119</DOCNO>

   Mr. REID. Also, while we are talking about prescription drugs, I offered an amendment in the Senate, which passed, that said for Federal employees--I tried to broaden it to cover all insurance policies but was unable to do that--health insurance programs, the people who are allowed to get prescription drugs should be allowed to get prescriptions for contraceptives. The reason is that there are 3.6 million unintended pregnancies in the United States and almost 50 percent of those wind up in abortion. 
   So if people really care about cutting back the number of abortions, we should have prescription drugs available in the form of contraceptives for people. But what the Senator didn't mention is hidden in this huge bill is language to lessen the effectiveness of this program. For reasons unknown to anyone, other than a way to attempt to help the insurance companies, they have said there is going to be a conscience clause for pharmacists. I say to my friend, I understand there should be a conscience clause for physicians who might prescribe these drugs, but does the Senator see any reason why you should weaken this most important piece of legislation in law and have a so-called conscience clause for pharmacists?

   Mr. REID. The Senator has said it all there. Not everybody lives in metropolitan Chicago, where they can go to two or three different pharmacies within a matter of a few blocks. In some places, there is only one pharmacy. 
   I also say to my friend it seems unusual--while we are talking about health care--and the Senator did an excellent job in talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights. We passed a patients' non-bill of rights. We passed a bill here that is a bill in name only. If you read the Patients' Bill of Rights, the Senator knows it is not a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   It is unusual in this country--and the Senator and I are both lawyers, and I know sometimes the legal profession doesn't have the greatest name, unless you need a lawyer. But in our great society, this country that we admire--and we salute the flag every day--it is interesting that the only two groups of people you can't sue in America are foreign diplomats and HMOs. 
   Doesn't the Senator think that should be changed?

   Mr. REID. On the floor today, right next to the Senator, is the Senator from Minnesota, who has been a leader in Congress fighting for the rights of those people who are disadvantaged because of mental disease. Well, there was a big fanfare a week or two ago about some big health entity in the Midwest that had 
   decided they were going to let doctors make the decision, rather than checking them out. They looked on their accounting and found they could spend a lot of money trying to direct care. They said what they are going to do now is let doctors make the decision. What they didn't tell us is that this would not apply to people who had mental disease, who had emotional problems. Is the Senator aware of that?

   Mr. REID. At the beginning of our August break, I traveled back to Nevada with my wife. As we flew home, my wife became very sick. We got off the airplane and went immediately to the Sunrise Hospital emergency room. As we walked in that room--she was wheeled into the room--there were lots of people. It was very crowded. We were probably among the 10 percent of the fortunate ones in that room; we had insurance to cover my wife's illness. She was there for 18 days. Ninety percent of the people there had no health insurance of any kind. They were there because they had no place else to go. 
   Those uninsured people get care. The most expensive kind of care you can get anyplace is in an emergency room. Who pays for that? You and I pay for it. Everybody in America pays for it in 
   the form of higher taxes for indigent care--higher insurance premiums, higher insurance policies, and higher hospital and doctor bills. We all pay for it anyway. 
   But we don't have the direction from the majority here to have a debate on what we are going to do with the rapidly rising number of people with no health insurance. 
   Next year, we are going to probably have 2 million more. It is going up every year. We have 45 million people--actually 44 million people now--who have no health insurance. Next year, it will be close to 46 million people. Will the Senator agree with me that it is somewhat embarrassing for this great, rich country, the only superpower in the world, that 44 million people will have no health insurance?

   Mr. REID. In the State of Nevada, we have at least 2 million. But yet in a Senate race a little over a year ago in the State of Nevada, Harry REID and his opponent spent $20 million; that is, between the State party moneys, our own money, $20 million. That doesn't count independent expenditures by people who come from someplace and are spending money. You don't know who they are, and where they are from--another probably $3 million. So in a small State of Nevada, about $23 million. 
   Does that sound a little excessive to the Senator from Illinois?

   Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend from Illinois to show how the system has frayed, I was interviewed in Washington by a Reno TV station for a half hour interview. During the interview, they said: How do you feel about the present Senate race? The person I had the good fortune of being able to beat is running again for the Senate; Senator BRYAN is not running for reelection. I said nice things about my opponent. I said I have known him; he is a nice man; I have known his family, and they always supported me. I said nice things about my opponent and I said nice things about the person who is going to be the Democratic nominee. 
   The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee issues a press release they poured out to Nevada saying, ``Reid endorses Ensign,'' because I said something nice about my former opponent. They stooped to the level of saying, Reid endorses John Ensign. 
   I like John Ensign; he is a nice man. 
   The system has gotten so callous. After this came out, a radio talk show host called me and said, I am a Republican but I want you to know I think what the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee did is despicable. I think it is, too. We now are suspect because we say something nice about somebody who is running for office. Shouldn't it all be nice? We should be in a contest where we can determine who will be the best for the State of Nevada, the State of Illinois, the State of Minnesota--not the worst.

   Mr. REID. I very much appreciate the Senator's statement on education. The Senator talked about how important it is to have additional teachers in America to reduce class sizes. 
   My daughter is a second grade teacher. She said she can tell within the first few days with these little kids who the smart ones are and those who are not so smart. The problem is classes are so big, what can be done about those in between, the average kid? Most people are average. What happens to the average kids? Many times they are lost in our present system. 
   No matter how teachers struggle, work long hours, and prepare their lessons, they don't have time to do it all because the classes are too big. What we have been able to do as a result of the President hanging in there is get more teachers to reduce class 
   size. That is a positive step. 
   One thing the Senator didn't mention, and I know we have spoken about it, is the problem we are having in America with high school dropouts. Every day we have about 3,000 children drop out of high school, half a million a year. We have no specific programs to address that. The Senator from New Mexico and I have introduced legislation two successive years. Last year, it passed; it was killed in the House when the Gingrich Congress killed it. It would have set up within the Department of Education a dropout czar who would have been able to work on programs that have been successful in other parts of the country and, in effect, give challenge grants to local school districts--they would still control the programs, of course--giving them guidance and direction in keeping kids in school. 
   This year on a strictly partisan vote the majority killed the Bingaman-Reid amendment. 
   Would the Senator acknowledge the fact we have to do something about high school dropouts, we need to do something to keep kids in school?

Eighty-three percent of the people sentenced for crimes in America today are high school dropouts, 83 percent.

   Mr. REID. I appreciate hearing from the professor. 
   I want to talk with my friend from Illinois about Social Security. The Senator mentioned Social Security. One of the things that puts a smile on my face is when I hear the majority talking about having saved Social Security. If that doesn't put a smile on your face, nothing would because the Senator will recall a few years ago here in the Congress we were debating something called the constitutional amendment to balance the budget. As the Senator will recall, I offered the first amendment to say, fine, we want a constitutional amendment to balance the budget; let's exclude the Social Security trust fund from the balancing. 
   The Senator is aware they defeated that because they wanted to have their calculations applying the vast surplus that we have had the last several years with our Social Security fund, they wanted to apply that to balance the budget. 
   Is the Senator aware of that?

   Mr. REID. The Senator was also part of this Congress when, in 1993, without a single Republican vote, we passed the budget to address the deficit. It passed. We had to have the Vice President come down and break the tie. The Senator recalls at that time clearly, we had deficits of about $300 billion a year. Since then, we now have surpluses. We have done very well with low inflation, low unemployment--40-year employment highs in that regard. We have created about 20 million new jobs. We have about 350,000 fewer Federal employees than we had then. We have a Federal Government about the same size as when President Kennedy was President. 
   We could go on with other things that happened as a result of the hard vote we cast, without a single vote from the Republicans. Does the Senator remember that?

   We are here in kind of a celebratory fashion. We are going to complete this bill tonight, unless certain Members of the Senate keep our staff in all night long. Otherwise, we will finish it very quickly. 
   Does the Senator understand getting to this point has been really difficult and we, the minority, have had to hang very 
   tough? 
   Remember, in an effort to get where we are, there have been a number of ways the majority has attempted to get to this point. You remember the Wall Street Journal article where they talked about the two sets of books the Republicans were keeping? They would, for certain things, go with the Office of Management and Budget and for certain things go with the Congressional Budget Office. Does the Senator remember that?

Does the Senator from Illinois understand that crying victory over having a .3-percent across-the-board cut where the President can decide what would be cut is not something they should be crowing about victoriously?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have had the good fortune, in the past several days, to work to resolve many issues. We have made some progress. I want to say that what we have seen in the last few days could not be a better illustration of what politics and Government is all about. I say that in a positive fashion. We have had people from the State of Wisconsin and the State of Minnesota fighting for what they believe is right. The Constitution was developed to protect the minority, not the majority. The majority can always protect themselves. 
   The Constitution is set up, especially through the Senate, to always protect the minority. That is what they were doing, protecting themselves. They, in effect, didn't get a fair deal in this omnibus bill. 
   About the Senator from Wisconsin, there have been a number of things said, especially by the Senator from West Virginia. I underscore and applaud that. We have to make sure the other Senator from Wisconsin is also recognized. They have both been stalwarts in this battle. 
   I direct everybody's attention to yesterday's CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. On page S14794, there was a statement made by Senator KOHL. If anyone is ever concerned about what the free enterprise system is all about, read what Senator KOHL said yesterday on the Senate floor. That is what this debate has been all about--about the free enterprise system in this great country of ours. 
   In effect, what the Senators from Wisconsin have been fighting about is whether or not the free enterprise system is going to be circumvented by a cartel, a deal that has been, in effect, condoned, underlined, and set forth by the Federal Government. It should not be. So I direct everyone's attention to this. I appreciate very much the cooperation of the Senators from Wisconsin and especially the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE. He has fought long and hard, and he has been on this floor for the last several days. To my friends from Minnesota and Wisconsin, I appreciate their recognizing that they have rights. They have done everything they could to protect their rights under the Constitution.

   Mr. REID. I thank my friend from Idaho for his hard work. I want to confirm my understanding of one absolutely critical thing with respect to the language in Section 337 protecting plans of operations submitted prior to November 7, 1997. It is my understanding that the language covers revisions, modifications, and amendments to such plans that are made before such plans are fully approved by the BLM or Forest Service. If an as yet unapproved plan of operations was submitted prior to November 7, 1997 and revised earlier this year, for instance, then the proposed operation, as revised, would be protected. It is the operation, not a specific property position--whether mining claims or mill sites--that is protected. This is very important to my State and I ask the chairman to specifically confirm my understanding.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator outlining for us what the intent is for the day. I hope that part of what we are going to do is to work on completing the bankruptcy bill. I say to my friends in the majority that we only have a few amendments remaining. I have spoken to Senator LEAHY and his staff, and I am ready to offer a unanimous-consent request. I will not ask that the Senator accept this, recognizing that he must speak with the manager of the bill, Senator GRASSLEY. But what I would like to do is ask unanimous consent that the following amendments numbered 2517, 2537, 2538, 2539, 2658, 2666, 2667, 2747, 2748, 2753, 2759, 2761, 2763, and 2670, and any amendment agreed upon by the two managers be the only amendments--those I have just read and those agreed to by the two managers--in order to S. 625, the bill to amend title 11, United States Code, and for other purposes, and that following the disposition of all the above-described amendments, the bill be immediately advanced to third reading; that the Senate then proceed to the House companion bill, H.R. 833; that all after the enacting clause be stricken, the text of the Senate bill, as amended, be inserted; that the bill be advanced to third reading; that a vote occur on passage of the bill without any intervening action, motion or debate; that the Senate insist on its amendments, request a conference with the House, and the Senate bill be placed back on the calendar. 
   Mr. President, that is the unanimous-consent request that I spread across the RECORD of the Senate, recognizing that at this time there will not be an objection to it. We will make this unanimous-consent request at some later time.

   Mr. REID. I am not asking, Mr. President, that there be objection. I am not asking unanimous consent at this time. 
   I say to the majority that we have enumerated 14 amendments. Seven of them have tentatively been agreed upon or they will be withdrawn. Only seven amendments are now between 
   completing the bankruptcy bill and not completing it this year. The only two amendments of the seven that I understand are causing any controversy are the ones dealing with gun manufacturers and clinic violence. 
   On the gun manufacturing amendment, the proponents have agreed to a 70-minute time agreement, and on the amendment relating to clinic violence, the proponent has agreed to 30 minutes. So there is really not much left to complete this bill. I hope that during the day there can be discussions ongoing to complete this bill. We would be willing at any time the majority wants to lock in these amendments; we would be willing to come back and I would propound this unanimous consent request, or we could have the majority do so, so that this bill could be completed in a reasonably short period of time.

We have worked very hard these past few days on these amendments. We need time on the floor to begin to offer some of these amendments. 
   As the Senator knows, we have maybe 8 or 9 amendments total out of 320, and we could have a bill. And the contentious amendments--on one that is causing us not to move forward, the Senator from New York, Mr. SCHUMER, has agreed to a half hour. That is all he wants.

There is no Member of the Senate who is more astute, works harder, and has a better understanding of the issues that face the Senate, which was well demonstrated by her work on this issue about which she feels fervently.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the amendment offered by the Senator from Massachusetts. Also, for the benefit of everyone in the Chamber and within the sound of my voice, on this bill we have moved along significantly from 300-plus amendments down to fewer than 10 amendments. 
   I hope we can continue working on this bill. I do not see any reason why we cannot finish this legislation tonight. We have a few amendments. I have heard it being rumored that we are going out early tonight. If the majority wants a bankruptcy bill, they can have a bankruptcy bill. The minority is not holding up the bankruptcy bill. We have, as I indicated, fewer than 10 amendments. A number of those Senators have agreed to time limits. 
   It is a situation where, with all the work that has been done for years by the manager of the bill--not a matter of weeks but for years--the goal is in sight, and we should move forward and pass this much-needed legislation. I repeat, the problem is not with the minority. We are willing to work as late tonight as possible. We were willing to work yesterday. I hope we can move forward on these amendments. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

I say to my friend from Vermont that in looking over these amendments, which have gone from 320 to now probably 7 or 8, a handful of amendments, the Senator understands that the movement of this bankruptcy bill is not being slowed down on this side of the aisle. Our Members have been very cooperative. Would he agree to that?

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, Senator WELLSTONE has two amendments he will offer first thing in the morning. Senator FEINGOLD has one amendment that has already been offered. He wants to debate it some more, and he said he would do that tonight. We also have Senator FEINGOLD who has one other amendment he wishes to offer at a subsequent time. We also have a Dodd amendment that, I think with the managers' bill, we have worked out, and it has been agreed to by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the manager. Senator SARBANES has an amendment he wishes to offer. Senator HARKIN has an amendment he said he may offer tonight. We are basically finished. 
   The two things that are holding this up--and we should not play around with it anymore--are an amendment by the Senator from New York dealing with clinics, on which he has agreed to a half-hour time limit, and we have the Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, who has agreed to 17 minutes on an amendment relating to gun manufacturers. 
   I say to my friend, in short, we have almost nothing left. So it would seem to me we should move forward as rapidly as possible and finish this bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, to engage my friend on the bill generally, we have been working with the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator DASCHLE's floor staff, and Senator GRASSLEY and his staff during all or parts of the day. We are in a position now where this bill can be completed in a relatively short period of time. We have worked with Members on this side of the aisle, and with the cooperation of the manager of this bill there is a tentative agreement to accept about 10 amendments that the Democrats have offered. They may want to change the amendments in some fashion. We have been able to work on a finite number of hours that would be left in those amendments, with the exception of one Senator. 
   In short, for notice to the other Members of the Senate, with a little bit of luck we can finish this bill relatively shortly. I hope the majority allows Members to continue to work on this bill to complete it.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Iowa, we have made great progress. Originally, the bill had about 320 amendments. We are now down to no more than 15 amendments. Of those amendments, some can be negotiated. There are some that will require votes. 
   As I indicated, there is only one Senator, who has two amendments, who hasn't agreed on time for those amendments. Of course, if everyone is serious about completing the bankruptcy bill, going from 320 amendments to approximately 15 amendments says it all. We should complete this bill. Significant progress has been made. 
   I acknowledge there are a couple of issues that will be more difficult. However, people on our side--even on those two amendments--have agreed to times. One Senator has agreed to a 30-  minute time agreement; the other Senator has agreed to a 70-minute time agreement. As contentious as these two amendments might be, we recognize we are in the minority. We are willing, in spite of our being in the minority, to agree to a time limit to let the will of this body work. We would agree to a way of disposing of those. Two Senators feel very strongly that they deserve a vote on these two amendments. 
   Other than those two amendments, I think we should be able to go through this bill at a relatively rapid rate. From all I have been able to determine, we are not going to be leaving here tomorrow anyway. We should try to complete this bill if at all 
   possible. It would be a shame if cloture were attempted to be invoked on this bill, after having gone from 320 amendments to a mere handful. I think that would leave a pretty good argument on the side of the minority not to go along with cloture. We have done everything we can to be reasonable. A few Senators desire to offer amendments. They should have the right to offer those amendments. 
   I have appreciated the cooperation of the Senator from Iowa, the manager of this bill, and his staff. They have been very easy to work with and very understanding of what we have been trying to accomplish. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wish to renew what I said earlier today. We have taken this bankruptcy bill a long way. When the bill started, we had 320 amendments that had been filed. We are down now to a handful of amendments, literally--12 to 15 amendments. 
   I suggest to the majority, after we complete our votes in the morning, we should go immediately to offering some of these amendments. I think, without a lot of work tomorrow, we can complete this bill. There is no reason at this stage to even consider invoking cloture; we are so close to being able to complete this bill. I can't speak for the entire minority, but if a cloture motion were filed at this late day, I am confident it would not be passed. 
   I think we should do everything within our power to complete this bill before we adjourn.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased to join today with a geographically and politically diverse group of Senators to introduce the Small Community Assistance Act of 1999. I commend Senator JEFFORDS for investing his time and energy in developing this important legislation. This Small Community Assistance Act will help ensure that small towns all across America are included in a combined local, state, and national effort to protect the environment. 
   This bill would help increase communications and cooperation between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and smaller communities. By establishing a Small Town Ombudsman Office in each of EPA's regions, this bill will ensure that communities with less than 7500 residents have improved access to the technical expertise and information that are necessary for small towns to cost effectively protect the quality of their air and water and their citizens' health. 
   By incorporating the perspectives of a Small Community Advisory Committee early in the development of EPA's environmental policies, this bill will improve the working relationship between small towns and EPA and ultimately strengthen environmental protection. 
   The Small Community Advisory Committee will build on the valuable work already done by EPA's Small Community Task Force, which includes representatives of towns, governmental agencies, and public interest groups from across the country. Cherie Aiazzi of Carlin, a town of about 2800 people in northern Nevada, contributed  her time, insight and creativity to this task force and I know that perspectives of rural towns across the country are better understood as a result of her efforts. 
   By coincidence of history and geography Nevada is a state with more small towns than big cities. In our efforts to enhance the quality of life for all Nevadans, it is crucial that small communities play an important role in the development and achievement of our environmental goals. The Small Community Assistance Act of 1999 provides an valuable opportunity for small towns to contribute to and benefit from this important effort.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, last Thursday, I was reading the morning newspaper in Washington when I came across an article describing for, lack of a better description, the emotional stress of a doctor, Steven Dixon. Dr. Dixon, after a lifetime of study and sacrifice, indicated he was going to give up the practice of medicine. Why? Because terrorists had broken his 40-year-old spirit. 
   This 40-year-old doctor decided he wasn't going to practice medicine anymore. His will to work had been broken. 
   Dr. Dixon maintained a medical practice in the downtown DC area. Dr. Dixon, by training, was certified to be an obstetrician/gynecologist. In his practice, he helped women with a multitude of medical problems--basic checkups, physicals, and problems unique to women. On occasion, he terminated pregnancies. What did these people do to run Dr. Dixon out of the practice of medicine? They distributed wanted posters with his name and photograph like those you see in the post office. He received numerous threatening phone calls to his home and his office. Various threatening mail was sent to his home and office. These are some of the things that happened to Dr. Dixon. 
   In the United States, the highest court in the land, the U.S. Supreme Court, the same court that established the way commerce is conducted between the 50 States, the same court that decreed education cannot be separate and be equal, the same court that set precedence for the cleansing of Government by its overview of Watergate--this same U.S. Supreme Court has set forth a standard as to how abortion in the United States is legal. That is the final word, what the Supreme Court says in our country. Whether one agrees or disagrees, it is the law of this Republic. 
   But some are unwilling to follow the law of the land. They think they know better. This has led to violence, vandalism, brutal protests at legal clinics established to deal with a multitude of female-related health problems. In the last 20 years, there has been an average of 40 of these acts each week--bombings, arsons, death threats, kidnappings, murders, tires slashed, oil drained from cars, sugar put in gas tanks, blood splattered on people's homes and sidewalks and places of business. There have been 38,000 acts during less than two decades--38,000 acts of terrorism. 
   I am going to talk now about some examples of these terrorist acts. For example, people who work in entities, such as Planned Parenthood clinics, face acts of violence, threats, intimidation. In 1998, at just such clinics, there were multiple murders, bombings, and arsons, a score of butyric acid attacks. That is a chemical compound that burns and leaves an awful smell. Anti-choice violence and terrorism is worsening. It should be stopped. Dr. Dixon, who I have never met, who many read about last Thursday, which caused me to begin thinking about this issue, stated in a letter:  
   It is ironic that I am a target, because my entire career has been about educating and empowering women to help prevent unintended pregnancies. While I have always supported a woman's right to have this legal procedure, I actually performed few abortions for my patients. In fact, I stopped performing them because of the stress associated with this terrorism. Sadly, the ongoing threat to my life and my concern for the safety of my loved ones has exacted a heavy toll on me, making it necessary that I discontinue practicing.  
   I don't know Dr. Dixon, never met him, never talked to him. But those who threaten Dr. Dixon are cowards, terrorists, no different than the people who blew up the New York City Trade Center. They are murderers. These killers and would-be killers and terrorists call each other patriots. The true patriots of this Nation are those who have given their all in the fields of battle, places called the Bulge and the beaches of Guadalcanal, Pork Chop Hill in Korea, and in Vietnam. And many people who haven't given their lives have sacrificed a great deal. Many serve in this Chamber. Under our system of government, which has been in existence for more than 200 years, the law of the land can only be changed by peaceful political means, through persuasion, debate, demonstrations that are peaceful in nature, grassroots political activity, the assertion of one's feelings at the ballot box, but never, never, through violence and intimidation. What is now 
   taking place in our country by these zealots is despicable. 
   Why do I say what I have said? Why do I conclude this? Let me travel a little bit. Remember, we have 38,000 of these terrorist acts, and I am going to talk about a few of these demonstrations of viciousness. A manual has been produced by a group called the Army of God. It is a manual directing there to be no trial, no jury, no appeal, no stay of execution. Their clear declaration is to kill abortion doctors and people associated with abortion clinics--kill whoever they decide should be murdered. 
   Doctor Barnett Slepian. I didn't realize this until after the murder had taken place, but Dr. Slepian's niece worked for me here in Washington. She is now a writer of some acclaim. She had an article published in the last issue of George magazine. She is from Reno, NV, and is a wonderful young lady. Dr. Barnett Slepian was shot and killed by a bullet that came through his kitchen window at the same time the doctor was having dinner with his family in his kitchen. After this brutal murder, this cowardly act, his death was mocked publicly. His murder was commended by some groups. The killer, even though identified, has not been apprehended. 
   In Birmingham, AL, at a health clinic, there was a bomb blast which killed the security guard who was there, a man by the name of Robert Sanderson. He was a police officer trying to make some money on the side. Emily Lyons, a nurse, was severely injured and left nearly blind and with medical bills of almost $1 million. Eric Robert Rudolph has been charged with this attack. He is the man who is being chased through the hills in the south, someplace in North Carolina. He is one of the FBI's Ten Most Wanted. He is yet to be found. 
   In December of 1996, Dr. Calvin Jackson was stabbed many, many times. He lost at least four pints of blood, and one ear was severed. His assailant was apprehended a few hours later, after entering another clinic carrying a filleting knife. 
   John Salvi--at about the same time this Jackson matter took place--was tried for two murders of clinic receptionists, people who were secretaries--Shannon Lowney and Lee Ann Nichols. He attempted to kill five others. He fired bullets into these clinics in Brookline, MA, and Norfolk, VA. 
   It is hard for me to say this, but a Reverend, Rev. Paul Hill, a well-known protester and director of the anti-choice group called Defensive Action, was convicted in the fall of 1994 for the murders of Dr. John Britton and a 74-year-old man who happened to be with him outside a health clinic in Pensacola, FL. 
   The two victims were shot with a 12-gauge shotgun. Before the shootings, Reverend Hill had been previously arrested for his activities where he advocated continual use of force. 
   Dr. David Gunn, a physician, was murdered during a protest at a Pensacola clinic. Wanted posters featuring Dr. Gunn's photograph, telephone number, and schedule were distributed at an Operation Rescue rally in Montgomery, AL, and other places.  
   Dr. George Tiller, who was a target of violence and blockades for many years, was shot in both arms. 
   Finally, in Wichita, KS, a person charged with a shooting who had been arrested on previous occasions for trespassing and blockading clinic entrances praised the man who murdered Dr. Gunn. 
   I was the first person to come here and speak out on the Senate floor about Dr. Gunn's murder, which I thought was sickening. 
   Neal Horsley, a militant and founder of a group called the Creator's Rights Party, has developed a web site entitled ``The Nuremberg Files.'' The site was designed to ``collect evidence.'' This so-called ``evidence'' lists clinic staff members, law enforcement officers, judges, and politicians for use in future trials ``for their crimes.'' Remember that they work in legal clinics. The site seeks and lists personal information such as photos of them and their families, their houses, their cars, their driving records, license plate numbers, names and birth dates of individuals, and even the birth dates of their family. 
   A legend accompanies this list of names under a banner where there is a simulation of dripping blood. The legend indicates the degree that this so-called Creator's Rights Party wants to place these people. There is a black font for people who just work there. Then it becomes gray when somebody has been wounded. Their name isn't completely stricken but partially stricken when they have been wounded by one of these terrorists. But if someone is killed, like Dr. Slepian, there is an immediate strike through. They are stricken off the list. 
   Last year, about a year ago, at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Milwaukee there was an envelope received in the mail. Inside the envelope was a bomb constructed of two batteries with wire wrapped in modeling clay. These bombs didn't work. But the message written on white paper stated that the next one might be real. The next day, Milwaukee's Affiliated Medical Services received a similar mailing. 
   A week after the murder of Dr. Slepian, four clinics in three States received letters purporting to contain anthrax, which we know is the most deadly strain of bacteria. A few days later, six more anthrax threats were sent to clinics. Although some clinics were closed and staff decontaminated, all of these threats turned out to be hoaxes. 
   Bombs were discovered at two clinics in North Carolina about a year ago, less than a month after these clinics had been damaged by arson. 
   Between May and July of last year, 19 clinics in Louisiana, Florida, and Texas were vandalized with butyric acid, that I have already talked about, which is a noxious industrial chemical which sent people who happened to be in the area to hospitals, including patients and staff members. They went there with respiratory problems, nausea, and sickness. Clinics were closed for days while they tried to get the smell out of their facilities. 
   Shortly after the clinic bombings in Atlanta and Oklahoma, an Oregon physician, Peter Bours, received a letter which demanded $50,000 in cash and threatened, ``The bombings in Atlanta and Oklahoma are a warning,'' and indicated that those who do not comply to our demands will be destroyed. 
   The FBI arrested a man by the name of William Kitchens. When they arrested him, they discovered a book in his kitchen on extortion and kidnapping. 
   Within 2 weeks of Dr. Britton's murder in Pensacola, FL, the last remaining doctor then providing advice in Mississippi, Dr. Joseph Booker became the target of a ``No Place to Hide'' campaign. The campaign's leader, Roy McMillan, signed a petition advocating the murder of Dr. Britton and others.  
   According to physician Pablo Rodriguez, ``[i]n the beginning, the harassment consisted of just nasty letters and graphic pictures. Then I began receiving strange packages with dolls inside, as well as subscriptions to gun magazines. ..... Then the ``Wanted'' posters with my picture on them began to appear. ..... Then the doors and locks to our clinic were glued several times, and protesters blockaded the clinic three times. ..... Just after Dr. Gunn's death, ..... I realized that my car was steering poorly. I checked my tires and found 45 nails embedded in them. ..... That evening, my wife painfully discovered with her foot that our driveway had been booby-trapped with roofing nails cleverly buried beneath the snow. ..... My home, my haven of safety--violated.''  
   Shortly after Operation Rescue targeted physician Frank Snydle as part of its ``No Place to Hide'' campaign, his 80-year-old mother received a telephone call that was false and misleading and a prank at 3 a.m. in the morning telling her that her son had been killed in a car accident.

   Mr. REID. The Reform Resolution also proposes a uniform set of possible sanctions for violations. The reforms would continue the Ethics Committee's current authority to dismiss a complaint because there is no violation, or find that any violation is inadvertent or otherwise de minimis and resolve it informally, after the Committee has gathered the facts. Both the current and the reformed process contemplate a letter of disapproval to resolve situations where a violation is de minimis and does not deserve formal discipline. Although the use of such letters is not explicit under current rules, such letters have historically been used by the Committee to resolve complaints, and the reformed process would expressly provide for public or private ``Letters of Admonition'' for this purpose. Such letters have not been and would not be considered discipline. 
   As to discipline by the Committee, the current process permits the Committee to resolve a case, with the Committee does not believe deserves sanction by the full Senate, by suggesting a remedy such as a reprimand, but only with consent of the respondent. The usefulness of this method of resolution is limited by the requirement of consent. The reformed process would authorize the Committee to resolve an appropriate case with a reprimand without consent, and/or financial restitution, but only after an opportunity for hearing and only with a right of appeal of the full Senate. In this fashion, cases which the Committee does not believe deserve discipline by the full Senate could be resolved, and the individual's right to defend his or her conduct before the full Senate would be preserved.

   Mr. REID. I don't intend to get involved in the debate involving the merits of this bill, but the problem with this legislation is not the legislation itself; the problem is the majority has not allowed the minority, the Republicans have not allowed the Democrats, to treat this bill as the Senate should treat any bill. 
   We started this bill last Thursday. It is now Friday. Eight days we have spent on this legislation. We have spent no time on a single amendment on this legislation. 
   The proper way to handle this is to allow the Senator from South Carolina, the Senator from Minnesota, and others to bring their amendments forward and have a debate. The Senators who want to offer amendments have all agreed to time agreements. The Senator from South Carolina desired 10 minutes on an amendment, 5 minutes per side. 
   Our leader, the minority leader, has also agreed, even though it is probably not in his best interest, but he believes in this legislation. He knows how important it is to the President. He has said he will offer to go along with the majority leader and table amendments not germane. 
   We should treat this body as it has been treated for over two hundred years: Bring a measure before the floor and let the debate proceed. We would have completed this legislation some time ago. There is no question this legislation now before this body has at least 75 supporters, maybe 80. I think this should give the majority all the backing they need for this legislation. I think it is a shame we are to the point we have not had a good debate on this legislation; in fact, probably the legislation will be pulled down. That is too bad.  
   We as the minority will have to continue protecting our rights, 
   whether it is the CBI, this bill now before us, whether it is bankruptcy. Whatever the legislation that is going to be brought forward, we must have our input. That is all we are asking. We are not asking we win every amendment. Some amendments we recognize the majority does not want to vote upon. But that is not the way you conduct a legislative body, just avoid all issues that are tough votes. 
   We need more tough votes. We would all be better off, individually, in our respective States and the country, if we had more tough votes. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   I know you would agree with that. But I say to the Senator from South Dakota, I think it is important that you, in effect, have challenged them to come forward in a bipartisan fashion to debate these proposals the Senator has outlined for the good of the country, to extend Social Security and preserve Medicare. Is that, in effect, what the Senator is saying?

The junior Senator from Illinois came forward and said he thought it was too bad the minority would not allow a vote on the lockbox. 
   I say to the Democratic leader, isn't it true that we were happy to have a vote on the lockbox; all we wanted was to have our lockbox and their lockbox and vote on both of them? Isn't that what it was all about?

   It was a few months ago at the West Front of the Capitol that I was here with Miss America. There has been a new Miss America in the last few weeks. The 1998 Miss America is a diabetic. She was out there because she has hope that what we are doing at the National Institutes of Health will allow her and the millions of other people who are diabetic to be cured. 
   This will slow up the grants to these people who, we are told, are on the verge of a breakthrough so children and others with diabetes can look forward to the date when they will no longer have to take the insulin shots, sometimes three times a day. Isn't that right?

   Mr. REID. Madam President, there is going to be ample time in the months to come to debate this issue. As the RECORD is clear, this matter was brought up by the majority leader today, and there were a number of Senators on the floor, including the two Senators from Nevada and the Democratic leader, who all objected to the motion to proceed. The leader did say that he was going to, at some subsequent time, bring this matter forward. 
   My purpose today is simply to state that the Senator from Alaska, who is the chairman of the committee that is trying to move this piece of legislation, indicated he could speak for 7 or 8 days on the issue. I think the Senator from Alaska is going to have to speak for 7 or 8 days on the issue in an effort to move this matter forward. 
   The Senators from Nevada, and others who oppose this environmental disaster, would speak for eight times 8 days in an effort to stop this matter from moving forward. This legislation is bad legislation. 
   The fact that the nuclear power industry gave up on interim storage, what does that mean? It means there was an attempt by the nuclear power industry--this all-powerful entity that has been so powerful in the Congress--for 4 or 5 years to set all environmental laws aside, the laws that are established to protect the public in the characterization at Yucca Mountain. They moved to set all these environmental laws aside, go to the Nevada Test Site, pour a big cement pad on top of the ground, and then haul across the highways and railways across this country nuclear waste, dump it on top of the cement pad, and in effect just leave it there. 
   Everyone recognized that if this storage took place, this so-called interim storage--which in the minds of the nuclear industry meant permanent--it would be permanent, it would never leave the Nevada Test Site. 
   The President of the United States said: I think we have to do something to take care of nuclear waste, but I think what is being attempted in the interim storage is wrong. If the Congress sends that to me, I am going to veto it. 
   We had a couple of test votes here, and it showed that we clearly had enough votes to sustain a Presidential veto on nuclear storage in an interim fashion. 
   The nuclear power industry has said: We weren't able to do that. And we don't want Yucca Mountain to go forward, as the law now stands. We want to change the law. 
   How do they want to change the law? They want to, again, set environmental standards on their head, avoid environmental standards. What they want to do is have the Environmental Protection Agency--remember that name, the Environmental Protection Agency--removed from the picture. The most poisonous substance known to man, plutonium, nuclear waste, they want to haul someplace, and the nuclear power industry does not want the Environmental Protection Agency to have anything to do with it. 
   How in the world could you support legislation such as that? Instead of the Environmental Protection Agency, they want to insert the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. They want to have the fox guarding the hen house, literally. 
   Again, the President of the United States has stepped forward and publicly said: I am not going to allow that to happen. 
   All environmental groups in America, and probably in the world--certainly I can speak about America--think this is bad legislation, and they have spoken out accordingly. The President has again said: Go ahead and pass this legislation. But if you do, I am going to veto it. 
   I do not know why, other than to pacify and satisfy the nuclear power industry, you would bring this legislation forward. This legislation is dead. It has no chance of passing. 
   If they think they can bring in a subsequent President--that would have to be, I assume, President Bush, if in fact he were lucky enough to be President--that is the only way this will ever pass because President Gore would never support this legislation.  
   But in fact what they should do, to avoid all this wasted time in the Senate this year and next year, is just wait until the next Presidential election takes place. I think they will find they are probably going to be faced with President GORE. But regardless of that, they should at least wait because in the meantime they are wasting the time of the Congress by playing around with this legislation. 
   I repeat: To take from the law the protection of the Environmental Protection Agency, it is not only that they are going to remove the Environmental protection Agency from this legislation but at the same time they are changing the standards; they are reducing the standards; they are making it easier to place nuclear waste. 
   We have always talked around here about the risks, the millirems, the way you measure the poison that comes into your system. We have measured that with adults. What we are going to talk about, at the right time as this legislation proceeds, is what this radiation would do to children. 
   Children cannot take the same radiation that adults can. We have had this debate on other issues. Lead, lead-based paint, lead in the environment is very harmful to children, not very harmful to adults--harmful to adults, but not nearly as harmful to adults as it is to children. 
   If you look at the risk to children, you see that the risk to children is very substantial. In fact, the risk to children is six times the maximum risk permitted by the EPA standards. They want to lower that. 
   The children living in the areas of Yucca Mountain and the areas that are going to transport this stuff will suffer as much as three times what an adult would. 
   So we are going to have time to talk about this. As I have indicated, we can talk eight times 8 hours on this issue, and we are going to devote at least a couple of hours of that time to the risk to children. 
   Ground water protection. 
   Things nuclear are very dangerous to water. We have learned at the Nevada Test Site, where we have set off 1,000 nuclear devices either above ground or in the ground, that it is being transported in the water a lot quicker than we ever thought. Scientific proof is now present which shows there is tremendous danger in things nuclear to ground water. What they are trying to do with Yucca Mountain will be very dangerous to water. But what about the water along the highways and railways where it is being transported? Of course, it is dangerous there also. 
   In addition, earthquakes in the Nevada area of Yucca Mountain are very significant. Yucca Mountain is located in the region with the second highest frequency of earthquakes in the entire country. It is hard to believe, but the Department of Energy selected the second most earthquake-prone place in the United States to site this nuclear repository. There has been a series of earthquakes in this area in the last couple of years--not one, but a series of earthquakes. It is called a cluster area; a clustering of earthquakes occurs in Yucca Mountain naturally. We will have an opportunity to talk about that. 
   The cost of the program is something the American public needs to hear more about. This program already has cost about $7 billion. We know the public has lost confidence. This is not something we are making up. We can look at what has transpired in Europe where they have tried to move nuclear waste. Last year, they tried to move a few casks of nuclear waste in Europe. They had to call out 30,000 soldiers and police to move it. I think it is clear there is a loss of confidence in being able to transport nuclear waste. 
   We have talked on the Senate floor--we will have a lot more time to spend on it--about the shipments and where this nuclear waste will travel. We know that at least 50 million people are located in an area within a mile of the highways and railways where it will be transported. We know that there are terrorist threats. It is very easy to develop nuclear weapons. You can go on the Internet. For example, the blast that blew up the Federal Building in Oklahoma, they learned to do that over the Internet, how to mix fertilizer and whatever else you mix to make this huge explosion. It is just as easy, if you have the material, to come up with a nuclear device. That is one thing the transportation of nuclear waste presents to us; how are we going to stop it. How are we going to prevent terrorists from stealing it? 
   We have had organizations that have followed small shipments of nuclear waste. They said there is no one guarding it. It is easy to follow it. It could be stolen, if someone wanted to. 
   We know the canisters that have been developed are not safe for transporting. They are safe for storage but not transporting. A collision or a fire breaches the casks. Physicians for Social Responsibility are very concerned about nuclear waste and the dangers of nuclear waste. They testified on October 26, regarding the draft environmental impact statement, that the dangers associated with storing an unprecedented amount of highly radioactive waste is very dangerous, and it is difficult to comprehend how it could be done safely. 
   Finally, recognizing the day is late and my friend from Alabama wishes to speak, the obvious question people ask, if you 
   are opposed to interim storage and you don't want these standards changed at Yucca Mountain, what should be done with nuclear waste? Easy question to answer. Scientists have determined the best thing to do with nuclear waste is leave it where it is, leave it where it is in dry cask storage containment. It would be safe. To set up one of these sites only costs $5 million. Only? Remember, Yucca Mountain is already approaching $7 billion. So the constant harangue here, ``OK, if you don't want to put it in Nevada, where are you going to put it,'' is easy to answer. 
   The question wasn't so easy to answer a few years ago, but the scientific community has stepped forward and now, as is done right out here, not far from Washington, DC, at Calvert Cliffs, nuclear waste is stored in dry cask storage containers, and it is stored safely--safe against fire, safe against transportation. And it is easy to secure it because it is in one centralized location. Of course, there would be a number of these locations around the country, but think of how much more safe it is to have these multiple sites than trying to transport this 70,000 tons across the highways and railways of this country. 
   In closing, we have a lot to talk about on this issue. I express appreciation to the President of the United States who is willing to join with the environmental community in saying: Don't do it because if you do, I will veto it.

The Senate stands for what our Constitution was set up to do. We are not the House of Representatives. We are not elected every 2 years. We are to be a deliberative body, and the leader spoke so well in that regard. I, as I said for all Democrats and for the country, respect and appreciate his position. 
   I would like to ask a question of my friend from North Dakota. I say to my friend from North Dakota, does he remember--I see at least five Senators, here coincidentally on the floor, all of whom agreed to oppose the rush by the Republicans to have a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. We opposed that, the five of us on the floor today: The Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER; the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY; the Senator from South Carolina, Mr. HOLLINGS; this Senator; and the leader walking out to his office.

   Mr. REID. I carry with me in my wallet, because I think it is hard for people to comprehend this is true--here it is. Just to show Lionel Van Deerlin is not too old to remember what really happened, I have here what I carry in my wallet: GOP leaders on Medicare and Social Security. 
   Let me read to the Senator what some of the leaders have to say. 
   House Majority Leader DICK ARMEY, with whom we both served when we were in the House, said:  
   Medicare has no place in a free world. Social Security is a rotten trick. I think we're going to have to bite the bullet on Social Security and phase it out over time.  
   I could read a statement from former leader Bob Dole, from House Speaker Gingrich. 
   The point is, Lionel Van Deerlin is right on target because Republicans did not vote for Social Security to begin with. And they still hate it.

   Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from California, we came to the House together in 1982. I had never seen you before until the day we had our orientation. We have served together in the House of Representatives and the Senate. You and I have been involved in some very tough campaigns over the years. I have always been so proud of the Senator from California, because it doesn't matter if you are speaking to the League of Women Voters or to a high school class, whoever you are speaking to, you say the same thing in response to the same question. 
   You have had tough, hard campaigns, but you have never deviated from what you believe in. It has caused you some heartache and heartburn because they have been tough decisions. That is why I am so upset and feel so oppressed, put upon, and don't know what to do about these ads running all over the country. 
   You can have tough campaigns. A person can run against BARBARA BOXER. A person can speak out against BARBARA BOXER on an issue because they disagree with how you feel on that issue. That is what government is all about. That is what governing is all about. But not to come up with, we love Social Security and the Democrats are trying to destroy it. That, I am sorry to say, is not fair. It is not right. It is dishonest. It is wrong. This is what a totalitarian government is all about. If you tell a lie long enough, people might believe it.  
   I hope the American people will not believe the lie being perpetrated around this country by the Republicans saying Democrats are trying to destroy Social Security. We founded Social Security. Just as Congressman Van Deerlin said, we did it on the votes of Democrats. We have saved Social Security. We are the ones who stopped it from being placed in the constitutional amendment to balance the budget, where they would raid the funds more. What is happening around the country is distasteful. It is wrong. It is dishonest. It is repugnant. Somebody should speak out against it. That is why you are here today.

The fact is, somebody may have a different lifestyle with which someone doesn't agree. People every day are being hurt in America. 
   There may be people who disagree with what we want to do with this hate crimes legislation. But in the light of the Senate, couldn't we have a debate on it?

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, I appreciate his candor. I appreciate the Senator indicating he doesn't  think there is anything wrong with it. Either do we. That is what this is about. 
   The majority, the Republicans, have a lockbox proposal; and we do, too. What we think should happen is the Republicans offer their proposal, we offer ours, we have a debate. That is what this body is all about. 
   I have followed the short career in the Senate of the Senator from Illinois. I have acknowledged and appreciated some tough votes the Senator has cast against the majority in opposition to most of the people on the Senator's side of the aisle. I think that is good. 
   The Social Security debate is one where we should be honest with one another. There are ads running around America sponsored by the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee and the RNC, Republican National Committee, that say with this Congress, this year, the Democrats are spending Social Security money. 
   We have done our best to make the point that is simply not true, and I believe there are people of good will, of which I think the Senator from Illinois has the ability to be one of those, to speak out against those ads. They add nothing to the political process. They only take away from it. 
   That is the point we have been talking about today. The ads are disingenuous. They are wrong.

   Mr. REID. My friend from Illinois learns quickly. The fact is, that is not how this body has run in the past. For over 200 years, this body has been able to survive in comity. We recognize the minority has rights. There was a time not long ago when the Democrats had a veto-proof majority in the body but the Republicans were not treated badly. 
   I say to my friend from Illinois, Democrats have voted against no lockbox provision. We have voted to sustain our rights to be able to offer an amendment to the Senator's lockbox proposal so there could be a debate. If, in fact, the Senator thinks those ads are running because we voted against lockbox, I respectfully submit the Senator needs to study the issue more.

   Mr. REID. That is the whole point. The rules have not changed. 
   The fact is, however, the majority is not treating this body in the senatorial tradition. The rules have held that we in the Senate have the right to offer amendments. This body is being treated like a House of Representatives where a bill comes upon the floor, there is a rule offered, and that is it. The so-called tree is filled up, we can offer no amendments, and we are locked out of offering amendments. 
   That is what the Senator from South Carolina has been saying. All we want is to offer amendments. Shouldn't the Senate of the United States be able to have a debate on minimum wage?

   Mr. REID. I have the greatest respect for my friend's intellect. We have had just one vote this year on minimum wage. We didn't have one last year. Or the year before. 
   We want to have a debate. We want to have an amendment offered where we raise minimum wage. We have not had the opportunity to do that. If the majority doesn't agree, fine. The Senator from South Carolina said he would agree to a 10-minute time limit on minimum wage. I am not sure I can agree to 10 minutes, but I certainly agree to 2 hours. 
   I say to my friend from Illinois, picking that one issue, doesn't the Senator think it would be appropriate this body debate minimum wage?

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield, I do have a question. I personally am in agreement with the different issues the Senator has raised--campaign finance reform, minimum wage, being able to 
   amend bills. I agree with the Senator in that regard. 
   However, the Senator from Texas and I have a matter on the floor. I ask the Senator about how much longer he will speak. I know the Senator has a lot of capacity, but if he could give an idea so we could either interrupt at this time or come back at whatever time the Senator indicates.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I was born and raised on the southern tip of the State of Nevada, in a little mining town called Searchlight. When I grew up, there wasn't a single telephone anyplace in the town. No one had a telephone. In the home I was raised in, there was no hot water. We had no indoor toilets; they were outdoor toilets. It was primitive--well, I would not say primitive, but we weren't very modern there. That is the way it was with a lot of people in rural Nevada at that time. 
   Today, it is hard for me to comprehend what has taken place in the advancement of science. I can go home at night and see if I have received any e-mail on my computer. It is easy to do. I open my computer and it says, ``You've got mail.'' I open that up and find out who has contacted me by e-mail, and it is like magic. I press a button and I can reply to that person as quickly as I can type that message out. That message is sent quicker, of course, than the speed of light. It is gone. It is amazing. I can check to find out the weather on my computer. I can communicate and buy a CD, or anything else I want, on my computer. I can't imagine how that can happen, but it happens. 
   I rise today in total awe of what is happening in science and technology in America. The amendment I have offered is an amendment that is critical to maintaining our Nation's lead in the high-tech sector. Specifically, this amendment is crucial to the computer industry, the industry that allows me to communicate, for example, with all five of my children. It is easy to do. It is easier to do than seeing if they are home by virtue of a telephone. It is easier to do because it is very convenient. They can send me a message when I want a message sent. I can send them a message when I have the time. I can have a good time with my children over the Internet. I sent one of my boys, who is the athlete of the family, an e-mail last weekend saying that I think the Redskins are going to do well if they get a new coach. He was an athlete at the University of Virginia. It is the first time I can remember that the University of Virginia soccer team has not been ranked in the top 10; they are in the top 20. I suggested to my son that it might not be a bad idea to get a new coach for the soccer team at Virginia. 
   This is done so quickly. He will communicate back to me when he has the time. I am in total awe of what is going on in the high-tech sector. 
   This amendment relates to an issue I have been interested in for quite a long time and, in particular, have done a lot of work on this session with some of my colleagues. What I am concerned about is bipartisanship. For once in this legislative session, we are doing something that is bipartisan. I have to say it appears the underlying bill is generally bipartisan, even though some disagree with it. 
   I want to talk about the U.S. computer industry. According to an article in Computers Today, one of the many computer trade journals, dated July of last year, American computer technology has led the world since the first commercial electronic computer was employed at the University of Pennsylvania in 1946. The advancements that have been made are unbelievable. I can remember, before I came back to Washington, going to the Clark County Courthouse and being shown around by the person who was in charge of the computers for the county. It was a whole floor of that large building. Of course, it had to be really cold because computers needed constant cool 
   temperatures. Well, today, what was done on the whole floor of that Clark County Courthouse can be done on a computer the size of a briefcase. 
   The industry is constantly changing with new companies and new products emerging every day. A statistic I find fascinating is that more than 75 percent of the revenues of computer companies comes from products that didn't exist 2 years ago. That statistic shows they will continue to grow and change rapidly. 
   Through research and development that is largely due to another issue I have strongly favored, the research and development tax credit--and I think it should be permanent--the computer industry has been able to remain competitive for these many years. The challenge we now face is a challenge that, frankly, we haven't lived up to in the past as a Congress, and that is to allow our export control policies to change with the times and not to overly restrict our Nation's computer companies. 
   In the free enterprise system, entrepreneurs have never been so in charge of what is going on than in the computer industry. They have led this Nation forward economically. We have to give them the freedom that they can continue, in this free enterprise system, to sell the product. We need to stop trying to control technology by politics. We have to start controlling technology by allowing the businesses to go forward. The technology we are regulating, computers with performance levels of 2,000 to 7,000 millions of theoretical operations per second, or MTOPS, is readily available from many foreign companies. Companies from countries such as China and other tier III countries are moving into this field rapidly. 
   Not too long ago, I secured funding through Congress for a supercomputer at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas. We were so proud of that computer. It required its own room. It is now about as powerful as my laptop computer. The supercomputer is no longer the same supercomputer it was then, in 1988 or 1989, when it came to UNLV. That is exactly, though, the kind of computers we are still regulating politically. 
   Computers that are now considered supercomputers operate more than 1 million MTOPS, or about 500 times the current level of regulation. Last month, Apple began producing a computer that exceeds the current threshold and, as a result, Apple is unable to sell its new G4 computer systems in over 50 countries. 
   The bottom line is that by placing artificially low limits on the level of technology that can be exported, we may be denying market realities and could very quickly cripple America's global competitiveness for this vital industry. If Congress doesn't act quickly, we will substantially disadvantage American companies in an extremely competitive global market. 
   On July 23, 1999, at my urging, and the urging of some of my colleagues, the President proposed changes to the U.S. export controls on high-performance computers. Since that announcement, the President's proposal has been floating around Congress for a mandated review period of 180 days, or 6 months. When the President made his proposal, the new levels would have been sufficient; however, we are still regulating under the old levels, and therefore hindering companies such as Apple from competing in tier III countries with other foreign companies. 
   The amendment I am offering simply reduces the congressional review period from 180 days to 30 days to complement the administration's easing export restrictions by amending the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998. 
   I would like to share an example of how outdated today's restrictions are. I was at a meeting recently where Michael Dell, President of Dell Computers, stood up and pulled from his hip holster a little pager. Under current export controls, this little pager, normally smaller than a computer mouse, can't be exported to tier III countries because it is considered a supercomputer. That is wrong. 
   I am going to withdraw my amendment. I am going to do it because I have had conversations with the chairman of the Banking Committee. I fortuitously was able to have lunch with the ranking member of the Banking Committee, and I met also with Senator ENZI, who has worked very hard on this issue, and also Senator JOHNSON, who has worked very hard on this issue. They indicated they are very impressed with the need to change this time period. They want to do it under the Export Administration Act. I, frankly, have been convinced by them that their intentions are well considered. They have thought this out over a long period of time. I want to work with them and the majority leader and the minority leader to do whatever we can to, this year, move the Export Administration Act. It is vitally important that we do that. 
   We need to allow the entrepreneurs in America who have made this economy the vibrant, untiring economy that it is the freedom to sell their products because if we don't allow them to have that freedom to sell their  products, other foreign companies, some of which will be actually Americans moving over and setting up foreign companies, will be selling products that we should be selling with American-manufactured goods. 
   I am going to withdraw my amendment with the notice that I am going to work very hard with my friend, the chairman of the Banking Committee and the members of the Banking Committee to do whatever we can to move this very important piece of legislation. It is more than just my amendment. What the Banking Committee wants to move is more important than my amendment. I am concerned about the material that I have in this amendment. I think this is very important. 
   I look forward to working with the chairman of the Banking Committee and the other members of the Banking Committee to see what we can do to move the Export Administration Act in this Congress. With all the turmoil we have had in recent months with the partisanship, I believe we need to move this legislation in a bipartisan fashion. It can be done. We need to show the business community of America that we can move forward. 
   It is vitally important to everyone. The people who buy these products don't look to see who manufactures them, whether they are Democrats or Republicans. The people who work putting these computers together, no one knows whether they are Democrats or Republicans. But everyone knows when we have a good economy that we, the Congress, should get some consideration in a positive fashion for that. If something goes wrong, we deserve the blame. I think with things going so well we have to do everything we can to make sure the economy continues to move forward. 
   I am going to do what I can to help this piece of legislation that we hope will come up as early as this week or 
   next week and have it passed in this Congress and not next Congress. I mean this year of this Congress and not some subsequent year.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, last week Paul Laxalt and I were talking about some general items, and the name JOHN CHAFEE came up. We had a pleasant visit, Senator Laxalt and I, talking about JOHN CHAFEE, talking about how much we liked him, what a good guy he was, what a good friend of ours he was. In my opinion, the United States has lost one of its true heroes. JOHN CHAFEE died last night. I say this not simply to honor his time in the Senate, where he served with distinction for 23 years; I say it because of the way JOHN CHAFEE lived his life. 
   From a very young age, he showed the characteristics of leadership he went on to display throughout his whole life. When JOHN was only 11 years old, he saved the life of a young boy who had fallen into a frozen pond where they were playing hockey. Everyone else stood around. Little JOHN CHAFEE went into the water to save this boy's life. 
   He was a student at Yale during the Second World War. He had completed 3 years of school at Yale when he joined the U.S. Marine Corps to go fight for his country, and fight for his country he did. On his 20th birthday, he participated in the invasion of Guadalcanal--a marine who served with distinction in the Second World War. 
   The definitive book written about the Korean War is a book called ``The Coldest War,'' written by a man named Brady. The hero of that book is JOHN CHAFEE, a captain in the U.S. Marine Corps during that coldest war. I have spoken on any number of occasions about JOHN CHAFEE, about what a hero he was to me and to the rest of the country. I am happy to do that today so this RECORD can be spread throughout the Senate for his family, his staff, and many, many friends.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have enjoyed working with the Senator from Kentucky on this issue. He is certainly an expert at what is going on in the Senate. But I do say respectfully, he has over the years decided that the best defense is a good offense. Certainly, that is what he has done. One of  the biggest targets he has talked about during the last few days is the Democrats having stopped the Republicans from offering amendments to this bill. It is simply not true, as indicated by the fact the Senator from Minnesota offered an amendment yesterday. There was still room to offer three or four amendments. 
   It was chosen as a matter of tactics not to offer amendments and then talk about the fact they were not able to offer amendments. In fact, the majority could have offered all the amendments they wanted. They say, if cloture was invoked, the amendments would fail, well, that is the way it always works around here. 
   We simply wanted a vote on the two issues before this body: The House passed Shays-Meehan bill; and the so-called ``McCain-Feingold lite''--that is, to ban soft money. 
   That is what the debate has been about, an effort to avoid an up-or-down vote on those two very important issues that the American public deserve to have heard. 
   There was no holding pattern; the holding pattern was generated by the majority themselves, as indicated by the actions taken by the majority. 
   This is just the culmination of a number of things that we have around here. When the going gets tough, we go off the issue. The going was just getting tough on this issue. My friend from Kentucky can spin things; he is very good at that. Of course, everyone knows the Senator from Wisconsin and Senator MCCAIN have picked up eight Republicans we never had before. When the first votes took place on this issue, Senator BYRD was majority leader, we tried to invoke cloture seven times. The Democrats voted to invoke cloture on campaign finance reform, but we didn't have the support of Republicans, generally speaking--certainly not eight. We now have that. 
   I say to my friend from Kentucky, he can spin it however he sees proper, but the numbers don't lie. We are picking up Republican Senators every time we have a vote on this issue. We have eight now. That is a victory for campaign finance reform. 
   This debate should go forward, not be stopped now. As our Democratic leader further announced earlier today, there are issues we need to be talking about. We should be talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights--a real Patients' Bill of Rights, not the ``Patient Bill of Wrongs'' passed out of this body. We should pass a Patients' Bill of Rights as the House of Representatives did. 
   Minimum wage. Minimum wage is not for teenagers flipping hamburgers at McDonald's. People earn their living with minimum wage. Mr. President, 65 percent of the people drawing minimum wage are women; for 40 percent of those women, that is the only money they get for their families. Minimum wage is an issue we should be out speaking on today, now. 
   Juvenile justice: We have been waiting for 5 months for that conference to be completed. It is not close to being done. 
   Medicare: We talked about Medicare. We go home and we know the problems with Medicare. We did some things with the balanced budget amendment that we need to correct. We should be working on that right now. 
   Any time we have something important that is a little difficult, we walk away from it, just as we walked away from one of the most important treaty's to come before the Senate, the Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty. We had 24 Republicans that signed a letter saying they thought the treaty should not be acted on at this time, however, when the vote came, they all walked away. The fact of the matter is if they didn't like it in its present form, shouldn't we have had a debate on the Senate floor and maybe make some changes to it--just not vote it down. 
   We were prevented from doing that. 
   So I believe we should go forward on this most important issue. This is the fourth time during this debate I have had the duty of managing, on the minority side, this bill, this most important campaign finance reform. This is the fourth time I have said this, and if I have the opportunity I will say it four more times. 
   The State of Nevada has less than 2 million people. In the campaign between HARRY REID and John Ensign almost a year ago, we don't know how much money was spent, but we know between the State party and Reid and Ensign campaigns we spent over $20 million. That does not count the independent expenditures. We do not know how much they were. John Ensign and I estimate it was probably about $3 million in ads run for and against us. If you use no other example in America than the Reid-Ensign race of last year, that is a reason to take a real, strong, close look at campaign finance reform. 
   Maybe after the two measures see the light of day and amendments are offered and we have a full debate, maybe they would be voted down. But should not we at least have that opportunity? I think after what happened in Nevada, if in no other place in America, we deserve a full airing of campaign finance reform. How in the world can you justify spending, in the State of Nevada, the money that was spent in that race? John Ensign and HARRY REID have said to each other, and said publicly: We never had a chance to campaign against each other for ourselves. We were buried by all this outside soft money. 
   Campaign finance reform, Patients' Bill of Rights, minimum wage, juvenile justice, Medicare--there are a lot of other things we should be debating. But right now--today, this week --in the Senate, we should be spending more time on campaign finance reform. 
   I say, as I have said on a number of occasions, I greatly appreciate the efforts of my friend from Wisconsin. Here is a person who put his career on the line for a matter of principle. He was the original sponsor of McCain-Feingold. In the election that occurred last year, he almost lost the election because he was buried by soft money. As a matter of principle, RUSS FEINGOLD refused to allow anyone to use soft money in the State of Wisconsin for his benefit. He offended people by saying: I know you are trying to help me, but I will not allow you to bring soft money in the State of Wisconsin as a matter of principle. He is still here. I have great admiration for him. I think what he has done for the people of the State of Wisconsin and this country is commendable. 
   If for no other reason, I believe he deserves a full debate in this. Of course he is joined with the Senator from Arizona. 
   We need to go forward on this issue. Personally, as has been indicated, I have supported the next measure the majority leader wants to bring up. But if I have an opportunity to vote on whether or not we are going to proceed to partial-birth abortion, I will vote no, even though I am a supporter of that legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sorry my friend from Utah last left the floor. The fact is, the political balance of power is already heavily tilted toward corporations, 
   by any study that you find. The fact is, in the last election cycle corporate interests spent about $700 million in political contributions. That is 11 times more than what unions spent. And they did not get the permission of their stockholders. While unions contributed less than 4 percent of the $1.6 billion raised by candidates and parties in 1996, corporations contributed over 40 percent. 
   So the disparity between corporate and union spending is not static; it is growing. In the next election cycle, instead of 11 to 1, it will probably be 14 to 1. What is so disconcerting about this is for this so-called soft money, it is even wider. 
   While both corporations and unions have increased their unrestricted so-called soft money contributions, since 1992 corporate spending has grown twice as fast. In 1996, as an example, corporations spent more than $176 million--19 times more than what the unions spent. 
   There is all this talk about the unions that represent the working men and women of this country spending 4 percent of what is spent in political campaigns. I think it is too bad that working men and women in this country do not have more of a representation. It is getting worse. That is why this legislation is before this body. 
   I think it is important at this time to recognize the work done by Senator FEINGOLD in making this an issue before the people of America. I applaud and congratulate Senator FEINGOLD for his position based upon what he believes is principle. 
   He not only talks the game; he lives the game, as indicated in his most recent election. While all over America people were spending huge amounts of soft money, and it was being spent in Wisconsin against Senator FEINGOLD, he refused to take any money even though it was available to him. 
   So I take this opportunity to say, first of all, let's bring in to proper perspective the disparity between corporate spending and union spending and also to congratulate my friend from the State of Wisconsin.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Alabama, if we took into consideration State and local races, the corporate skew would be even further out of whack because unions do get involved in local campaigns. But it is usually through the grassroots level 
   and very rarely is it money; where the corporations very rarely are involved in the grassroots activities and are always involved in the money. 
   So if we added all that, the number may even be more than 11 times more than what the unions spent.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend the numbers that he has, I don't know from where they came. I do state that in America we have far too much money being spent, soft money and other kinds of money. The point I was trying to make in my statement in response to my friend from Utah is the fact that corporate spending, by any number you pick, is far out of whack with union spending, whether it is 19 times more or 11 times more. We all acknowledge it is a growing disparity. 
   The fact is, what is being attempted by my friend from the State of Wisconsin is to stop the flow of all this soft money. 
   The fact is, there is a lot of talk about union money coming from working men and women in this country. Remember, corporate money is also money that represents shareholders. Certainly, they get no say in how that money is spent. 
   So I suggest that before we start picking on organized labor, remember, is there anything wrong with the nurses of America, who are included in these numbers--the AFL-CIO, teachers, carpenters, cement finishers--being represented? The answer is, they should be able to be involved in campaigns just as much as somebody who represents tobacco interests and the very large health care industry in America. So they, too, need a voice. 
   I am glad that voice is being represented by this side of the aisle. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

Is the Senator aware of that? The Senator from Arizona has indicated and I may be paraphrasing the words; that there were games being played and Senators were not being allowed to offer amendments. 
   I say to my friend from Arizona, the Senator from Minnesota offered an amendment today. Amendments could have been offered Friday. Will the Senator acknowledge that having the two amendments, one being ``McCain-Feingold lite'' and the original version of the McCain-Feingold bill, that we should be able in this body to vote on both those matters?

I say to my friend from Arizona, I have stated publicly and privately, both outside these Chambers and inside these Chambers, about the work that is being done by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, and indeed it has been a tremendous effort bringing this very important issue before this body. You have been undying in your efforts to bring this forward. You would acknowledge, would you not, that there are others in this body, other than the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona, who believe strongly that there should be some campaign finance reform?

   Mr. REID. I guess the point I want to make is that I am not sure I can put my many efforts on behalf of campaign finance reform next to that of the Senator from Arizona. He has done so much to move this issue forward. But I would say to my friend from Arizona--and I would like the Senator to either acknowledge whether or not this Senator believes strongly that there should be campaign finance reform. Even though my qualifications for asserting the need for campaign finance reform would not meet those of the Senator from Arizona, I think I am in the top 10 of members of this body who have been a strong advocate for reform. For example, I have given speeches on the Senate floor, since I came here with the Senator from Arizona in 1986, about the need for campaign finance reform. Would the Senator acknowledge that?

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New Jersey, in the election that was held in the State of Nevada last year, Congressman Ensign and Senator REID never really campaigned because of all the outside influences. Our campaigns were buried in all these independent expenditures and State party expenditures. 
   At least with my campaign, and that of the State party, anyone in the world can find out how much money was spent. But for the independent expenditures, no one in the world can find out what money was spent.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, in the election of 1986, when Senator BRYAN was elected to the Senate, he was a sitting Governor at the time. At that time, there were these ads that came from nowhere, hundreds of thousands of dollars of ads in the State of Nevada. These ads were talking about Social Security. 
   One would think these ads were run by some organization that had some concern about Social Security. We learned later that those ads were being paid for by foreign auto dealers--talking about the United States of America's Social Security plan. That is what happens when these groups have unfettered, 
   unrestricted ability to spend money on any subject they want for any cause they want.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend in conclusion--and I appreciate his allowing me to ask him a question or two--first of all, I hope beyond all hope the Shays-Meehan bill passes. That is the amendment that has been filed by our leader, the Democratic leader. I hope that passes. I am going to do everything I can to make sure that passes. I hope we have Republicans of goodwill who will support that legislation. 
   I have offered another amendment that would eliminate soft money. I respect and appreciate what the Senator from New Jersey has said. Certainly there is merit to what he said. But I believe, as I think does most everyone in the Democratic conference, that even if Shays-Meehan for some reason fails, there will be a significant number of us, out of desperation regarding the system that is so bad in this country, who will support the so-called soft money ban. I hope we do not get to that. I hope Shays-Meehan passes. The Senator makes a compelling case for what might happen. I hope something short of that will happen and the soft money ban will bring some reality to the system.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the amendment, which I personally haven't seen, but I am sure has been shared with the staff, we have not had an opportunity to discuss, to even show the amendment to the ranking member of the Commerce Committee, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, both of whom are tremendously interested in anything dealing with the Internet. First of all, to lock in a time, that is something we couldn't do. 
   Secondly, I say to my friend from Kentucky, there are no more votes until 5:30. That is an announcement made by the majority leader. So we are not stopping anyone from voting. That decision has been made by the majority. We would have been happy to stay and vote. I have been here the last several days anyway. If there had been some notice there would be votes, other people would be here. 
   I say there is ample opportunity to talk about any of these issues in whatever length anyone cares to. We have a vote scheduled at 5:30 on a judicial nomination or whatever the 
   majority leader decides. We have cloture votes that are going to take place on Tuesday. I think we have plenty to do on this. 
   I might say in passing that I think now the majority knows how we feel all the time when we can't offer amendments to pending legislation. On this legislation, we have two amendments that have been filed: One dealing with the Shays-Meehan legislation, and one dealing with the so-called soft money amendment. That is what this debate is all about. That is what it should focus on. Objection is heard.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend from Montana leaves for Montana, he can offer his amendment. The Senator from Utah can offer his amendment to two slots to which I previously referred. If they are subsequently adopted, they could try to defeat, of course, the Daschle-Reid amendments by votes, or after the Reid amendment is disposed of, they could still offer their amendments to the Daschle amendment. In short, there are occasions in the Senate when it doesn't work by majority rule but most of the time majority rules. In this instance, the majority rules. All they need to do is pass this amendment and defeat the Reid-Daschle amendment. 
   It is a very simple procedure. They can offer their amendments. They not only can talk about them but they can offer both of them. 
   Remember the procedure we are now working under. There will be no votes this day or on Monday until 5:30. We will come in sometime Monday. There will be further discussion on this bill. There are people on my side of the aisle, on the minority side, who still want to talk about the bill. 
   Also, there has been some talk about pulling down this bill on Tuesday. Of course, it is 5 days. I know the majority leader recognizes the fifth day is on Wednesday. But also, you can't automatically go to something else. It takes, again, a majority vote to do that. 
   As I have indicated, all they need are majority votes to adopt the Burns amendment and the Bennett amendment and have a majority vote to go to some other issue rather than campaign finance reform. 
   We are operating, we think, in good faith. There are still two spots to offer their amendments. If there are two Senators who wish to offer their amendments, they can certainly do that.

   Mr. REID. The campaign went on for a long time. The television money was spent, of course, in a relatively short period of time. 
   I do not know if my colleague is aware that my opponent, John Ensign, and I talked on several occasions. Even though there was that much money spent on the campaign, we never campaigned against each other. There were all these outside interests. We never had a chance to campaign for ourselves. 
   So I would say if there is no other example given on the floor of the Senate regarding campaign finance reform, all you have to do is look at the relatively sparsely populated State of Nevada and there is a compelling reason we need to do something about the present campaign system in America.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friends from Arizona and Virginia that we will try to speak now and even out the time. 
   Mr. President, I give myself such time as I may consume. 
   We have heard a lot about nuclear testing recently, but no one has experienced nuclear testing as has the State of Nevada. Just a few miles from Las Vegas is the Nevada Test Site. There we have had almost 1,000 tests, some above ground and some below ground. You can travel to the Nevada Test Site now and go and look at these test sites. You can see where the above-ground tests have taken place. You can drive by one place where bleachers are still standing where people--press and others--would come and sit to watch the nuclear tests in the valley below. You can see some of the buildings that still are standing following a nuclear test. You can see large tunnels that are still in existence where scores and scores of tests were set off in the same tunnels. You can go and look at very deep shafts where underground tests were set off. 
   The State of Nevada understands nuclear testing. At one time, more than 11,000 people were employed in the Nevada desert dealing with nuclear testing. Now, as a result of several administrations making a decision to no longer test nuclear weapons, there are only a little over 2,000 people there. Those 2,000 people are there by virtue of an Executive order saying we have to be ready if tests are deemed necessary in the national interest. So the Nevada Test Site is still there. The people are standing by in case there is a need for the test site to again be used. 
   The cessation of testing caused the largest percentage reduction of defense-related jobs in any Department of Energy facility. Today, as I indicated,  there are a little over 2,000 of those jobs. 
   The State of Nevada is very proud of what we have done for the security of this Nation. Not only have we had the above-ground nuclear tests and the below-ground nuclear tests, but we have Nellis Air Force Base which is the premier fighter training center for the U.S. Air Force--in fact, it is the premier fighter training center for all allied forces around the world. I had a meeting recently with the general who runs Nellis Air Force Base. He was preparing for the German Air Force to come to Las Vegas to be involved in the training systems available for fighting the enemy in fighter planes. 
   Also, 400 miles from Las Vegas and Nellis Air Force Gunnery Range, you have Fallon Naval Air Station. It is the same type of training facility, not for the Air Force but the Navy. Virtually every pilot who lands on a carrier has been trained at Fallon. It is the premier fighter training center for naval aircraft--Fallon Naval Air Station. 
   There are many other facilities that have been used over the years. Today, we have Indian Springs Air Force Base which is 50 miles out of Las Vegas--actually less than that--where they are testing drones, the unmanned aircraft. So we have given a lot to the security of this Nation; we continue to do so. 
   When we talk about nuclear testing, I can remember as a young boy, I was raised 60 miles from Las Vegas. 
   We were probably 125 miles from where the actual detonations took place. We would get up early in the morning at my home in Searchlight and watch these tests. They would announce when the tests were coming. 
   We always saw the flash of light with the above-ground tests. Sometimes we did not hear the sound because it would sometimes bounce over us. 
   We were the lucky ones, though, because the winds never blew toward Searchlight or Las Vegas. The winds blew toward southern Utah and Lincoln County in Nevada. 
   As a result of these above-ground tests, many people developed radiation sickness. They did not know it at the time. People did not understand what fallout was all about. 
   Yes, in Nevada, we understand nuclear testing as well as anyone in the world. 
   Nevada is going to continue its national service whether this treaty is ratified or not. We have already stopped testing in the traditional sense. 
   I want everyone to understand that even though I am a supporter of this treaty, I believe it would be much better, rather than having everyone march in here tonight and vote up or down on this treaty, that we spend some more time talking about it. I am convinced it is a good thing for this country, a good thing for this Nation, but I have some questions. We should answer some questions. 
   I have the good fortune of serving on the Energy and Water Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I am the ranking Democrat on that subcommittee, with the head Republican on the subcommittee, Senator DOMENICI of New Mexico. It is our responsibility to appropriate the money for the nuclear defense capabilities of this country. We do that. We spend billions of dollars every year. 
   One of the things we have tried to do, recognizing we do not have traditional testing--that is underground testing or above-ground testing; of course, we do not do above-ground testing--is to provide other ways to make sure our nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. No matter what we have done in the past, we have to make sure our weapons are safe and reliable. 
   How can we do that? We are attempting in this country to do the right thing. We have the Stockpile Stewardship Program under which we are conducting tests now. They are not explosions. We are doing it through computers. We have some names for some of our tests. 
   One of them is subcritical testing. What does that mean? It means we set off an explosion involving nuclear materials, but before the material becomes critical, we stop it. There is no nuclear yield. Then through computerization, in effect, we try to determine what would have happened had this test gone critical. That is an expensive program, but it is a program that is absolutely necessary, again, for the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. 
   About 2 years ago, I gave a statement before our subcommittee. This was a statement on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on which we had a hearing. In that statement, I wrote about the loss of confidence in new weapons that could not be tested under the treaty and how this loss of confidence would prevent recurrence of the costly and dangerous nuclear arms race of the past 50 years. 
   I wrote about the confidence between former adversaries that would come from the treaty because no longer would we or they have to worry about significant new imbalances in deterrent forces, because no new weapons could be built. 
   I wrote about how that confidence would lead to more and more reductions in nuclear stockpiles and move the world even further away from nuclear annihilation. 
   I wrote about how the international example of refraining from nuclear testing, along with stockpile reductions, would reduce the 
   incentives for non-nuclear states to develop nuclear weapons. 
   I did not write 2 years ago about the upcoming Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty review conference in which only states that have ratified the treaty will have effective membership. 
   That review conference will be able to change the conditions under which the treaty goes into force, and the United States, I am sorry to report, will have no place at that table unless the treaty is ratified by this Senate before that conference. 
   I wrote about more than the benefits of this treaty. I also wrote about some of its uncertainties and some of the concerns, I believe, we need to study and review, and about the debate that is needed for their resolution. 
   I pointed out that a prohibition against any and all nuclear explosions would reduce confidence in stockpile reliability and safety unless some other means was developed to maintain that confidence. 
   I noted that the Stockpile Stewardship Program was conceived to provide that other means. We have had 2 years of experience with this program, but I wrote about the uncertainties faced by science-based stockpile stewardship. I noted the plan depends critically on dramatic increases in computational capability. That is why in our subcommittee we have worked very hard to spend hard-earned tax dollars to develop better computers. The development of computers is going on around the world, but no place is it going on at a more rapid pace than with the money we have provided through this subcommittee. We are doing it because we believe through computerization, we can have a more safe and more reliable stockpile. 
   It is only through, as I wrote, these dramatic increases in computational capability and equally dramatic increases in resolution with which non-nuclear experiments can be measured that we can go forward with certainty of having a safe and reliable nuclear stockpile. 
   I noted persistent support by Congress and the administration was absolutely necessary, not on a short-term basis but on a long-term basis. I noted Congress and the administration had to support the science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program; that we must set the pattern for the world; it can be done, and we can do it. 
   I did say that the support of Congress and the administration was absolutely necessary but not necessarily sufficient because the stewardship program is being developed at the same time that its architects are learning more about it. It is a study in progress. I wrote then, and I believe now, the learning process will continue. 
   I pointed out that the test ban treaty would not prevent nuclear weapons development. It would only inhibit the military significance of such development. We are not going to develop new weapons. We have not developed new weapons. 
   Let's talk, for example, about what can be done. You can have the development of crude nuclear explosives that are difficult to deliver, but these could be developed with confidence without testing. We know, going back to the early days of things nuclear, that ``Fat Man'' had not been tested. That was the bomb that was dropped on Hiroshima. There was no test. It was a huge  weapon, as large as the side of a house. They had to build a pit in the runway to load it. They had to reconfigure the B-29 so it could drop this huge weapon, but it was not tested. 
   Stopping testing is not going to stop the development of nuclear weapons. Rogue nations and other nations can develop these weapons if they see fit. But these crude weapons will not upset the deterrent balance. 
   Also, some say the treaty would prevent the introduction of new modern weapons that could weaken strategic deterrence. For example, nations could not build sophisticated new weapons; they would be stuck with what they have. What they have may be good, may be bad. 
   I pointed out the treaty could not guarantee total cessation of nuclear testing because very low-yield tests and higher yield ``decoupled'' tests might not be detected with confidence. You could have small, very small tests. It would be very hard to detect. 
   You could also have the situation where a signatory nation could execute a high-yield ``unattended'' explosion. What does that mean? What it means is that for a high-yield ``unattended'' explosion in a clandestine operation--nobody could identify the signatory nation that was being noncompliant. 
   For example, let's say someone developed a nuclear device and secretly dropped it in the ocean and then left. When the device went off someplace deep in the ocean, the country that dropped it in the ocean could certainly know that it exploded. But others could not identify who did it. It would be very hard to develop or make a new stockpile doing it this way, but it is possible. There are ways around everything. 
   But in spite of all these things that you could throw up as ways to get around the treaty--the ``decoupled'' tests and dropping them in the ocean, of course, you can do those kinds of things--but in spite of that, the positive nature of this treaty far outweighs any of these things that I have mentioned. 
   I did say in that statement I made before our subcommittee that the United States takes its treaty obligations seriously. We would not in any manner do what I have just outlined. But other nations might conduct themselves in that fashion. You cannot conduct your foreign policy believing that everybody is going to do everything the right way. 
   I do say that in all of these areas of uncertainty, I wrote about the need of the United States for a prolonged, comprehensive investigation and debate. That is where we have failed. We should have had hearings that went over a period of years, not a few days. 
   It is through consultation and the testimony of experts, and debate among Members of this body and the other body, that the issues and questions can be properly framed, examined, and resolved.

We are to a point now where this bill could be completed but for this one contentious issue. From the very beginning, we have said this is an issue that deserves a lot of attention. We say, again, we are willing to work with the majority on this bill, but if this matter is here, we are going to have to discuss it. The American people, 600,000 a year, are injured with these accidents. It deserves more than 2 hours or 4 hours. I object.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, what this amendment would do is a number of things that are not good for working men and women. It would be an automatic suspension of the Davis-Bacon enforcement in areas where there have been disasters. It would mean hundreds of thousands of construction workers who typically go to these areas to work would lose the wage protections currently afforded them under the law. The President of the United States already has the authority to waive Davis-Bacon in the event of a national emergency. 
   So far this year disasters have been declared in 36 States, including Nevada. 
   This amendment is ill timed, ill advised, especially in light of the disasters that we had to deal with throughout the country.

   Mr. REID. I rise today to address an issue of great concern to me. I was recently made aware of the findings contained in a recent report from the Office of Research on Women's Health (ORWH) regarding gender-based differences in digestive diseases. The report identifies irritable bowel syndrome, functional bowel disorder and colorectal cancer treatment and detection as serious health problems that disproportionately affect women.

<DOCNO>106-reid-nv-7-19991007</DOCNO>

   Mr. REID. The ORWH report recommends that Federal research efforts focus on the need to: (1) develop a better understanding of the mechanisms of gastrointestinal motility and altered sensitivity to sensory dysfunction that will help explain why irritable bowel syndrome so disproportionately affects women more than men; (2) examine the relationship between hereditary colon cancer and gynecologic malignancy in women; and (3) determine the relationship between functional bowel diseases and pelvic floor dysfunction. As a result of these findings and recommendations, I hope that the Office on Women's Health will work with NIDDK to address these digestive diseases that so disproportionately affect women.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the manager of the bill, we are going to have to do that now. It would be appropriate if the debate started. We are in the process of checking to see who wants to speak against the pending amendment. 
   I say in response to my friend's statement earlier that we want to move this along. The staff has worked very well the last several days since we had our break. We are down now to about 16 amendments, give or take a few, both Democratic and Republican amendments. We have on our side agreed. We have time agreements on most of ours--not all of them but most of them. I think we can move forward on that basis. 
   I also say to my friend that I saw the Senator from Pennsylvania coming into the White House as I was leaving last night. I was invited down for a meeting. I should say to my friend that I had orange juice and some nuts. I see that he was served dinner. That is something I have to check into.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have here an interesting saga. It started when the House decided to add another month to the fiscal year. That caused a little bit of controversy, to say the least. Then last week they came up with a new proposal, and that is the earned-income tax credit, which Ronald Reagan said was the best antiwelfare program he had ever known. The Republicans in the House decided what they were going to do was slow down the payments of this, the best antiwelfare program ever. 
   This ran into a little bit of trouble, including the frontrunner for the Republican nomination for President, George W. Bush, who said he thought it was wrong to try to balance the budget on the backs of the poor. 
   Just a short time ago, they came up with a new proposal. That is what we are here to talk about today, an across-the-board cut. Of course, an across-the-board cut would be devastating. In fact, it was attacked immediately by the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee as a political blunder. He said: ``It's a mistake.  It sets a bad precedent. We have never done anything like that.'' This is the chairman, the Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee. So I think we should just step back and become more realistic and look at some reasonable offsets to fund Government the way it should be funded. 
   In this morning's Washington Post, in something called ``In The Loop'' by Al Kamen, he gave us the results of a little contest he held. He wanted to find out what people thought the new month should be named. Remember, the majority wants to extend the calendar year 1 month. Here are some of the names they have come up with. He said:  
   We weeded out some suggestions that came as many as 10 times, such as Porkuary or Porkcember, Debtuary or Debtember, Budgetary.......  
   But some of those he thinks were winners were: ``Abracadember'' which is, magic, It is like ``abracadabra.'' And then ``Payupuary'' was also declared a winner. This is clearly voodoo economics; one of the names that won was ``Voodoober.'' 
   We have another one that sounds pretty good--I certainly agree it should be declared a winner--``Gridlocked-ober,'' based upon the gridlock that occurred just a few years ago because of the Republicans shutting down the Government. Another one is ``Busta-cap-uary.'' This was submitted by a Member of the House of Representatives. 
   Another one that was not submitted by a Member of the House of Representatives, but probably should have been--is called ``DeLaypril,'' named after the House whip. 
   I think it is good to add a little bit of levity to what is going on. But the levity should end and we should get serious about getting rid of the appropriations bills. When I say get rid of them, I mean just that. We should get them so they can pass muster here and be signed by the President. The way things are going now, I think the President is going to veto almost every appropriations bill that is going to be sent to him. It is apparent to me the appropriations bills have too much magic in them and really are pieces of legislation that deserve these derogatory names. We must get serious and pass a budget the American people will accept. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, the Office of Management and Budget, in a meeting last night, indicated at least 9 percent. The House has a number of things in bills they have passed; they have declared those as emergencies. There are other matters that are double funded. For example, in order to pass this bill, there has been money taken from the Defense appropriations bill. There comes a time when we have to fund everything in realistic terms. As I have indicated, the Office of Management and Budget believes across-the-board cuts now would have to be about 9 percent.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to James Arthur Gay III, a pioneer black civic leader from Las Vegas. Through his tireless efforts, he was instrumental in the fight to desegregate Las Vegas. Jimmy Gay was one of the first black hotel executives in Las Vegas in the 1950s at a time when his longtime friends Sammy Davis Jr., Nat ``King'' Cole and others were not allowed to stay overnight in strip hotels. 
   Mr. Gay was one of the best known and respected local black leaders of his generation. Among his accomplishments are many ``firsts''. He was the  first black to obtain a mortician's license in the state of Nevada, the first black to be appointed to the Nevada Athletic Commission, and the first black in the United States to be certified as a water safety instructor by the Red Cross. He also was a national record holder in the 100-yard dash and an alternate on the 1936 U.S. Olympic track team. 
   Born in Fordyce, Arkansas in 1916, Jim was the youngest of three children. When he was just 3 years old, Jim was orphaned. Beginning his experience with work at age 7 as a house boy, Jim developed a strong commitment to work at an early age. He moved to Las Vegas in 1946 as a college-educated man having earned his degree from the University of Arkansas. Although he was educated and ambitious, getting a job in Las Vegas was virtually impossible at the time. He started out as a cook at Sills Drive-In, a popular restaurant in the area of Charleston and Las Vegas Boulevard working hard to prove himself. In the late 1940s, people became aware of Jimmy's many talents. Jim's first break in Las Vegas came when the city opened the Jefferson Recreation Center in West Las Vegas. He was hired as the Director and among other things also coached football, swimming and basketball. His break in business came when he was hired as the Sands hotel-casino Director of Communications which was one of the highest posts held by a black at that time. During this period, the Sands was one of the Las Vegas Strips finest. 
   In 1941, Jimmy married Hazel Gloster and together they raised a family of five children, 10 grand-children and 17 great-grandchildren. Always finding time for his community, he was an active member of the executive board of the NAACP. He also was active in local politics serving as a member of the Clark County Democratic Central Committee and on the executive board of Culinary Local 226. 
   Jimmy discovered the world of the hotel industry and opened opportunities for many. Over the years, Jimmy served as an executive at the Sands, Union Plaza, Fremont, Aladdin and Silverbird hotels. He earned the respect of many for his tireless efforts and his love for the city of Las Vegas. 
   Deservingly, the state of Nevada has honored Jimmy Gay by naming him a Distinguished Nevadan in 1988 and a few years before, the city of Las Vegas named a park after him. In 1985, the city of Las Vegas and the state of Nevada honored him with ``Jimmy Gay Day.'' For his civic efforts, Jimmy was named Las Vegas Jaycees Man of the Year in 1952 and received a City of Hope commendation in 1959. On numerous occasions he was named NAACP Man of the year. His contributions have not only left a lasting impression on many, but also served as an inspiration to generations of young people growing up in Nevada. Over the years, Jimmy helped many deserving black students receive scholarships to his alma mater. 
   It was once written that ``Some people walk through our life and leave after a few seconds. Others come in and stay there for a very long time leaving marks that will never be forgotten.'' Jimmy Gay is one of those whose legacy will remain for the countless Nevadans whose journey will be easier because of his pioneering efforts. Las Vegas is a better place because Jimmy Gay went above and beyond to advance the cause of social justice. The best one can hope for life is to make a difference with their time on earth. There is no doubt that Jimmy Gay made a tremendous difference. 
   On September 10, 1999 at the age of 83 Jimmy Gay died of complications of a stroke. He will be missed but will remain one of the most admired and respected local Las Vegas leaders to have graced the city. This U.S. Senator is a better person because of the friendship he enjoyed with Jimmy Gay and Nevada is a better state because of his lifelong effort to ensure equality for all.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, ``Prairie Home Companion'': My wife and I have enjoyed many Sunday afternoons listening to this great program on public radio. It lasts 2 hours; there is music, comedy, drama. It is a great program. It comes on public radio. 
   On public television, we all watched the series on the Civil War. I don't know if there was a more dramatic, a more effective presentation of history ever made on public broadcasting than of the Civil War. 
   It was tremendous. 
   Then several years later, the same person who produced the Civil War series produced a magnificent series on baseball, the history of baseball. It had pictures we had never seen, stories we had never heard, all on public broadcasting, all without any type of commercial interruption of any kind. 
   I watched on public broadcasting, public television, a presentation about the city of New York. I have been to the city of New York numerous times. Never did I see New York as it was shown in that program. I saw parts of New York I would never, ever be able to see. I understand New York better than I would have ever been able to understand New York as a result of that program on public television. 
   I am a fan of public broadcasting. I think America is a fan of public broadcasting. We can look back to the mid-1990s when Newt Gingrich took control of the House of Representatives and publicly proposed cutting all public broadcasting funds. 
   There has been an effort by public broadcasters to do all kinds of things to be able to meet the demands of their viewers. One of the things they have done--there is report language in this bill that I think is important, and that is to stand up and say what they have done as far as selling lists of their subscribers is wrong. We have public broadcasting selling lists to Democratic organizations; we have public broadcasting selling lists to Republican organizations. They were put up to bid, in effect, and that is wrong. The report that accompanies this bill says, in very strong terms, that was wrong. 
   It was wrong. I acknowledge that without any question. 
   But we have to decide whether we want to have a public broadcasting system or not have a public broadcasting system. Either we fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting so they can exist or we decide to end it. I prefer the former. I prefer that we fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. I suggest we increase funding as indicated in this amendment, this year, by $125 million. 
   I think it is important we talk about public broadcasting, what it does for this Nation. As long as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is leery of Congress cutting their funds--and certainly they should be--I suspect they will begin to sound more and more like private broadcasting stations. 
   There was one article in the Washington Post, written by a man named Frank Ahrens, in which there was substantial research about what has happened to public broadcasting. We find there has been a 700-percent increase in corporate funding over just the past few years, since Congressman Gingrich got involved in this. It is not just listeners who are noticing the change. Private stations, which are not tax exempt as are these public broadcasters, are voicing their concern about an increasingly uneven playing field--as well they should. 
   Why do they do that? They do it because corporate support has shifted radically in the past several years. In fact, at WAMU, which is a station here in Washington, the broadcasts of which we hear all over the country, the station president said it has gone up significantly. That is an understatement. 
   Bob Edwards, for those of us who listen to public broadcasting--and I listen to it in the morning more than any other time; I listen to the morning edition--he is even more blunt. Bob Edwards says:  
   Underwriting has kept us alive. 
   It has cut into our air time. If you have to read a 30-second underwriter credit, that's less news you can do.  
   That is an understatement. There is much less news that is done. Underwriting spots sound like commercials, a trend that troubles listeners, and recent surveys show this. 
   As this article indicates, the public is getting upset about this. In Boston, a radio station called WBUR has aggressively pursued corporate underwriting, as many stations around America have--in fact, they have all done this. It lists 315 corporate sponsors on its web site--1 radio station. 
   The corporations love to advertise on public radio. They believe demographically they have an audience that listens to their messages, understands their messages; many times they are well-educated, upper-middle-class listeners who have expensive tastes and, some say, the money to indulge them. Moreover, they trust public radio much more than listeners trust, perhaps, commercial radio. 
   We know on WAMU and other public radio stations, the Nuclear Energy Institute, the lobbying arm for the atomic power industry, has done a lot of advertising. This comes not from the Senator from Nevada but from this article from the Washington Post. With its ads, the Nuclear Energy Institute says, by using their slogan, ``Nuclear technology contributes to life in many ways you probably never thought of.'' 
   This upset listeners. There was a lot of complaining. As Bob Edwards, the host of the program indicated, there was an 
   e-mail campaign suggesting NPR was in the pocket of the nuclear industry. I personally do not think they are. But when this advertising takes place, people do not have to stretch really far to come to that conclusion. 
   The same radio station, WAMU, decided several years ago they were going to do a show sponsored by the National Agricultural Chemical Association which advertised its products as safe. People complained because some people do not like these chemicals that are put on crops. Calls came in suggesting the radio station was in the pocket of this chemical company. That is really not true, but people can draw that conclusion because of the advertising that takes place on public radio. 
   Still, public radio managers are concerned and they are inventing all kinds of ways to get around FCC rules. They are creating promotions with adjectives and lengthy explanations: ``the blue-chip company,'' ``18 million customers worldwide,'' and ``converting natural gas to sulfur-free synthetic fuels.'' These are some of the catchwords they are using to try to get around some of the FCC rules. 
   In this Congress, earlier this year, Congressman MARKEY from Massachusetts and Congressman TAUZIN from Louisiana drafted a bill that would tighten the FCC rules and also increase spending by as much as 60 percent for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. They were--I should not say forced; they decided on their own, I am sure, but as a result of all the publicity that was engendered as a result of learning these public broadcasting organizations were selling their subscribers' lists, they backed off this legislation. They said they were going to go forward with it soon. There is a sentiment all over America that we have to have either public broadcasting or commercial broadcasting. This mix is not working because the mix is coming out as commercial broadcasting. 
   It is not just lawmakers and listeners who are concerned and taking note of this advertising policy, but commercial radio stations are concerned. Public broadcasting is tax free. Commercial broadcasters believe it is unfair that public stations can air essentially the same advertising they do and not have to pay the same taxes. They are competing in a way that is unfair to commercial broadcasters. ``It's not an even playing field,'' says Jim Farley, the vice president for news at WTOP here in Washington.  
   I listen to WTOP. It is a great news station. I think if we are going to have public broadcasting, it should be public broadcasting. People should not have to guess whether or not it is a commercial station or it is public broadcasting. I agree with Jim Farley. It is not an even playing field. 
   The increased presence of corporate underwriters has led some listeners and even those within public radio to fear underwriters might influence the news coverage in segments they sponsor. There are not many other conclusions you can reach if, in fact, you are advertising some commercial product. 
   The reason people can come to that conclusion without a lot of stretch is, for example, ``Marketplace,'' which is a public radio program, aired stories about General Electric being indicted for price fixing but ignored a 1990 boycott of the company by the people who objected to its participation in the nuclear weapons industry. 
   Why did some people come to that conclusion? Because General Electric provides more than 25 percent of the funding for this program. There was no other conclusion one could reach. The show's general manager now calls the fact they did not run stories about this boycott a lapse, a mistake. I submit, we should not have these problems with public broadcasting. 
   My amendment simply says if we are going to have public broadcasting, we should have public broadcasting. Even though this money I am suggesting we vote for is not enough to solve all the problems, it is a step in the right direction and will take some of the pressure off public broadcasting. 
   This is money well spent. It is important we in America feel good about our public broadcasting. I submit that programs such as ``Prairie Home Companion,'' the series on the Civil War and baseball and New York and a multitude of other programs we have all enjoyed should continue without commercial interruption. 
   I believe we should adequately fund this organization. Whether it is adequate funding or not is something we can all debate, but it is at least a step in the direction of giving public broadcasting a shot in the arm, funding which has been taken from them as a result of the activities of Congress since 1995. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the manager of this bill and the Senator from Iowa have done a good job in constructing this $91.7 billion bill, and they have included things regarding health and education. There is nothing more educational for the American public than to do a good job for public broadcasting. 
   As I said earlier, the sales of the donor lists were brought about because of the financial pressure on these institutions. I do not condone that, and I agree with the language of the report which does not condone that. 
   I suggest this is money well spent out of $91.7 billion. This money is a mere pittance and it would be very important to spend to help the American public. 
   I ask unanimous consent that the actual vote on this amendment not take place until there is an agreement between the two leaders as to when it should take place.

So we hope everyone, especially the staffs who are listening, will take that into consideration, as I am sure they are--that consideration will be given to the submission of amendments, working under the time constraints we have.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I did not want to get into a ``who did this; who did not do that.'' I acknowledge, selling the lists was wrong. The fact is, though, that PBS stations made these lists available to both parties. Without getting too partisan, we know the Bush family has made their lists available to groups, also. These groups include the  Citizens for a Sound Economy and the Heritage Foundation. These are certainly if not Republican organizations, I would clearly say, Republican-leaning organizations. 
   I also think it is important to note we are talking about the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. And the Corporation for Public Broadcasting has a policy----

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, if Members of the Senate have enjoyed and appreciated ``Prairie Home Companion,'' the great work of Ken Burns' ``Civil War,'' ``Baseball''--and now he is doing a new one on Susan B. Anthony and Liz Stanton dealing with the women's movement--and if they have enjoyed with their children ``Sesame Street,'' which is Big Bird and Elmo, then every person in the Senate should support my amendment. 
   We want to keep public broadcasting public and not commercial broadcasting. We do not want it, like most everything else in America, to be commercialized. Our children and the rest of America at least deserve this much from their Congress. 
   This amendment cries out for support. This is an education and labor bill, and I underline education. There is nothing more important as it relates to education than having a sound public broadcasting function of our Government.

A number of Members on this side are waiting to see what amendments are being offered on the other side. There are a couple of amendments that are going to cause this bill a really slow ride through these Halls. One is on ergonomics, which is a real problem; we have a dozen or so Senators who want to speak in relation to that amendment. 
   So I think a lot depends on what amendments are offered on the majority side to see how we can weed out some of these amendments over here.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I offer this amendment on behalf of the Senator from Nevada, Mrs. BOXER, and Senator KENNEDY. 
   A woman by the name of Karen Daly was stuck by a contaminated needle while working as an emergency room nurse in Massachusetts. As a result of her being inadvertently, accidentally stuck with a needle she was using on a patient, she was infected with both HIV and hepatitis C. She had worked as a nurse for 25 years. She, of course, can no longer work as a nurse. She loved her job. She has become, I believe, the Nation's most powerful advocate for our need to do something to prevent people from being accidentally stuck with needles from which they become sick. 
   Her story is really heart-rending. She says:  
   I can't describe for you how that one moment--the moment when I reached my gloved hand over a needle box to dispose of the needle I had used to draw blood--has drastically changed my life. Since January of this year, I have had to come to terms with the fact that I am infected with not one but two life-threatening diseases.  
   The tragic part of this story is, like Karen, so many other people could have had this accidental stick prevented. Karen Daly is one of 800,000 accidental sticks every year. 
   In Reno, NV, there is a woman by the name of Lisa Black, a 21-year-old registered nurse, a single mother of two, who has also learned the devastating impact of a needle stick. In October of 1997, 2 years ago, she was nursing a man who was in the terminal stages of AIDS when a needle containing his blood punctured her skin. Today, she is infected with hepatitis C and HIV. She takes 22 pills a day to keep her HIV infection from progressing to full-blown AIDS and to delay the effects of hepatitis C which is an incurable liver disease. 
   Lisa Black's needle stick could have been prevented if hospitals had widespread use of safe needles and needleless devices. 
   I repeat, 800,000 needlesticks and sharps injuries each year. That is more than is really imaginable, but it is true. 
   There are pages and pages of incidents I could report of people who are stuck with these needles. The nursing profession is mostly women, so most of the people who are injured are women. 
   I will talk about a couple of others. 
   Beth Anne. She graduated with a nursing degree less than a year before she got hurt. She says:  
   Life for me was just starting. Having graduated from college that year, I had planned to specialize in critical care, emergency services, and flight nursing. I was engaged to a wonderful and supportive engineer whom I had met when we were students on the same university campus. We were planning our wedding. Suddenly, everything seemed uncontrollable. The illness and the response from my employer seemed out of my control. ..... The severity of the illness threatened my life. ..... Wedding plans were postponed indefinitely.  
   Here is how she describes her injury:  
   I pulled the needle out. As the needle tip cleared the skin, the patient swiped at my right arm, sending the needle into my left hand. ``I forgot about the shot,'' the patient said. ``I thought it was a mosquito biting at my hip.''  
   Beth Anne says:  
   The injury I sustained is now preventable. ..... I injected the needle into her hip with my right hand, aspirated to assure placement, and pushed the plunger. The patient did not flinch. I pulled the needle out. As the needle tip cleared the skin, the patient swiped at my right arm, sending the needle into my left hand. ``I forgot about the shot,'' the patient said. ``I thought it was a mosquito biting at my hip.'' There [are] now syringes that automatically retract the needle into the syringe before the syringe is pulled away from the patient's skin. ..... The cost difference between this safe syringe and the one that infected [this lady] is less than the cost of a postage stamp. The cheaper syringe has cost [this woman and her employer] much more than this, in many ways.  
   She has been very sick and has been in and out of hospitals. Hundreds of these patients die each year from these injuries. Moreover, these statistics account for only reported injuries. The 800,000 are only those that are reported. There are a lot more that are not reported. 
   Lynda.  
   On September 9, ..... I sustained a needlestick while starting an intravenous  line at a small community hospital in Lancaster, Pa. I was a 23-year-old registered nurse working in the ICU.  
   The reason I go over these stories is these are not negligent nurses. They have not done anything wrong. 
   What happened is on one occasion there was a needle in a wastepaper basket. She stuck her hand in it. Needles are not supposed to be put there. 
   On another occasion, a patient, very sick, not thinking well--senile--swiped at a person's hand, thinking it was a mosquito. 
   In this instance, I repeat, she was a 23-year-old registered nurse.  
   At my hospital I had received in-depth training and had attended in-service sessions about safety and technique. Although I was complying with all recommended precautions at the time my needlestick occurred, these precautions were not enough to prevent the injury. While removing the needle from the patient's vein, he suddenly moved his arm and knocked mine. The motion forced the bloody exposed needle directly into my left palm. It punctured my latex gloves. ..... 
   It was here that my worst fears were confirmed. The patient had AIDS and was in the final stage of the disease.  
   She said:  
   I began the 1-year wait to discover if I had become infected. At 3 weeks after my needlestick I was sent to a family practitioner because of a rash, sore throat, and fever; I was prescribed some topical ointment for the rash and sent home. 
   ..... I received the results of my 6-month antibody test and got the most devastating news of my life: I was HIV positive. I do not think that words can accurately describe my emotions at this time. I felt suffocated, desperate, fearful, dirty, contaminated, and confused. Nothing in my education, on-the-job training, or critical care course could have prepared me for the experiences and emotion that lay ahead.  
   I have only recounted a few of these. Nurses badly need this legislation. There are all kinds of things that can be done to protect these people who are being stabbed inadvertently. There are needles that retract. Too many of our front-line health care workers contract, as I have indicated, these debilitating and often deadly diseases as a result of these on-the-job needlestick injuries. 
   Those at risk for needlestick or sharp injuries include anyone who handles blood, blood products, and biological samples, as well as housekeeping staff and those responsible for the disposal of contaminated materials. 
   According to the Centers for Disease Control, we have only a few of the reported sticks each year; 800,000 people have reported needlesticks and sharps injuries. There are many more who do not report. 
   We do not actually know the number of needlestick injuries. 
   Over 20 different diseases--including HIV, hepatitis B and C, and malaria--may be transmitted from just a speck of blood. 
   This amendment that has been offered would ensure that necessary tools--better information and better medical devices--are made available to front-line health care workers in order to reduce injuries and deaths that result from these needlesticks. 
   What would my amendment do? 
   It would amend OSHA's--that is the Occupational Safety and Health Administration--blood-borne pathogens standard to require that employees use needleless systems and sharps with engineered sharps protections to prevent the spread of blood-borne pathogens in the workplace. 
   Second, create a sharps injury log that employers would keep containing detailed formation about these injuries that occur. 
   And finally, it would establish a new clearinghouse within the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, NIOSH, to collect data on engineered safety technology designed to help prevent the risk of needlesticks. 
   In the House of Representatives, this legislation is sponsored by 136 of their Members. Protecting the health and safety of our front-line health care workers should not be a partisan or political issue. We need something done. 
   I have been told that the chairman of the committee, the junior Senator from Vermont, is aware of the problem in this area and has indicated a willingness to work to come up with regulations that we can work with the administration on or legislation, if in fact that is necessary--which I think it is--to prevent these needlestick injuries--and they are preventable, and we as a body need to do something about it.

   Mr. REID. I say to the manager of the bill, I appreciate his statement. I understand rule XVI. It was my initial idea because I think this is so important. Every nurse in America, every day they go to work, is concerned about whether or not they have a needlestick. Nurses all over America favor this. It was my original intention to move forward and see if we could get enough votes to surmount the problem with rule XVI. 
   I think we have the opportunity to do something on a bipartisan basis. I do not believe something this important should be done on a partisan basis. I think we should make this a bill both Democrats and Republicans support. I have spoken to the Senator from California, Mrs. BOXER, who has worked on this with me from the very beginning. She is someone who feels very strongly about this issue. I have spoken to the other sponsor of the legislation, Senator KENNEDY. They acknowledge the need for this and also the fact technology now exists to protect health care workers from needlesticks, but only 15 percent of those hospitals are using safer needle devices such as retractable needles. 
   Having said that, I am not going to call for a vote at this time. It is my understanding Senator JEFFORDS has agreed to do hearings. I am sure I can confirm that with a phone call with him. At this stage, what I am going to do is speak no more, talk to Senator JEFFORDS, and then I will withdraw my amendment.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend in closing, I understand there might be a cost involved. CBO has indicated to the manager of the bill $50 million. I think it would be a fraction of that, but we need not get into that today. For any one of these women I talked about today who have been inadvertently stabbed with one of these needles, their medical bills are huge. There isn't a single one of these women who doesn't have medical expenses less than $100,000. When added up, it comes out to a tremendous amount of money that could be saved, notwithstanding the pain and suffering of these individuals and their families.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am very fortunate to be the ranking member on this subcommittee because I always have a hole card and that hole card is the chairman of the subcommittee. I say that because not only does he serve on this very important subcommittee as chairman, he is also chairman of the Budget Committee, which helps when we run into money problems--No. 1, for understanding the budget issues in their entirety, since he has been in the process over the many years of setting the budget, the process that we have here, but the chairman of the Budget Committee also is able to work with the Office of Management and Budget, able to work with the Congressional Budget Office, and other people who make this bill one that has been able to move through the process. It is a very difficult process. 
   So I say to my friend, the chairman of the subcommittee, the chairman of  the full Budget Committee, I appreciate very much his including me in matters when I would not have to have been included. The chairman of the subcommittee, the manager of this bill, and this Member, can be about as partisan as anybody can be or needs to be. We do what we need to do to protect our two parties. But when it comes to matters where you have to set aside your partisan differences and move forward for the good of the country, I think we have set a pretty good example. We have been able to work through a very difficult process. This is an important bill--$22 billion. I understand the awesome responsibility I have to satisfy the needs of my State, the needs of the respective Democratic Senators who come to me for assistance, and Republican Senators who come to me for assistance; and I understand the importance of this bill to the country. This is a very important bill. I repeat, I express my appreciation to the chairman of this subcommittee for working with the minority in coming up with this bill. 
   This is a tough bill because there are so many very good projects, good measures we were unable to take care of; there simply was not enough money. It is hard to go to a Member and say: We couldn't do this. 
   Why? 
   We had a formula set up and you didn't fall within the formula. 
   Why couldn't you do this for me? 
   If we did it for him, we would have to keep doing it for some other people. We set up some standards, we kept to those standards as best we could, and we came up with what we think is a very good bill. 
   This bill deals with many important matters. I believe, as does Senator Simon, who served in this body and has since leaving here written a book on water, that future wars are not going to be fought over territory. They are going to be fought over water. In this country of ours, we have a lot of water problems developing. This subcommittee has a tremendous responsibility to handle those water problems. 
   We do not have much in this bill dealing with the water problems of the southern part of the United States, but we are going to get them. As a result of Hurricane Floyd, North Carolina has been devastated. North Carolina has water problems they never dreamed of having. There is talk that their 
   different aquifers are being polluted as a result of the tremendous discharge of human and animal waste as a result of this hurricane. We are going to get some of those problems in this bill next year.

   Mr. REID. I think that is important. Everyone should know this bill meets the very stringent standards, as far as the wetlands rider and some other funding matters the administration set. 
   I also say to my friend, the manager of this bill, there was some question about the new structure that has been set up within the Department of Energy and whether they needed more money to comply with the strictures that we have set under the new legislation. I think everyone agreed, this conference, if it takes more money, then they can come back. We will have a supplemental down the road early next Congress. They can come back to us and make a case that, because of the new legislation, they have been required to do new things that they were unable to pay for out of the budget that they have, and we will look to that with favor. 
   I think that is a fair way to go. 
   The path to this year's bill was rocky. It certainly was through no fault of the chairman. We spent a lot of  time trying to understand what the House wanted. We were able to work that out. 
   I also say to my friend from New Mexico, I came to Congress with the chairman of the House subcommittee in 1982. He is a very fine man. He is a good subcommittee Chair. He is going to be even better. I can see the progress since we did our supplemental to this bill. He is a fine man and is trying to do the right thing. That is Congressman RON PACKARD from the San Diego area.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as I indicated, this was a rocky road. I am surprised we are where we are. Ten days ago I did not think this was possible. The House and Senate were apart by $1 billion. We have worked that out. We have gotten more money in the bill. In fact, we have about $1 billion which has made this possible. 
   The final conference report is very balanced among the needs of water projects. I indicated how important they are for the corps and the Bureau of Reclamation, as well as the very important science and national security responsibilities of the Department of Energy. These responsibilities, the water projects and the Department of Energy, could stand alone, but they do not stand alone. We have to balance them. 
   I have spoken a lot about the importance of this bill. I did that earlier. I do believe it is important. Year after year, I am amazed at what this bill does to meet the needs of this very complex country in which we live, with the natural resources that are different from one coast to the next. 
   Earlier this year, Congress passed the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. We call it WRDA. We have not been able to fund a single project that we authorized in that. That is unfortunate, but that is one of the rules we set. The bill passed after this bill started, and if we are going to have some limitations, this is a good place to start. Next year, we are going to receive a number of requests from this bill, as well we should. We need to look for a way to fund them. 
   On the energy side, this bill is a solid compromise. It has sizable gaps both technologically and fundingwise, but we are going to make progress. We have battles on the Senate floor every year this bill is before us with solar and renewable 
   energy. We have to do better than we have. We were funded well below last year's request. We have made progress, and I think we can continue to make progress. 
   The conference compromise was the best we could do, given the available funds. It was not enough, but it was the best we could do. 
   This is a good bill. It is a bill that will next year, I hope, be even better. It is balanced. There are good things in it. We have hurricane protection for Virginia, funds for the Everglades in Florida, Chicago shoreline funding which will help keep the Great Lakes out of downtown Chicago, healthy funding for our National Labs, and dozens of other examples throughout this conference report that do help this country. My frustration is merely that there is so much more to be done that we cannot do. 
   Each year this bill is the product of hundreds and hundreds of hours of staff work on both sides of the aisle and in both Chambers. The staff worked very well together and produced the best possible result for the American people. That is what it is all about. 
   As I indicated, there comes a time--and we should do it much more often--when we must set aside our partisan differences and move forward with positive results. This bill is good for the country. We could have chosen to be partisan and neither of us budge and wind up with nothing, and that is what the American people would have gotten--nothing. We think setting aside our partisan differences has been a positive accomplishment. 
   The staff set the example. They worked to produce the best possible result for the American people, and I am very grateful to all our staff. I thank some of the key members of the Senate staff who made this bill possible: Gregory Daines, my energy and water clerk; Sue Fry, an Army Corps of Engineers detailee to the Appropriations Committee; Bob Perret, a fellow on my personal staff; Liz Blevins, an Appropriations Committee staff member; and Andrew Willison, who is on my personal staff who has worked very hard on this bill; and Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, and Lashawnda Leftwich of the majority staff who have been very helpful to us on this bill. 
   As always, as I have indicated, it is a pleasure to work with my counterpart, the chairman of this subcommittee, the chairman of the Budget Committee. I hope we are able to work on this bill for many years to come. 
   I yield back my time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as the fiscal year 2000 rapidly approaches, Republicans find themselves scrambling to pass appropriations bills before the October 1, 1999 deadline. Once again the majority has proven incapable of managing the appropriations process. Only four of the thirteen appropriations conference agreements have been completed, and the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill has yet to be voted on in either House. I recognize there is going to have to be some time so we can try to work out the differences. 
   What has gone on this past year is something about which we need to talk. We know they have put the most important of the 13 appropriations bills, Labor-HHS, at the bottom of the totem pole. Instead of doing this bill first, a bill that is vital to our country in dealing with health research and education, it has been put at the bottom. I do not think that is appropriate. 
   They have done all kinds of things: The majority has added a 13th month to the fiscal year. They are talking about delaying tax credits for low-income Americans. They are trying to spread 1 year's funding over 3 years. They are talking about making certain things an emergency, such as the census. This is just nonsensical. 
   I suggest that putting off for 3 weeks decisions we are going to have to make is unnecessary. The majority has consistently failed to finish their work on appropriations bills. The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. CONRAD, has done an excellent job of illustrating this point. We had two Government shutdowns in 1995, and this year, rather than developing legitimate spending offsets to increase funding available for the next fiscal year, we have come up with all these gimmicks. 
   It is like a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid scheme, which, if you did outside the Halls of Congress, is illegal. We have developed a massive Ponzi scheme while ignoring all of the budget rules. What they are driven toward and are already looking for is to spend Social Security money even though the talk is different. They are trying to spread this funding over 3 fiscal years, adding a 13th month, declaring things emergency that really are not emergencies, and waiting to do the most important bill the last, Labor-HHS. This is a Ponzi scheme, a pyramid. It is a house of cards that is just about to fall. 
   We keep delaying this. We have to sit down and work out our differences. We have to do the business of this country, and that means passing the appropriations bills in this body, finishing the conferences quickly, and getting the President to sign these bills. 
   If we have to do a continuing resolution that takes us through the year on some or all of these appropriations bills, we have to get to that right now. We have spent a lot of time treading water and going nowhere. Extending this funding for 3 weeks is doing just that, it is treading water. 
   We have to start doing something that is meaningful, and that means making tough decisions. Tough decisions, is not extending the year for another month. It is not declaring things like the census an emergency. It is not using welfare moneys that the Governors have kept to offset the problems we are having here. The Governors  should be able to use that money any way they want. And there are many other things they have attempted to do in an effort to avoid the tough decisions. The tough decisions have to be made. They should be made now rather than prolonging this for 3 weeks. 
   Mr. President, has there been a time set for a vote?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak this afternoon. This money going to the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been so important to the State of Nevada. Lake Tahoe, which we share with the State of California, has received, from the work that I have been able to do since I have been fortunate enough to be in the Senate, tens of millions of dollars from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to purchase environmentally sensitive land, land that would have been subdivided, land that would have been overrun with problems. Now this land is in beautiful, pristine wilderness. 
   The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been extremely important to the State of Nevada. This gives me an opportunity, because of how important the Land and Water Conservation Fund has been to the State of Nevada, to talk about the State of Nevada. People do not understand the State of Nevada. 
   Coincidentally, there was an article in today's Reno Gazette Journal. That is a Gannett newspaper in Reno, NV. This is a major story, coincidentally, in today's newspaper. There is a picture of a beautiful area. Below it are the words, in large print: Many don't associate Nevada with beauty. But if they do some exploring, one of the many sites that will take their breath away is the Arc Dome Wilderness. 
   As is said in this article: One of the many sites that will take their breath away is the Arc Dome Wilderness. 
   The State of Nevada is seen by many as a place to dump nuclear waste, a place to set off nuclear weapons, nuclear devices. The State of Nevada is the most mountainous State in the Union except for Alaska. We have, in the State of Nevada, 314 separate, distinct mountain ranges. In the State of Nevada, we have 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. Just outside Las Vegas--if you could walk it, it would be about 10 miles--you would come to a mountain that is almost 11,000 feet high. Nevada is a unique State. It is a very large State. It is a State that has magnificent views. 
   What people also don't understand is, we are fortunate. When I first came here, Nevada was the only State that had not done its Forest Service wilderness designation, the only State. I introduced legislation. It took a number of years, but we, in the State of Nevada, have created a beautiful Forest Service wilderness. 
   That means we have preserved areas in the State of Nevada in their pristine state. These are areas that my children, my children's children can go to, and these areas are the same as they were 100 years ago. In the process of doing the legislation for the wilderness in the State of Nevada, I, of course, toured the State of Nevada and looked at every wilderness site. After the legislation was introduced, I sent staff to talk to local people because, of course, with rare exception--although there are two wilderness areas, one right outside Las Vegas and one right outside Reno--with rare exception, these wilderness areas are located in remote areas of the State of Nevada, rural areas in the State of Nevada. I sent staff out to visit with these people in rural Nevada to talk to them about wilderness. 
   I got a call from one of my staff members. She said: It is interesting; I am in Ely, and they believe you should back off your wilderness--and I had heard that story lots of times. She said: They think you should create a national park. I said: A national park? She said: Yes, that is what they think should be done. 
   I didn't realize at the time that there had been for almost 60 years an effort to create a national park in the State of Nevada. A long-time Nevada Senator by the name of Key Pittman, who became the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee in the Senate--and was, at the outbreak of World War I, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee--sent a man, a forest ranger, to take a look at where would be a good place in Nevada to have a national park. This man traveled to Nevada. His name was Mott. He found a place. He reported to Key Pittman. 
   Key Pittman went to the President. To make a long story somewhat short, there were efforts made over the decades to create a national park in Nevada. It failed every time. Mining interests, ranching interests, they couldn't work it out. Well, I took the advice of my staff person, and the people in White Pine County, and created a national park legislatively. I offered legislation to take it out of the wilderness designation and create a national park. We created a national park. It is now a law that has passed the U.S. Congress, signed by the President, and it is a beautiful park--Great Basin National Park. 
   It is in a very remote area. It is over the border of the State of Utah. It is about 720 miles from Ely, NV. It is a place that everybody should go. What is there? The oldest living thing in the world is located there. The bristle cone pine tree is over 5,000 years old. These pine trees in this national park were growing when Caesar was around. These pine trees were old when Christ was on the earth. You can go to the Great Basin National Park and see them and feel them. They are there. They are still growing. On this national park is Nevada's only glacier. We have a glacier in Nevada 
   at our Great Basin National Park. Every different thing that is found in the Great Basin is found in this national park. It is a wonder of nature, from the towering Wheeler Peak to the base of it, which is high desert. It is a wonderful place. It is a place where people can walk. 
   We certainly need to do more things in all of our national parks to make them better places for visitors, although Great Basin is very nice. I would love to have a great new visitor center there, and we need an interpretive site. 
   The Senator from California has gone, but I say, with land and water conservation moneys we are going to build in various areas in our national parks beautiful visitor centers. That is important, and we should be able to do that. 
   A bit of the ice age exists in the form of this glacier. As I indicated, it is the only one of its kind, not only in Nevada but in the Great Basin. It is a mere token of what the ice age was, but in Nevada it still exists in the Great Basin National Park. It calls to mind the powerful glaciers capped at Snake Range only a few thousand years ago. Glacial activity is easy to find. Piles of glacial debris form mounds and ridges and lakes. 
   I failed to mention, in these parks are wonderful little lakes; they are turquoise blue. I have been there, and I have seen them. They are ice cold. We call them Theresa and Stella Lakes. They occupy hollows that were gouged out during the ice age. This national park is just unbelievably nice. I talk about Nevada having 32 mountain peaks over 11,000 feet high. Wheeler Peak is 13,000 feet high. I think that is really important, that we have Wheeler Peak, which is over 13,000 feet high, the second highest peak in the State. It is just really quite unbelievable that we have Wheeler Peak where it is. 
   The bristle cone pines we talked about being there at the time of Caesar and at the time of Christ. When they were building the pyramids, these trees were growing. 
   This is interesting. We had a cowboy out riding his horse one day, and he was looking up, and he suddenly dropped through ground into this huge cavern, and now these caverns are part of the Great Basin National Park, called Lehman Caves. It has a separate entrance, a wonderful place. You can look at stalactites and stalagmites,  and it is as dark as anything could be. We have that there.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me reclaim my time and say to my friend from North Dakota, as I indicated earlier, the reason I was so impressed with what the Senator from California has done is that a portion of these royalties currently goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund for Federal land acquisition. That is what I have talked about here. I think it is so important. 
   I see my friend from Iowa and my friend from North Dakota. I know they have both been to Lake Tahoe, which the Senators from Nevada and California share. Now, that is a beautiful place. It has remained as beautiful as it is because we have been able to take money in years gone by from the Land and Water Conservation Fund to buy land around there. As a result of that, we are making progress and saving that pristine land. It is not pristine now, but we are saving that beautiful lake, and we want to stop degradation from taking place. That is why, from my standpoint, these royalties are so important, because they go into land and water conservation moneys which for us in the State of Nevada are so important.

   Mr. REID. The reason I came, I say to my friend, and the reason I am so interested in this is that we are desperate for money in the West. I am sure it is accordingly so in other places. We have so much in the way of public land. We are desperate for money to make sure some of our nice places remain that way. 
   In all due respect to my friend from Iowa, his State was settled long before Nevada. The reason he does not have national parks and wilderness areas is because it is all private land. I don't in any way denigrate what has happened to the State of Iowa. But we in the West still have public lands that we want to try to add to and protect. We are having difficulty doing that because we don't have the money as the Federal Government, which is the caretaker. We don't have the money to not only add to it a little bit but take care of what we have.

   Mr. REID. They go to a number of places. But the track of money I have followed goes to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, which the President, thank goodness, is fighting to put some money into. 
   We have not had enough money for the Federal Government to stop development in Montana. There was an agreement made to buy a large mine there because they thought it would be detrimental to the national park that is right there. Yellowstone, they thought, didn't need that there. As a result of that, the Federal Government didn't have any money to buy it, even though they made the deal to buy it. This $154 million would allow them to do that. A lot could be done with that.

   Mr. REID. Let me say to my friend, as someone from the State of Nevada, we don't grow a great deal. We grow alfalfa. We are the largest producer of white onions in the United States. But other than that, we don't produce a lot in the way of agricultural products--certainly a lot less than we used to because of the growth in the Las Vegas area. So it was a hard sell to me to accept ethanol being something that was good for our country because it was hard for me to accept that we could grow something and stick it in a car and burn it. 
   But what persuaded me--I am now an advocate for ethanol--is that it is renewable. We have this ability in the United States to grow crops. We don't grow crops in Nevada as they grow them in the Midwest, in Iowa. But if we burn up a tank of ethanol this year, then next year there is some more ethanol and we can burn up some more. It is not the same as fossil fuel. That is a selling point to me. 
   I say to my friend from Iowa that another reason I was willing to come here on the Boxer postcloture activities is that we don't get enough opportunity around here to talk about things. 
   I am happy to hear the Senator from Iowa talk about some areas in the State of Iowa that are environmentally important. The Senator has talked about them. I would love to visit Iowa. I came to the floor today to talk about the beauty in the State of Nevada. I invite the Senator from Iowa to spend a few days with me in Nevada. We will go on a pack trip; we will go into some of the beautiful wilderness areas. 
   People fly over the State of Nevada. It looks like one big desert. It is not. We have wilderness areas. In the Reno newspaper, they talk about one wilderness area called Arc Dome. We have heard about mountain sheep, but in Nevada we have mountain goats. We have beaver. We have eagles floating through the valleys, antelope, elk. 
   People don't realize Nevada is more than the bright lights of Las Vegas and Reno. We need more time to talk about our various States. We tend to come to the floor and get involved in things that do not allow Members the opportunity to educate each other about their States.

   Mr. REID. I do want to say we are very proud of the wilderness areas we have in Nevada. Let me name them: Alta Toquima Wilderness, 38,000 acres; Arc Dome Wilderness, which is the largest, it covers 150,000 acres; Mount Charleston Wilderness, right outside the city of Las Vegas, covers the Spring Mountain Range and is almost 11,000 feet high; Mount Rose Wilderness, likewise, located just outside Reno. You can see it from Reno when you go there. Table Mountain Wilderness, and I have traveled almost every bit of that, is a wonderfully unique place. Currant Mountain Wildness is near the Great Basin National Park. The East Humboldts Wilderness is 37,000 acres. Here we have a herd of shaggy mountain goats which you can see there, with a small cirque lake and the 11,000 foot peak. Grant Range Wilderness, not far from Las Vegas, is a 50,000 acre area; Jarbidge Wilderness, a beautiful, wonderful area, you can still go there and pick up flint stones. You can pick up arrowheads. I went there for the first time in August, and the snow had not melted yet. It was beautiful. 
   Mount Moriah Wilderness is located near the Utah border; Quinn Canyon Wilderness is located in eastern Nevada, 27,000 acres. Ruby Mountain Wilderness has skiing. Land at the top in a helicopter, ski down the mountain, and come out where there is no wilderness. Santa Rosa Mountain Wilderness, also very remote; and finally, Boundary Peak Wilderness on the California-Nevada border is a mountain more than 13,000 feet high, which is the highest mountain in the State of Nevada. 
   My friend from Massachusetts has a question, I understand.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend, who is the ranking member of the Health,  Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and who has spent so much time working on education issues, trying to find money, as I know the ranking member has done--trying to find money to fund education programs all over America--yes, $66 million. As the Senator from Iowa indicated, it could go up to $154 million. Think what we could do with that share of education moneys, with the programs he has authorized in his committee but we have no ability to fund.

   Mr. REID. I have been waiting for the Senator from Massachusetts to come because I was hoping he would ask this question. 
   We in Nevada know more than anyplace in America how difficult it is to fund education. I say to my friend, does he realize in Nevada we hold the record? In Clark County, we dedicated and built 18 schools in 1 year. No school district in America has ever come close to that. We need schools. I say to my friend from Massachusetts, in Las Vegas we have to build one school every month to keep up with the growth. We are the eighth largest school district in America. We have well over 200,000 kids in our school districts. 
   So I say, absolutely, the money that would come from this would help the people in Nevada and the rest of the people in the country. I don't know how I could be more direct in my answer to the Senator.

   Mr. REID. The Senator has asked a couple questions. 
   First of all, no, there has not been a single word on this Senate floor about where the makeup would be for this money. The fact is, as with most education issues that 
   have come up since the majority has been controlling this place, they just ignore it. They don't worry about it. 
   I say, in answer to my friend from Massachusetts, yes, we have a lot of children--more children who are not going to be able to read, the more we cut back on these moneys. But I say to my friend, we have 3,000 children dropping out of high school every day in America. Couldn't we use a few of these dollars to come up with some programs to keep these kids in school?

   Mr. REID. I would have to say to my friend from California, I knew of dollars but I did not know of the tremendous amounts: The State of California, $345 million, unbelievable; Texas, $30 million; New Mexico, a small State, think of what could happen in the State of New Mexico with $6 million; Alabama, $15 million; Louisiana $400 million. 
   As I understand, these moneys come from lawsuits where the oil companies settled. There was not a trial where a verdict was rendered or a judgment rendered. They paid up when they found that they were doing wrong. And all this money, based upon what the Senator from California has so aptly described earlier in her statements on the Senate floor, and what the Senator from Massachusetts said--every dollar of this money goes to public education. States break it up differently, the Senator said--California, 100 percent; North Dakota, 56 percent--but that is a lot of money for those States.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend in response to the question, he made a very good point. The Federal Government, in my opinion, does not do enough to help public education. It does not do enough. Seven percent is not enough. But at least we do something. Every dollar we send to the school districts is badly needed.  
   But in answer to the question of the Senator, this money goes to the school districts. They can spend it in any way they want. Isn't that right?

   Mr. REID. I appreciate the questions from my friend from Massachusetts. One reason, before the Senator leaves the floor, that I think this is so important is this money does not go to any one place. I talked about the importance of the money and doing something about the natural beauty in our States. The Senator asked a series of questions that indicated a large chunk of this money will go to public education, and as far as this Senator is concerned, I do not think there is anything more important than public education and protecting our natural resources. That is, in effect, what the Senator from California 
   is attempting to do: Focus attention on these moneys that would go to these very important issues, such as the national park we have in Nevada, such as the 14 wilderness areas we have in Nevada, and the many educational programs. 
   I ask the Chair how much of the Senator's hour is remaining.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, while we are talking about education, I say to my colleagues that I have worked with the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, on some very important legislation. The Senator from Massachusetts and I just touched upon it. It deals with dropouts. 
   As the Presiding Officer has heard me say, every day in America 3,000 children drop out of high school, half a million a year. Every one of those children who drop out of school are less than they can be. They are going to be less productive to themselves and to their families. They are going to add to the cost of Government in education, in welfare, and our criminal justice system. 
   Mr. President, 84 percent of the men and women in the prisons around America have not graduated from high school. So are high school dropouts a priority? Yes, they are. 
   The Senator from New Mexico, Mr. BINGAMAN, and I have introduced legislation to create, within the Department of Education, a dropout czar who would work on programs around the country to keep kids in school and not force any of these programs on local school districts, but have them available with challenge grants and other opportunities for schools to step in and see if they can help keep some of their kids in schools. It will cost a few dollars to do this. We need to do it. This will allow us to have moneys to do that. 
   I say keeping children in school is important. We have programs around the country that work. Let's try to pattern what we do after the programs that work and keep some of these kids in school. I cannot think of anything more important, as it relates to education, than keeping these kids in school. We are not going to keep all 3,000 children from dropping out every day, but let's say every day instead of 3,000 children on average dropping out, 2,800 drop out. We will keep 200 children in high school every day. Think how many that will add up to in a school year: Kids who have a better opportunity to do what they are capable of doing and not adding to the criminal justice system, not being part of the statistics. Eighty-four percent of the people in prison did not graduate from high school. We need to do better in that regard. 
   Also, we need to do better with our natural resources. We need to do something about the multibillion-dollar backlog in our national parks. We are closing parts of our national parks because we cannot rehabilitate them the way they need to be rehabilitated. Some of these areas are becoming dangerous for people to walk in. 
   What we do with our personnel in our U.S. park system is something we should not brag about. Employees of the National Park System are living in Quonset huts from the Second World War. We have to provide housing for these people. A lot of these parks, just like Great Basin, are very remote. The nearest town from the Great Basin is 70 miles away. These people are living in conditions I do not think you want your children living in. These jobs are coveted. They go to school to become a park ranger. They love their work. We should 
   provide adequate housing for them because a lot of times it does not exist. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to speak today. I appreciate the questions from the Senators from North Dakota, Massachusetts, California, and Iowa. I hope this debate has been educational to other Members of the Senate.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I had intended to offer to the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations measure an amendment that would have repealed a provision that the Congress tucked into last year's massive omnibus appropriations bill. 
   That provision established a one-year moratorium on any new or expanded Indian Self-Determination Act contract, grant, or compact between the Bureau of Indian Affairs, or the Indian Health Service, and Indian tribes. 
   The establishment of this moratorium was a result of the growing shortfall between allowable contract support costs and the amounts appropriated for such costs. 
   The rationale when we imposed the moratorium was that shortfalls in contract support costs would continue to increase as long as Indian tribes entered into new contracts with the BIA or IHS. 
   Therefore, it was argued that the best way to prevent these increasing shortfalls simply would be to prevent the tribes from even entering into new contracts. 
   Logical as it may sound, the moratorium has had the practical effect of preventing many Indian tribes from providing their members with the most basic of services, whether it involves health services, social services, law enforcement or road maintenance. 
   Mr. President, while I have withdrawn my amendment at this time, I would like to emphasize the importance of addressing this issue. 
   I would note that as we go to conference, the House version of this legislation does not contain the provision which extends the moratorium on self-determination contracts. 
   Mr. President, I ask my friend from New Mexico whether he is familiar with Section 324 of H.R. 2466, the FY 2000 Interior appropriations measure, which is currently pending before the Senate.

   Mr. REID. I concur with the Senator. 
   A prime example of this effect involves the Washoe Tribe of Nevada and California, which was prevented from entering into a contract for the most basic service, even though they were willing to proceed despite the realization that their contract support costs would not be fully covered. 
   In the Alpine Country of the Washoe tribal lands, huge amounts of snowfall are not uncommon. The BIA has a snowplow, and until recently, also had a snowplow operator who would help clear snow after the lands were hit by storms. The BIA operator recently retired, however, so the tribe made plans to contract with the BIA, under the Indian Self-Determination Act, to take possession of the plow in order to allow a fully-trained tribe member to operate the truck and clear the snow. 
   You can imagine their surprise, therefore, when the local BIA office informed them that they were prohibited by statute from entering into that contract for such a simple, yet important, task of clearing snow. 
   The inability to clear snow in a timely fashion created a logistical nightmare and a safety hazard, not to mention further strains on an already-strained tribal economy. 
   For the Washoe Tribe, contract support funds weren't the primary concern; the safety and well-being of the tribe's members superseded that concern. 
   I ask the Senator from New Mexico if he is familiar with these types of consequences.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of legislation that address our national shortage of geriatricians. I am pleased that Senators GRASSLEY, HARKIN and CLELAND are joining me as original cosponsors. 
   Our nation is growing older. Today, life expectancy is 79 years for women, and 73 years for men. While the population of the United States has tripled since 1900, the number of people age 65 or older has increased eleven times--to more than 33 million Americans. One-third of all health care costs can be attributed to this group. The fastest growing part of the Medicare population--those over 85--number more than three-and-a-half million. But, according to reports from the Institute of Medicine, the National Institute on Aging, and the Council on Graduate Medical Education, the number of doctors with special training to meet the needs of the oldest and frailest Americans is in critically short supply. 
   I first became concerned about this problem when I read a report issued by the Alliance for Aging Research in May of 1996 entitled, ``Will You Still Treat Me When I'm 65?'' The report concluded that there are only 6,784 primary-care physicians certified in geriatrics. This number represents less than one percent of the doctors in the United States. The report goes on to state that the United States should have at least 20,000 physicians with geriatric training to provide appropriate care for the current population, and as many as 36,000 geriatricians by the year 2030 when there will be close to 70 million older Americans. 
   I first introduced legislation to address the national shortage of geriatricians during the 105th Congress. While I am encouraged that greater attention has been focused on this issue, little has been accomplished to improve the shortage of geriatricians. The two bills I am introducing today, the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act'' and the ``Geriatrician Loan Forgiveness Act of 1999'' aim--in modest ways and at very modest cost--to encourage an increase in the number of the doctors Medicare clearly needs, those with certified training in geriatrics. 
   One provision of the ``Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act of 1999'' will allow the Secretary of Health and Human Services to double the payment made to teaching hospitals for geriatric fellows. This provision is limited to a maximum of 400 individuals in any calender year. This is intended to serve as an incentive to teaching hospitals to promote and recruit geriatric fellows. 
   Another provision of the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act would direct the Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase the number of certified geriatricians appropriately trained to provide the highest quality care to Medicare beneficiaries in the best and most sensible settings by establishing up to five geriatric medicine training consortia demonstration projects nationwide. In short, this would allow Medicare to pay for the training of doctors who serve geriatric patients in the settings where this care is so often delivered. Not only in hospitals, but also ambulatory care facilities, skilled nursing facilities, clinics and day treatment centers. 
   The second bill I am offering today, ``The Geriatricians Loan Forgiveness Act of 1999,'' has but one simple provision. That is to forgive $20,000 of education debt incurred by medical students for each year of advanced training required to obtain a certificate of added qualifications in geriatric medicine or psychiatry. My bill would count their fellowship time as obligated service under the National Health Corps Loan Repayment Program. 
   While almost all physicians care for Medicare patients, many are not familiar with the latest advances in aging research and medical management of the elderly. Too often, problems in older persons are misdiagnosed, overlooked or dismissed as the normal function of aging because doctors are not trained to recognize how diseases and impairments might appear differently in the elderly than in younger persons. As a result, patients suffer needlessly, and Medicare costs rise because of avoidable hospitalizations and nursing home admissions. 
   A physician who takes special training in the care of the elderly becomes sensitive to the need to evaluate and address the patient's behaviors and moods, as well as her physical symptoms. This is especially important, as the rates of undiagnosed depression and suicide among the elderly are scandalous. By allowing doctors who pursue certification in geriatric medicine to become eligible for loan forgiveness, and by offering an incentive to teaching institutions to promote geriatric fellowships, my bills will provide a measure of incentive for top-notch physicians to pursue fellowship training in this vital area. 
   Increasing the number of certified geriatricians will not be easy for a number of reasons. Geriatrics is the lowest paid medical specialty, because the extra time required for effective and compassionate treatment of the elderly is barely reimbursed by Medicare and other insurers. It takes a special individual to commit himself or herself to the work of helping older patients preserve vitality and functional abilities over time. Often the goal for a geriatrician is not to cure disorders, but to delay the onset of disability--that is, simply to help seniors live as well as possible. For these reasons, existing slots in geriatrics training programs sometimes go unfilled today. But while the work may be difficult and not well compensated, protecting quality of life for the elderly is extraordinarily important, and we need physicians whose training explicitly recognizes that. 
   It is similarly difficult for teaching programs to build and remain committed to maintaining fellowship training in geriatric medicine, because geriatric faculty are scarce and the type of patients brought in by a training program often require extremely complex and high cost care. Simply, it is cheaper to train other specialties, and more lucrative in terms of graduate medical education payments to the hospital. In fact, there are only two departments of geriatrics at academic medical centers across the entire country. 
   Another barrier to alleviating the shortage of geriatricians is the result of an unintended consequence of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA). A provision in this law established a hospital-specific cap on the number of residents based on the number of residents in the hospital in 1996. Because a lower number of geriatric residents existed prior to December 31, 1996, these programs are underrepresented in the cap baseline. The implementation of this cap has resulted in the reduction of, and in some cases, the elimination of geriatric training programs. This is one obstacle that should not be overlooked when Congress considers legislation to correct some of the unintended consequences of the BBA. 
   When it comes to training the doctors we need, Medicare's current payment system is part of the problem, not part of the solution. The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission's (MEDPAC) August 1999 report to Congress entitled ``Rethinking Medicare's Payment Policies for Graduate Medical Education and Teaching Hospitals'' examines this very issue. According to the MEDPAC report:  
   Where Medicare does not pay for services generally associated with a particular specialty, it may discourage training. For example, although several studies have indicated an inadequate supply of geriatricians, the number of geriatric training slots exceeds the number of people who choose to enter the specialty. This may reflect a lack of payment for services such as palliative care and geriatric assessment.  
   Clearly, the incentives in Medicare's payment system are poorly aligned  when training doctors specifically to care for the elderly is avoided. Again, my bill provides a modest incentive for hospitals to increase the number of training slots available. 
   Medicare should be providing incentives to community-based programs to participate in the education of doctors, especially geriatricians, by directing graduate medical education payments appropriately to all facilities that incur the additional costs of providing training. My bill directs the Secretary to undertake up to five demonstration projects that will do just that. 
   Many reports have highlighted the shortage of geriatricians we have today. The response to the problem needs to be a national one, and it would be most unwise to simply hope that the labor market will produce the kinds of doctors we will increasingly need. I am especially grateful to the American Geriatrics Society for its assistance in discussing ways to address the problem. I believe that the Medicare Physician Workforce Improvement Act and the Geriatrician Loan Forgiveness Acts are steps in the right direction, and I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting these bills.

   Mr. REID. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator SHELBY, the Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, in a brief discussion about an important program for my home state of Nevada. 
   As my colleagues know, Nevada is a state with a very large amount of federal lands. Nearly eighty-seven percent of the state is federal land. In fact, Nevada trails only Alaska in total acreage under federal control. 
   As such, Nevada qualifies for preference under the Public Lands Highway Discretionary Program portion of the Federal Lands Highway program, since, in the words of the law, its borders include ``at least 3 percent of the total public lands in the nation''. (The other states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah and Wyoming.) This factor, together with consideration of a state's need, are the only statutory instructions on the awarding of discretionary funds under Public Lands Highway Discretionary Program. 
   Is the Chairman aware that this body has historically not earmarked projects under Federal Lands Highway program. However, the other body has undertaken to heavily earmark the program this year even though this undercuts the basic intent of Congress in creating the discretionary program for states heavily impacted by federal land holdings. 
   In addition, this earmarking has the effect of reducing the federal agencies ability to utilize the program for very urgent needs on federal lands and for which there is simply no other source of federal funds. I have a copy of Nevada's submission to the FHWA for Public Lands Highways funding in FY 2000. Eight of the nine projects are submitted by federal agencies. 
   I hope that my good friend and colleague, Senator SHELBY, can address this problem in Conference, by reemphasizing the intent of the Congress with respect to this program.

   Mr. REID. I would like to engage my colleague, Senator SHELBY, the Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, in a brief discussion about several important programs that impact my home state of Nevada. While these projects and programs are not currently fully funded in this bill, I am pleased that my colleague, senator SHELBY, has indicated that he will seek to find resources in the final conference report. 
   The first two programs I would like to discuss today are cutting edge research and technology programs, ones where relatively small allocations of resources can pay huge long-term dividends to consumers. 
   The first research effort I would like to discuss is the Strategic Alliance for Passenger Airline Security. A consortium of local, state, and private entities, including the University of Nevada-Las Vegas, the University of California-Los Angeles, Alaska Airlines, and Certified Airlines Passenger Services, a Nevada-based company is working with the FAA to develop a decentralized baggage and check-in system that will allow passengers to check-in at various remote locations in the city of origin, such as hotels, shopping malls, or other aviation check-in points. 
   In a state as dependent upon tourist traffic as Nevada, the ability to more efficiently handle arrivals and departures is critical. As airports struggle in the coming years to cope with more and more passengers in facilities that are unable to expand, alternative, safe, technologies for keeping passenger and baggage traffic moving will become critical. I am grateful that my colleague, Senator SHELBY has recognized the merits of increased research and development in this area. I am looking forward to working with my Chairman on this issue in conference and during the upcoming fiscal year. Only by encouraging innovation can the FAA  hope to keep our Nation's aviation system out of gridlock. 
   The second technology that I want to discuss to day is a Remote Certification and Maintenance system, a technology developed by Arcata, a Nevada-based company. 
   In the Committee-passed version of this bill Senators SHELBY and LAUTENBERG included language favorable to the remote certification and maintenance technology manufactured by Arcata. It is my understanding that the FAA has 
   informed the Committee of their ability to deploy up to $5 million worth of this technology at remote radar centers throughout the nation. As this technology gives older generation radars advanced RMM capability, the cost savings alone make this a worthwhile investment of our nation's resources. 
   Finally, as all of my colleagues are aware, Nevada has been one of the fastest growing states in the nation for most of the last two decades. Southern Nevada attracts nearly 5,000 new residents per month. Given this colossal growth, it is no surprise that the demand for aviation infrastructure has sky-rocketed in recent years. 
   These increases in aviation traffic in the skies over Southern Nevada have make Contract Air Traffic Control Tower Service at Henderson Executive Airport absolutely critical. 
   A relatively small investment of resources at the third largest airport in Southern Nevada will solve what is becoming a sticky air traffic control issue for the Las Vegas Valley, especially in light of the county's decision to move the majority of Grand Canyon overflight tour operators from McCarran to the airports in Henderson and North Las Vegas. 
   Let me be clear, I am not asking for special treatment here. The Clark County Department of Aviation has recently received independent confirmation of a cost-benefit ratio of over 1.0 (specifically 1.16) and expects the FAA to verify that figure in the near future. Any rating over 1.0 makes a facility eligible for this funding. The cost-benefit ratio, coupled with Henderson's status as the third rung in a much more complex air traffic system, make funding for this service an easy choice for Congress to make. I am delighted to have your support for the Contract Tower Program and for the specific inclusion of Henderson Executive Airport in the program, Mr. Chairman. 
   I appreciate your consideration and look forward to working with you on these and other important issues in conference.

   Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have spent a lot of time talking about this issue. 
   I spoke to the chairman of the committee today. We really want to try to be helpful and move along these judicial appointments, including the one that is so important to the Senator from Utah, Mr. HATCH. 
   But we would ask the majority leader if he would modify his request to provide for the same time limitation for those nominees: Berzon, White, and Paez. Maybe having made this suggestion, modification of the time agreement, we could have all these done. We could do it probably in a morning or certainly with a little added time. In fact, we would even be willing to cut down the time or add to the time if the majority leader would agree.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask the leader this. I have listened to the two  of you in your dialog. I have a different idea. I think that and I respectfully submit this--we would be better off if you did not file your motion for cloture. You can do that next week. I feel that, knowing the minority as well as I do, we would be better off. If things don't work out by Tuesday at this time, you can still file your motion to invoke cloture. 
   I don't think we should be filing motions to invoke cloture on these judges. I don't think we need to do that. Give us a little time to work this out. I respectfully submit to my dear friend that I think we would be making a mistake procedurally. I have only been to Mississippi once, and that was when I went to Senator John Stennis' funeral, a man who I had the pleasure of serving with years ago. I had great respect for him. I feel that, in the Stennis way of doing business, we need to do a little more deliberating and less pushing people's backs to the wall. I feel this motion would be the wrong thing. 
   As I say, I have spoken to the Senator from Utah. I know how badly he wants this judge to be approved. I think you have gone some way this evening in saying that you have mentioned four people that I think we can approve pretty quickly.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, September 15, 1999, marks the beginning of Hispanic Heritage Month. Today, I rise before my colleagues in the Senate to pay tribute to Nevada's dynamic Hispanic community, as well as the more than 30 million people in the United States who are of Hispanic heritage. 
   Mr. President, Nevada, which has consistently been the fastest growing state in the union, boasts a Hispanic population of more than two-hundred and fifty thousand. While the Hispanic community constitutes fifteen percent of the population of Las Vegas, more than one in four schoolchildren in the Las Vegas/Clark County School District are of Hispanic heritage. Our children are the future, and the inference is clear: the Hispanic community is the fastest growing minority group in Nevada and the entire country. 
   The many contributions of Hispanics in American society are demonstrated in the areas of culture, academics, business, education, the arts and entertainment. In Nevada, Hispanic leadership continues to advance as members of the community occupy more and more elected and appointed positions. I was especially honored to have my dear friend, Reynaldo Martinez, serve as my Chief of Staff in the United States Senate. 
   Mr. President, to celebrate these many contributions, but also, to address the path that lies ahead, Nevada Hispanic leaders from Nevada will gather in Washington, D.C. from September 15-17, 1999, for Unidos para el Futuro (United for the Future), my National Conference for Nevada Hispanic Leadership. Armed with the lessons of the past, and ready to confront the challenges of the future, these members of the Nevada Hispanic community will have the opportunity to meet with my colleagues in the Senate and the House of Representatives, including the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. I am honored that Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, the highest ranking Hispanic in President Clinton's administration, will also address the gathering. Furthermore, the group will meet with numerous national Hispanic organizations, as well as officials from the various federal agencies that interact with the Hispanic community. I am hopeful that the efforts we are undertaking will provide our friends and colleagues in the Hispanic community with essential information on a variety of issues, as well as the necessary interaction with those individuals and entities that shape policy. Such pro-action on our part is imperative in the Senate which, unfortunately, is without a Hispanic Member. 
   As elected officials, we must be constantly apprised of the issues that are important to our constituents. Simply put, the priorities of the Hispanic community must be our priorities as well. 
   Mr. President, I rise to recognize and honor the following members of Nevada's Hispanic community who have joined me in our nation's capital, united for the future: 
   Bob Agonia, Elmira J. Alvarez, Luisa Balsa, Kelly Benavidez, Carina Black,  Greg J. Black, Carlos Blumberg, Don Brown, Andrea Brown, Malena Burnett, Deanna Cambeiro-Remark, Liz Carrasco, Maria Champlin, Lyciane Corona, Laura Cortez, Cheryl Davis, Nico De La Puente, Johnny Diaz, Dr. Mark Dominguez, Rose Dominguez, Lopez Edwardo, Elva Esparza, Edith Fernandez, Jacqueline Ferreiro, Judith Fleishman, Frank Canales, Charvez Roger, Sermern 6o Francisco, Zullie Franco, Hector Galvez-Lopez, Edward M. Garcia, Helena Garcia, Laura Garcia, Arriola Gilbert, Almalinda Guerrero, Jesse Gutierrez, Elaine Hernandez, Cinthya Hernandez, Cecilia Khan, Estela LaVario, Eduardo Lopez, Scott Antono Lopez, Rene Mantecon, Diego Martin, Rual Martinez, Magda Martinez, Larry Mason, Griselda Mava, Rita Mac Gary, John Medina, Eva Melendrez, Jose Melendrez, Laura Mijanovich, Clara Miranda, Ramon Miranda, Marlene Monteolivo, Jesse Montes, Fran Montes, Gabriel Mora, John Mulligan, Mercy Mangel, Alberto Ochoa, Arturo Ochoa, Alex Ortiz, Rosa Parodi, Ciria Perez, Jose Pineda, Craig Pittman, Andres Ramirez, Dr. Maria G. Ramirez, Margarita Rebollal, Mary Resendez, Linda Rivera, Mario Rocha, Carlos Rodriguez, Jr., Michelle Rodriguez, Fernando Romeo, Dr. Carlos Romero, Martha Salazar, Tony Sanchez, Raymond Sandal, Emma Sepulveda, Carmen Suarez, Maria Carmen Thomas, Jose Troncoso, Candida Ann Ureno, Rafael Villanueva.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am a great fan of public broadcasting. I listen almost every day to public radio. I am tremendously impressed with programs such as ``Prairie Home Companion'' and all the news stories in the morning that are extremely in depth. With public television, we all recognize the contributions made by the series on the Civil War, which is a classic and will continue to be in American television. The ``MacNeil, Lehrer News Hour,'' which is now the ``Lehrer News Hour,'' is the most in-depth news coverage that we have any place in America. There are many other programs on radio and on public television which I haven't mentioned that are quite good as well. 
   I am struck by the amount of commercials I endure and we all have to endure when we listen to public radio and watch public television. In my estimation, it is out of hand. These commercials are technically called ``enhanced underwriting.'' You can call them whatever you want, but they are commercials. 
   An article appeared a short time ago in the Washington Post entitled ``Now a Word About Our Sponsor.'' Critics say public radio's on-air credits come too close to being commercials, and, as indicated in that article, they are absolutely right. People are getting more disturbed every day with commercialism of public broadcasting. 
   I point this out because I am not the only one who has noticed the increasing sponsored announcements. According to this article, one survey shows a 700-percent increase in corporate funding over the past 5 or 6 years. It is just not listeners who are noticing the change. If I were the owner of a private broadcasting station, I would be up in arms. And some private station owners are tremendously disturbed about the increasing commercialism of this so-called public broadcasting. 
   Private stations aren't tax exempt like public broadcasting stations are. The private stations are now voicing their concerns about the existing uneven playing field. I don't want to sound as though I am beating up on public broadcasting because, as I have indicated in my opening statement, I really do like public broadcasting. I enjoy the programs on National Public Radio and public television. I believe public broadcasting should remain just that--public. That means we have to do a better job with public funding. 
   We can trace very clearly what has happened to public broadcasting. Newt Gingrich, and others with whom he associated, came out with the bad idea that they wanted to eliminate public broadcasting. This group found that they could not do that. So, in effect, they cut back the funding and they are strangling public broadcasting to death. 
   Mr. President, we need to do the necessary things to make public broadcasting more public in nature. I believe it is time for us to decide whether we want to have a public broadcasting system or whether we don't want to have one. Either we fund the Corporation for Public Broadcasting so they can exist, or we end it. I prefer the former. Therefore, when the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education marks up its bill--and I am a member of that subcommittee--I plan to offer an amendment to increase the Corporation for Public Broadcasting appropriation to $475 million. This is $125 million more than their request. However, I also plan to include report language that would encourage public radio and television to scale back their so-called enhanced underwriting practices and to become, once again, a public broadcasting system that is publicly funded. 
   As long as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is leery of Congress cutting their funds or doing away with Federal funds altogether, they will begin to sound more and more like private broadcasting stations. The people who run those stations don't like it. You have people, as indicated in the Post article that I referred to earlier, who are continually talking about how difficult it is and how unfair it is. In this article, the author cites Bob Edwards from the NPR Morning Edition, which is a very fine program for news in the morning. He says:  
   Underwriting has kept us alive, but there's also a downside. It has cut into our air time. If you have to read a 30-second underwriting credit [a commercial], that's less news you can do.  
   So as I stated, we have to either make public broadcasting public or do away with it. If we continue the road we are going on, we are going to wind up having public broadcasting in name only, and it is going to be unfair that they are competing with the private stations, in which we have people who have invested a lot of money, trying to make money on an uneven playing field because of the protections public broadcasting have.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we had some good news last week when the majority leader, Senator LOTT, indicated that if the President vetoed the $800 billion Republican tax plan, that would be the end of it. 
   That is good news for the American public on the $800 billion attempt to cut taxes in this country because, in fact, it really wasn't a tax cutting measure. It was something that would give no immediate relief to the American taxpayer. There was relief in the outyears. In fact, what it would have done is prevent us from directing moneys toward the debt, and the debt of $5 trillion is something we need to address. 
   If the national debt were lowered, it would be a tax cut for everyone, rich and poor. We pay hundreds of millions of dollars every year in interest on that debt. If we lower that, it will be good for everyone. We are not going to continue to live in this 
   great economy where everything is looking good, forever. Hard times may lie ahead, and I think we will rue the day we didn't use these good times to pay down that debt. 
   This massive tax package that was passed on a very partisan basis, and then withheld from the American public during the August break so there could be a public relations effort to have the American people accept this tax cut, never materialized. The American people would not accept it because it was not acceptable on its face. They realized there was no meaningful tax relief in this package. It was more of a public relations ploy. The fact is that there should have been more attention focused on paying down the debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare. We must pay down the debt. That would be a tax cut for everyone. 
   We must protect Social Security. The majority touted the Social Security lockbox in conjunction with the tax cut. But the Republican lockbox fails to extend the solvency in the Social Security trust fund by a single day, and it includes, in this so-called lockbox, a trapdoor, a loophole, that would allow Republicans to label anything Social Security reform and to raid the Social Security trust fund. Finally, the Republican lockbox does nothing to protect Medicare. 
   So by proposing targeted tax cuts toward working families, the minority believes our Democratic plan is able to prioritize paying down the debt and protecting Social Security and Medicare while still providing almost $300 billion in targeted tax cuts. 
   What would those cuts do? They would increase the standard deduction for all individuals and married couples. They would provide marriage penalty relief for those taxpayers who pay more as married couples than they would if they were to file their taxes as two single individuals. They would provide for a long-term-care tax credit to make it easier to care for elderly family members. They would provide for a 100-percent deduction for health insurance costs of the self-employed and include tax incentives to build and modernize more than 6,000 schools. That is important. 
   Clark County, Las Vegas, NV, has the eighth-largest school district in America, with over 200,000 schoolchildren. We are having to build over a dozen new schools every year. In one year  --and we hold the record--we dedicated 18 new schools in Clark County. We have to build one new elementary school every month to keep up with the growth in Clark County. We need some help to do that. The Democratic tax plan would give us some of that needed help. 
   Also, one of the things we have talked about, which is so important, is a tax credit for research and development for high-tech companies. That is part of the Democratic tax plan--something we hope the majority leader and others will take a look at and be willing to compromise on. Democrats have been out in front on the issue for a long time. We pushed hard for a permanent R & D tax credit. The majority talked about how they were in favor of a permanent credit as well, until it came time to actually do it. In the end, the minority, myself included, were pushing for a ten year R & D tax credit. The majority ended up only committing to a five year tax credit in their package. Due in large part to initiatives like the R & D tax credit, the high-tech industry exists and has flourished. Without knowing whether or not that tax credit will be around next year or the year after or the year after that, hinders these companies' long term planning.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, in Nevada we are very proud of a number of things. We have a beautiful State. We are the most mountainous State in the Union, except for Alaska, with over 300 separate mountain ranges, with 32 mountains over 11,000 feet high. Las Vegas, of course, is the entertainment capital of the world. 
   We are very proud of our universities for a number of reasons. We have a great engineering program at the University of Nevada, Reno. The Mackay School of Mines is there, and we are proud of that as well. We have a great school for biological sciences, which has a national reputation. At UNLV, we have the finest hotel administration program in the entire country. The universities in Nevada are very proud of the football teams that we had in the forties and fifties. Since the schools have been divided, UNR has been a power in division II football, and they have played for the national championship. They are now a division I team. UNLV has won national championships in basketball. The UNLV football team has had some bad years, losing dozens of games. Last year they didn't win a single game, but this year they were able to beat North Texas State in their first away game. 
   A week ago last Thursday and then this past Saturday, they played Baylor. Even though Baylor was favored by a couple of touchdowns, one of the most miraculous wins in the history of football at the professional or college level occurred when Baylor was ahead by four points with less than 10 seconds left. They had the ball inside the 10-yard line of UNLV. Rather than take their four-point victory, they wanted to run the score up a little bit and go for a touchdown. In the end zone there was a fumble picked up by a UNLV defensive back who ran 101 yards for the touchdown and beat Baylor with no time left on the clock. This was tremendous. 
   People are going to be very happy with their new football couch, John Robinson, who had a great career before coming to UNLV from the University of Southern California and, of course, coaching the Los Angeles Rams. 
   We offer our congratulations to John Robinson and UNLV for two victories, which is two more than they had during all of last year.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the main reason I wanted to talk about athletics in Nevada is not because of the team victories that we have had over the years in Nevada but because of a great young man who was born and raised in Nevada who has been part of the Nevada athletic scene for some 25 years, even though he is only 29 years old. 
   Andre Agassi and his family have been great for the State of Nevada. Andre, when he was a little boy still in elementary school, it was said by Poncho Gonzales, who was a tennis great. ``He will be better than I someday.'' This is when he was a little, tiny boy. Poncho Gonzales was right. 
   Andre Agassi has already proven himself to be even greater than the great Poncho Gonzales. This was certainly the case as proven yesterday when he won the U.S. Open Tennis Championship. 
   I want to, on the Senate floor, congratulate Andre Agassi on this remarkable comeback yesterday in the U.S. Open and, of course, his comeback victory in the French Open. 
   Andre, as I have indicated, is a native of Las Vegas and dominated this summer with 35 victories in 39 matches. That is almost unheard of. 
   Andre Agassi is the No. 1 ranked tennis player in the United States. Not too long ago, because of an injury and other problems, Andre Agassi was ranked 141. He is now ranked the best tennis player in the world, as he should be. 
   I was watching the tennis matches over the weekend. John McEnroe, one of the great tennis players of all time, commenting about Andre Agassi, said his ability to return service is the best there has ever been in the entire history of tennis. His reputation and his abilities are still being proven. He is getting better with every match he plays. 
   But yesterday he closed out one of the greatest summers in tennis history. He came up with some of the most impressive shots ever seen in tennis in a dominating fifth set to capture his second U.S. Open. 
   Andre has made his place in tennis history. When he won the French Open, he joined Roy Emerson, Rod Laver, Don Budge, and Fred Perry as the only men to win all four major tournaments in their career. 
   Andre not only won the French and the U.S. Opens this year, he was also in the finals at Wimbledon, making him the first man since Ivan Lendl in 1986 to have gone to three grand slam finals in the same year. 
   No man had fought back to win the U.S. Open from a 2-1 deficit in sets since John Newcombe did it 26 years ago. But that is exactly what Agassi did in a 3-hour and 23-minute match yesterday. 
   The match was only the fifth all-American men's final at the U.S. Open in 32 years. The matchup of these two men who are almost 30-years-old, was the oldest since 39-year-old Ken Rosewall lost to 22-year-old Jimmy Connors in 1974. Even though these two men had 
   not reached the age of 30, they played great tennis. They will be talked about as being old men at tennis, I repeat, even though they were not even 30 years old yet. They set a great example for tennis generally and for American tennis in particular. 
   I have to agree with Andre when after the match he said, ``I'll tell you what. How can you ask for anything more than two Americans in the final of the U.S. Open playing a great five-set match?'' 
   Andre turned pro when he was 16 years old. We can all remember--I shouldn't say ``we can all'' because that was 13 or 14 years ago--a lot of us can remember when he turned pro. In those 13 or 14 years, he has changed. He won Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and was the No. 1 player in the world by 1995. 
   But by 1997, Andre had, as I have indicated, come across some tough times. But he has fought back remarkably well. He finished sixth in the world last year. Earlier this year, he was ranked No. 1. He is now No. 1 again. 
   In a period of 4 months, he won the French Open--coming back from two sets down in the final--reached the Wimbledon final, and won the U.S. Open, a truly phenomenal comeback. 
   Andre deserves to be congratulated not only for his tremendous tennis, but for all the great work he does for at-risk youth in Las Vegas. He truly has put his money where his mouth is. 
   The Agassi Foundation has helped poor kids in Nevada. That is an understatement. He personally raises millions of dollars. He is going to have an event this month. He has gotten some of his friends to come from Las Vegas. He will raise $3 million at that event, all of which will go into his foundation to help the youth of Las Vegas. 
   His exhibition against Todd Martin yesterday was exciting. Todd Martin is a great champion in his own right. His towering stature of 6-foot-6 was as towering on the tennis court. These two men were interviewed after the tennis  match, and that should certainly be an inspiration to all young people who want to compete because as winner and loser, they both talked as winners and indicated how important it was that they were able to represent the United States at the U.S. Open. 
   Andre Agassi is good on the court and off the court with the tremendous work he has done with the Andre Agassi Foundation. He has helped the youth of Las Vegas by giving them a helping hand in growing up to be successful individuals. His foundation even branched out to a program to help women and children who have become victims of domestic abuse. 
   Today on the floor of the U.S. Senate, I congratulate a great American, Andre Agassi, someone who will go down in the annals of history as a great athlete and who will go down in the annals of history in the State of Nevada as a good person. Andre Agassi is someone who is willing to help those who certainly aren't as fortunate as he. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I applaud my friend, Mr. TORRICELLI, for bringing up this important amendment today. 
   This amendment is very simple. It prohibits the expenditure of funds to administer or promote the use of steel-jawed leghold traps or neck snares on any unit of the National Wildlife Refuge System except for research subsistence, conservation, or facilities protection. 
   This is a no-brainer. These traps are inhumane. They are designed to slam closed. The result is lacerations, broken bones, joint dislocations, and gangrene. 
   Additional injuries result as the animal struggles to free himself, sometimes chewing off a leg or breaking teeth from chewing at the metal trap. 
   An animal may be in a trap for several days before a trapper checks it. 
   The American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, and the World Veterinary Organization have all declared leghold traps to be inhumane. 
   Our National Wildlife Refuges are the only category of federal land set aside for the protection and benefit of wildlife. It is inconceivable to me that, as a matter of federal policy, we allow recreational and commercial killing of wildlife on refuges with inhumane traps. 
   This is not even a close call. These traps are so inhumane and indiscriminate that they have been banned altogether in 88 countries. Additionally, they have been banned in four of our United States: California, Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts. Other states impose restrictions on them. 
   Let me be clear about one critical point: This amendment does NOT bar trapping on National Wildlife Refuges. Other traps, such as foot snares, conibears, and box and cage traps can be used for any purpose consistent with applicable laws and regulations on Refuges. 
   This amendment does not even forbid the use of steel traps or neck snares outright, although I think that would be a good idea. It just bans these two processes on National Wildlife Refuges. 
   As I mentioned at the outset, research, subsistence, conservation, and facilities protection uses are still allowed under this amendment. 
   In this day and age, there is no need to resort to inhumane methods of trapping, particularly not on those portions of our federal land that are set aside specifically for the protection and benefit of wildlife. I encourage all of my colleagues to support the Torricelli amendment.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the only reason I sought recognition is to speak before the motion to table is made. I apologize to my friend, the manager of the bill, recognizing how badly he wants to move on. I feel inclined to speak on this amendment. 
   I say to the Senator from West Virginia, my friend, I have had many inspirational times on the Senate floor, and most of them have been directly attributable to the Senator from West Virginia. If what we just listened to, was not inspirational, then someone wasn't listening. 
   I had the honor a week ago to participate in a parliamentary exchange with the British Parliament. I was able to meet with a small group of British parliamentarians, with a number of Senators in West Virginia. The hosts of that event were Senators BYRD and STEVENS. It was a wonderful weekend where we talked issues. 
   One evening we were able to meet and have a social event in a place called Kate's Mountain in West Virginia. I had been there only once before. I came to realize, on my first trip to West Virginia at Kate's Mountain, what that song, those West Virginia hills where I was born, means to someone from West Virginia because Kate's Mountain is part of those West Virginia hills. I appreciate those hills, even though I wasn't born in those West Virginia hills. Part of the entertainment that night, just a few days ago, was a blue grass band playing. Senator BYRD participated in the entertainment. He took the microphone and proceeded to sing. It was a wonderful, fun, entertaining evening. 
   Well, Mr. President, I can't sing. I can't play a musical instrument. But there is no one in the world that enjoys music more than I enjoy music. I have tried to play music. I have tried to sing. I can remember as a young man in high school, I wanted to sing. I went to try out for the choir at Basic High School in Henderson, NV. I can still remember the choir director, Chapman Wooten, a wonderful man, but he could understand talent when he saw it. He didn't see it in me. He said I should continue playing football and baseball and pass on the choir. 
   I didn't make the choir. In fact, I only was there a few minutes. But I still love music. I can't paint a picture. I have tried. My grandchildren paint better than I do. But I love to see people paint pictures, and I love to see the finished product. I have in my home paintings that may not be very valuable, but they are valuable to me. They are paintings I have bought because I loved those paintings. I can remember the first painting I ever bought. I was just out of law school. I went to the Tropicana Hotel in Las Vegas and a man by the name of McCarthy had an exhibit there. I don't know if he has ever made a living painting, but I gave him $75 for a painting that I still have. If you come in my home, there is the first painting that I ever bought. I bought that painting because it reminded me of my wife. It is a painting of a woman. I love that picture. 
   I was born and raised, as most of you know, in a little place called Searchlight, NV. We had very little entertainment in Searchlight. There wasn't a church to go to. I never went to a church until I went to high school. There wasn't one to go to. In the whole town there was one person who played a piano. 
   I don't know how well she played it, but she played the piano for Christmas programs. That is about all I can remember. She was a woman of some note. She was not noted for playing her piano. She had been married 14 times. I know that because she was married to a few of my uncles. But she played the piano. She was our music in Searchlight. Any program we had, she was part of it. 
   I am sure in that little town of Searchlight there were people who could have played, if there had been someone there to give them a lesson, someone who could paint a picture, if there was someone who could teach them how to paint a picture. In the entire time that I was growing up in Searchlight, I don't remember a single person playing a musical instrument because they didn't play one. I don't remember a single person painting a picture because they didn't paint a picture. There was no one there to help us, to encourage us. 
   The National Endowment for the Arts is a program that I envision as helping kids like HARRY REID growing up in rural America, rural Nevada. It also helps kids in urban America, but I think of it as to what I can relate to. The National Endowment for the Arts is a program that is important for people in this country. 
   I can remember first becoming acquainted with the National Endowment for the Arts because Senator BYRD allowed me to conduct some of the hearings when he was chairman of the Interior Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee. I conducted the hearings. I loved doing that. We conducted hearings relating to the National Endowment for the Arts. I became so impressed with the work that they do that I have been a fan ever since. 
   In Elko, NV, we benefit from the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. There is a great program; it is world famous now. It is called the Cowboy Poetry Festival. It took years to get off the ground. A man by the name of Cannon got it started. He started off in Utah, and he did everything he could because he had this idea that there was cowboy poetry that should be preserved and perpetuated. He couldn't get it off the ground. He went to private foundations. He did everything he could. They didn't think his idea was very good. He went to Elko, NV, and luckily the National Endowment for the Humanities, the National Endowment for the Arts helped him get this program started. Now it is world famous. You can't find a motel or a hotel room when this festival is occuring. People recite poetry. There are books on western American history that are written and talked about and presentations made. It is because of these programs, the National Endowment for the Arts, National Endowment for the Humanities. 
   In Nevada, we benefit all over. There are so many things. I have a spate of papers here talking about how great these programs are. One from Delores Nast. She doesn't teach art. She is not a teacher. She loves art, though. She writes: Many Nevadans believe strongly that part of our tax dollars should be directed towards support of our Nation's cultural and educational initiatives. 
   What an understatement. The most powerful Nation in the entire world can't spend a few dollars on helping kids from Searchlight, NV, learn to paint a picture or play a musical instrument. Yes, we can do that. We must do that. 
   I am not going to, as I say, hold up the manager of this bill. I only want to say that we in Nevada believe in the National Endowment for the Arts. There are some people who 
   criticize it, but they criticize anything dealing with government. I am proud of supporting the National Endowment for the Arts. I am proud of supporting a motion to table this amendment. It should be tabled overwhelmingly because we, the most powerful Nation in the world, need to spend more, not less, on the arts. 
   Mr. GORTON addressed the Chair.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Legal Amnesty Restoration Act of 1999. 
   This legislation would repeal the limitation on judicial jurisdiction imposed by an obscure, but very lethal provision of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996. Tucked into that massive piece of legislation was a provision, Section 377, which, in effect, stripped the Federal courts of jurisdiction to adjudicate legalization claims against the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Through this limitation, Section 377 has caused significant hardships, and denied due process and fundamental fairness, for hundreds of thousands of hard working immigrants, including several thousand in my home State of Nevada. 
   As a direct result of the 1996 legislation, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, with its hands tied by the 377 language, issued a series of rulings in which it dismissed the claims of class members and revoked thousands of work permits and stays from deportation. In Nevada alone, up to 18,000 people had been affected. Good, hard-working people who have been in the United States and paying taxes for more than ten years, suddenly lost their jobs and the ability to support their families. 
   I say to my colleagues that I have met with many of these people on several occasions, and I have been, firsthand, the pain that this cruel process had caused. Men and women who once knew the dignity of a decent, legal wage have been forced to seek work underground in the effort to make ends meet. Families who lived in homes have been disrupted by an inability to pay the mortgage. Parents who had fulfilled dreams of sending their children to college have seen those dreams turn into nightmares. Children who know that something is desperately wrong by the simple fact that Mom and Dad have not been working for almost a year. 
   Mr. President, allow me to add a brief history of what has caused these most unfortunate consequences. During the 99th Congress, we passed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. This law provided a one-time opportunity for certain aliens already in the United States who met specific criteria to legalize their status. In order to do so, these aliens had to show that they had resided continuously in the United States since January 1, 1982. 
   The statute established a one-year period from May of 1987 to May of 1988, during which the INS was directed to accept and adjudicate applications from persons who wished to legalize their status. In implementing the congressionally-mandated legislation program, however, the INS created new criteria and a number of eligibility rules that were nowhere to be found in the 1986 legislation. The result was that thousands of persons who were in fact eligible for legalization were told they were ineligible or were blocked from filing legislation applications. 
   Several class-action lawsuits were initiated, and several federal district courts entered interim relief orders blocking deportations while the additional INS restrictions were debated in the courts. These orders also typically required the INS to grant class members temporary employment authorization pending a final resolution of the legal cases. However, by the time the Supreme Court ruled in 1993 that the INS had indeed contravened the 1986 legislation, the one-year period for applying for legalization had obviously passed.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to seek amendment to the allocation for special grants for agricultural research under the Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service, Research and Education Activities. I respectfully request that $500,000 be added to this activity to fund the Nevada Arid Rangelands Initiative at the University of Nevada, Reno. This program is critical to Nevada, which has a higher percentage of its lands classified as arid rangeland than any other state in the union. 
   The mission of the Nevada Arid Rangelands Initiative is to develop research, management, and educational programs to promote healthy and productive rangelands and to support economic development of these rangelands in a sustainable manner. Healthy, productive rangelands are critical to the support of many rural families and communities and important to Nevada's quality of life. 
   The rangelands of Nevada are at risk from many factors including competing demands for water, loss of scarce riparian vegetation, invasive weeds, and wildfire. The Nevada Arid Rangelands Initiative will seek to develop innovative strategies for such items as simplified methods to assess rangeland health, the development of watershed grazing strategies, control of invasive weeds and the use of vegetative management strategies to control wildfire. 
   This money should be included in the following account: ``Competitive Research Grants, Natural Resources and the Environment.''

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, on July 1, 1999, President Clinton announced that the Commerce Department would implement changes to the United States export controls on high performance computers. By changing the limits on high performance computers, we will be increasing our national security and easing outdated regulations that are currently imposed on the thriving high tech industry and on government itself. 
   Mr. President, as you may know, I have followed this issue closely for the last eight months since the inception of the high-tech working group that I chair. I have met with many company leaders, both large and small, to discuss the issue of export controls on computers. I am convinced that if we don't immediately act to ease export controls, many American jobs may be at risk. Each day that our nations's companies can't compete in foreign markets, we are losing market share and eventually will be giving up our world dominance in the high-tech sector. 
   The bill that I am offering today reduces the review period from 180 days to 30 days to complement the Administration's easing of export restrictions by amending the National Defense Authorization Act of 1998.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I, too, stand to express my concern over the possible direction of the Treasury regulations. The Senator from Iowa and I worked long and hard to fix this problem in 1996. We worked with the various staffs here in Congress and at the Department of the Treasury to ensure that all contributions in aid of construction as regulated by the various state utility commissions were included under our legislation. We worked with the industry to develop a revenue raiser paid for by companies receiving relief in our legislation. I urge the Department to stick closely with the congressional intent of our amendment and look forward to working with my colleague to ensure that we reach the correct result on this issue.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, in a letter dated April 21, 1999, on a similar provision, then-Secretary of the Treasury Robert Rubin wrote to Senator MOYNIHAN that this ``provision could preclude the United States from meeting its financial obligations to repay maturing debt and to make benefit payments--including Social Security checks--also worsen a future economic downturn.'' 
   The lockbox in this proposal is potentially destabilizing in a manner reminiscent of the constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget. 
   I remind those who propose rigid 10-year schedules for reducing the publicly held debt that economics does not follow the agricultural cycle. There will be periods when surpluses, both on and off budget, will fall far short of projections. We should not impose a debt reduction schedule, enforced by a declining debt cycle ceiling, even if it can be overridden with 60 votes. To do so will risk default every time the debt ceiling is lowered.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, despite the recent declines in teen birth rates in general, the overall teen birth rate for 1996 is still higher than it was in the early to mid-1980s, when the rate was at its lowest point. In fact, United States has the highest rates of teen pregnancy and births in the western industrialized world. More than 4 out of 10 young women in the U.S. become pregnant at least once before they reach the age of 20--nearly one million a year. 
   Unfortunately, my home state of Nevada has the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country--140 pregnancies per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1996. 
   Teen pregnancy affects us all. Teen mothers are less likely to complete high school, and more likely to end up on welfare (nearly 80 percent of unmarried teen mothers end up on welfare). Teen pregnancy costs the United States at least $7 billion annually. The children of teenage mothers have lower birth weights, are more likely to perform poorly in school, and are at greater risk of abuse and neglect. The sons of teen mothers are 13 percent more likely to end up in prison while teen daughters are 22 percent more likely to become teen mothers themselves. 
   Teen pregnancy has become a significant problem in America's fastest growing ethnic group--the Hispanic community. Latinos currently constitute approximately 11 percent of the total U.S. population. By 2010, Latinos will be the largest minority group, and by 2050 approximately one-quarter of the U.S. population will be Latino.  
   Latinas have the highest teen birth rate among the major racial/ethnic groups in the United States. In 1997, the birth rate for Latina 15- to 19-year-olds was 97.4 per 1,000, nearly double the national rate of 52.3 per 1,000. Approximately one-quarter of the births in 1997 to teens aged 15 to 19 were to Latinas. Further, the teen birth and pregnancy rates for Latinas have not decreased as much in recent years as have the overall U.S. teen birth and pregnancy rates. 
   To combat the plague of teen pregnancy in this country, I am introducing the ``Teenage Pregnancy Reduction Act of 1999.'' In so doing, I join Congresswoman LOWEY, who has introduced the House companion bill. 
   The Teenage Pregnancy Reduction Act of 1999 will provide in-depth evaluation of promising teenage pregnancy prevention programs. Experts on teen pregnancy have informed us that such an evaluation is very needed. This three year evaluation will be funded at $3.5 million per year. The bill requires that a report of the evaluation's results be made to Congress, and the results be disseminated to the administrators of prevention programs, medical associations, public health services, school administrators and others. In addition, the bill provides for the establishment of a National Clearinghouse on Teenage Pregnancy Prevention Programs. Lastly, the bill provides $10 million for a one-time incentive grant to programs that complete the evaluation and are found to be effective. 
   Social problems like teen pregnancy are not happening in a vacuum, independent from other social problems. Nevada has the highest teen pregnancy rate, and it also has the highest high school dropout rate. Obviously, these two issues are related. Only one-third of teen mothers receive a high school diploma. 
   Senator BINGAMAN and I have offered a dropout bill similar to the teen pregnancy bill I introduce today. Both bills look to what states and communities are doing now and focus on those programs that are working. We can then help states and communities replicate these successful programs. But we are not going to totally solve problems like teen pregnancy through programs and legislation--we need to talk to our children. Studies show that teenagers who have strong emotional attachments to their parents are much less likely to become sexually active at an early age. We cannot legislate parents talking to their children, but we can provide the information and programs that will help parents work with their teens. 
   I would like to acknowledge the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy, whose mission is to reduce the teen pregnancy rate by one-third between 1996 and 2005. I think that we can accomplish this goal, and I will do all that I can to help.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I simply want to say I have every understanding of the consternation and the concern of my friends from Washington, California, and Illinois about the state of mining in America. They have concerns that should be raised. They have concerns that have been raised. However, this very narrow issue is being talked around. 
   The fact of the matter is, the picture that my friend from Washington held up, a beautiful mountain area in Washington, has nothing to do with what we are talking about tonight. 
   The fact is the pictures she showed were pictures from some other mining operation that probably took place at least 60 years ago. 
   Let's take, for example, a mine that is right over the Nevada border in California. It is called Viceroy Gold. It is in the State of the Senator from California, but it is a mine that is very close to the people of the State of Nevada. It is a short distance from the place I was born, Searchlight, NV. It took $80 million to get that operation in a situation where it could be mined. It started out as an old mine and was originally called Big Chief Mine around the turn of the century. After spending $80 million, this mine was developed. It is an open-pit mine. 
   I invite everyone to look at that mine because part of the requirements of being allowed to mine there is the land has to be reclaimed. This is an area where they have Joshua trees and some small cedar trees, lots of sagebrush. They have a nursery. When they decide to take some ore, some muck, some dirt out of the ground, they take the trees that are where this open-pit mine is going to be, and they save them. When that area is mined out, they have to reclaim the land. They fill it up and replant these trees. That is going on right now. 
   That mine only has about a 2-year life left. When the mine is finished, the land will look like it did before. That is one of the requirements. They put up a big bond which makes that necessary. It is not a question of they do it because they like to do it; they do it because that is a requirement of the State of California that they replace the land the way it used to be. 
   It is good to do all these scary pictures about mining. My father was a miner, and if my father thought there was gold 
   under my desk, he would dig a hole. That is the way he used to do things. But you cannot do that anymore. There are requirements that say you cannot do that. 
   I say to my friends from the State of Illinois, from the State of California, and the State of Washington, I have tried to change the 1872 mining law. We have been trying to do that for 10 or 12 years. We offered legislation to change that. We have been as far as conference to change it, but it is never quite good enough. No one is willing to go 50 yards; they want to go 100 yards. 
   I have always said: Let's change it; let's do it incrementally. It is similar to the Endangered Species Act in which I believe. People want to rewrite the Endangered Species Act totally. It will never happen. We are going to have to do it piece by piece. 
   Superfund legislation: I believe in the Superfund legislation. We are never going to reauthorize Superfund totally. We need to do it piece by piece. That is what we need to do with this mining law. 
   What are we talking about? Secretary Bruce Babbitt is only going to be Secretary of the Interior for another year and a half. He is not willing to go through the legislative process. What he wants to do is legislate at the Department of Interior, down at 16th Street or 14th Street, wherever it is. He is legislating down there, and he has admitted it. 
   Secretary Babbitt has indicated he is proud of his procedure and proud of the way he is doing it. This is what he has said:  
   ..... We've switched the rules of the game. We're not trying to do anything legislatively.  
   Here is what else he says:  
   One of the hardest things to divine is the intent of Congress because most of the time ..... legislation is put together usually in a kind of a House/Senate kind of thing where it's [a bunch of] munchkins .....  
   The munchkins, Mr. President, are you and me. He may not like that, but I think rather than taking an appointment from the President, he should do as the First Lady and run for the Senate and see if he can get it changed faster. 
   Our country is set up with three separate but equal branches of Government. The executive branch of Government does not have the right to legislate. It is as simple as that. What has been done in this instance is legislating. That is wrong. 
   What we are doing--and that is what this debate is all about--is not changing anything. We are putting it back the way it was before he wrote this opinion--he did not write it; some lawyer in his office wrote it--overturning a law of more than 100 years. 
   All these pictures are not the issue at point. I do not think any of my colleagues will agree that President Clinton or any of his Cabinet officers or anybody in the executive branch of Government have the legal ability to write laws. That is our responsibility, and that is what this debate is about today. 
   I recognize the 1872 mining law needs to be changed. Let's do it. I am not debating the fact that it needs to be changed. I have offered legislation at the committee level and the conference level to change the amount of money that mining companies pay when they get a patent. We all agree that should be done, but they do not want to do it because it takes away a 
   great piece of argument they have: You can get land for $5 an acre. 
   We have agreed to change it. It has been in conference where we said: If you go through all the procedures to get a patent, then you should pay fair market value for the land. We agree. Let's do it. 
   They keep berating these mining companies. Mining is in a very difficult time right now. The price of gold is around $250. Yesterday, the press reported that a company from a little town in Nevada called Battle Mountain in Lander County laid off 200 more workers. That little community has had a little bar and casino for some 60 years. That just closed. Mining is in very difficult shape.  
   I say to my friends who care about working men and women in this country, the highest paid blue collar workers in America are miners. I repeat: The highest paid blue collar workers in America are miners. They are being laid off because mining companies cannot proceed as they have with these jobs when the gold price has dropped $150 an ounce. It went from almost $400 to $250. They are really struggling. England just sold I do not know how many tons of gold. The IMF is threatening to sell gold. Switzerland is talking about selling gold. 
   Mining companies are having a difficult time maintaining. One of the largest mining companies in Nevada--the State of Nevada is the third largest producer of gold in the world. South Africa and Australia lead Nevada. We produce a lot of gold, but the confidence of the mining industry has been shaken tremendously. It is getting more and more difficult to make these mines profitable. 
   One mining company in Nevada, a very large company, has had two successive years of tremendous losses. We have one mining company that still has some profits, the reason being that they sold into the future. They are still being paid on a high price of gold which the free market does not support. 
   I say to my friends, let's change the mining law. All we are trying to do, I repeat, is not let Secretary Bruce Babbitt legislate. That is what he did. All this does is take the law back to the way it existed. 
   I heard my friend from Washington say: Why don't the mining companies--I may have the wrong word; ``dialog'' is not the word she used--have some dealings with Congress? They have tried. We are trying to come up with legislation on which we should all agree. 
   I hope my friends, for whom I have the deepest respect, understand this is a very narrow issue. I do not mind all the speeches. My friend from California, my friend from Washington, and my friend from Illinois are some of the most articulate people in the Senate. They have great records on the environment. My record on the environment is second to no one. I acknowledge I have defended the mining industry in this Chamber for many years, and I will continue to do so. I want everyone to understand I have tried to be reasonable on this issue, at least that is according to through whose eyes you look. I have tried to be reasonable on this issue before us today. 
   Also, I have tried to be reasonable on the mining issue generally. As my friends will acknowledge, in the subcommittee I offered a very minimal amendment. It was broadened in the full committee, which is fine. But what I have done, along with Senators BRYAN and CRAIG, is tried to change what was done in the full committee. 
   I think what we have done is reasonable. I tell my friends, basically, here is what it says. It says Babbitt's opinion does not apply to mining operations that are now ongoing and mining operations that are ongoing that need additional mill sites. It does not apply to new applications. I think that is fair.

   Mr. REID. In a second. 
   I think it is fair. I say to my friends, I think it should not apply to anything because I think the opinion is worthless and does not have any meat on its bones. I do not think the Solicitor has any right to offer the opinion that he did. But I think this amendment is an effort to kind of calm things down, to compromise things. I say to my friends, if you want the law changed, let's change it. I am happy to work with you. 
   I am happy to yield for a question without losing my right to the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. We can even talk about the effective date of this legislation. But the intent of the amendment is to protect those operations that are now ongoing. Secretary Babbitt has written a letter to me--that is part of the record of the committee--saying that mining operations that are now in effect would not be harmed by his Solicitor's opinion. What this amendment does is go one step further and say, not only the mining operations that are now in effect but those that are ever in effect that have filed a plan of operation to expand would also be protected. 
   So that is really the intent of the amendment. 
   I say to my friends, don't beat up on the mining industry. They supply good jobs. We are willing to change the law. I do not know if any of my friends are on the committee of jurisdiction, the Natural Resources Committee. I am not. I would be happy to work with you in any way I can, as I have indicated on at least one other occasion tonight. 
   We have tried. We have had legislation that dramatically changes the 1872 mining law that has gotten as far as the conference between the House and Senate, but it was not good enough. We have made absolutely no changes in the law since I have been in the Senate, going on 13 years. I want to make changes. There aren't too many people who are not willing to 
   make changes. 
   So I would hope we could tone down the bashing of the mining companies. They supply jobs. They are not trying to rape the environment. Under the rules that are now in effect, if they wanted to, it would be very hard to do. 
   In the place where I was raised, we have hundreds of holes in the ground, created in the years when mining took place there. There are a lot of abandoned mines we need to take care of. There are laws in effect. 
   In the State of Nevada you have to have fences around some of the holes so people do not ride motorcycles into them or do things of that nature. Abandoned mines that create a harm to the environment, we need to clean them up. I am willing to work harder to have money to do that. But let's limit what we are talking about to the harm that has already been done. Certainly we have a right to do anything legislatively we need to do to protect harm from happening in the future. That is what I am willing to do.

   Mr. REID. I said in my statement that since I have been here, the 1872 mining law hasn't changed. I meant it had not changed in its entirety. The fact is that we in the Senate and in the House changed the 1872 mining law. It was changed in significant ways, such as passage of the moratorium on patents and a number of things. I didn't want the Senator to think the law hasn't been changed. 
   I ask my friend from Illinois, what does he think the mining companies should do? Does he think there should be mining to some degree? Can he tell me? I would be happy to translate the message to them. What more does the Senator think can be done than they have done in the past few years? 
   Let me tell the Senator what they have done. They met with us when we were in the majority. They met with us when we were in the minority. They met with the other side of the aisle when they were in the minority and in the majority. They have agreed to bills. They have agreed to pay royalties. 
   I say to my friend, what more can they do? They want to be good citizens. They help with things. I can only speak for the State of Nevada. I think around the country they are good corporate citizens. They help with the schools. They pay their taxes. What more should they do?

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend that there is general agreement. The mining companies agree. Eight years ago, we went to conference and agreed to change the amount they paid when a patent is issued. 
   I also say to my friend that the mining companies signed off on a royalty. That was something initiated here. I have to ask someone here. It passed. I can't tell you that it passed. But it was on the Senate floor that a royalty was agreed to. 
   I say to my friend that I hope this is the beginning of a dialogue where we can really get something done. There is nobody that I have more respect for than the Senator from Arkansas, who was the spokesperson against mining companies for all the years I was here--the greatest respect in the world. But I say to my friend that he wanted all or nothing, and we kept getting nothing. 
   I hope my friends will allow us to improve something. We have made very small improvements. I say to my friend that those of us who support mining and the mining companies want changes. They know it doesn't look good, from a public relations standpoint, for them to pay $2.50 or $5 for a  piece of land. They know that. But there was something that passed the Senate which allowed the payment of fair market value. That was turned down in conference. 
   I say to my friend that I know how sincerely he believes in this. I will give him the line and verse. In fact, the Forest Service handbook talks about this very thing. In effect, the solicitor's opinion overruled their own handbook. I hope this will lead to improvement of the law. We all recognize it needs changing. I am willing to work with the Senator in that regard.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague, Senator KOHL, in introducing the ``Patient Abuse Prevention Act.'' This legislation would help protect our nation's most vulnerable citizens by keeping workers with criminal and abusive backgrounds out of our long-term care facilities. 
   It is simply too easy for workers with criminal or abusive histories to gain employment in long-term care facilities. A report released last year by the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) confirmed that current regulations were not sufficient to protect the frail and elderly from being placed in the hands of known abusers and criminals. If we do not take steps to keep workers with criminal and abusive backgrounds out of our long-term care facilities, the growing number of reports of abuse and theft in these facilities will only continue to increase. 
   The ``Patient Abuse Prevention Act'' would give employers the tools they need to weed out potential employees who are unfit to provide care to the elderly because of abusive or criminal backgrounds. Our bill would create a national registry of abusive workers within an existing database at HHS. It would also expand existing State nurse aide registries to include substantiated findings of abuse by all facility employees, not just nurse aides. States would submit any existing or newly acquired information contained in the State registries to the national registry. This would ensure that once an employee is added to the national registry, the offender will not be able to simply cross state lines and find employment in another facility where he may continue to prey on the frail and elderly. 
   Our bill would require all long-term care facilities to initiate a search of the national registry of abusive workers when considering a potential employee. If the prospective employee is not listed on the registry, the facility would then conduct a State and national criminal background check on the individual through the Federal Bureau of Investigations. 
   The Inspector General for the Department of Health and Human Services reports that 46 percent of facilities believe that incidents of abuse are under-reported. Our bill would require long-term care facilities to report all instances of resident neglect, abuse, or theft by an employee to the State. This would ensure that offenders are reported and added to the national registry before they have the opportunity to strike again. 
   Over the past few years, Senator KOHL and I have worked to ensure that our frail and elderly are not placed in the hands of criminals. During the 105th Congress, we introduced similar legislation and conducted hearings through the Senate Special Committee on Aging. This bill is a culmination of our efforts to institute greater protections for all residents of long-term care facilities. 
   One of the most difficult times for any individual or family is when they must make the decision to rely upon the support and services of a long-term care facility. Families should not have to live with the fear that their loved one is being left in the hands of a criminal. Last year, Richard Meyer testified before the Senate Aging Committee about the sexual assault of his 92-year-old mother by a male certified nursing assistant who had previously been charged and convicted for sexually assaulting a young girl. This legislation would prevent tragedies like this one from occurring in the future. 
   I have visited countless long-term care facilities in my home state of Nevada. During these visits, I have always been impressed by the compassion and dedication of the staff. Most nurse aides and health care workers are professional, honest, and dedicated. Unfortunately, it only takes one abusive staff member to terrorize the lives of the residents. That is why we must work to weed out the ``bad apples'' who do not have the best interest of the residents in mind. I urge you to join Senator KOHL and me in our efforts to provide greater protections for all residents of long-term care facilities.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have been designated by the Democratic leader to control the time on this resolution that is now before the Senate. 
   I feel a certain affinity toward rule XVI because it was my point of order that was appealed and overruled. In short, what this meant is that we were here on an appropriations bill. It had been standard procedure in the Senate for decades and decades and decades that when an appropriations bill came before this body, we did not offer legislative matters on that appropriations bill; it should be for the 13 subcommittees to deal with the money of this country and not append extraneous materials, extraneous legislative matters to an appropriations bill. 
   However, that is what happened on such a matter, a supplemental appropriations bill. The junior Senator from Texas offered an amendment dealing with the Endangered Species Act. I raised a point of order. The Chair  upheld my point of order and that was appealed, a vote taken in the Senate which overruled that decision, and it changed the precedence of this body. 
   It has caused legislating on appropriations bills as standard operating procedure in this body since then. For more than 4 years, that is what has taken place. 
   There is going to be a vote taken later on rule XVI. The minority is going to vote against it. We recognize that we will be overruled by virtue of the fact that we are in the minority. We are protesting basically because of what has gone on in the Senate these past several years. The fact is that we are not able to offer amendments to bills coming through this body. In short, the Senate has been treated similar to the House of Representatives. For those of us who served in the House, there is not much difference anymore between the House and the Senate. When a bill comes to this Chamber, there is, in effect, an order placed on that bill just as in the House saying how many amendments you can offer, how long you can debate each amendment, and in effect how the bill is going to be treated. 
   That is very much unlike the Senate. In decades past, when a bill came before this body, debate took place on amendments that were offered relative to that piece of legislation. That is not the way it is now. 
   The reason that is important is that we Democrats believe we need--the country needs--to debate campaign finance reform. In the State of Nevada, a small State populationwise, my opponent and I spent over $20 million last year in the election. It is hard to believe. The State of Nevada had less than 2 million people in it. But my opponent, Congressman Ensign from the State of Nevada, and I spent over $20 million. 
   How could that be done? It was done because in the so-called hard money counts in our campaign we spent about $4.5 million each, and in State party money we spent over $6 million each. That does not take into consideration the independent expenditures that took place for me and against me. 
   That is not the way campaigns should be, I don't believe. In the small State of Nevada, I repeat, over $20 million, probably closer to $25 million, $26 million was spent when you add in the independent expenditures about which I have talked. 
   That is an issue we should debate in this body. Maybe I am wrong. Maybe the American public, the people from individual States, want all that money spent. I doubt it. I think we should have a debate as to whether soft money, that is, corporate money, should be used for State parties and spend all this money on negative ads. I don't think so. 
   There should be a time, I believe, that we are able to debate education. The State of Nevada leads the Nation in high school dropouts. We are not proud of that, but that is a fact. I think we should be able to debate issues relating to that issue. 
   Senator BINGAMAN and I have legislation that would create within the Department of Education a dropout czar so that we could debate whether or not we should have in the Department of Education a person whose sole job it would be to work on curbing dropouts. Three thousand children drop out of high school every day in the United States. Over 500,000 kids drop out of high school every year in America. That is not the way it should be. Education is an issue we have not debated nearly enough in this body. 
   There are other issues we need to talk about: child care, minimum wage, the environment. There are so many issues we have not had the ability to talk about. That is what this debate is about. 
   I see my friend from the State of New York is here. I am managing this bill. I do not want to take a lot of time because I am sure there will be time later today to speak about issues. But the point is, rule XVI is being debated today as a result of a ruling of the Chair that was appealed. It was my point of order to the Chair that brought about this situation in which we now find ourselves. The point we in the minority want to make is that we should have full debate on issues, all issues. There should not be any arms or legs tied. We should be able to speak as we want on issues. We have not been able to do that. 
   I ask my friend from New York, how much time does the Senator wish?

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New York, surprisingly, in spite of the legislating on appropriation bills, we have passed, I think, seven appropriation bills at this stage, give or take a bill or two. But, for example, we were able, on Thursday, to pass Commerce-State-Justice, which had hundreds of amendments filed. It was only through the cooperation of the membership.

   Mr. REID. The Senator has graphically illustrated what happened under our present situation. Last fall, being more specific, that huge document we were asked to vote upon, we all came from our individual States, because we had been out of session, while a few people negotiated this bill for all of us.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from New York, the same thing is happening now. The mere fact that the Senate has passed an appropriations bill doesn't mean it is going to become law because we have to go to conference with the House. If we are fortunate enough to come up with a bill, it goes down to the President. He has said he is going to veto most of these appropriations bills. So that means we will be right back  where we started last year, isn't that the case? We will have a bill written in conference that you or I, or even the members of the appropriations subcommittees, have never seen; is that fair?

   Mr. REID. But under our present rules, I say to my friend, that is not only the rule, it is being done. 
   The minority leader has offered an amendment to this change we are discussing today regarding rule XXVIII, so that when you go to conference, the conferees could only work on the bills they have, the one from the House and the one from the Senate, and have to work on matters that are before them. They can't go outside that scope and start talking about wild horses in Nevada or they can't start talking about the wheat crop in North Dakota, if it is not in the conference report.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the statement made by the Senator from New York and the wisdom that he imparted to us is something we should all listen to. 
   Some have said: Well, we have to treat the Senate like the House of Representatives. We really can't debate measures. 
   I say to my friend from New York, and anyone else within the sound of my voice, we used to debate matters and let the cards fall where they did. A good example of that was the Budget Deficit Reduction Act of 1993. As Senators will recall, we had all kinds of statements of doom regarding that. The chairman of the House Budget Committee said: This plan will not work. If it does work, then I will have to become a Democrat. 
   Well, it has worked. We have now a budget surplus. But my friend from the House has not become a Democrat. 
   My friend, the chairman of the Finance Committee, said: It will flatten the economy. That has not been the case. 
   My friend, the senior Senator from Texas, said: I want to predict here tonight that if we adopt this bill, the American economy is going to get weaker, not stronger. The deficit 4 years from today will be higher than it is today, not lower. When all is said and done, people will pay more taxes. The economy will create fewer jobs. The government will spend more money, and the American people will be worse off. 
   Every statement made by my friend from Texas was absolutely wrong. The fact is that we had that bill. We had a debate. Without a single vote from my friends on the other side of the aisle, we passed that bill, with the Vice President breaking the tie. The deficit did not rise. In fact, it went away. 
   The economy got stronger, not weaker. More jobs were created; in fact, almost 20 million new jobs have been created since that legislation was passed. 
   The point I am trying to make is that we can debate issues, debate them in their entirety. We should do more of that. That is what this is all about.

   Mr. REID. I say also to my friend, he will remember when we had the debate about uninsured people who had no health care--who needed health care but had no insurance. That was a debate that came early in the Clinton administration, and we had a full and complete debate on that issue. It was debated at great length. 
   At that time, we had 38 million people with no health insurance. Now we have 43 million people with no health insurance. But the fact is, when you are in the majority, you have to take chances, as did the former chairman of the Finance Committee, the senior Senator from New York. You have to take chances. Health care was a good debate for the country. Does the Senator agree?

   Mr. REID. So I hope this debate will allow the majority to give us more opportunities to debate issues. It doesn't hurt to talk at length about issues. It is good for the country to talk about issues. It is good for the body politic. But we should legislate the way the Founding Fathers determined we should, and not have 1,500 bills that are prepared by 8 or 9 people when we have 535 Members of Congress. We have less than two handfuls of people that came up with that bill, and that is wrong. I think we need to change rule XVI, of course. We are going to protest and probably vote against that. But we also need to change rule XXVIII while we are doing it. If we do that, we will have a much more open and better legislative body. Does the Senator agree?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are here today talking about the change in rule XVI. We are also talking about the minority leader's effort to change rule XXVIII. 
   The minority today wants to talk about how we are being treated like the House of Representatives. In fact, if the majority were consistent and they were going to vote without any question to change rule XVI, they would also vote to change rule XXVIII, which in effect says you can't go outside the scope of the conference as the conference committees have done, especially in the appropriations field. 
   I am happy to see my friend from North Dakota here, the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee, who is in effect the educational arm for the minority.

   Mr. REID. I reminded my friend from Iowa just the other day of one of the first legislative sessions I attended while in the Senate. The Senator from Iowa came to the Senate a couple years prior to this Senator. It was 2:30 in the morning. We were debating an issue, and the Senator from Iowa felt very strongly about aid to the contras in Central America. Even though it was inconvenient, even though it was 2:30 in the morning, and even though most of us wished the Senator had not offered an amendment, the Senator from Iowa had the right at 2:30 in the morning to offer an amendment on a bill  that was before the Senate. There were no rules on that bill, and the Senator offered an amendment on aid to the contras because the Senator from Iowa felt strongly about that and he had a right to offer it. Does the Senator remember that?

   Mr. REID. I come from the neighboring State of Nevada, which has about 2 million people. We have a lot of things we would like to be talking about. The Senator talked about environmental issues. Our States share beautiful Lake Tahoe. There are environmental issues we need to be talking about that would protect that beautiful gem we share. We need to talk about minimum wage, fair wages, and the fact that women who work comparable jobs should make the same amount of money as men. We need to talk about campaign finance reform. I am sure, representing 33 million people, the Senator believes--and we came to the House of Representatives together in 1982--that we in the Senate should act and be treated as Senators, not as Members 
   of the House of Representatives. There is nothing wrong with Members of the House of Representatives, but that is a large body and they need different rules than we do; is that not true?

   Rule XVI was changed by virtue of the majority voting to change it. 
   I ask my friend this question: The minority leader has filed an amendment to change rule XXVIII. Rule XVI would say that there would be no legislation on appropriations bills. Rule XXVIII goes one step further and says: Fine. If we are not going to legislate on appropriations bills, then a conference committee should only be able to take up matters in the bill that they are conferencing and that has within it confined limits. 
   Will the Senator comment on whether or not he believes, if we are going to change rule XVI, we should also change rule XXVIII which would mean that a conference committee cannot do things outside the scope of the two bills they are dealing with?

I think we would be hard-pressed to say we could lift it, much less to have read it. Yet a few people in the conference committee, together with the White House, drew this bill. If we were working under the confines of rule XXVIII, that would not be possible. I appreciate very much the comments of the Senator from Wyoming, acknowledging that would also be a good idea.

   Mr. REID. If the Senator will yield just for another comment, I serve on the Appropriations Committee. I am very fortunate; I have been able to do that since I have been in the Senate. But, having said that, I think we need to get a process where we are doing more legislating on authorizing legislation than what we are doing. Almost all of our attention is now focused on the 13 appropriations bills, and we have kind of lost track of the fact that we should be legislators on things other than appropriations bills.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Wyoming, I think he is going to find a protest vote, saying we want a more open debate. We are going to support the change in rule XXVIII, and we are confident rule XVI will be changed if rule XXVIII were changed in addition to that. The minority leader is offering that as an amendment. I think it would be a pretty good day for the country. 
   But the conversations today on this side of the aisle, I say to my friend from Wyoming, have been to the effect we need to do more legislating. An example of the lockbox has been used. That is a very important concept, that we should lock away enough money from the surpluses to protect our Social Security system. But we would like to talk about that a little bit. Not talk forever; no one wants to filibuster that. That is something we believe in, too. But we may not believe in it exactly the way the majority has presented it to us. We have had three cloture motions filed on that particular bill and we have not been able to say a single word about it. That is what we are complaining about.

   Mr. REID. I do have a brief question to ask the chairman of the most important Energy and Natural Resources Committee. I asked a similar question--in fact, the same question--earlier this morning of the senior Senator from Wyoming who shares a lot of the interests of the Senator from Alaska. 
   He said he felt it was appropriate to change rule XVI. The minority leader is going to file a motion to amend rule XXVIII for that to go back the way it used to be. 
   In 1996, on the FAA authorization bill, a point of order was raised that the conferees brought back information and material that was not contained in either bill of the House or the Senate. A point of order was raised that it was not. The Chair ruled that it was true. It was overruled. 
   I say to my friend from Alaska in the form of a question, I hope in his support to change rule XVI that he will also look at rule XXVIII because, as the senior Senator from New York who spoke earlier today said and the senior Senator from West Virginia said, the problem we are facing is magnified even more so than what the Senator from Alaska stated. The Senator from Alaska was called back from his State, and I was called back from my State last fall, and we voted on a 1,500-page bill he had not read and, I am sorry to say, I had not read. I probably could not lift that bill, let alone read it. 
   The fact is, there was so much material contained in that, material to which I am sure the Secretary of Interior referred. He had stuff in that bill with which the Senator from Alaska had nothing to do with and it was put in, even though he is the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction. Certainly the appropriators did not work on it. It was done by the Chief of Staff of the White House principally, a few people from the Senate, a few people from the House, and they did the work for all of us. 
   I hope that my friend from Alaska, who certainly has so much to do with what we do around here, especially those of us in the Western United States, will look favorably also at changing rule XXVIII back the way it used to be.

   Mr. REID. That is absolutely true. I ask my friends, are they so afraid of discussing an issue, and are they so afraid they will lose a couple of Members and we will be right? Is that the problem? I don't know. Why won't they let us at least 
   offer an amendment?

   Mr. REID. It is absolutely the case. The fact is that all we want is to be treated like the Senate. My friend from Maryland served in the House of Representatives, as I did. That is a huge body, 435 Members. They need specific rules--and they have always had them--to move legislation along. You can't have unlimited debate in that body. But the Senate was set up differently. We do not need, or should we have, a rule on every piece of legislation that comes through, as does the House of Representatives. Does the Senator agree?

   Mr. REID. I remember that very clearly because I was the Senator who raised the point of order. It was on an appropriations bill, a supplemental appropriations bill. The junior Senator from Texas offered an amendment on the Endangered Species Act that would do great harm to that act. I raised a point of order it was legislating on an appropriations bill. The Chair, without question, upheld my point of order. There was an appealing of the rule, as the Senator said, and a longstanding rule, with all the precedence, was turned on its head. 
   Now it has been 4 years, and we have been working under this situation that was created by the majority. The minority didn't do that. But I say to my friend, the reason we in the minority are so concerned is because it is not only that rule they are going to overturn, the fact of the matter is that we don't have any opportunities to offer amendments, to debate substantive issues in this country, based upon the gag rule placed on all legislation brought here; isn't that true?

   Mr. REID. Is the Senator aware that the minority leader is going to offer an amendment to S. Res. 160 which will reinstate the scope of the conference report rule? That is when you go to conference and the conference committee must stay within the scope of the two bills on which they are working. It will be interesting to me to see if the majority will vote to support the overturning of rule XVI, which we know they will do, to see if they are logically consistent by going ahead and voting to also reinstate rule XXVIII. Also, this precedent was overturned in 1996 on the reauthorization bill. 
   Does the Senator think it would be consistent for them to vote to make rule XVI the way it used to be and rule XXVIII the way it used to be? How can you vote for one and not the other?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged to the majority. 
   The reason I say that is so the Presiding Officer, either in his capacity as Presiding Officer or as a Senator from Arkansas--we have been very diligent in the minority in using up all of our time. Both leaders have sought to have a time in the evening to complete our vote. If the time doesn't run off, the time is charged to the majority now. This could go on forever and we wouldn't vote until sometime late at night. 
   I ask unanimous consent that be the case. 
   If there is some objection from the majority leader, he can come right back and change that. 
   That is my unanimous consent request.

   Mr. REID. Thank you. 
   I say to my friend, for whom I have the utmost respect, I know how hard you work trying to move things along. I have tried to be as much help as I can be. But from the most junior Member of the Senate, Senator BAYH, to the most senior Member on this side, Senator BYRD, there has been a general belief today that we need to do more legislating, with fewer quorum calls; some more debate needs to take place. So I hope my friend understands the belief of the membership of the minority that we need to do more legislating. 
   I also say to my friend that I have asked--in colloquies here with Members from the majority who came to speak today--how is it logically consistent that you can vote to change rule XVI and not vote to change rule XXVIII? And they all three said--I only asked three the question--it is not logical to do that. 
   I hope that the majority would take a very close look 
   at rule XXVIII to see to it that we do not wind up with a situation like we wound up in last fall, with a 1,500-page bill that just a few people developed. 
   So I hope, I repeat, that the Senator will listen to the spirit of the debate today. It was not acrimonious. I think it was constructive criticism. We all love the Senate. You are the leader. We recognize that. But we need to move along and do more legislating as the Senate, we think, should be legislating. 
   I thank you very much for yielding.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, for several days, we have waited anxiously for evidence of news I did not want to believe. I did not want to believe that tragedy could come again to the Kennedy family. I did not want to believe that the Bessette family could lose two beautiful daughters in one tragic accident. But as of yesterday afternoon, I was confronted with reality. I am profoundly saddened by the tragic death of John F. Kennedy, Jr. and his wife, Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and her sister, Lauren. 
   My relationship with President Kennedy goes back almost 40 years. In 1960, I formed the first Young Democrats organization at Utah State University and worked hard as a young college student for the election of President John F. Kennedy. On the wall in my Senate office, I have a letter from Senator Kennedy written a few weeks written a few weeks before his inauguration as President in 1961. That letter is a thoughtful and considerate note thanking me for my efforts as a campus organizer. 
   As a young law student in Washington, I worked at night as a Capitol Police Officer. On more than one occasion, I remember President Kennedy's visit to the Capitol. In fact, in my capacity as a police officer, I walked past President Kennedy's casket while it laid in state in the Capitol Rotunda. 
   For three generations, the Kennedy family has contributed much to the political and cultural life of our Nation. Three members of the Kennedy family have served the Nation as U.S. Senators, and other members have served in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Ambassadorial Corp and other important positions of state. They also serve as leaders, in business and in the world of cultural affairs. 
   Historians will one day write that the Kennedy family is the most remarkable family in our Nation's history. They have endured tragedy after tragedy. But despite adversity, this family has persevered and found the will and strength to make our nation a better place. Since the presidency of John F. Kennedy, the Kennedy family has become part of the American family. For us in government, the Kennedy family is synonymous with the finest in American politics. They inspire us to dream; they teach use to enjoy life; they make us feel noble.  
   John F. Kennedy, Jr. had large shoes to fill as the son of a great President and a beautiful, elegant and strong mother. While John F. Kennedy, Jr. was born into the privilege and the fame of his family, he handled it better than anyone I know. His dignity, his sense of style, his connection to ordinary people was unsurpassed. 
   Finally, I admire the strength and courage of my friend and colleague, Senator TED KENNEDY. Senator KENNEDY is the patriarch of this great family. He has served the Nation and the people of Massachusetts with distinction in the U.S. Senate for almost four decades and the people of Massachusetts have repeatedly shown their gratitude for his service. Senator KENNEDY has given much to this country and yet he has never forgotten the legacy of his distinguished family. To Senator KENNEDY, to the entire Kennedy family, and to the Bessette family, I extend my condolences.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, while the two leaders are on the floor, the original point of order was made by me, so I believe I have a right to talk about this. 
   I am not going to talk about the substance of the amendment but talk about our two leaders. Speaking for Democrats and Republicans, we are very proud of our leadership. The majority leader and the minority leader, I think, do an outstanding job of representing their respective interests. The legislative branch of government depends on these two men leading their respective caucuses. 
   We should be doing less procedural battling and more substantive battling. I hope the majority leader hears what the Democrats are saying. We want to legislate. We are not trying to stop anything from going through. We want our rights to be protected. We want the ability to offer amendments. That is all we are saying. 
   This was proven in the very good debate we had. We were allowed to have the debate as a result of the work done by our minority leader. I think it is important we have more issues debated here. I hope during this weekend the two leaders realize, as I know they do,  the importance of having the Senate act as the Senate and that we start debating substantive issues. 
   I think this colloquy between the two leaders was very substantive and informative. I hope it will lead to a much better and more productive Senate.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as we prepare to agree to this amendment reauthorizing the COPS Program for an additional year, I wish to take a moment to recognize the work of the Senator from Delaware on this issue. The senior Senator from Delaware has offered an amendment that is very important to the country. He also, earlier this year, offered an amendment to the juvenile justice bill to reauthorize this program. That effort, supported by everyone in the minority, was defeated. 
   Fortunately, though, for the people of the State of Nevada and this country, we had the support of the police officers from all over the country, the district attorneys from all over the country, the sheriffs from all over the country. Law enforcement officers, officials, literally called upon us, their Senators, to express their overwhelming support for the reauthorization of this program. So I extend every bit of appreciation possible to the Senator from Delaware for his persistence and also for his ability to energize law enforcement officials in this country. It is because of their interest and their trust in the Senator from Delaware that we have reached this point. 
   I have in my hand four pieces of paper filled with the names of cities and towns, Indian tribes, universities from all over the State of Nevada, that have received help from this program, from Bolder City in the far southern tip of Nevada to the Yomba Shoshone Tribe in the northern part of the State. They received grants of money and police officers to allow the State of Nevada to be a more peaceful place. 
   Hundreds of police officers are now patroling the streets all over the State of Nevada as a result of the legislation that was previously passed. It is very important we move forward. 
   I speak as someone who has been a police officer, someone who has been a prosecutor, someone who has defended people charged with crime. I am convinced there are many important ways to cut back on crime, but there is nothing more important than having a police officer seen on the street. A police officer who is known to be in the area certainly will deter crime. 
   This program is good. We are fortunate we are now having another opportunity to make sure this program goes forward.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, one of the most important contributions to our national security is the annual stockpile report to the President and the Congress in which the safety, security, and reliability of the stockpile is assessed. 
   A very important piece of that report is an assessment by the Directors of the national security laboratories regarding the results of their technical investigations. 
   That assessment by the lab Directors combines scientific and engineering findings with expert professional judgment to form an independent evaluation of the quality and character of the weapon designs that make up our nuclear stockpile. 
   The scientific and engineering findings are derived from data developed at Pantex, at Oak Ridge's Y-12 plant, at the Kansas City Plant, at the Nevada Test Site, and at the national security labs, Sandia, Los Alamos, and Lawrence Livermore. 
   Experts from all of these sites combine their efforts to review and validate this information upon which the  effectiveness of our stockpile is determined. 
   More experts are convened to consider the ramifications of findings and the whole effort is finally integrated into a certification of the reliability, the safety, and the security of the stockpile. 
   It is absolutely essential that this effort be free of political or bureaucratic interference. 
   Scientists, engineers, and technicians at these national security facilities are hired for their expertise and diligence. 
   They are the only experts who know the significance of their findings and they should remain absolutely unimpeded in exercising their professional skills and judgment. 
   At the same time, the lab Directors earn their positions of trust and responsibility by a lifetime of outstanding technical accomplishments, demonstrated skill at integrating large complex bodies of information, and consummate integrity in reporting their conclusions. 
   They, too, should remain absolutely unimpeded in the performance of their stockpile certification responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, in matters as important as certification of our stockpile, the possibility of interference, or even just the appearance of the possibility of interference, can affect the exercise of skills and professional judgment. 
   These professionals should retain their independence from bureaucratic or political interference. 
   Unfortunately, this amendment takes a step that will destroy that independence by asserting that these civilian contractor employees ``shall be responsible to, and subject to the supervision and direction of, the Secretary and the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship or his designee.'' 
   So now there are at least three Federal officers, necessarily politicized by their positions, and undoubtedly bureaucratic in their origins, who can direct these professionals in any or all aspects of their work. 
   That is not an environment that promises assessments that are independent of political or bureaucratic interference. 
   Mr. President, the labs and production facilities should not be independent of Federal direction, but that direction must not be allowed to dictate technical findings or their interpretation. 
   My concerns in this regard could be adequately addressed by adding to the appropriate section the following clarification:  
   Such supervision or direction of any Director or contract employee of a national security laboratory or of a nuclear weapons production facility shall not interfere with communication to the Department, to the President, or to the Congress, of technical findings or technical assessments derived from, and in accord with, duly authorized activities.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I believe that we are all in agreement that the weapons program should remain within the Department of Energy, with clear lines of authority, responsibility, and accountability. 
   The sponsors of this amendment agree that the Secretary of Energy must have the ultimate authority for Department functions because he carries the ultimate responsibility. 
   The question is how does the Secretary exercise his authority in a way that allows him to meet his Cabinet-level responsibilities and still remain consistent with the restrictions in this bill. 
   The bill's prohibition against delegation of any supervisory or directive authority over the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship means that only the Secretary may intervene in Agency matters that may be inconsistent with Department policy. 
   That is backwards. 
   The provision for non-Agency review of Agency programs permits the Secretary to understand the compliance status of the Agency, but the prohibition against delegation requires the Secretary to appeal to the Under Secretary to respond to noncompliance findings. 
   That is a reveal of normal management flow of authority. 
   The Under Secretary should be the one making the appeal to the Secretary if the Agency is found to be noncompliant in a review. 
   Under the provisions of the amendment, the Secretary is likely to spend far too much of his valuable time ensuring that the Agency is complying with the Department policy. 
   A simple change in the bill would effectively accommodate this concern. 
   The amendment should specifically acknowledge that the Secretary is endowed with equivalent authority to meet his Department-wide responsibilities; and those include the Agency for Nuclear Stewardship. 
   Instead of prohibiting delegation of authority, the bill should provide direct appeal authority for the Under Secretary to the Secretary. 
   I understand the reluctance of the sponsors to encourage broad delegation of authority to non-Agency Department employees. 
   Nevertheless, compliance reviews of the Agency should be communicated to the Under Secretary and to the Secretary, with the presumption that any corrective actions would be implemented by the Under Secretary unless he determines to appeal to the Secretary.  
   This would encourage the Under Secretary to consider the merits of review findings and consider changes before involving the Secretary.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think we are all in agreement that the quality of American science benefits from participation by the national security labs. 
   And, I think all would agree that the quality and character of our nuclear stockpile benefits from non-weapons research and development at these labs. 
   The national weapons labs are truly multi-program labs that apply their skills and facilities, unmatched anywhere in the world, to the solution of critical nondefense problems as well as defense problems. 
   I do not believe for one moment that any of the bill's sponsors intend to isolate the weapons labs from their scientific roots. 
   But I do believe that the amendment's restrictive language that assigns direct responsibility and authority to the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship for ``all activities at the Department's national security laboratories, and nuclear weapons production facilities'' will do just that. 
   For example, the Director of the Office of Science is responsible for research in high energy physics, a topic of particular interest and skill at the weapons labs. 
   But, according to the amendment, the Director has no authority over high energy physics work that might be performed at Lawrence Livermore National Lab. 
   According to the amendment, only the Under Secretary for Nuclear Stewardship can have responsibility and authority for work at that lab. 
   Mr. President, I suppose that the Director of the Office of Science could simply ``trust'' the Under Secretary to do the ``right thing'', but that is not the way things normally work. 
   A far more likely outcome in my opinion would be that the Director would choose to assign work to a University or other source of skills, regardless of the lost opportunity at these superb weapons labs--just in order to retain authority over things for which the Director is responsible. 
   In the same way that the Secretary needs to retain authority over functions for which he is responsible, other functionaries in the Department need to retain authority over work for which they are responsible. 
   There has been unanimous agreement among my colleagues on both sides of the aisle as well as among the members of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board that no person should be assigned responsibility without appropriate accompanying authority. 
   So I think we should be able to agree on this matter. 
   I understand that we are very near agreement on this matter with some differences remaining between whether it is the Secretary or the Under Secretary who ensures that the national security labs remain available for appropriate scientific work for other agencies and other parts of the Department. 
   I hope we can arrive at some common ground on this issue. 
   It does not seem wrong to me to call for the Secretary to establish policies regarding the availability of the national security labs since the Secretary is, according to the underlying amendment, responsible for all policies at the Department of Energy. 
   So I hope my colleagues can continue to work toward a bipartisan agreement that will strengthen this legislation and allow it to endure.

   Mr. REID. I say to the majority leader, there are ongoing discussions. There was a hearing today in the Senate on this very issue. There are meetings that are going to take place today on that issue. I have spoken to the Secretary of Energy as recently as last evening. 
   We are really trying to work something out. I think parties on both sides are trying to work something out. I think it would be to everyone's best interest that when we do bring this up, there is some degree of certainty that it will be resolved. 
   We also understand, without any question, the importance of the intelligence authorization bill. Senator KERREY, the ranking member of this committee, has expressed, on numerous occasions, how important it is we move this legislation. So I say to the leader and Members of this body, we are doing our utmost to resolve this issue as quickly as possible.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the fact of the matter is, in the United States of America, this great country we live in, there are basically two groups of people who cannot be sued: foreign diplomats and HMOs. That is not the way it should be. We are saying HMOs should be treated like every other entity in the United States. 
   Today, even an HMO involved directly in dictating, denying, or delaying care for a patient can use a loophole in what we call ERISA to avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. The American people simply do not support that. ERISA was designed to protect employees when they lose pension benefits to fraud, mismanagement, and employer bankruptcies, which occurred so often during the 1960s. 
   The law now has the effect of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care, with no effective remedy for patients. What they are trying to do is strike a provision from our bill which simply ensures HMOs can be held accountable for their actions, a responsibility of every other industry to consumers. They talk about this in vague abstract, as if this is some big cabal to change the law. All we want to do is make the law apply to HMOs. 
   Let's talk about a real person. Florence Corcoran is an example of the need to hold HMOs accountable. She lost a baby because the HMO refused the doctor's request for hospitalization in the last days of her pregnancy. The HMO would pay for only 10 hours of at-home care. During the final months of pregnancy, when no one was on duty, her baby went into distress and died. Because Florence received health care coverage through an employer, they had no recourse or remedy for the death of this baby. The HMO was not responsible under the law for any cost because the Corcorans never incurred any medical expenses for the loss of their baby. 
   The court of appeals--the court that is highest except for the Supreme Court in this country--said, and I quote from a Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   The result ERISA compels us to reach means that the Corcorans have no remedy, State or Federal, for what may have been a serious mistake. This is troubling for several reasons. First, it eliminates an important check on the thousands of medical decisions routinely made in the burgeoning utilization review system. With liability rules generally inapplicable, there is ..... less deterrence of substandard medical decisionmaking.  
   In another case, another Federal judge, Judge William Young, said:  
   ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity that protects health insurers ..... from potential liability for the consequences of the wrongful denial of health benefits.  
   That is from the case of Andrews-Clarke v. Travelers Insurance Company, decided last year. 
   All we want to do is be able to hold the HMOs accountable. 
   What about the cost of this? We have an independent study by Coopers & Lybrand that found the cost to be as little as 3 cents per person per month. We can handle that. That is fairness. 
   This is not going to touch off a flood of lawsuits. In fact, it will make people feel better about their health care and, in fact, make health care providers be more diligent in rendering adequate, complete care to their patients. It is not going to create massive lawsuits, as Coopers & Lybrand said. 
   The Republican provision leaves patients with no recourse if benefits are denied. That is wrong. 
   I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, our bill that is now being attempted to be wiped out as far as liability has not established a right to sue but simply says Federal law cannot break what the States say are appropriate remedies for patients and families who are harmed. 
   Our legislation protects employers against liability. 
   I repeat. Our legislation protects employers against liability. 
   It allows patients who are harmed by an insurance company's decision to deny or delay care to hold their insurance company accountable--not their employer. 
   There is a lot of talk about the ads that are being run that the employers are going to be held responsible. That is absolutely not true. 
   Under the Republican amendment, if someone dies of cancer because an insurer refuses needed tests, all the insurer is responsible for is the cost of that test. It may be $20 or $30. That will be the extent of liability. Doctors and other health providers can be sued for harm, pain, and suffering. Yet health plans that make decisions to deny or delay care will continue to be off the hook. Doctors and other health providers can be sued, and yet these HMOs continue to be left off the hook. 
   It is ironic that those who defend States rights so much on the floor of the Senate obviously don't follow through because they are the loudest and the first to use Federal law to protect health insurers that injure patients. 
   That is another way of saying the insurance industry is being protected by the majority. 
   Democrats believe insurance companies should be held accountable when their decisions lead to injury or death. And our opponents claim that isn't the way it should be. They say they should be protected in this separate category, as has been pointed out about the foreign diplomat. 
   In fact, I repeat what I said earlier this morning. An independent study by Coopers & Lybrand, the international accounting firm, found that the provision in our bill to hold health plans accountable would cost as little as 3 cents per person per month. 
   Our legislation is directed toward patients, not profits. Our legislation wants to maintain and reestablish the party-physician relationship, which the Republican, the majority, have attempted to destroy with their protecting of the HMOs. 
   The Republican, the majority, bill is an insurance protection bill; ours is one that protects patients.

   Mr. REID. If the Senator is accurate in his statement, it would have said the only time an employer can be held responsible is when the employer is involved directly in a specific case and makes a decision that leads to injury or death. 
   Of course that is fair. If an employer makes a decision--not the employer's HMO, not the employer's doctor, but the doctor himself is involved in making a decision that leads to injury or death--that seems fair to me.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the facts are that the Republican majority have offered a number of feel-good amendments. Everyone should understand that these amendments, even if they pass, will only cover 40-plus million Americans. Our amendment covers over 160 million Americans. Even though the provisions they have stuck in this amendment are weakened compared to the Democratic provisions dealing with external appeals, provider nondiscrimination, points of service, continuity of care, it is just the same as the amendment we offered for 50 minutes. Advocates of that amendment came from the minority side and presented their arguments to the Senate, to each other. The majority was not here. They did not offer a single word in opposition to the amendment that was offered by the minority. 
   This can best be summed up not by a Senator, not by some paid advertisement on television. I think the best  way to sum this up is by a New York Times statement by Bob Herbert today entitled, ``Money versus Reform.''  
   Donna Marie McIlwaine was 22 when she died on Feb. 8, 1997. She is buried in the Chili Rural Cemetery in upstate Scottsdale, N.Y. 
   The managed-care reform legislation that has been the focus of a furious debate in the Senate was essentially an effort to make it easier to save the lives of patients like Ms. McIlwaine. 
   The Republican Party, flooded with money from the managed-care industry, gives lip service to the idea of protecting patients, but then does the bidding of the companies that are the source of all that cash. 
   It's a tremendous scandal. No one can seriously argue that lives are not being lost. 
   Ms. McIlwaine went to the doctor several times in the week before she died, complaining of pains in her chest and shortness of breath. According to her family, she was diagnosed with an upper respiratory infection and ``panic attacks.'' 
   In fact, she was suffering from pneumonia and a blood clot in her left lung. Her mother, Mary Munnings, told me yesterday that her daughter had been screaming from excruciating pain before finally lapsing into unconsciousness and dying at home on a Saturday night. 
   There was no need for her to die. Ms. Munnings said that when she contacted the office of her daughter's primary-care physician the following Monday, she learned that Ms. McIlwaine had not been sent for the laboratory tests that would have properly diagnosed her condition. She said that when she asked why not, she was told that ``they couldn't justify'' the tests to her health maintenance organization. 
   So we have Donna Marie McIlwaine dead at age 22. 
   Most of the country understands that an unconscionable obsession with the bottom line has resulted in widespread abuses in the managed care industry. Simply stated, there is big money to be made by denying care. It is now widely known that there are faceless bureaucrats making critical diagnostic and treatment decisions, that some doctors are being retaliated against for dispensing honest advice, that women have had an especially hard time getting the care they need, and that patients have died because they were unable to gain admittance to emergency rooms.  
   Mr. President, that is what this debate has been about. I quote further:  
   The so-called patients' bill of rights, sponsored by Democratic Senators Tom Daschle and Edward Kennedy, was an attempt to curb these and other abuses. The managed-care industry wanted no part of the legislation, which meant the Republicans wanted no part of it. The Democrats had to virtually shut down the Senate before the Republican majority would even agree to bring this matter to the floor for a debate. 
   The Republican whip, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, could hardly have been clearer about his party's desire to avoid the issue. ``I don't want our members to go through a lot of votes that can be misconstrued for political purposes,'' he said. 
   The Democrats succeeded in forcing debate on the bill, but they haven't gotten the patient protections they sought. What occurred on the floor of the Senate this week was a G.O.P.-sponsored charade in which one Republican senator after another talked about protecting the health of patients while voting to protect the profits of this industry. 
   It was a breathtaking exercise in hypocrisy. It was as if George Wallace had spoken earnestly about the need to admit black students to a public school in Alabama while standing in the doorway to block their entrance. 
   Some face-saving measures were passed by the G.O.P. majority, but the essence of managed-care reform was defeated. In the end, it didn't matter that Mary Munnings had needlessly lost her daughter, or that a parade of managed-care victims had traveled to Washington to detail their horror stories, or that organizations representing doctors, patients and their families had lined up en masse in support of reform. 
   All that mattered was the obsession with the profits of the insurance companies and the H.M.O.'s. 
   Eventually substantial improvements will be made in the delivery of effective and affordable health care to Americans. It will take years but it will happen. And then the country will look back and wonder (as we have with Social Security, Medicare and the like) why anyone was ever opposed.  
   Mr. President, that is what this debate is all about. It is a debate about protecting the insurance industry or protecting American patients. I am sad to report, money is going to win. Money is going to prevail over American patients who need help. It is as simple as that. 
   It is whether or not a doctor can make a decision for a patient or a bureaucrat is going to make a decision for a patient. It is a question of whether we are going to be driven by profits or patients. Let us hope some day patients will prevail. 
   I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Maryland.

   Mr. REID. I will take 2 minutes off the bill in addition to that. 
   Mr. President, the statements of the Senator from Vermont and my friend from Maine basically are cynical and very unreasonable. We have given the majority the opportunity to vote on drive-through mastectomies and also to maintain clinical trials. We could do that by voice vote. We could save a lot of time. The decision has been made by the majority to make sure that we do not have the opportunity to pass the clinical trials aspect of this bill. 
   They are always promising they are going to come back with something else a little better later. The fact of the matter is, this is not a Hobson's choice. What they are attempting to do is cynical and unreasonable. 
   Senator LOTT said this morning in his opening statement, Republicans have a medical doctor to support their positions. And I have the greatest respect for the junior Senator from Tennessee. The fact is, with his medical knowledge, though, he should relate the facts. And the fact is, on page 8341 of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of July 13, 1999, Senator FRIST said, among other things, ``Let me share with Members what one person told me. Dr. Robert Yelverton, chairman of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.'......'' 
   Fact: My friend from Tennessee never spoke to Dr. Yelverton. 
   Fact: Dr. Yelverton, even if he had spoken to him, disagrees with statements made by Senator FRIST about him.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to direct a question to the manager of the bill, the Senator from Vermont. There is a provision in your bill--by the way, let me, for everyone, just explain. Because of the way we were forced to debate this issue, we have been unable to look at this amendment. We just got this amendment. What happens in the ordinary course in the Senate is if somebody offers an amendment, under normal conditions, we would ask for a quorum call so we could take a look at the amendment before the debate started. We cannot do that. Our time is running as we speak. So we are trying to work our way through this amendment they have jammed in here at the last minute without giving us any notice as to what was going to be in it. 
   But my question to the Senator from Vermont is, there is a provision--in fact, it is the first provision in the bill--that includes long-term care insurance. Would the Senator from Vermont tell the minority how much this is going to cost and from where the money comes? 
   I would like the RECORD to note the dull silence.

   Mr. REID. I think this is an interesting argument, to say the least. We have, on this side, striven, worked very hard to make sure there are some benefits for long-term care. It is great that there is some acknowledgement they want to do that, but in this age of frugality, it is interesting that the majority is willing to spend $5.4 billion with no offset. 
   Anything we have set forth in this bill had offsets. We looked at the Superfund as an appropriate offset, and the only complaints we heard were from the majority in this regard. In short, it appears that we have, as the Senator from California pointed out, a provision to help women that really doesn't help women. Helping the women which is about 20 million women, is not mandatory. The HMO could do it if they want to. It is permissive. It is like having nothing. 
   We have learned from a letter from the President of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that at least a third of the women who want to go to a gynecologist in these HMOs are refused. This amendment, the little bit that we have been able to see in the last few minutes, it is clear, has no substance. It is a sham. It is a phantom. 
   It is, as I pointed out in my opening statement, a game that I first learned when I went to New York, the shell game. Every time you look under one of these shells that the majority gives us, it is empty. There is nothing there. You keep looking, hoping that one of the times you are going to pick up a shell and there is going to be something of substance. This amendment that we have been able to see, again, is similar to the rest of the game that has been played here the last 3 days. 
   The shells appear. We anxiously pick one of them up. And just like the street game in New York, they are empty.

   Mr. REID. And a right that doesn't mean anything. It says that the group health plan described in paragraph 2 may treat the ordering of other care, ``may treat.'' That says, as my friend from Massachusetts has talked about for 3 days, if the insurance company decides it is good for them; right? What are 
   they going to decide is good for them? The bottom line, what is going to give the HMOs another top $10.5 billion in profits.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have gone over this before. Senator KENNEDY made the same offer. Our legislation says that anything, as set forth by the Senator from North Carolina, is appealable. It is as simple as that. It is appealable. They are depending on a legal opinion from some insurance lawyer. We are not willing to do that. We want appealable as part of the legislation. They are unwilling to do that for obvious reasons, because their legislation is dictated by the insurance companies. 
   I also say that the majority leader today bragged about one of his Members. I would like to brag about one of our Members. 
   We have JOHN EDWARDS, a new Senator from the State of North Carolina, who has represented the injured, the maimed, and the wrongfully killed for many years. He is one of the prominent attorneys in the United States. He is one of the finest representatives of protecting the rights of the oppressed and injured. 
   That should be spread across the RECORD of this Senate. 
   We have heard some people boasting about Members on the other side. We have one of the finest lawyers in America, now a Member of the Senate. We are very proud of that. 
   I think he has made a very clear case that the reason they are unwilling to agree to his simple words ``it is appealable'' is that they don't want it appealable. They know it is not appealable. 
   Mr. President, will the Chair indicate to the Senator how much time the minority has left on this amendment?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this past Saturday we watched a very interesting spectacle. It was an athletic contest. There were no arguments with referees. There was no vile language. There were no lewd gestures. There were no demands by the participants for more money. There were no pleas from any of the players that they didn't get a fair opportunity to play, that they should have had more opportunities to shoot for a goal. It appeared to be a real team effort, a team effort by daughters and mothers. 
   We watched a great athletic contest between the United States and China for the World Cup soccer championship. The U.S. women's soccer team won on penalty kicks. There could not have been a more exciting game. 
   I have had the opportunity to watch many soccer games, as my youngest boy played on three national championship soccer teams at the University of Virginia. It is a great sport. Certainly the sport was exemplified in the work of these women last Saturday. Throughout the tournament, the U.S. team emphasized what it means to play as a team. This was a team effort. It was team spirit that helped them win on Saturday. 
   There were really no standouts, even though there are great athletes on both sides. The final penalty kick was by Brandi Chastain, but she was just one of the players that day. Briana Scurry made her most crucial save against China's third penalty kicker, Liu Ying, by diving to her left based particularly on instinct. Kristine Lilly saved what looked to be China's winning shot with a header while standing at the goal line in the first overtime. Mia Hamm, who  is a superstar, the Michael Jordan of women's athletics, led the attack. While she failed to score, she kept pressure on the Chinese for most all of the game. Michelle Akers, at 33 the oldest team member, a woman who suffers from Epstein-Barr, or chronic fatigue syndrome, played as if she would never be fatigued until the last minute of regulation play. She literally was carried off the field, succumbing to dehydration and exhaustion. She was certainly a stalwart of this team effort. 
   This team has captured America's heart. A crowd of over 90,000 people watched that game. Cumulative attendance for the U.S. team's 6 victories was 412,486, an average of almost 70,000 a game. The 90,000-plus that watched this game was the largest crowd to watch an athletic contest among women. This team, that averaged 70,000 people watching each of its contests, was a constant reminder that this event was seen as a bellwether for women's athletics in America. Could women's teams fill stadiums? Could they draw advertising and television viewers in a nonolympic event? The answer to each of those questions was a resounding yes. 
   While most of their success is a result of the hard work and dedication of each team member to the sport of soccer, their brilliant play on the field, and their personalities off the field, they were aided even more in the fact this came about as a result of title IX. 
   There are many heroes in bringing about title IX. We could name Molly Yard, who more than four decades ago started talking about why women deserve to be treated equally in athletics. We could talk about Senators Birch Bayh from Indiana and George McGovern of South Dakota who led the way in the Senate against sex discrimination in higher education programs. 
   But there is no need to talk about any one individual. The fact is that title IX makes a great case for American women. 
   I indicated that my youngest son is a good athlete. He really is a great athlete. But the fact of the matter is, he inherited his athleticism from his mother, not from his father. The fact is, his mother and I went to high school together. 
   The only thing that his mother, my wife, could do in high school was be a cheerleader. As athletic as she was, she could not do anything else because there was nothing else for her to do. She was not entitled to play any other athletics. Title IX says that is not the way it is to be. 
   Title IX has been an outstanding program. It has allowed women to build their character and athleticism just as men did for many decades. They are building their character, as seen in this team, this women's athletic team--the World Cup champions. 
   Women are now seen as sports stars in their own right, not through their sons but through themselves, from Mia Hamm in soccer to Sheryl Swoopes in basketball, and as shown by the inspiring story of Dr. Dot Richardson, the captain of the American Olympic softball team, who left her triumph in Atlanta to go to medical school. That is what title IX is all about. And Dot Richardson exemplifies what has been accomplished on and off the field because of women's athletics. 
   Before the passage of title IX, athletic scholarships for college women were rare, no matter how great their talent. After winning two gold medals in the 1964 Olympics, swimmer Donna de Varona could not find a college anyplace in the United States that offered a swimming scholarship. She was one of the finest, if not the finest swimmer in the world at that time. She could not find one because it did not exist. 
   It took time and effort to improve the opportunities for young women. Two years after title IX was voted into law, an estimated 50,000 men were attending U.S. colleges and universities on athletic scholarships but only about 50 women. 
   In 1973, the University of Miami in Florida awarded the first athletic scholarships to women--a total of 15 in swimming, diving, tennis, and golf. Today, college women receive about a third of all the athletic scholarships that are given. That is good. It should be half. But a third is certainly a step in the right direction. 
   It is important to recognize that there is no mandate under title IX that requires a college to eliminate men's teams to achieve compliance. 
   The critical values learned, though, are that women are entitled to equality. Those things learned from sports participation--including teamwork, standards, leadership, discipline, self-sacrifice, and pride in accomplishment--are equally important for young women as they are for young men. 
   These women who have captured America's attention over the last 3 weeks are all children of title IX. They came to age athletically at a time when high schools and colleges were required by law--a law that we passed--to treat them fairly. 
   These women have set an excellent example for the thousands and thousands of young girls who have followed their World Cup play over the last 3 weeks. 
   I was listening to something on public radio this morning where they interviewed young girls who attended their celebrations yesterday. They were saying they wanted to be just like them. That is important. 
   So I congratulate all them and wish them continued success in the future. 
   I have a resolution that I would like to introduce later in the day. I certainly invite everyone to join with me. I would certainly be willing to take a back seat to the women of the Senate, as we do a lot of times around here, to allow them to be first in line to sponsor this resolution. So at a later time today, I would like to introduce this resolution and hope that it would clear both sides of the aisle to give these women the recognition they deserve today, to congratulate the U.S. women's soccer team on winning the 1999 Women's World Cup championship.

   Mr. REID. I appreciate very much my friend from North Dakota commenting. I say to my friend from North Dakota, it is extremely interesting that young girls recognize that they do now have equal opportunity. 
   I was at a small school in rural Nevada and getting ready to speak to a group of students who were assembling. I was in a holding room waiting to speak, and there were two girls in the room with me. They were wearing their letter sweaters. One of them was a sprinter and one played softball. 
   I said: Do you know why you can participate in athletics? 
   They said: No. Why? 
   Because we passed a law saying if boys have a program in athletics, girls have to have something that is equal to the program the boys have. 
   They did not know that. They just thought girls had always participated in athletics. One of the girls said: I would just die without my athletics. 
   Title IX is a program that of which we should all be proud. It has really done a great deal to equalize athletics for boys and girls in America. That is the way it should be.

   Mr. REID. I can remember the first time I went to New York 
   as a young man. My wife and I, of course, traveled the streets of New York. We walked, and there were a lot of fascinating things. But one of the things I will never forget is the people on the streets who were involved in shell games. I did not participate in any of them, but they would try to get people to come. They would move these little markers around. You could never win. No one ever won. None of the people they got to participate in these shell games ever won. I had had enough experience from going to carnivals as a young man not to participate in those games because there are certain games you can never win. 
   What is happening with the majority is they have a shell game going on. They are here today pronouncing what is so good about their bill. But the fact of the matter is, it is a shell game. Because you pick it up, and what they talk about is never there. The important part of what they are talking about is never there. Pick it up, and it is gone. 
   What am I talking about? The Senator from Massachusetts has talked about the bill of the Republicans covering only about one-fourth, about 25 to 30 percent, of the people that our bill covers. That is part of the shell game. You pick it up and 75 percent of it is missing. 
   We are talking about passing a real patient protection act, a bill that covers 161 million Americans, not 25 percent of 161 million Americans who receive health care through some form of managed care. 
   Our bill is not a bill that omits 113 million Americans. Our bill ensures access to the closest emergency room without prior authorization and without higher costs. 
   There have been lots of stories told about people wanting to go to an emergency room but having to check first. I participated in an event this afternoon where an emergency room physician talked about what is happening with managed care and how an emergency room physician never has the opportunity, under managed care, to really do what they need to do because of: How did that patient get there? Did they come on their own? Did they get prior approval? 
   Our bill is not a shell game. As to emergency care, you pick up the shell and under it the Republicans give you nothing. Our bill ensures access to qualified specialists, including pediatric specialists, unlike the Republican bill, a bill that limits access to specialists and does not guarantee that children may see a pediatric specialist. 
   We live in a world of specialization. When your child is sick, you want your child to go to someone who is a pediatric specialist. Whether it is a pediatric oncologist specialist, whether it is a pediatric orthopedic specialist, you need to be able to take your child to the person who can render the best care. But when you pick up this Republican shell where they talk about ``they get everything,'' and you want a pediatric specialist, it is empty; you cannot get it. 
   Our bill, the minority bill, guarantees that women may designate their obstetrician/gynecologist as a primary care provider. Why is that? Because that is, in fact, the reality in America. Women go to their gynecologists. That person treats them when they have a cold, when they are sick from something dealing with whatever the cause might be. They look to their gynecologist as their primary care physician. 
   Under our legislation, it guarantees that women may designate their OB/GYN as a primary care provider. But what happens under the Republican bill? It makes no guarantees and limits this to only a few select women. 
   Again, you look up and you see this shell game and you see all these promises. You think you are going to score big. You pick up this shell, and there is nothing there for women that guarantees their OB/GYN as a primary care provider. 
   The junior Senator from Wyoming came to the floor and again tried to move this shell around. What was his shell game? The junior Senator from Wyoming said that this was national health insurance--those bad words: national health insurance. Of course, this  has nothing to do with national health insurance, absolutely nothing. But, of course, this is part of the shell game: We want to frighten people; we want to frighten and confuse people, as the health insurance industry is doing as we speak by spending millions of dollars with false and misleading advertisements. 
   The insurance industry, as the Senator from Massachusetts pointed out, opposes this legislation. Hundreds of groups support this legislation--hundreds of groups.

   Mr. REID. This isn't national health insurance. This is something that the junior Senator from Wyoming and others would like you to think is. You can follow these shells. You pick one up, and, of course, again it is misleading. Our legislation ensures access to needed drugs and clinical trials. It is not a bill that imposes financial penalties for needed drugs. Of course, their bill does not guarantee access to clinical trials for cancer patients, among others. 
   What does this mean? Again, not speculation but facts. We were at an event at 2 o'clock today, and there was a man there whose 12-year-old son last August got cancer. It was a rare form of cancer. During his chemotherapy, the managed care entity suddenly said: We don't cover you. What was he going to do? He wrote numerous letters and called numerous people. In short, by the time the managed care entity finally agreed to cover it and that it was certainly something which was necessary, and by the time his family and friends gathered together to help pay for this, the boy was almost dead, and he died in February, just a few months ago. 
   Our bill ensures access to needed drugs and clinical trials, 
   not this shell game where you say: Here, my 12-year-old son is sick; I have been told this will cover me. You pick up the shell. It is empty. There is nothing under there. You lose again. 
   Our legislation prohibits arbitrary interference of HMO bureaucrats. What does that mean? It means that insurers cannot overrule doctors' medical decisions. What we need is a bill that reestablishes the patient-doctor relationship, not one that allows clerks in Minneapolis or Baltimore or Sacramento to make decisions for my friends, relatives, and constituents in the State of Nevada. We want the doctors making those decisions. Our legislation does that. The Republican version does not do that. It is a part of the shell game that shuffles these shells around. People think they have won, but they pick up the shell and, again, they have lost. 
   The minority legislation prohibits gag clauses and improper financial incentives to withhold care. What does this mean? There are many organizations around the country that give incentives to keep people out of hospitals, incentives to keep people from having certain types of care rendered. Why? Because if they do that, they get bonuses. 
   Our legislation also prevents HMOs from prohibiting doctors and other medical care specialists from telling patients what is really wrong. They can't be fired if they do so. Again, our legislation is not a shell game. It is not a shell game, as the majority legislation is a shell game. The majority would like you to believe that under every one of those shells you have a winner, but the fact of the matter is, every shell you pick up under the Republican version is empty; you lose again. 
   The minority bill holds HMOs accountable when their decisions lead to injury or death. There have been people who have talked about how this bill is going to be overtaken by the lawyers. Let me give you a little statistic about medical malpractice cases. In the State of Nevada, since we have become a State, there have been fewer than 40 medical malpractice cases tried by a jury. We became a State in 1864. 
   I say that HMOs should be treated like everyone else. I went to dinner in Reno a couple weeks ago with a woman who is a manager of a managed care entity. She said: HARRY, I like your bill except for the lawyers. I said: Why should you be any different from anybody else in America? We all have to deal with lawyers. You should, too. 
   This legislation will not increase costs more than the cost of a cheeseburger and a very small order of fries every month. We can go through a list of people who have indicated that that, in fact, is the case, contrary to what the junior Senator from Wyoming and others have said today. 
   Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes, since the manager is not here. I will take that off the bill.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, the fact that lawyers are involved will make managed care entities do better work. The history of this is certainly adequate. In the State of Texas, as an example, where they have a Patients' Bill of Rights, it doesn't cover enough people, but it covers some people. By the way, it is a Patients' Bill of Rights that George W. Bush vetoed. They came back and passed another one, and he refused 
   to sign that. He is going around talking, in his Presidential run, about what a great Patients' Bill of Rights they have in Texas. Everyone should understand, he vetoed the bill and refused to sign the second one. The fact of the matter is, the Texas experience indicates that it doesn't increase cost; it just makes the health care entity, the managed care entity, do a better job. 
   Our bill holds HMOs accountable when the decisions lead to injury or death. This is not a bill, as the Republican bill, that maintains protections for HMOs that injure or kill patients. I was startled today to hear one of the majority talk about how their bill would reimburse costs for somebody who has been aggrieved, whatever the medical care would have been. That is what happens now under HMOs. That is why it makes it so bad. 
   We want a bill that takes care of patients, a bill that takes care of patients based on doctors' decisions, not clerks' decisions. We want a bill that is more concerned about patients than about profits. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, just briefly, the Senator from Alabama stated the State of Alabama had this great health insurance by some poll that he had conducted by, I think, South Alabama University. 
   First of all, regarding coverage of emergency care, the State of Alabama is one of 12 States that does not use the prudent layperson or similar standard for emergency room treatment. In addition to that, with drug formularies, 36 States have no procedures for obtaining nonformulary drugs; Alabama is one of those. Access to clinical trials, 47 States have no access to clinical trials; Alabama is one of those. Continuity of care, 29 States have no continuity of care provisions; Alabama is one of those. Bans on financial incentives, 28 States have no ban on financial incentives to providers; Alabama is one of those. Provider protections, 21 States have no protections for providers who are terminated; Alabama is one of those. Point-of-service options, 30 States do not require that point-of-service plans be offered; Alabama is one of those. Coverage of emergency care, I have already stated 12 States do not use a prudent layperson or similar standard; Alabama is one of those. 
   The State of Alabama has 1,617,000 State residents who are not protected under the Republican plan; 62 percent of privately insured in Alabama are not protected under the Republican plan. So I do not know about the poll in South Alabama, but I know what the facts are. The facts are that State is similar to many States. That is why groups support our Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   Why do I say groups? Hundreds of groups. They are already on the record, the groups that support us, a listing of some of the groups that support us. Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Alzheimer Association, American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, American Academy of Emergency Medicine, American Academy of Neurologists, American Academy of Pediatrics, American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation--over 200 groups support this legislation, over 200. 
   In addition to that, we have a unique situation. The doctors and the nurses have joined with the lawyers to support this legislation. It is a unique day in American legislation when we can say not only do the doctors support this--the American Medical Association does, all the specialty groups--but in addition to that the lawyers support it. 
   I suggest people coming in, bragging about the other bill, the majority's bill, they are talking about--the junior Senator from Maine said all we want to do is ensure access. I respectfully submit they want to ensure the insurance companies continue to rip off the American public. That is what that legislation is about. That is what they are trying to ensure, and this legislation is meant to stop that.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the Senator from Texas is here to debate the Kyl-Hutchison amendment. I think that is appropriate. I want to respond briefly to Senator KYL's statement. 
   We are working under some very difficult budget constraints. There is a budget that is affecting the work we do on the floor that I didn't support. It was a budget that was given to us and passed by the majority. There are all kinds of problems we have with domestic discretionary spending, including more Customs agents. I would love to have more Customs agents. We need them very badly in Las Vegas, the most rapidly growing area in the whole country. 
   Remember, we, on this side of the aisle, did not vote for that budget. The budget we are working under is the budget that was given to us by the majority. With all of our domestic discretionary programs, we have a lot of problems, not the least of which is Customs agents. 
   I hope the American public is aware of the fact that veterans' benefits, as a result of the budget we have, are being stripped significantly. I hope there will be an effort made to have more money placed in the allocations to allow more appropriate and fair spending for domestic discretionary programs in all of our appropriations bills.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize Nye County, Nevada to acquire approximately 800 acres of public land. This conveyance will facilitate the development of both the Nevada Science and Technology Center and the Amargosa Valley Science and Technology Park, part of a larger proposed Nevada Science and Technology Corridor. 
   The Nevada Science and Technology Center is a proposed interactive science center and museum, highlighting the environment, industries, and technological developments associated with the region. This state of the art facility will have the potential to draw visitors from the Las Vegas Valley, 80 miles to the southeast, and the 1.3 million tourists who visit nearby Death Valley on an annual basis. The Center will appeal to people of all ages and backgrounds because it will provide a unique, fun, hands-on experience. Planning for this project is ongoing under the direction of a Nevada registered non-profit organization. 
   The Amargosa Valley Science and Technology Park is a proposed research and development business park designed to support Department of Energy contractors and suppliers associated with the Nevada Test Site, located immediately to the north of this site. Nye County currently has a $1.5 million grant from the Economic Development Administration in the final stages of review at that agency's regional office. Once finalized, this grant will provide the funding for water and infrastructure development in support of both the science center and the research and development park. 
   The lands proposed for conveyance have been identified for disposal under the Bureau of Land Management's October 1998 Las Vegas Resource Management Plan. Due to the non-profit nature of the Science Center, this portion of land, approximately 450 acres, would be conveyed at no cost. Because the research and industrial park will house commercial operations, the County would be required to pay fair market value for these lands, approximately 350 acres. The legislation contains provisions for the no-cost land to revert to the federal government should it be used for purposes other than the science center and related facilities. 
   This legislation will provide the impetus for future development in this area, providing the opportunity for economic growth in Nye County. I urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize the city of Mesquite, Nevada, to acquire approximately 7,690 acres of public land necessary to provide for urban and economic growth and development of a new commercial airport. This legislation will amend existing public law and allow for the continued expansion of this growing community. 
   Mesquite is the one of the fastest growing cities in the fastest growing State in the Nation According to figures released by the U.S. Census Bureau, Mesquite grew by 441% between 1990 and 1998, increasing in population from 1,871 to over 10,000. This phenomenal growth rate is being fueled by a variety of factors, including the development of new destination resorts and the ``discovery'' of other recreational opportunities in the tri-state region of Nevada, Arizona, and Utah. As the tourism industry in the area continues to grow and prosper, a greater capacity for air carrier service will be required to meet the needs of the region. In addition, the city of Mesquite is land locked by public lands. While some relief has been provided via the existing public law, this growth is exceeding demand and the city expects to be out of room within a couple of years. This bill is designed to help with both growth related and air service issues. 
   Although the existing Mesquite Airport is adequate for general aviation service, terrain precludes the expansion necessary for commercial and cargo service. A new commercial airport is needed to meet the future regional demands. The proposed airport site identified in this bill is a result of an approved Site Selection Study conducted for the Clark County Department of Aviation. This study was funded through, and approved by, the Federal Aviation Administration. Of course, no airport construction activities will begin without completion of a comprehensive Airport Master Plan and environmental review. Once these steps are completed, airport construction will be financed by the City of Mesquite and its business community. 
   Existing state law requires that the airport site be contiguous with the city limits in order to be annexed. The legislation I introduce today will authorize the city to purchase 5,400 acres of public land to meet this connectivity requirement. As some of this land has development potential, the city will be required to pay fair market value for this acreage. The actual airport site of 2,560 acres would be acquired by the city pursuant to existing land acquisition statues related to transportation and airport development. 
   Mr. President, I request that this legislation be given prompt consideration.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to provide Lincoln County, Nevada with the exclusive right to purchase approximately 4,800 acres of public land near Mesquite, Nevada. This legislation, to be known as the Lincoln County Lands Act of 1999, will facilitate economic growth and development in one of the most economically distressed counties in the Silver State. 
   Lincoln County encompasses an area of 10,132 square miles, which is larger than several of the New England states combined. Approximately 98% of the County is owned by the federal government and property tax revenues amount to only $1,106,558 annually. As a result, Lincoln County is hard pressed to provide basic services to its citizens and the County school district in facing a critical situation as its schools are literally crumbling because of a lack of funds to maintain them.  The Lincoln County Lands Act will allow the County to address these economic problems in a positive way. 
   By allowing Lincoln County to purchase 4,800 acres of public land (less than 1/10th of 1% of the land in the County) at fair market value, this legislation will result in the County's property tax revenues increasing by over $12.9 million annually--an increase of more than 1000%. While this may seem extraordinary, it is a result of land being situated immediately adjacent to the rapidly growing City of Mesquite which is located just over the County line in Clark County, Nevada. Mesquite's growth has created a huge demand for more housing and commercial development that can be best met by allowing Lincoln County to purchase this public land and develop it in a prudent manner. Under this scenario everyone involved is a winner. Lincoln County will gain badly needed property tax revenue, Mesquite gains room for expansion and growth, and the federal government will be fairly compensated for the sale of public lands. 
   Another important aspect of this legislation is that it allows for the proceeds of any sale of land pursuant to the Act to be utilized by the Bureau of Land Management to acquire or otherwise protect environmentally sensitive lands in Nevada, to defray the administrative costs that BLM will incur in processing this land sale, and to develop a multi-species habitat plan for all of Lincoln County. These provisions, similar to those contained in the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act enacted in 1998, will help ensure that a mechanism exists to fund the conservation and protection of Nevada's natural resources. 
   Mr. President, the Lincoln County Lands Act is modeled after other legislation that I have successfully sponsored, such as the Mesquite Lands Act of 1986 and the previously mentioned Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act. These laws have provided a framework for creating economic growth while protecting the environment and the taxpayer. I am very pleased to be able to build upon these achievements by assisting Lincoln County in a similar manner. I look forward to prompt consideration of this important piece of legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture to convey, without consideration, two acres of land to Elko County, NV, for use as a cemetery. This proposal should not be controversial, and I urge my colleagues to act upon this quickly. 
   Jarbidge, NV, is a small town located in the remote wilderness of Elko County in northern Nevada. Surrounded by the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest, this community is representative of many of the small, rural communities of Nevada. Its residents have worked hard to earn a living off the land and many of its families have deep roots in Nevada established decades ago by early pioneers to the Silver State. Since the 1900's, the people there have buried their dead in a small parcel of national forest land. 
   The people of Jarbidge now have an opportunity to establish a permanent trust for the maintenance of this historic cemetery. The establishment of the trust is dependent on county ownership of the land, however. The Forest Service has stated that they cannot and will not give the land to the County, and insist that the land be paid for--either in cash or via a land exchange. While I agree that in the vast majority of instances this is the correct stance, in this case the Forest Service is just plain wrong. 
   We should do the right thing and give this land to the county to honor the families whose loved ones rest in that small cemetery. The bill I introduce today is companion legislation to a House bill introduced by my fellow Nevada legislator JIM GIBBONS--a bill which is making its way through the House. I hope my colleagues in the Senate will act quickly so that the residents of Jarbidge will know the entire U.S. Congress supports their efforts to honor the memory of deceased residents whose graves occupy this tiny plot of land.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Phillip I. Earl, the Curator of History for the Nevada Historical Society in Reno. Phillip Earl will be retiring from the Nevada Historical Society on June 30, 1999 after 30 years of service to the State of Nevada. 
   Allow me to introduce Phillip Earl. He grew up in Boulder City, Nevada and graduated from high school there in 1955. After high school, Phillip Earl started working in construction and later in 1957, he joined the U.S. Army and served in Europe until 1960. 
   After his service to his country, Phillip Earl began attending classes at Nevada Southern university in Las Vegas. He transferred to Reno for his senior year and graduated with a degree in history/political science and education. Phillip Earl was a graduate assistant for two years following his graduation. During that time he taught school in Reno and was married. 
   In 1973 Phillip Earl began his career at the Nevada Historical Society. During his tenure, he has worked under six governors, two acting directors, and three directors. He has worked with four assistant directors. Phillip Earl has also worked with many photo curators, accountants, registrars, and volunteers. Phillip Earl has survived them all. He has provided his expertise and passion for history with editors, copy writers, authors, curriculum specialists, teachers, exhibit designers and many others whose jobs reflect on history in one way or another. 
   He started at the Nevada Historical Society as a Museum Attendant and worked his way up to Curator of Exhibits and later Curator of History, his present role at the Historical Society. 
   Phillip Earl has many achievements since serving as Curator of History. He is best known in Nevada for his popular history column, ``This Was Nevada,'' which went out to some 26 newspapers around the state. When the column's first edition came out in May of 1975, there were six people on the column's staff. But the column eventually fell into the very capable hands of Phillip Earl who became it's only author. In 1986, the Historical Society published the first volume of articles from the column and a second volume is under production and scheduled to be released this summer. This second volume of Phillip Earl's column will probably be a very popular item, because his column, ``This Was Nevada'' retires with Phillip Earl later this month making his retirement even more special for Nevada and the history he has been able to capture for over 20 years. 
   Phillip Earl also writes scholarly essays for the Nevada Historical Society Quarterly and the Humboldt Historian, the journal of the North Central Nevada Historical Society. 
   He has explored many historical topics in depth over his career. Some of these are the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, early aviation,  automobiling, shortline railroads, outlaw and lawmen history, the movie industry, race relations, boxing, ethnic history, women's history, the Lincoln Highway, county seat fights, county boundary controversies, the Great Spanish Flu Epidemic of 1918 to 1919, and even Searchlight, Nevada. And there is much more, too numerous to list. 
   Phillip Earl's love for Nevada and the rich history that the State is on display every week during the school year. Since 1976 Phillip Earl has been teaching Nevada History at Truckee Meadows Community College in Reno. He helps bring Nevada's past to life for hundreds of college students who may never have had exposure to the Silver State's rich history before. 
   Capturing the history of the Great State of Nevada will always be the legacy of Phillip I. Earl. He has preserved Nevada's history for all future generations to reflect upon, to learn from, and to enjoy. As one who has a great deal of respect for Nevada's proud history, it is this Senator's privilege to pay tribute to Phillip I. Earl, a great historian, Nevadan, and American.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the question always arises as to whether we have sufficient time in this body to take care of all the business before us, especially the appropriations bills, and still have time to properly handle the Patients' Bill of Rights? The obvious answer is yes. 
   We have had a number of bills brought before this body this year. We have had, for example, the military bill of rights with 26 amendments, the Education Flexibility Act with 38 amendments, the supplemental appropriations bill with 66 amendments, the first budget resolution with 104 amendments, and the budget process reform bill with 11 amendments. We are asking for 20 amendments. Certainly we have the opportunity to do that. 
   I agree with my friend, the Senator from Massachusetts, that we are talking about real people's problems. He has spent a great deal of time emphasizing the importance of the access to specialists. 
   I have a letter from a girl from Minden, NV, by the name of Karrie Craig. She wrote:  
   ..... my mother found out she had cancer [in] November 1997. After about two years of going in circles with her primary care physician, she was [finally] admitted to a urologist.  
</TEXT>

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. In short, this letter says that after the 2 years passed, it was too late. Had her mother received permission to see a specialist early on, she may still be alive today. By the time she was referred to the specialist, a tumor had developed. It was later determined that she had advanced bladder cancer that a sooner visit to the urologist could have prevented. Her mother died. This is a real-life case that illustrates the importance of access to specialty care. 
   I hope the majority will allow us to go to the Patients' Bill of Rights at the earliest possible date. This is something we need the do. 
   I yield to my friend from Illinois 2 1/2 minutes.

   Mr. REID. I extend my appreciation to my friend, the senior Senator from Oklahoma, my counterpart on the majority. 
   Mr. President, I think it is time we did a little comparison as to what we really mean when we talk about the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The majority has something called the Patients' Bill of Rights, but it is this only in name. For example, does the majority's bill protect all patients with private insurance? No. It covers about 40 million; ours covers about 170 million. 
   What about the majority's ability to hold plans accountable? Does their bill hold plans accountable? No. Does ours? Absolutely, yes. 
   What about arbitrary interference from the management, from the bureaucrats? In the minority's bill, our Patients' Bill of Rights, there is no arbitrary HMO interference; in the majority's bill, of course there is. 
   We have heard so much about guaranteed access to specialists. The Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights guarantees access to specialists; the majority's does not. 
   That is important. We have heard so much today about the need for the ability to see a specialist when needed. I spoke earlier about the daughter from Minden, NV, who writes to me:  
   If my mother had been able to get to the urologist earlier, she would be alive today, but she had to wait for 2 years. The tumor had grown, she died five months afterwards.  
   She also said in the letter it was such a waste of resources, because the HMO did spend money putting her mother in a hospice while she died. That was very expensive. 
   That is the whole point of our legislation. There is talk about it being so expensive. It is not expensive. In the long run, it saves the country money to have people taken care of when they need medical care. 
   Guaranteed access to specialists is what our legislation is all about. It is important we understand that. 
   What about access to out-of-network providers? They are needed on occasion. Ours gives that access; the Republicans', the majority's, does not. 
   How about specialists who need to work together to coordinate care? Ours guarantees that; the Republicans' does not. 
   What about prohibition of improper financial incentives? Some of the plans have incentives. The more you keep people out of hospitals, the more money you make. A doctor has an incentive to keep people out of the hospital. That is wrong. That is absolutely wrong. Our legislation prohibits improper financial incentives; the Republicans', or the majority's, does not. 
   Access to clinical trials. This really isn't anything fancy, or complicated. There are certain diseases--cancer is the one that comes to mind--where people have no standard therapy left. Should they be allowed to go to the most modern programs that are 
   lifesaving in nature? We don't know for sure they work, but we think they will work. However, we need experiments, clinical trials, to determine if these new procedures work. Our legislation allows these clinical trials to go forward. Our legislation says we don't give up on someone and simply say we have used all standard procedures, we will not allow these great scientists, these medical researchers who have found new ways they believe can cure a disease--we will not allow your mother, father, brother, or sister to have cutting-edge treatments. 
   Under our program, we say patients should have access to clinical trials.  People's lives are saved every day because of these clinical trials. 
   Access to OB/GYN--obstetrician/gynecologist. This is absolutely critical for women. It is guaranteed under our legislation that women would have access to OB/GYN physicians. That is extremely important. Under the Republican version, there are certain instances, certain times--very minute, very limited--that women can see an OB/GYN physician. We believe this should be a matter of routine. A woman should be able to see a gynecologist or obstetrician when she believes it appropriate. 
   We know in America today, when women see a gynecologist, often these physicians become the primary care physician for women. We believe our legislation is what women deserve and what they need in America today. 
   What about access to doctor-prescribed drugs? We have had a problem develop around the country and in Las Vegas when one of our providers found a new way to dispense drugs. If someone needs one 50-milligram pill, the provider sends them a 100-milligram pill and tells them to cut it in half, giving them the instrument to cut it in half. 
   That is not the way medicine should be practiced. Just because the HMOs get a good deal on a bunch of medicine, on a bunch of drugs, does not mean that patients should be subjected to that kind of treatment. Shouldn't they be given the prescribed drugs the doctor says they need? 
   How would you feel if you went to a pharmacist and the prescription ordered a 50-milligram pill and the pharmacist said: I will give you half as many, but they are twice as powerful, so just cut them in half? 
   That is what is going on in America today with managed care. Our legislation would prohibit these practices. 
   There are significant numbers of people who are fired from managed care entities for telling the truth, for being advocates, for saying: This is not the way you should be treated. Go talk to your doctor. Go back to someone else. They get fired. 
   In our legislation, we have protections for patient advocates. If a nurse, for example, says, this is not the way I believe you should be treated, you should go talk to your doctor, or you should appeal a decision, under our legislation, this nurse would be protected for advocating on behalf of her patient. Under the proposal of the majority, there is no similar protection. 
   Another problem is that managed care facilities put their physicians on an index. They go out every year and hustle doctors in order to get good deals. They find a doctor who will do an appendectomy cheaper than a doctor did last year, so that doctor gets put on their list. All of a sudden, the patient no longer has the right to see the doctor who has been treating him or her for 10 years, because the doctor is not on the HMO's list. 
   What we say in our legislation is that you can keep your doctor throughout treatment, that you need not change even though the managed care entity, in effect, has fired that doctor. The doctor is fired not for doing anything wrong as far as rendering bad treatment, but simply because they no longer want them on their approved list. Maybe they had an argument with one of the administrators. Maybe they think they charged too much. Maybe they can get a better deal. That is usually what it is, a better deal from other physicians. 
   Under our Patients' Bill of Rights, we, as I have said, allow patient advocacy. But we also prohibit gag rules. Under the majority's Patients' Bill of Rights, and I use that term very loosely, you will find they have language prohibiting gag rules but it is relatively meaningless. It is not enforceable. 
   We also believe there should be external appeals. There was a speech made here yesterday that the majority's legislation does allow independent external appeals. That is simply not true. They have words that say that occurs, but it really has no merit. Under our legislation, there is a guarantee of an independent external appeal. And it is done quickly. 
   There are also very important considerations as to whether or not a person who is part of a plan has the right to go to an emergency room. We have heard numerous examples of people denied payments after going to an emergency room. One of my favorites was a young woman who was out hiking, fell off a cliff, broke her pelvis and leg, was taken to an emergency room, and the cost was over $10,000. It was denied by the managed care entity because she did not get prior approval to go to the emergency room. 
   If that were only one case where that happened, maybe we would not pay much attention to it. But this happens all the time. People are constantly denied the right to go to an emergency room. Under the majority's legislation, they have a little bit of language that gives a little bit of protection for emergency room access, but this is not enough. 
   One of the key provisions in our legislation is that we have an ombudsman. What is an ombudsman? An ombudsman is a person you can go to who works for the managed care entity, so if there is a complaint, ``I was denied care and I should not have been,'' it is that person's job to get to the bottom of it. An ombudsman can take a look at that and find out what went wrong. There is someone to go to if there is a problem with the managed care entity. Under our legislation, it is a requirement. It is not even mentioned in the majority plan. 
   Plan quality--isn't it just right that there be somewhere where a patient, a member of a plan, can go to find out what happens when certain procedures are done in this managed care entity? Are they successful? Are they not successful? Our legislation provides that people who are members of a plan can get information on the quality of their plan. That is critically 
   important. 
   As I have asked before, why are we here today talking about the Patients' Bill of Rights? We are here because we believe there should be a debate taking place in the greatest debating society in the world, as the Senate is often referred to, on this issue. What should be done with these managed care entities around the country as far as providing information, protecting all patients? Do we want a debate on whether the Patients' Bill of Rights should cover 40 million Americans or whether it should cover 60 million? Do we want to debate on whether we can hold plans accountable? Do we want a debate on whether there can be arbitrary HMO interference in the practice of medicine? Do we want a debate on guaranteed access to specialists? Do we want a debate on access to out-of-network providers? Do we want a debate on specialists being able to coordinate care? Do we want a debate on standing referrals to specialists? Do we want a debate on improper financial incentives given to doctors who are part of these entities? Do we want a debate on access to clinical trials? Do we want a debate on having an obstetrician and gynecologist for women when they want one? Do we want a debate on access to doctor-prescribed drugs? Do we want a debate on patient protection advocacy? Do we want a debate on keeping a doctor throughout your entire treatment? Do we want a debate on prohibition of gag rules? Do we want a debate on how the guaranteed network meets the needs of a patient? Do we want a debate on access to nonphysician providers? Do we want a debate on choice of provider point-of-service? Do we want a debate on emergency room access? Do we want a debate on whether or not these plans should have an ombudsman? 
   The answer to every one of these questions is yes, we do. That is why we are here in this body. This great debating society says: Yes, let's debate these issues. If the majority is putting forth this bill that they call a Patients' Bill of Rights--and we submit it is only in name a Patients' Bill of Rights--we say we are willing to debate this because the American people are protected under our Patients' Bill of Rights. People need protection. They have been taken advantage of. 
   In America today there are only two groups of people who cannot be sued: foreign diplomats and HMOs. I was at dinner in Nevada Saturday with a friend who is one of the chief administrative officers for a big managed care entity in northern Nevada. She said to me: I kind of like your plan, except these lawyers. 
   I said to her: Every other business in America has to deal with lawyers. Why shouldn't people who take care of me, people who take care of my daughter, people who take care of my son, my  wife, if they do something wrong, why should they not also have to respond in the legal system? That is really invalid. People are saying this is going to make all this litigation. That is simply not true. Lawyers, especially when they deal with people's health, have to be very careful litigating. In the entire history of the State of Nevada, which is now not the smallest State in the Union, although certainly not one of the largest, it is about 35th in population, in the entire time we have been a State, there have only been a handful of cases, medical malpractice cases that have gone to a jury. So this is a bogeyman that does not exist. 
   What we are saying is we want a debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights. We think ours is certainly one in keeping with the standards the American people want. In the light of day, we are willing to debate what the Patients' Bill of Rights on the other side has, which is nothing. It is a Patients' Bill of Rights in name only. We want to come to this body and have a reasonable number of amendments. That is a concession on our part, a reasonable number of amendments. We should be able to offer all the amendments we want, but we believe so strongly about this issue that our leader has said to the majority leader we are willing to limit our amendments to 20 and to set a time for completing this bill. 
   That certainly seems fair and reasonable when one considers that in this Congress, we already have taken up bills which have not taken a lot of time but had far more amendments. 
   Y2K problem, 51 amendments; DOD authorization, 159 amendments. We spent 4 days on that bill. On the Y2K problem, we spent 13 days on it and many of those were very short days. 
   Defense appropriations, 67 amendments. We were able to finish that bill in 1 day. We debated the juvenile justice bill for 8 days, and we were able to dispose of 52 amendments. 
   We are saying, with something as important as people's health care and well-being, we are willing to take 20 amendments. We feel we can finish the bill in 3 days with 20 amendments. Certainly, we are entitled to that time. We had 8 days on juvenile justice. In that regard, we came up with some good legislation. 
   On the budget resolution, which is a guide for this body and which I believe was not a very good piece of legislation--I voted against it as did most everyone on this side of the aisle--there were 104 amendments, and we disposed of that bill in 2 days. 
   In short, we certainly should have this debate, and we should do it right away. We recognize we are only going to have one more legislative day this week and then we go back to our States to do other things. Let's do it next week. Let's begin this bill next week, and after the Fourth of July break, we can come back and work on the appropriations bills. We are not going to complete any of the appropriations bills until we have a meaningful debate on the Patients' Bill of Rights, one where we are not gagged and we are allowed to offer the amendments we want to offer as to the substantive merits of this legislation. 
   I hope the majority will allow this debate to take place. It will take place. It is only a question of when it will take place. We will save a great deal of time and anxiety if we just get to it. As Mills Lane, the famous fight referee, now the TV judge says: Let's get it on. 
   We are willing to get it on with this debate. We feel so strongly about the merits of our case, we are willing to debate it in the dead of night or early in the morning. We do not care when we do it, but let's do it. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the majority leader and the others assembled here, not only have we done a good job this week on those things we voted upon--major appropriations bills--but also there are a lot of things that have gotten a lot of attention that are completed and passed in this body, not the least of which is the resolution sponsored by the four leaders and everybody else in the Senate, and basically a vast majority here, dealing with commending the troops and all those who were involved in the Kosovo war. That took some work between the two sides, and we worked that out. It is a beautiful resolution. It is passed. If we had more time today, we would talk about that. 
   Lots of things occurred here. There, of course, is some question as to whether there are other things we would like to do. We have talked about the Patients' Bill of Rights. But we have to say that we have accomplished a great deal this week, and I think we should feel good about that. 
   Having served in the other body and this body, I think every Senator who has served here for a matter of years appreciates the work of the leader in making this body one where we have certainty as to our schedule. That has been a big help. 
   We had a vote this morning. We didn't have as many people as we thought, but we had a vote. Our time wasn't wasted this morning. The progress made on this State Department bill, I think, is terrific. I have been involved in this bill when we have taken more than a week to deal with this bill. We will resolve this in a matter of a few hours. 
   I appreciate the anxiety and frustration of the leader, but we want to work with the leader and make sure we get more done. I speak for everyone on this side.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, the senior Senator from New Mexico, that I appreciate his hard work on this measure. This has been very difficult. As he has pointed out, we do not have the money we had last year. To meet all the demands on this very important subcommittee has been very difficult. 
   We have harbors that need to be dredged. We have water projects that are ongoing which are important to prevent flooding and to allow people to develop commerce in various parts of the country. We have been unable to do all that was required to be done under this bill, but we have done our best. 
   I extend my appreciation to those Members on this side with whom we have had to work on these amendments. It has been very difficult. There has been some give-and-take on both sides. 
   Senator DOMENICI and I have worked together now on three different bills, and each year it seems that it gets more difficult. 
   But for our relationship, this bill would even be more difficult. 
   I also say what the Senator has said but perhaps in a different way. From this side of the aisle they must hear the message in the other body that we need at least this much money to do a bill. For the other body to come in and say that we are going to cut even more than is cut here means we are not going to get a bill. This has been cut to the bear bones. We cannot go any deeper. 
   Senator SCHUMER from New York has done an outstanding job in advocating things he thinks the State of New York deserves in this legislation. We have been able to meet many of the things he has suggested and advocated--in fact, most everything. I had a longtime relationship with his predecessor, who was an extremely strong advocate for  the State of New York. Senator SCHUMER certainly stepped into those shoes and has been as strong an advocate as Senator MOYNIHAN. 
   The one thing we were unable to do for the State of New York dealt with the Community Assistance and Worker Transition Program, and that was at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. Interestingly, yesterday, the one meeting I was able to have off the floor was with Assistant Secretary Dan Reicher. The reason I say ``interestingly'' is because this is the program he works with in the Department of Energy, the Worker Transition Program. 
   In this bill, there is money for that program. We are ratcheting this down every year. In our bill, we have $30 million for that program. Senator SCHUMER thought there should be an earmark for Brookhaven National Laboratory. We thought that was inappropriate. It had not been done in the past; we could not do it on this bill. 
   I have indicated to the Senator from New York that we will work in conference to see if there can be something done. But more important, the Senator from New York must know that Assistant Secretary Reicher said Brookhaven was a prime candidate for that. 
   In short, I believe this can be done administratively and will not require legislation. So if, in fact, the people of Brookhaven are laid off permanently--and it has not been determined yet whether they are going to be laid off permanently--Secretary Reicher indicated there was a real strong possibility they would fit right into the Community Assistance and Worker Transition Program that has been able in the past to cover people at Savannah River in South Carolina, Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee, the Pinellas Nuclear Facility in Florida, and the Nevada Test Site in Nevada. 
   So Brookhaven National Laboratory has many of those same conditions and problems. We are going to work very hard to make sure we do what we can to protect those workers at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. 
   If the reactor at Brookhaven is decommissioned, and the workers have left because of a loss of confidence, or other reasons, the lab certainly will lose its efficiency in its mission. If the reactor is restarted, the decontamination team will need transition assistance. 
   The simple expedient of providing some assistance now, I believe, will avoid the waste and needless suffering. In short, we are going to do what we can, both from a legislative standpoint, but more importantly from an administrative standpoint, to take care of those problems. So I appreciate, I say to the manager of this bill, the cooperation of the Senator from New York.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. We have been told the Senator from Vermont will be here in a matter of a couple minutes. While we are waiting for the Senator to come, I want to just build upon some of the things the senior Senator from New Mexico talked about. 
   This bill, I am confident, is one of the most complicated bills in the entire 13 Appropriations subcommittees. It deals with the Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation, the Department of Energy, atomic energy, defense activities, the Power Marketing Administrations, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. I think I have covered most all of them. 
   But this bill deals with a myriad of very difficult problems. We find each year the requests--which are valid requests--from Members trying to protect interests in their State get bigger because the problems become more complex. It has made it most difficult, because the numbers we are allowed to work with are going down all the time. 
   Not only do we deal with problems in the continental United States, but, of course, our two newest States, Alaska and Hawaii. We also deal with problems in American Samoa, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. This is very difficult as it relates to the Corps of Engineers. 
   The construction account for the Corps of Engineers deals with problems that are all over this part of the world. We even deal with problems that some say have gone on too long. The fact of the matter is that sometimes when we are not able to give the full amount of the money in a given year, then the projects take more money. We may start out with a program that costs $100, and if you spread that out over, instead of 1 year, 3 years, it winds up costing more than $100. Those are some of the problems we have faced in this bill. 
   The Bureau of Reclamation was first authorized in 1902. The Bureau of Reclamation manages, develops, and protects water reclamation projects in arid and semiarid areas in 17 of the Western States. The first ever Bureau of Reclamation project in the history of the United States was in arid Nevada. It was called the Newlands project, named after a Congressman from Nevada named Francis Newlands, who later became a Senator. It was going to make the desert blossom like a rose; and it did. It diverted water from the Truckee River. It created some very difficult problems. In this bill we are working on it. Even though it was 96 years ago that the first act took place, we are still trying to correct some of the problems that were created. 
   The Bureau of Reclamation provides in this bill over $600 million to handle water and related resources accounts. It is something that has been made more interesting as a result of something I talked about when the bill came up on Monday, and that is the CALFED project. 
   This is a huge project. It is a program that the private sector has invested in, the State of California has invested in, and local government in California has invested in, along with the Federal Government. This project, the Bay Delta in California, CALFED project, deals with two-thirds of the water, the potable water, the water they drink in the State of California--a difficult project. It is something that is extremely important to a State that has 35 million people in it. Yet we have projects from the Bureau of Reclamation to some of our smallest States and populations, but we have to work with this multitude of problems with less money. And we keep going down, as I said. 
   The Department of Energy, a large part of this bill: We deal there with energy programs, nondefense environmental management, uranium enrichment and decontamination, decommissioning funds; we deal with science programs, atomic energy, defense activities, which take up a large amount of money in this bill; and we have to do this to support the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. This program is becoming even more important with the emphasis that has been focused on our nuclear programs as a result of the China problem dealing with the supposed theft, the alleged  theft, the spying that has taken place in one of our laboratories, and maybe more than one of our laboratories. 
   Power marketing administrations: We have had to work money there to see what we can do to maintain that very important program. 
   The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is part of our responsibilities. 
   We have also had for many years the responsibility of a program established in 1965 called the Appalachian Regional Commission. This is a regional economic development agency. This program, which has been going on for some 44 years, receives over $70 million in this bill, which is important for a large part of the United States. The amount of money we have been asked to increase for this program has been very difficult to come by. There have been the increased construction costs of the Richie County Dam, and the cost has gone up because of delays due to a legal challenge over some problems in the Fourth Circuit. This caused our bill to be required to spend more money. 
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission: This bill provides $465.4 million. There are some offsetting revenues that we reduced the amount we need to put in this bill. 
   For each of these entities, everything we do is vitally important. Each dollar we do not put in is something less that they can do that certainly is required. 
   Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board: This is a board which reviews what happens with this very important issue of nuclear waste. Just this morning, the full committee, authorizing committee, chaired by the junior Senator from Alaska, reported out a very important nuclear waste bill. Part of what happens with nuclear waste has to be reviewed by the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board. We fund that program. 
   One of the programs that has been ongoing for many, many years, back in the days of the Depression, is the Tennessee Valley Authority. Under this bill, they receive some $7 million. 
   We have a lot to do in this bill. It seems it becomes more complicated each year because of the cut in moneys that we receive. We have worked very hard, as the Senator from New Mexico has indicated, trying to resolve most of these amendments. We have been able to do it with the cooperation of Senators on both sides of the aisle.

   Mr. REID. I want to state to the Senator that as one of the managers of this bill, I think the content of his amendment is very good. I think he has had a record of looking out for programs like solar and renewable energy. I have a personal commitment to work with the Senator from Vermont and the senior Senator from New Mexico as this matter goes to conference to see how well we can do in regard to the matters he has put before the Senate. 
   In short, my statement is in the form of a reverse question. I want the Senator to understand that certainly there was nothing personal in regard to exercising my rights under the rule. In fact, it is one of the more difficult things I have done in my time here. The Senator from Vermont offered something that I think needs to be spoken about. He has done it before very eloquently, and we will do the best we can from the time that this bill leaves this body until it gets to conference, keeping this amendment in mind.

   I finalize my question to the Senator. The Senator is aware that last year's bill we reported out of this subcommittee was less than what we reported out this year. Is the Senator aware of that? The bill we reported out of this subcommittee last year was less than what we reported out this year. I can assure the Senator that is accurate. It was only with the supplemental that this number came up larger than the number that we gave this year. The number, including the supplemental, was $12 million more than what we recommended this year, but about $50 million less than what the subcommittee approved last year.

<TEXT>
   Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I reiterate what the chairman of the subcommittee has said, the manager of this bill. It is not as if we have not done everything we can to make sure that solar renewables are taken care of. There has been a 3-percent cut in solar and renewables. Others had a 9-percent cut. We have treated this, in effect, more fairly than anything else. 
   I also say to my friends, when this bill left this body last year, it had less money in it than the bill has this year. It was only because of what took place in the so-called summit after the committees completed all their work, the negotiation with the President, that the bill was plused up to $365 million. This is not chicken feed. This is $354 million for solar renewables. 
   Also, we in Nevada understand solar energy. At the Nevada Test Site, which we hear so much about in this Chamber, there could be enough energy produced by Sun at the Nevada Test Site to take care of all the energy needs of this country. 
   The fact is, it is very difficult to get from here to there. 
   We are spending huge amounts of money--not enough; and I recognize that. Everybody wants to come and  spend more money. I would like to spend more money. My friend from Vermont voted for the budget. I did not vote for the budget. I wish we had more money here. I think the budget we are being asked to work under is ridiculous. We cannot do what needs to be done for this country. My friend from Vermont voted for the budget. I did not. 
   So I say that we have to understand that if this goes back to the committee, we are going to have significant difficulties getting to the point where we are today. If we are going to move these bills along, it would seem to me the majority should help us move them along. This is one of the easier bills, some say. Based on this, I am not too sure. 
   I am a supporter of alternate energy sources. We have a solar energy program in the State of Nevada that we are very proud of. It is one of the best in the country. I have been to the one at Barstow. It produces 200 megawatts of electricity. It is by far the largest plant in the world. It is 100 times larger than the second largest plant, which is a small plant. Technology is allowing us to move forward but not very rapidly. 
   In this bill for solar building technology research there is $2 million; for photovoltaic energy systems there is $64 million; for biomass/biofuels transportation there is $38 million. For wind energy systems there is $34 million in this bill. 
   In the bill there is money for solar program support, the renewable energy production incentive, international solar programs, national renewable energy laboratory construction, and geothermal funding. 
   The State of Nevada has more geothermal potential than any State in this Union. It would be very beneficial for us to have more money. It would help the State of Nevada. We cut solar renewables 3 percent. We cut other nondefense programs almost 10 percent. We have been more fair to this entity than any of the others. 
   So I move to table the appeal and ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, as in recent years, the energy and water Appropriation bill has been faced with dilemmas about funding the diverse activities within its jurisdiction. For example, last year, the budget request for the Corps of Engineers was significantly decreased and in this subcommittee we had the challenge of keeping the Corps of Engineers viable and focused. Clearly this year's appropriation bill was just as dramatic--since for the first time in over twenty years the Corps of Engineers funding is reduced below the enacted bill's level. Despite the problems, there are many positives to this particular appropriation which the Chairman and I pointed out in opening statements. 
   Additionally, we have worked hard to find ways to accommodate our colleagues with their amendments. I believe that the responsibility of a Senator is not simply to listen to the bureaucrats who plan ways to spend the appropriations, but to request those amendments the Senator sees as necessary for his or her constituents. While Members may not be satisfied with every aspect or the resolution of every request, the chairman and I have made a conscientious effort to work with those amendments. 
   I recommend this bill to my colleagues for the vital functions across the nation that are funded through these appropriations. I recognize the difficult work done by the subcommittee staff and their efforts in preparing this bill and responding to the members of the Senate. So I commend the diligence of Alex Flint, David Gwaltney, Gregory Daines, Lashawnda Leftwich, Elizabeth Blevins, Sue Fry, a detail from the Corps of Engineers, and Bob Perret, a congressional fellow, in my office.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been working with the leadership on the other side of the aisle for the last several days on a resolution dealing with the operation in Kosovo. The negotiations--that is too harsh a word. We have been working together, as you know, in negotiating; working together to come up with language that both sides would approve on a concurrent resolution. We have one printed in the RECORD as of last Thursday. I ask unanimous consent this concurrent resolution that we submitted today be printed in the RECORD, just for the sake of continuity.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, today--for the first time in many months--there is peace in Kosovo. 
   Like all Americans, I hope with all my heart that the peace will be both lasting and just. 
   I rise today not to discus the war--or the way it was conducted--or the terms on which it was ended. 
   Many Americans risked their lives in the air over Kosovo in the bombers and helicopters flying over the front lines. Every night, America watched the heroism and skill of those pilots as they braved anti-aircraft fire to drop laser-guided bombs and missiles and other ordnance onto targets with amazing accuracy. 
   But what we often forget is that those heroics were made possible by the efforts of thousands of Americans working behind the lines, off-camera, in a variety of roles--maintaining the planes, feeding the pilots, shipping supplies, performing countless other functions critical to men and women in combat.  
   Now that the war is over, I think that we owe all of those countless Americans, who helped in ways both large and small, a nod of thanks for their sacrifice and for their effort. 
   Today, I particularly want to acknowledge the unique contribution of several hundred men and women from my home state of Nevada. 
   The war in Kosovo was the first successful large-scale campaign waged exclusively by air. Much more than other wars, that kind of war relies heavily upon specialized ordnance--the laser-guided smart bombs and precision rockets that were so effective in destroying Slobodan Milosevic's infrastructure and weapons of war. 
   Many of those weapons were supplied by the hardworking men and women of Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada. 
   Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada is the largest ammunition storage facility in the world. It employs about 500 people in the state of Nevada, and stores munitions of all kinds for our Armed Forces. 
   For the past several weeks, many of those 500 men and women worked overtime--sometimes working 12 to 16 hour days, for days on end--to supply many of the bombs, rockets, shells, and missiles used to such devastating effect in Kosovo. 
   During the course of the war, Hawthorne Army Depot shipped about 10,000 tons of munitions to our troops in Kosovo, including hundreds of the 750-pound bombs used to destroy Slobodan Milosevic's infrastructure. 
   And even though the war is over, their job is not. They still have a long, tough job ahead of them to replenish the weapons and munitions expended during the closing days of the conflict, to supply the peacekeeping forces now entering Kosovo, and to return to storage the thousands of bombs and munitions being shipped back now that the fighting is over. 
   I take this opportunity to say to those hardworking men and women at Hawthorne, thank you for a job well done.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the State of California has 35 million people. It is a State of great contrast. It is an agricultural producer, to say the least. It produces more agricultural products than any State in the Union. Yet it is also heavy into tourism. It is heavy into recreational endeavors, and also has these huge cities--Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, San Jose. It is very difficult to develop a balance between these various competing interests. 
   One of the things in this legislation that we have been asked to do is to step into this delicate balance. The California Bay Delta--or CALFED, as it is called--is a project that is going to have a tremendous impact on these competing interests in the State of California. 
   This program, as I have indicated, has environmental interests, urban interests, agricultural interests, and tourism interests. We have been asked as a subcommittee to provide hundreds of millions of dollars for the bay delta system, which provides potable water for two-thirds of this huge State. 
   I don't know the latest numbers, but California as a country would be the eighth largest country in the world. I think that is the number. 
   We have been asked in this subcommittee to step in and provide huge amounts of money for this bay delta project, which, as I have indicated, provides water for two-thirds of California's homes, businesses, and irrigation for more than 7 million acres of farmland. 
   Additionally, this system provides habitat for at least 120 different species of fish and wildlife. Some are already listed 
    as threatened or endangered. 
   CALFED has been tasked with the development of long-term solutions for the complex system that we call bay delta, including certain water supplies, aging levies, and threatened water quality. Our bill has $50 million for this project. This isn't enough. It needs more. 
   Those are some of the responsibilities that we have. 
   I say to my friend, the chairman of the full Budget Committee, and chairman of this subcommittee, the senior Senator from New Mexico, that we have worked hard on this bill. I appreciate his consideration on the issues that have been developed. 
   The problem is that with all 13 appropriations bills we simply just do not have enough money. This has been a very tough year. But we have worked within the constraints of what we have been given to come up with the best possible bill that we could. 
   I mentioned the California Bay Delta project as an example of how important this subcommittee is. 
   There are 13 subcommittees. We have already passed the defense appropriations bill. This will be the second bill, leaving 11 bills. I don't know what is going to happen in the future with all of the bills. Some of them are extremely difficult, if not impossible, to get passed. 
   The HUD-independent agencies is really a difficult bill with the 302(b) allocations that they have. The bill dealing with Health and Human Services is a very difficult bill dealing with issues that affect the health and safety of this country. 
   We, the senior Senator from New Mexico and I, cannot be prospective in nature about other subcommittees. We can only do the best we can with our subcommittee. We have done the very best we could with our subcommittee. 
   I support this bill. I have already indicated that we don't have enough money. But I would like to see anyone do a better job than we have done. It has taken tremendous amounts of our time, and, of course, the staff has worked day and night for many weeks. If you look at the responsibilities that we have with this subcommittee, they are really significant. 
   The manager of the bill has talked about the Army Corps of Engineers. It is very important. It does things that only the Corps of Engineers can do. 
   Take the State of Nevada. The Corps of Engineers used to be very important for water projects. Now the Corps of Engineers, with the rapidly growing Las Vegas area, is extremely integral to developing a system so people do not drown, so they don't lose personal property when these floods hit this metropolitan area. 
   The Bureau of Reclamation in the early years in Nevada--it was the same all over the western part of the United States--was concerned about Boulder Dam and Hoover Dam. Now the Bureau of Reclamation has other responsibilities that are just as important. 
   The Department of Energy, the atomic energy defense activities, the Power Marketing Administration, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Appalachian Regional Commission, the Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, the Tennessee Valley Authority--these are the 
    responsibilities that the senior Senator from New Mexico and I have with this bill. 
   Every one of these issues for the States in which the facilities are found will be most important as we deal with this bill this year. 
   We recognize how important this legislation is. There is no secret that the budget caps have a devastating effect on the Army Corps of Engineers and the Bureau of Reclamation. But that is the way it is. Water projects have an impact on communities around the United States. 
   The point I want to make is that with this bill people start to talk about pork. Try to explain to the people of the State of California, with 35 million people, where pork is involved in this CALFED project. Remember, it deals with competing interests, all of which support our bill. 
   The question is, Can we provide them with enough money to make sure this project stays on line? 
   This bill affects individuals and projects--people and States. It is important for their lives and for the safety and health of communities. The decisions that we have made have been extremely difficult decisions, because we realize that the decisions we make put people out of work, put people to work, and change priorities in different communities. 
   I have mentioned briefly the CALFED project. The State of Nevada is not much into dredging ports and harbors. The fact of the matter is that the two managers from the State of New Mexico and the State of Nevada have responsibilities to make sure there is appropriate money for dredging ports and harbors along both the  Atlantic and Pacific coastlines as well as the Gulf of Mexico. This is the project for the Corps of Engineers. 
   It is important on an annual basis for U.S. ports and harbors to handle hundreds of billions of dollars--approaching $1 trillion--in international cargo, generating to this country and local and State entities over $150 billion in tax revenues every year. 
   Even though the State of Nevada is basically a desert State, the State of New Mexico, while not as much desert as Nevada, is also a State that has its share of desert. This is important for us; it is important for the Senate; it is important for the country that we do what is right regarding dredging ports and harbors. 
   Navigational improvements in New York and New Jersey include things called the Arthur Kill Channel and the Howland Hook Marine Terminal project. This project includes deepening, widening, and selective realignments of the channel to allow deep draft container vessels access to this marine terminal. 
   This is an ongoing problem. Once you dredge a port, it doesn't mean you are not going to have to dredge it again. This is an ongoing problem, and this subcommittee is responsible for making sure that these ports can compete with the rest of the world. 
   The New Jersey and New York ports account for 34 percent of the Nation's trade in petroleum, automobiles, many food products, and import goods bound for all of the Northeast and upper Midwest, supporting nearly 170,000 jobs. When we cut back, when these ports are not dredged properly, when we do not do the things that need to be done to make sure these ports are capable of handling this cargo, people lose their jobs. 
   The ports of the Northeast are not alone. There are 25 ports around the coast of the United States that take in over 26 million tons of cargo annually. Fourteen of these ports have total trades of over $50 million in cargo. That says a lot. 
   Continuing to maintain the ports and harbors requires a long-term commitment in the budget process, as does shoreline protection on which so many communities around the country rely. In the city of Virginia Beach, VA--I have never been to Virginia Beach, VA--this year we are attempting to fund a program at $17 million because a hurricane hit Virginia Beach and almost destroyed the beach. The construction of Virginia Beach began 3 years ago. Benefits have already been realized because the damage from Hurricane Bonnie was minimal to the unfinished portions of the project. The project was not in the budget request sent to Congress, but a $247 million project needs to be completed in a city that has invested over $100 million in infrastructure over the last 5 years, and that has been matched by $100 million in private investment. The Federal Government doesn't do all this all alone, but it should do its share. 
   Additionally, the U.S. Navy megaport, Naval Air Station Oceana, directly benefits from the project at Virginia Beach with its personnel increased by as many as 6,000 sailors and family members recently being transferred to the base. 
   I personally recently voted for the base closure amendment before this body. I did it because I think if we are going to save money, we are going to have to do some of the things the military says need to be done. The military has stated a large amount of money can be saved by eliminating bases around the world and certainly in the United States. One way we can do this is to make sure we take care of those businesses that we know are lasting in nature. Naval Air Station Oceana is one of those. As a result of the additional work there, which we participated in, we have had 6,000 additional sailors and family members transferred to that base. 
   Who would think that the Corps of Engineers would be involved in anything in Nebraska? There are a number of important projects in Nebraska. I could point to every State in the Union, although I have been somewhat selective. The Corps of Engineers has been given the responsibility of environmental restoration in various parts of the country, not the least of which is Nebraska. 
   One of the projects I want to discuss today is the Ponca State Park in Nebraska. This park lies on a 59-mile stretch of the Missouri River. We are spending a relatively small amount on Ponca, $1 million, but it is very important. Education is a primary component of gaining support for additional environmental activities that people believe need to be done. Through efforts of Ponca State Park, the public will be able to understand the environmental and water management problems of the Missouri River basin and potential solutions to its problems. 
   The Corps is also playing an integral role in the multiagency effort to restore segments of the Missouri River to something resembling what Lewis and Clark saw as they searched for the Northwest River Passage, the Pacific Ocean. 
   Working with Senators, particularly BOB KERREY, the Corps expects to propose a plan this fall for managing the Missouri River with more emphasis in protecting native wildlife and their habitat and facilitating outdoor recreation, while not compromising traditional downstream uses of the river. 
   We need to also talk about Nevada. We have had Law Review articles written about this project in Nevada. There have been seminars held using the model we used in Nevada for how to solve water problems in the western part of the United States. President Bush signed a bill of his Presidency where we put to rest a 100-year water war between the States of California and Nevada in the Truckee and Carson Rivers. We settled problems that had been outstanding for many years, including problems between two Indian tribes, and there were two endangered species involved--a wetlands had gone from 100,000 very nice acres of marshlands with all kinds of birds, fish, and other animals to about 1,000 very toxic acres where fish were all but dead and birds could no longer nest there. 
   We solved problems in the agricultural area, also, in the cities of Reno and Sparks. The reason I mention this, money for solving this problem for so many years came from the Bureau of Reclamation, the Corps of Engineers. We have put money in this project over the years and have generally resolved these issues that have been so difficult. 
   Remember, the Federal Government is not the only one involved. The State legislature this year appropriated $4 million to help with some projects along the river; the private sector agreed to come up with $3 million. 
   As I have indicated with the situation in Nevada, Nebraska, California, the port areas in New Jersey, New York, and Virginia, they are essential to the well-being--commercial well-being, the financial well-being, and the economic well-being--of this country. These are not projects in the sense that somebody is getting something for nothing. These projects are vital to the interests of the communities they serve. 
   I am very gratified with the work we have been able to do in this bill with so little money. There is much more that needs to be done and should be done. We don't have the money. However, we are doing so much good for the country in this legislation that it is important Members of the Senate and the American public understand how important this relatively small subcommittee is. 
   As the manager of the bill indicated, we not only deal with these programs which I have talked about that are nondefense in nature, but there are other nondefense programs that deal with our energy supply. We have been cut here. We are not going to be able to supply these programs, these alternate energy programs that I am such a strong believer in, unless money comes from the defense programs, which it should not. I think that would not be the right thing to do. 
   We have to have priorities and make decisions. Energy supply programs are reduced by $12 million from the current year, and from within this program we fund science, such as fusion research which is conducted at universities and labs around the country. Also funded in energy supply are solar and renewable technologies, which I 
   believe are a key to the future energy sources in our society. 
   For Members who say we should spend more on solar and renewable energies, what will we offset? It has to be offset. Finding an offset will be very difficult to do. 
   We all know how important it is to provide for a secure and cheap supply  of acceptable energy. For continued economic growth, the maintenance of our current business climate and global environment depend on cheap energy. The research and development investments in this bill are certainly far more meager than they should be but still focus on providing affordable and enduring energy supply. This bill provides funds to maintain our known and existing energy resources while aggressively investing in new technology options for future resource development. 
   I repeat for at least the third time that we were unable to do as much as we would have liked to do. We did the best we could under the allocation we were given. 
   I counsel my colleagues that with the allocation mandated, the framework which we determined for these funding levels, any amendments need to be reasonable in their approach to emphasizing one program over another. It is very tough to choose. 
   As to atomic energy defense activities, my friend, the manager of this bill, I think, did a very good job in pointing out why these programs today are so important. We know what is going on in the world is so important. We have a very fractured situation in the land that separates India and Pakistan--Kashmir. Two nuclear powers are looking at each other, threatening each other with war. 
   We had the situation with the Soviet Union, which has disintegrated, but Russia still has huge numbers of nuclear devices. We have to make sure our nuclear weapons are safe and reliable and that we have the ability to help the rest of the world with its nuclear weapons. 
   The atomic energy defense activities include, among other things, a number of very important national security programs. Maintenance of a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile; support for and verification of global nonproliferation of nuclear weapons; support for and verification of nuclear international arms control agreements and domestic and foreign nuclear safeguards and security; technical analysis of nuclear intelligence information; and domestic environmental restoration and defense of nuclear waste management are all activities that are necessary in our conduct of the cold war and for other reasons. These activities are important because they are essential elements of our comprehensive national security strategy whereby we will deter any actual or possible adversary from relying on nuclear threats to our security interests. 
   The key ingredient of our strategy is to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. The so-called science-based stockpile stewardship program has been developed and is supposed to provide that assurance. It is important that this new program is active and is making progress. But the critically needed facilities and capabilities are still being 
   developed. Some of them are still concepts. So it is critically important we stay the course and maintain the necessary funding to allow this program to succeed. 
   We have no choice, literally. To not allow this to happen would set us back significantly. Let's assume we found a problem with one of our nuclear warheads. How are we going to test this? What are we going to do? We can no longer take it to the underground caverns in Nevada, the underground tunnels or shafts in Nevada, and set it off. We need the greatest minds in the world to be able to tell us what we can do to make sure these weapons systems are safe and reliable. At the same time, we must continue making investments directed at containing and reducing the international threat of nuclear proliferation. Success here, also, is vital. 
   It is just as important to reduce the expense, the burden, and risk of maintaining a stockpile of weapons that is far larger than necessary. I am convinced all the elements of the Department of Energy's defense activities will provide for our security, now and in the future, more effectively and with less cost than will be the case if any one of these activities is reduced. By reducing moneys here, the costs in the outyears will increase tremendously. So I recommend this bill to my colleagues. 
   This bill provides for national needs and addresses regional, interstate, and local concerns as well, ranging from nondefense energy and water interests to the highest priority maintenance of international peace and security. 
   So I hope, as we proceed through this bill, we keep our eye on the prize, what this subcommittee is all about. It is about making sure the ports and harbors of this country are able to handle the goods and commerce that come here. It is making sure urban areas are now safe from flooding. It is making sure the Bureau of Reclamation is allowed to continue its projects so water supplies are good--good in the sense of being plentiful, and good in the sense of being pure. 
   I end this statement where I started. Using the State of California as an example, 35 million people are depending on this bill. They are depending on it because two-thirds of their water comes from a project we have in this bill. It meets the inconsistent but very vital demands of the agricultural interests, the recreational interests, environmental interests, and urban interests of this huge State. 
   I hope we can move through here without a lot of mischievous amendments, move to the merits of this legislation, and complete it as quickly as possible.

   Mr. REID. I also say there have been some people of good will joining together around the country attempting to advocate for the disabled, but the people we deal with on a daily basis are usually people who come representing institutions or entities and who are, in effect, well paid. They are people who have vast amounts of money tied up in Federal programs. 
   The disabled people the Senator is attempting to help with this legislation are people who have--the Senator is absolutely right--joined together in the last decade recognizing the disabled need help. But these are volunteer groups and people, as I said, of good will around the country trying to help people who have no representation; is that basically true?

   Mr. REID. I want to say one additional thing while the Senator is on the floor, and that is, the community of disabled persons around the country have been very fortunate to have Senator KENNEDY as a spokesperson on their behalf. But I also want to mention something in which your family has been involved. It certainly has shown to me, having been involved in a number of Special Olympic programs in my own State, how the disabled enjoy life just as much as anyone else. There is no example better than athletics. I commend and applaud the Senator and his family for the great work they have done with the Special Olympics program, which is now a worldwide program.

   Mr. REID. Madam President, even though this is the energy and water  bill, I am glad we are going to have this conversation this afternoon about mental health. 
   An area I have worked on that is now receiving more attention is suicide. Thirty-one thousand people each year in the United States kill themselves. What if 31,000 people were killed in some other manner? We would focus a lot of attention on it. 
   There are almost as many people killed in car wrecks every year. We have airbags and we have speed limits. We do all kinds of things to prevent people from being killed in automobile accidents. We have even done a much better job in recent years trying to stop people from driving under the influence of alcohol. 
   Suicide is a very difficult problem in America today. During the time we have been on this bill--it is now 3:30 eastern time; we started at 1--about 12 people in the United States have killed themselves. So it is an issue I hope we will spend more time on. 
   For the first time in the history of the country we are spending money to find out why people commit suicide. We don't know why. An interesting fact is that the 10 leading States in the United States for suicide are western United States, States west of the Mississippi. We don't know why this is, but it is now being studied by the Centers for Disease Control. We appropriated money last year to try to focus on this. 
   Not only is this, of course, terrible for the person who dies, but what it does to the victims, the people who are the survivors. 
   I am happy to hear the discussion this afternoon about mental health generally. I want to talk about suicide specifically. It is an area that we really have to focus some attention on and get Members of the Congress to agree that we have to do something about this. It is an issue that is crying for an answer. I hope that in the years to come we can do much more than we have done in the past, which wouldn't take very much, but it is an area in which we need to do much more. I hope we can do that. 
   Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. I think one of the reasons we have made more progress on suicide and other mental health problems in recent years is because people who have problems with depression, people who are survivors of suicides are willing to talk about it. It wasn't many years ago----

   Mr. REID. So I believe clearly that the Senator is absolutely right. The Senator and I, as an example, are willing to talk about some of our experiences with mental health problems. As a result of that, it is not something people tend to hide as much as they used to. We recognize that depression is a medical condition.

   Mr. REID. It is no different than if you have pneumonia. Depression is like pneumonia. We are learning how to cure depression. We learned some time ago how to cure pneumonia. So the more that we talk about this, the more people are willing to say: I think I am just depressed. I need some help. Is there somebody who can help me. 
   The fact of the matter is, as the Senator said, we did some hearings on depression and suicide. With suicide, they had really an interesting program in the State of Washington where one city developed an outreach program with mail carriers. When someone would go to deliver mail, especially in areas where there were senior citizens--sometimes the only contact a senior would have was with the mail carrier--the mail carrier was trained to recognize symptoms of depression and, consequently, suicide and saved a lot of people. 
   I remember a hearing we had in the Aging Committee; a woman who wrote poems came in. She showed us a poem she wrote when she was depressed and when she wanted to kill herself and a poem she wrote afterwards. I can't remember the poem--I am not like Senator BYRD--but I can remember parts of it where she talked about the snow was like diamonds in her hair. 
   If we could do a better job of recognizing depression, talk about that one, mental illness, depression, think of the money we would save. We would have a much more productive society. The workforce would be more productive. The gross national product would go up as a result of that.

   Mr. REID. As the Senator was traveling here from Minnesota by air, Senator KENNEDY gave a very moving presentation about the necessity for this legislation, which, when he finished, caused the two managers of this legislation to talk about some of the work you and Senator KENNEDY and Senator DOMENICI and this Senator joined in, dealing with mental health parity. It was a very good discussion, stimulated by Senator KENNEDY's presentation on this legislation, which is so badly needed. 
   Senator KENNEDY has indicated that he filed this amendment on this legislation in the hope of focusing attention on this issue. If we have so much support--we have almost 80 Senators supporting this legislation--it would seem that we should figure out a way to pay for it. That is the problem. I think that will come to be, as Senator KENNEDY has talked to the majority leader and other people who recognize that they control the ebb and flow of legislation on this floor. In short, I say to the Senator, I think Senator KENNEDY did the right thing in filing this amendment on this legislation, or any other legislation. If it doesn't work out on this bill, he might have to do it on the next bill, but I support the efforts of the Senator from Minnesota.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I only say to my friend, the manager of this bill, that the amendments are now in. We, together with our staff, have worked very hard to see what we can do to accept amendments. Some of them are just not acceptable. We have tried every way possible. But some of them are not authorized, and there are various other reasons we can't accept a number of the amendments. I hope people will understand that some of these we can't accept. There may be votes required on them. 
   Frankly, with all the work we have done on the bill, I suggest it would be very hard to get some of these amendments agreed to that we haven't been able to work out with their staff, our staff, and the two managers of the bill. 
   We have worked very hard on this for the last couple of weeks. I hope that, with the two leaders, we can find some time so we can wrap this up. I think we can do it in a couple of hours at the most.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I am submitting a resolution that would set aside December 12, 1999, as the National Children's Memorial Day to remember all the children who die in the United States each year. While I realize the families of these children deal with the grief of their loss every day, I would like to commemorate the lives of these children with a special day as well. 
   This will be the second year we will have designated the second Sunday in December as National Children's Memorial Day. As I stated last year, I have had many constituents share their heart wrenching stories with me about the death of their son or daughter. I have heard heroic stories of kids battling cancer or diabetes, and tragic stories of car accidents and drownings. Each of these families has had their own experience, but they must all continue with their lives and deal with the incredible pain of losing a child. 
   The death of a child at any age is a shattering experience for a family. By establishing a day to remember children that have passed away, bereaved families from all over the country will be encouraged and supported in the positive resolution of their grief. It is important to families who have suffered such a loss to know that they are not alone. To commemorate the lives of these children with a special day would pay them an honor and would help to bring comfort to the hearts of their bereaved families.

If we wait now until Tuesday to vote on this, we are going to have less than 200 days to get this legislation passed, to get it to conference, to get it to the President.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, with Senator SNOWE, the Equity in Prescription and Contraception Coverage Act of 1999. Senator SNOWE and I first introduced this bill in 1997. 
   The legislation we introduce today would require insurers, HMO's and employee health benefit plans that offer prescription drug benefits to cover contraceptive drugs and devices approved by the FDA. Further, it would require these insurers to cover outpatient contraceptive services if a plan covers other outpatient services. Lastly, it would prohibit the imposition of copays and deductibles for prescription contraceptives or outpatient services that are greater than those for other prescription drugs. 
   I hope that we have the success this year that we had last year in directing the Federal Health Benefit Plans to cover contraception. As many of you recall, after a tough fight, Congresswoman LOWEY and I were able to amend the Treasury Postal Appropriations bill so that Federal Health Plans must cover FDA approved contraceptives. 
   EPICC is about equality for women, healthy mothers and babies, and reducing the number of abortions that are  performed in this country each year. For all the advances women have made, they still earn 74 cents for every dollar a man makes and on top of that, they pay 68 percent more in out of pocket costs for health care than men. Reproductive health care services account for much of this 68 percent difference. You can be sure, if men had to pay for contraceptive drugs and devices, the insurance industry would cover them. 
   The health industry has done a poor job of responding to women's health needs. According to a study done by the Alan Guttmacher Institute, 49 percent of all large-group health care plans do not routinely cover any contraceptive method at all, and only 15 percent cover all five of the most common contraceptive methods. 
   Women are forced to use disposable income to pay for family planning services not covered by their health insurance--``the pill'' one of the most common birth control methods, can cost over $300 a year. Women who lack disposable income are forced to use less reliable methods of contraception and risk an unintended pregnancy. 
   If our bill was only about equality in health care coverage between men and women, that would be reason enough to pass it. But our legislation also provides the means to reduce abortions, and have healthier mothers and babies. Each year approximately 3 million pregnancies, or 50 percent of all pregnancies, in this country are unintended. Of these unintended pregnancies, about half end in abortion. 
   Reliable family planning methods must be made available if we wish to reduce this disturbing number. 
   Ironically, abortion is routinely covered by 66 percent of indemnity plans, 67 percent of preferred provider organizations, and 70 percent of HMO's. Sterilization and tubal ligation are also routinely covered. It does not make sense financially for insurance companies to cover these more expensive services, rather than contraception. But insurance companies know that women will bear the costs of contraception themselves--and if they can not afford their method of choice, there are always less expensive means to turn to. Of course less expensive also means less reliable. 
   This just seems like bad business to me. If a woman can not afford effective contraception, and she turns to a less effective method and gets pregnant, that pregnancy will cost the insurance company much more than it would cost them to prevent it. According to one recent study in the American Journal of Public Health, by increasing the number of women who use oral contraceptives by 15 percent, health plans would accrue enough savings in pregnancy care costs to cover oral contraceptives for all users under the plan. Studies indicate that for every dollar of public funds invested in family planning, four to fourteen dollars of public funds is saved in pregnancy and health care-related costs. Not only will a reduction in unintended pregnancies reduce abortion rates, it will also lead to a reduction in low-birth weight, infant mortality and maternal morbidity. 
   Low birth weight refers to babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds at birth. How much a baby weighs at birth is directly related to the baby's survival, health and development. In Nevada, during the past decade, the percent of low birth weight babies has increased by 7 percent. These figures are important because women who use contraception and plan for the birth of their baby are more likely to get prenatal care and lead a healthier life style. The infant mortality rate measures the number of babies who die during their first year of life. In Nevada, between the years of 1995 and 1997, the infant mortality rate was 5.9, this means that of the 77,871 babies born during this period, 459 infants died before they reached their first birthday. The National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality determined that ``infant mortality could be reduced by 10 percent if all women not desiring pregnancy used contraception.'' 
   It is vitally important to the health of our country that quality contraception is not beyond the financial reach of women. Providing access to contraception will bring down the unintended pregnancy rate, insure good reproductive health for women, and reduce the number of abortions. It is a significant step, in my opinion, to have support from both pro-life and pro-choice Senators for this bill. Prevention is the common ground on which we can all stand. Let's begin to attack the problem of unintended pregnancies at its root.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I commend the democratic leader on behalf of the entire country for the statement he has just made. Think for just a minute what has taken place: Thousands and thousands of individual sorties by 19 member nations. There are some, who were detractors, who referred to this as Clinton and GORE's war. No, it was not Clinton and GORE's war, but rather a war of those people of good will around the world, and certainly in this country, who detest evil, repudiate ethnic cleansing, and, in short, believe that atrocities by bullies like Slobodan Milosevic should be no more. 
   So, I am confident and hopeful this will send a message to those around the world who feel they can maim and kill and displace those people with whom they disagree for purposes only they understand--the color of their skin, their religion--a message that this will no longer happen. 
   So I, too, applaud the Commander in Chief. I especially applaud Secretary of Defense William Cohen for his leadership and commend all the American forces deployed in the Balkan region who have served and succeeded in the highest traditions of our country, and, finally, I wish to thank the families of the brave service men and women who participated in Operation Allied Force, who have borne the burden of being separated from their families for these many weeks. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand the objection of the majority leader. We wish we could have gotten the information in the form of this resolution to him sooner. But the war just ended, and the United Nations resolution just a matter of hours ago was passed. 
   We thought it was very appropriate prior to this weekend--we are going out of session now until Monday--that the President, the Secretary of Defense, and especially those military men and women who have been away from home for weeks--the bombing has taken 11 weeks--that we commend and applaud the work they have done. 
   The way to do that formally is through a resolution. As the leader has said, he agrees generally with the thrust of what we are trying to do. We will be happy to work with the Republican leadership to come up with a resolution that makes sure the fighting men and women of this country are commended, that the Secretary of Defense is commended, the Commander in Chief, and that also we acknowledge we set out to make sure the Serb forces got out of Kosovo--they are on their way out--that the ethnic Albanians are allowed to return--they are on their way back--and, of course, there be a peacekeeping force on the ground, which this body has already approved. 
   So with that, I will yield the floor, recognizing that this is a great day in the history of the United States, and it is a great day in the history of the other 18 nations in that we have been able to force evil to come to an end. We have won the war. It is very important that we now win the peace.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am here to speak as one of those who is a cosponsor of the amendment now pending, the Kerry amendment. People have spent a tremendous amount of time coming up with the various proposals that are now before the Senate. I commend and applaud those who have worked so hard on this issue. I see on the floor my friend from Oregon. He has spent not hours and days, but weeks on this legislation. I commend him for the efforts he has made. 
   I do, however, say that in addition to the work he has done as a principal author of the bill, the junior Senator from Massachusetts has also spent a tremendous amount of time on this issue--as much if not more than my friend from the State of Oregon. The problem we have with this legislation--and we all recognize that it is extremely important--is that we have 204 days left until Y2K. We don't have time to play partisan politics and wait until the next session to produce a bill. 
   With 204 days left, we have to get to some serious legislation here and get something that is not perfect, but doable. I suggest that the amendment I am cosponsoring, which the chief author, the Senator from Massachusetts, has spoken at some length on, is legislation that the President will sign. We have to take that into consideration. 
   In the last several months I have traveled around the country meeting with high-tech companies, small businessmen and women, and individuals who have done so much to help this robust economy in which we are now involved. These individuals who run these companies want a bill. They don't want or expect a perfect bill, but they want a bill. They want a bill that would become legislation. They want a bill that would meet the demands they have. These small business men and women are successful enough, and certainly smart enough, to realize that with 204 days left there is a lot that has to be done. They would much rather have something signed into law than nothing at all. 
   We have to make sure that whatever we do is reasonable. The Kerry amendment is reasonable. The amendment now pending before this body is reasonable. We reward people for making an effort to address the Y2K problem. We also discourage frivolous lawsuits. I hope this amendment will receive a resounding vote. 
   I submit to this body that what we are doing is offering an amendment to the underlying bill that would make the legislation something the President would sign. We hope that when this bill, with this amendment, gets out of here, it will go to conference, and at the conference the differences will be worked out. 
   As it now stands, the underlying bill simply will not be signed by the President. I submit to my friend from the State of Oregon, who has worked so hard on this, that his legislation will not be signed. They have amended the McCain legislation, but the President of the United States will not sign this legislation. He has said this orally and he has said it in writing. 
   So I think, we have to push something through, in good faith, to help this problem that we have, something that would be signed by the President. I hope that people of good will on both sides of the aisle will join together and offer support for the underlying amendment.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, my colleague who just spoke on the Senate floor is the chairman of the Democratic Policy Committee. This is the educational arm of the Democratic Senators. He has done an outstanding job during his 6 months as chairman of the Policy Committee, hoping to educate not only Democrats but Republicans as to some of our responsibilities. The statement that was just made by the chairman of the committee, the Senator from North Dakota, is certainly appropriate. 
   I agree in every way. The fact is, it is very important that we do everything we can to ratify this treaty, and also the Nunn-Lugar money has been some of the money that has been most well spent. I do not know of any money we have spent in recent years that has done more good than that money spent to make sure the former Soviet Union is helped to retire some of their weapons of mass destruction. It has been a cooperative agreement that has worked well for the United States and worked well for Russia. So I compliment and applaud my friend, the Senator from North Dakota.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, I got up very early. I had a 6:30 a.m. flight leaving from Reno, NV. I was very concerned because that same day, that same time, my friend and someone who is very important to the State of Nevada, Andre Agassi, was playing for the championship of the French Open. This is a tournament that is world renowned. My friend and one of Nevada's favorite citizens was playing in that championship. 
   Just a few months ago, he had a series of injuries, and people said he was not going to compete anymore on the high scale he had in the past. He surprised everyone, except himself and the people from the State of Nevada. We have seen this young man time and time again do things that were said could not be done. There were people who said over the years he did not have the basic skills great tennis players have, but he, of course, has shown them that simply is not true. 
   When I arrived in Denver, one of the first things I did was run to a television set to see how Andre was doing. How disappointed I was. He had lost the first two sets, and lost them overwhelmingly; he had been beaten, and he was behind in the third set. If you lose the third set, it is all over. On the entire trip from Denver to Washington, I was very despondent. This opportunity for Andre Agassi to make world history was slowly dissipating as I traveled the skies. I knew the news would be bad when I arrived at Dulles. 
   I asked the first person whom I had a chance: What happened to Andre? He said he won. He won the French Open. 
   I rise today to honor the accomplishments of Andre Agassi. As I have already mentioned, he is a prominent Nevadan who has become the first man in 30 years to win tennis' four grand slam events. Andre, who lost the first two sets to Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev, rallied in dramatic form, to say the least, to win the French Open on June 6, 1999, yesterday. He won at Wimbledon in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, and the Australian Open in 1995. Andre Agassi now joins the ranks of tennis immortals Fred Perry, Don Budge, Roy Emerson, and Rod Laver. Not only does this assure him of a place in the record books, but also marks a successful resurgence into the very elite of the tennis world. 
   Andre in previous years has been ranked No. 1. He started a few months ago, ranked 140th in the Nation. He now, of course, is in the top 10 and is rising to where he will be ranked No. 1 again. He was ranked as high as No. 3 about a year ago. 
   Andre Agassi has proven himself to be not only a world-class athlete but a great citizen of the State of Nevada who has continually given back to his community. He should be recognized not only for his athletic prowess, but he should be recognized for what he has done in charitable endeavors in the State of Nevada. 
   In April of 1998, the Andre Agassi Boys and Girls Club in west Las Vegas, a minority community, was chartered as the 2,000th Boys and Girls Club in the Nation. This club provides a positive alternative to time on the streets for the youth of Las Vegas and is dedicated to the aid and education of children who are at risk of becoming involved with gangs, drugs, or both. 
   Not only has Andre Agassi done this, but he has also founded the Andre Agassi Charitable Foundation dedicated to the continued support of children's organizations, as well as domestic violence support programs. 
   Andre Agassi has done more than make appearances. He personally has given and raised millions of dollars to these charities. He is an outstanding example of an athlete and demonstrates how they should return to their communities. 
   I admire Andre Agassi for a number of reasons, some of which I have laid out today. He is a great athlete and, of course, we all admire great athletes. He is a great athlete who has returned much to his community. But one of the reasons I admire Andre Agassi is he has not forgotten from where he came. He recognizes the millions he has made in endorsements, and playing tennis did not come, in effect, because he was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He recognizes he came from a family that had very little. He came from a family that worked in the restaurants and hotels of Las Vegas. He has not forgotten his roots. It is this trait I admire more than any other of this world renowned athlete. I am pleased to acknowledge the achievements of this great athlete, great Nevadan, great American, Andre Agassi.

   Mr. REID. This is just to give the Secretary more options--sale, lease, lease option. It will give more discretion to the Secretary rather than saying the transfer shall be made by grant. There are other ways it can be done. I think it would be in the best interest of all concerned if these other options are available. I repeat: sale, lease, lease with an option to buy.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, this is a question--more of a statement--for the purpose of understanding the schedule for the rest of the day. I say at this time, so there are no surprises later on, as you know, there has been an amendment offered by the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from New Mexico which is pending. I want the body to know that this amendment is not satisfactory with the minority and with the administration. 
   The debate on this amendment is going to take a very, very long time. I want everyone to understand that. I have several hours of information that I need to explain to the body. Senator BINGAMAN and others wish to speak at length in this regard. 
   It is getting late in the day, and I did not want at 3 or 4 o'clock for people to ask: Why didn't you tell us earlier? I have suggested to both managers of the bill that this amendment causes some problem over here, in addition to the fact the President said he will veto it. In short, I will not belabor the point other than to say I hope we can finish this bill, but this amendment is going to prevent us from doing so in an expeditious fashion.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the country established the independence of the weapons laboratory directors for a reason. We are lucky to have had the weapons laboratories that have been such an important, integral part of this country. They are one of the main reasons the cold war ended. They have been established independently so that the President and the Congress could expect independent and objective reporting of the directors' honest judgment regarding assessment of the safety and reliability of nuclear weapon stockpile. We are talking about thousands of nuclear warheads. 
   The problem in the world today is the fact that we have too many nuclear warheads, but those that we have must be maintained to be safe and reliable. It is a responsibility of our weapon laboratories to make sure that, in fact, is the case. 
   This amendment, No. 446, strips our laboratory directors of this independent objective status. The amendment makes the laboratory directors directly subject to the supervision and direction of the administration. 
   What this means, in very direct language, is that we will get the opinion of the administration regarding stockpile safety and reliability--not the lab director's expertise and, therefore, their opinion. They will say what the President tells them to say, what the administration tells them to say--not what their scientists and engineers tell them is appropriate with these weapons of mass destruction. There will no longer be any reason to believe that stockpile assessments are founded on scientific and technical fact. 
   If this amendment comes to be we should just declare the stockpile adequate and simply not bother evaluating it for safety and reliability. This would be a tragedy not only for this country but the world. 
   That is the reason that the Secretary of Energy, Bill Richardson, wrote a letter yesterday to the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the senior Senator from Virginia. He said, among other things in this letter, ``The proposal would effectively cancel my 6-month effort to strengthen security at the Department in the wake of the Chinese espionage issue,'' and he goes on to say if this proposal is adopted by the Congress, ``I will recommend to the President he veto the defense authorization bill.'' 
   This has gone a step further, separate and apart from the letter--the President will veto this bill if this language is in the bill. 
   This proposal would reverse reforms in the Department of Energy. According to the Secretary of Energy, still referring to this letter to Chairman WARNER:  
   This proposal would reverse reforms in the Department of Energy going back to the Bush Administration by placing oversight responsibilities within defense programs. A program would be in charge of its own security oversight, its own health oversight and its own safety oversight.  
   He says the fox will, in fact, be guarding the chicken coop. 
   Secretary Richardson says in the final paragraph of this letter:  
   In short, the security mission cuts across the entire Department, not just defense programs facilities. We need a structure that gives this important function proper visibility and focus and provides the means to hold the appropriate line manager responsible. 
   The Secretary of Energy is a person who served in the Congress of the United States for about 16 years, who served as the Ambassador to the United Nations, who has been involved in some of the most responsible and sensitive negotiations in the last 10 years that have taken place in this country, traveling all over the world, working to free hostages, and doing other things upon the recommendation and under the auspices of the President. 
   We are told that this bill, in effect, is going nowhere if this amendment is in there. 
   Why? This isn't the way to legislate. The legislative process is an orderly process, or should be an orderly process. If there is a bill that is to be heard, there should be hearings held on that bill, especially one as sensitive as this that deals with the nuclear stockpile of the United States. We have had no hearings. There are multiple committees that have jurisdiction. We know that the Energy and Natural Resources Committee has jurisdiction. We know the Armed Services Committee has jurisdiction. 
   The Cox-Dicks report--which was a bipartisan report and we should treat it as such--said the problems with the laboratories as far as the espionage problems go back at least three administrations. Secretary Richardson has reported this past week that 85 percent of the report's recommendations are already adopted or in the process of being adopted and, in fact, the report was one that most everyone agrees did a good job. Congressman COX and Congressman DICKS did a good job. 
   I don't think it is appropriate that we go charging forth for political reasons to attempt to embarrass the administration or to embarrass Secretary Richardson. This deals with the most sensitive military resources we have--management of nuclear weapons. To change how that takes place, while keeping them safe and reliable, in an amendment being discussed in the few hours prior to a congressional recess, is not the way to go, especially when there have been no congressional hearings. This committee deserves to take a look at calling witnesses. 
   In short, I rise in strong opposition to this amendment. As I have said earlier today, this amendment is not going to go away. This deals with the security of this Nation. When I finish speaking, there are other Senators wishing to speak. I see the junior Senator from New Mexico who is going to speak, the senior Senator from Illinois said he will speak, we will have Senator BOXER from California speak. It will take a considerable period of time before enough is said about this amendment. 
   If adopted, this amendment would make the most sweeping changes in the Department structure and management since the Department's creation in 1977. This amendment fundamentally overturns the most basic organizational decisions made about the Department when it was created. It does it without any congressional hearings, without any oversight hearings, without any investigations having taken place. These changes will result in long-term damage to the Department of Energy. The defense National Laboratories will be tremendously compromised as scientific institutions. 
   The weapons laboratories have always been held out as being scientific institutions, not political institutions. Those who deal with these laboratories--and I had the good fortune the last 3 years to be the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee that appropriates money for these laboratories--I have found the people that work in these laboratories to be some of the most nonpolitical people I have ever dealt with in my entire political  career. They are not involved in politics. They are involved in science. We shouldn't change that. 
   Today, their work--that is, the work of the National Laboratories on national security--is underpinned by scientific excellence, 
   in a wide range of civilian programs that sustained needed core competency at the laboratories. 
   This amendment, No. 446, will result in the Department of Energy's defense-related laboratories losing their multipurpose character to the detriment of the laboratories themselves as scientific institutions and to the detriment of their ability to respond to defense needs. 
   This change reverses management improvements made at DOE by a series of Secretaries of Energy under both Republican and Democratic administrations. These improvements were made after careful consideration and review by these Secretaries. They looked at the management deficiencies they encountered during their tenures. There were hearings held in the Congress before the rightful committees, and decisions were made as to what changes the Secretaries recommended should be made in permanent law. That is how we should do things. That is not how we are doing things with this bill. 
   These improvements made part of the law have been made by careful review by the Secretaries of the management deficiencies they encountered during their tenures. This amendment re-creates dysfunctional management relationships at the Department of Energy that have proven in the past not to work. I repeat, these sweeping changes are being proposed on the floor of the Senate without any input from the committees of jurisdiction over general department management--that is, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, or the committee with specific jurisdiction over atomic energy defense activities--this committee, the Committee on Armed Services. 
   The two managers of this bill have worked very, very hard. As I said the other day, on Monday evening, I do not know of two more competent managers we could have for a piece of legislation. They have dedicated their lives to Government. They have dedicated much of their adult lives to making sure the United States is safe and secure. They have worked very hard to have a bill that should be completed today, a very important bill dealing with the armed services of the United States. We should not let this stand in its way. We should not have a bill that comes out of here that is vetoed. We do not need this information in the bill. 
   To this point, this bill has been proceeding forward on a bipartisan basis. This is the way legislation should move forward. We have been working on this bill for a few short days. In the past, it has taken as many as 14 days of floor activity to complete this legislation. These two very competent managers are completing this bill, if we get rid of this, completing this bill in 4 days. We should go forward. 
   There are so many important things in this bill that need to be completed that we should do that. If my friends on the other side--my friends, the Senator from Arizona and the senior Senator from New Mexico--if they really think there are problems in this regard I will work with them. I will work from my position as the ranking member of the Energy and Water Subcommittee. I will do whatever I can to make sure, if they believe a bill needs to come forward on the floor dealing with these things, we would not object to a motion to proceed, that they could bring this bill forward on the floor. We do not want to hold up this bill. But the bill is being held up, not because of anything we are doing on this side but because of this mischievous legislation. 
   I say to my two friends, the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from New Mexico--who are not on the floor; they are two Senators for whom I have the greatest respect--this is not the way to proceed on this. No matter how strongly they feel about what went on with the Chinese espionage, whatever the reasons might be, let's work together and see if, in fact, after we go through the normal legislative process, with hearings, with committees of jurisdiction, that their method is the way to proceed. Certainly, we are not going to proceed on an afternoon with a bill of this 
   importance, without, I repeat, committee hearings and the other things that go into good legislation. 
   These sweeping changes are being proposed with no supporting analysis, no public record. Indeed, the changes to be made fly in the face of past recommendations made by distinguished experts and past reports of congressional hearings on the subject--DOE Organization, Reorganization and Management. 
   These changes are firmly opposed, and that is an understatement, by the administration, and I think we should pull this amendment so we can go forward with this bill. The absurdity of this amendment is even more striking when you see who the senior management officials in the Department of Energy are at this time. Think of this. The current Under Secretary of Energy is Dr. Ernest Moniz, who, if not the top nuclear physicist in the country is one of the top nuclear physicists in the whole country. This man is the former chairman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's physics department--the most prestigious, famous institution of science in this country, especially their physics department. 
   Under this amendment, Secretary Moniz would be forbidden by law from helping Secretary Richardson, whose office is 40 feet away, manage and direct this program. He could not exercise any role in the management of the Department's nuclear weapons research and development. Is this a crazy result? The answer is, obviously, yes, it is a crazy result. 
   The safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile is absolutely critical to our national security and to the U.S. policy and strategy for international peace and nonproliferation. My friend from New Mexico, the junior Senator from New Mexico, is going to talk about why this amendment substantively is so bad. I want to talk more about procedurally why it is so bad. I have tried to lay that out. It is procedurally bad because we should not be here today talking about this as we are now. There should be a bill introduced, referral to committee or committees and a committee hearing or hearings with people coming forward to talk about this issue. 
   This is not whether we are going to change the way boxing matches are held in this country or how much money we are going to give to highways in this country. This deals with approximately 6,000 nuclear warheads, any one of which, as a weapon of mass destruction, would cause untold damage to both people and property. So this is not how we should proceed on this legislation. We should proceed on this legislation in an orderly fashion. 
   I say to my friends, the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Arizona, if they are right--which I certainly do not think they are--but if they are right, then let's have this legislation in the openness of a legislative hearing, the openness of the legislative process. 
   This amendment No. 446 causes us to be in the midst of protracted debate when we should be trying to complete this most important legislation. 
   We are in the midst of a major change in the way we ensure this critical stockpile safety and reliability because we can no longer demonstrate weapons performance with nuclear tests. 
   We have had approximately 1,000 nuclear weapons tests in the State of Nevada--approximately 1,000. Some of these tests were set off in the atmosphere. We did not know, at the time, the devastation these nuclear devices would cause, not to the area where the devices were detonated, but what happened with the winds blowing radioactive fallout into southern Utah, creating the highest rates of cancer anyplace in the United States as a result. 
   I would awaken in the mornings as a little boy and watch the tests, watch the detonation, and see that orange flash in the sky. It was a long way from where I was, but not so far that you could not see this orange ball, over 100 miles away or more, that would light up the morning sky. It was not far enough away that you could not hear the noise. Still, we were very fortunate in that the wind did not blow toward Searchlight, my hometown; it blew the other way. 
   We have set off over 1,000 of these nuclear weapons in the air, underground, in tunnels, shafts. We cannot do that anymore. We cannot do it because there has been an agreement made saying we are no longer going to test in  that manner. We have to manage our nuclear stockpile using science and computer simulation instead of nuclear testing. This is a terribly, terribly complex job. The greatest minds in the world are trying to figure out how they can understand these weapons of mass destruction to make sure they are safe and reliable. 
   It needs all of our attention and energy because we must demonstrate with high confidence that this job can be done without returning to nuclear testing. We have not proven that the stockpile can be maintained without nuclear testing, but we are doing everything we can to succeed. 
   We have developed a program called subcritical testing. What does that mean? It means that components of a nuclear device are tested in a high explosive detonation. The fact is, the components cannot develop into a critical mass, necessary for a nuclear detonation. It is subcritical. As a result of computerization, they are able to determine what would have happened had the tests become critical. We are working on that. We think it works, but there is a lot more we need to do. We need, for example, to develop computers that are 100 times faster than the ones now in existence. Some say, we need computers 1,000 times faster than the ones now in existence to ensure these nuclear weapons, nuclear devices, are safe and reliable. 
   This tremendously demanding job is made even more difficult by all the other problems with managing the nuclear stockpile. For example, we have to clean up the legacy of the cold war at our production facilities. We are spending billions of dollars every year doing that. We need to develop the facilities and skills for stockpile stewardship. We need to maintain an enduring, skilled workforce. 
   The people who worked in this nuclear testing for so long are an aging population. We have to make sure we have people who have the expertise and the ability to continue ensuring that these weapons are safe and reliable. We need to provide the special nuclear materials for the stockpile, because the material that makes up a nuclear weapon does not last forever. Tritium, for example, has a life expectancy in a weapon of maybe 12 years. Weapons have to be continually monitored to determine if they are safe and reliable. 
   All these things are complicated by the discovery that some of our most closely guarded nuclear secrets about our stockpile have been compromised over the past 20 years. That makes it even more 
   difficult and makes it even more important that we proceed to ensure that in the future our nuclear stockpile is safe, that it is not seen by eyes that should not see the secrets that go into our nuclear stockpile. We should not be determining the afternoon before the Memorial Day recess how we are going to do that. 
   Secretary Richardson is one of the most open, available Secretaries with whom I have dealt in my 17 years. He is open to the majority; he is open to the minority. We should not do this to him. He is a dedicated public servant. We need to concentrate on the most important things right now, not later. 
   I do not think an ill-conceived administrative change--and that is what it is; we are legislating administrative changes in the way that this most important, difficult job is being managed --is the most important thing we can do right now. Clearly, it is not. We have far more pressing matters to attend to in the nuclear stockpile. 
   We talk about the stockpile, but it is a nuclear stockpile. It is something we have to maintain closely, carefully, to make sure it is safe and reliable. We need to improve our computational capability; I said by 100, others say by 1,000 or more, beyond the advances we have already made. That is where we need to direct our attention. We need to develop new simulation computer programs that will make effective use of these higher performance machines. 
   I have been in the tunnels where these subcritical tests are conducted. I have been in the tunnels where the critical tests were conducted. We need to continue, I repeat, making sure these weapons of mass destruction are safe and reliable. 
   We need to design, as I say, advanced experimental facilities to provide the data for this advanced simulation capability. 
   We need to hire and train the next generation of weapons physicists and technicians before our experienced workforce really withers away. 
   We have to continue the training of these individuals, not only continue the training but have work for them to do, which we will surely do. 
   We need to establish better and more effective controls in how we do these jobs to ensure no further environmental contamination at our working sites. Hanford, that is an environmental disaster; Savannah River, environmental disaster. We cannot let that take place anymore. 
   We should be directing our attention to those efforts, not legislating on a bill that we should have completed by now. We could have completed this bill, and I think we will if we can figure out some way to get rid of this amendment. 
   We need to establish better and more effective controls in how we do those jobs, making sure we do not have Savannah Rivers or Hanford, WA, sites where we are spending billions upon billions of dollars to make those places environmentally sensitive and clean. 
   Just as important--maybe more important--we need to implement effective security measures that will protect our secrets without unnecessary interference in this very important work. Whatever we do in this terribly important job, we need to do it right. 
   There is neither the time nor the money to make mistakes. This proposed change in management of the nuclear weapons program is not the right thing to do right now. I feel fairly confident, having spent considerable time speaking to Secretary Richardson, that he is really dedicated to doing the right thing. He does not want to remedy the problems in the weapons labs with our weapons systems in a Democratic fashion--I am talking in the form of a party--or a Republican fashion. He wants to do it in a bipartisan fashion. 
   This amendment No. 446 would make the most sweeping changes in the Department of Energy structure and management since its creation in 1977. These drastic changes would be made with no consideration or suggestions, I repeat, by the committee of jurisdiction. They would be made with no consideration or suggestions by the committee that has general management jurisdiction; that is, the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources; or the committee that has jurisdiction over atomic energy defense activities, the Armed Services Committee. 
   There have been no hearings and testimony by proponents and opponents of a change, and not just this proposed change, but other proposed changes as well. 
   These jurisdictional considerations and testimony by credible witnesses are mandatory for such a change, because what is being proposed is not obviously better than the present program management framework. 
   I want to take this opportunity to compliment the Secretary of Energy--with whom I came to Congress in the same year--for his energetic response to the problems that have come to light since he assumed his responsibilities. I think his public and private statements regarding the possible compromise by the Chinese or others have been outstanding. I think he has done extremely well. No Secretary in my memory has taken such forthright and aggressive actions to remedy problems in this most complex and, I repeat, important Department. He is searching out the Department's problems. He is doing everything he can to correct these deficiencies. 
   Let's give him a chance to succeed. I am confident he will. I know the Secretary has an outstanding relationship with one of the authors of this legislation, the senior Senator from New Mexico. Secretary Richardson is from New Mexico. He served in Congress for many years from New Mexico. He has a good working relation with the junior Senator from New Mexico and, frankly, with most everyone in this body. Let's give him a chance to be successful. 
   This amendment has not been given, I believe, enough thought. There are obvious deficiencies in this proposal. Damage to our weapons laboratories' capabilities would surely occur under the terms of this amendment. The National Weapons Laboratories are truly multiprogram laboratories, providing their skills and facilities, unmatched anywhere in the world.  
   We talk about how proud we are of our National Institutes of Health, and we should be, because it does the finest medical research that has ever been done in the history of the world. That is going on as we speak. But likewise, the National Laboratories are truly unmatched anywhere in the world for the solution of critical defense and nondefense problems as well. 
   We think of the Laboratories as only working with nuclear weapons. But the genome research was started in one of our National Laboratories. Many, many things that are now being developed and worked on in the private sector were originally developed with our National Laboratories. 
   Enactment of this amendment would isolate these multiprogram national assets, making their contributions to other than defense work very difficult, if not impossible. This isolation would reduce and erode the technical scope and skills within the weapons laboratories, and that might result in missing an important 
   national defense opportunity. 
   I am absolutely confident that the directors of the weapons labs will testify to the enormous defense benefits that accompany the opportunity to attack important nondefense problems. I repeat that. There is no doubt in my mind that the directors of the National Laboratories would testify privately or publicly to the enormous defense benefits that accompany the opportunity they have had in the past and continue to have to attack important nondefense problems. That opportunity exists because the weapons program is not isolated within the Department, as it would be in this amendment. 
   There is a critical need to rebuild our confidence that necessary work can be done in a secure way and within a secure environment. I am very uncomfortable with placing the management of security in a position where it might compete with the management of the technical program. That critical function needs to exist independently of the program function so that these two equally important matters can be managed without conflict. 
   This amendment would require unnecessary duplication and redundancy of activities in the Department of Energy. Security of nuclear materials and information is necessary for activities that would not be included in the administration proposed by this amendment. This would require separate security organizations to undertake the same and other very similar functions. There is not enough money to allow this kind of inefficiency to creep into the weapons program. 
   The Secretary of Energy and the President of the United States oppose this amendment. The President promises to veto the defense authorization bill if it is included in the bill. I personally oppose this proposal for the reasons I have mentioned, and many other reasons that at the right time I will be happy to discuss. 
   I have worked with the senior Senator from New Mexico now for 3 years as ranking member, and many other years as a member of his subcommittee. I just think there is a better way to do this. I know of the time and effort he has spent with the National Laboratories. I believe this amendment compromises the National Laboratories. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment or to vote for the motion to table, which I am sure will precede an opportunity to vote on this ill-conceived and untimely measure.

   Mr. REID. I say with the deepest respect for the majority leader, I have spent considerable time here this afternoon indicating why I think this is the wrong time for this amendment. I have stated there are parts of the amendment that I think are acceptable and agreeable to the minority, but this is not the time for a full debate on reorganizing the Department of Energy. This is on the eve of the recess for the Memorial Day weekend. We have had no congressional hearings; we have not heard from the Secretary of Energy, except over the telephone. This is not the appropriate way to legislate. 
   For these and other reasons, I ask there be other arrangements made so that we can proceed to this most important bill, the defense authorization bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the junior Senator from Arizona, in my absence, talked about how I had improperly held up this bill. I complied with every Senate rule. The rules of the Senate have been in effect for a long time. 
   I think what we should understand is that it appears there was some kind of game playing here, that late in the day this amendment would be offered and because people wanted to go home --and I am not one of those Senators who had some desire to rush out of here; I had no airplane today--there would be a capitulation to this amendment which was filed late in the game. It was filed at a time when there were no congressional hearings, there had been no time to review this responsibly. The minority would not cave in to that. 
   We are not talking about Memorial Day recess. We are talking about good legislation. This is not good legislation. We have acknowledged that there are certain pieces of this amendment we are willing to accept, but the rest of it we are not. We are not going to be compelled to do so. We complied with the Senate rules, as we always try to do. 
   We shouldn't be dealing with this on a partisan basis. The Cox-Dicks report dealing with the espionage at one of the National Laboratories was done on a bipartisan basis. If we are going to do something to change the way the Department of Energy is administered, it should be done on a bipartisan basis. 
   There may be feelings hurt in this matter; certainly my feelings are not hurt. I did what was appropriate to protect the prerogatives of a Senator and a minority. That is a reason the Senate has fared so well over the two centuries or more that it has been in existence--that the rights of the minority can be protected. This is the body to do it. We did protect our rights. 
   I look forward to the day when we can debate this again. I think it will be an interesting debate. 
   I have said this before: I commend and applaud the managers of this bill. They have done an outstanding job to get rid of this very, very important, big piece of legislation. They could not have done it with this amendment pending. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their hard work over the last few days on this very important bill. The events in Kosovo underscore the importance of the work that we are doing here. 
   I think that we have worked to put together a good bill. It doesn't satisfy everyone, I myself have some concerns about some parts of it, but overall I think that it is a good bill. 
   I want to make a brief statement clarifying the substance of one of the amendments in the manager's package that we passed today. 
   I want to make it clear that the amendment relating to the authorization of $4,500,000 for the procurement and development of a hot gas decontamination facility, is directed to the development of such a facility at Hawthorne Army Depot in Hawthorne, Nevada. That reflects the prior agreement of the managers. The text of the amendment does not specify the location of the facility, and I want to make it clear in the record of the proceedings associated with this bill where that facility is to be located and how that money is intended by this Congress to be appropriated and spent.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, years ago, when air travel was in its infancy, the greatest threat to passenger safety was mechanical failure. 
   Over the last half-century, the dedication of the men and women who service our airlines, coupled with advances in technology and know-how, have made air travel the safest method of transportation we have. 
   But it's not always the most convenient way to travel. As air travel has become safer, it has also become more popular--and more crowded. 
   As all of my colleagues in this chamber well know, air travel is an increasingly stressful and chaotic experience, at times trying even the most patient among us. 
   I commend my colleagues for introducing the passenger's bill of rights earlier this Congress, which hopefully will alleviate some of the stress of air travel. 
   I rise today to address a different aspect of that stress, and that is the safety hazard created to all passengers when a passenger who can't control his behavior or emotions, or simply refuses to do so, acts in a way that jeopardizes the safety of the flight. 
   Over the last few years, the number of reported incidents in which unruly airline passengers have interfered with flight crews, or even physically assaulted them, has increased dramatically and dangerously. 
   One airline alone reports that the number of incidents caused by violent or unruly passengers more than tripled in only three years--from 296 cases in 1994 to 921 cases in 1997. 
   In 1996, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed civil penalties against 121 unruly passengers. In 1997, that number jumped to 195--a sixty percent increase in only one year. 
   These incidents represent a serious threat to the safety of both flight crews and passengers alike. 
   Today I, along with my colleague Senator FRIST, am introducing a bill that addresses this problem. 
   Briefly, my bill will allow the Secretary of Transportation to increase the civil penalty from its current level of $1,100, up to $25,000, on any airline passenger who interferes with the duties or responsibilities of the flight crew or cabin crew or takes any action that poses an imminent threat to the safety of the aircraft or other individuals on the aircraft. 
   We need not only to punish passengers who threaten the safety of their passengers. We also need to give airlines the power to prevent particularly violent or disruptive passengers from committing similar acts in the future. 
   When someone drives in an unsafe manner on our roads, local police have the power to fine them. When that someone commits the same offenses repeatedly, or drives in a way that is especially dangerous, local authorities have the power to revoke or suspend their driver's licenses--to take those drivers off the road. 
   I think we need to do something similar with air travelers who commit particularly dangerous acts, or who insist on repeatedly disrupting airline flight crews. We need them off of our airlines, so that they do not have the opportunity to jeopardize the lives of other passengers in the future. 
   The bill I am introducing today gives the Secretary of Transportation the authority to raise the civil penalty up to $25,000.  
   Second, and most important, my bill would also give the Secretary of Transportation the authority to impose a ban of up to one year on all commercial air travel on passengers guilty of such incidents. 
   The bill enforces this ban by making airlines which provides air transportation to a banned traveler liable to the Government for a civil penalty of up to $25,000. 
   Third, this bill would give whistleblower protection to flight attendants who report unsafe behavior by co-workers. 
   Fourth, this bill will make the investigation of in-flight incidents easier by giving the Attorney General the authority to deputize local law enforcement officials to investigate incidents when the plane lands, wherever it lands. 
   Mr. President, everyone in this body travels extensively by air. Every time we get into an airline, we put our lives in the hands of the hardworking men and women who staff our airlines. 
   When we, or any other American, gets on an airplane, we should be able to sit back and relax, confident in the knowledge that those men and women can perform the jobs they were trained to do without interference by unreasonable or violent passengers. 
   We should also be able to board an airline secure in the knowledge that the man or woman sitting in the seat next to us, doesn't have an extensive history of violent or disruptive behavior on airplanes. 
   We should also have the security of knowing that if a passenger does choose to commit a particularly unruly or violent act that threatens the safety of other passengers or the flight crew, that passenger won't be able to get on another airplane tomorrow and do the same thing to another unsuspecting planeload of passengers. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I want to say that we in the Senate tend to look at these nominations as mere numbers. Because we deal with so many nominations in this body, we tend to forget that these numbers stand for real people whose lives and dreams we are deciding upon. 
   I would like to talk in particular about one of these numbers, number 77. He is someone who, in a way, represents all of these numbers. 
   Number 77--otherwise known as Dr. Ikram Khan--is a resident of the State of Nevada, and one of the most important citizens we have in Nevada. He has served on the Nevada State Board of Medical Examiners. He has been involved in many, many charitable activities over the course of the past two decades. He is a skilled physician, an outstanding surgeon. He comes from a very substantial family, a family that is highly regarded in the State of Nevada. 
   I say these things because Dr. Khan is an outstanding man. And he is all the more remarkable because he is a new citizen of the United States--he immigrated from Pakistan. He exemplifies what is good about our country. He is someone who has come here from another country on another continent, arrived in the United States, and hit the ground running. He worked hard and made a name for himself and his family and built a successful career in a very short time. 
   And he was able to do all of that while taking the time to help others. I'm not even including those whose health and lives he has saved in his medical practice. I can't think of an event held in Nevada involving the public good that he has not been involved with in some way. We recently inaugurated a new Governor of the State of Nevada. Dr. Khan served very capably on his transition team. 
   In short, number 77 is an outstanding person, just as are all of these people who are numbered here, 18, 72, 73, 74, 77 through 91. It's regrettable that we here tend to rush through these nominations, for each one of these people will dedicate significant time and effort in service to this country. 
   Many of these nominations are of men and women who are being promoted to general officers in the armed forces, or are being promoted within the rank of general. Dr. Khan, however, will serve as a Member of the Board of Regents of the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, a nomination that I think sets him apart even in this group of good and able men and women. He will serve the University and this country at his own expense. He will devote many hours and days and weeks of his time doing this, and he does it willingly.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I don't know of two more able managers of a bill than the Senator from Virginia and the Senator from Michigan. But on behalf of the minority, I say that it would break all records of the Senate to finish this bill tomorrow night. It simply is not possible to do. 
   We in the minority are going to cooperate in every way we can. The fact that we have these two fine managers doesn't mean we can perform a miracle. 
   Additionally compounding the issue, I have been told that there has been an amendment filed dealing with the Kosovo situation that could take days of debate, not hours of debate. 
   We are willing to cooperate. There is no one on this side who wants to hold up this bill for any purpose other than the fact that we want to have a good bill. In short, we have shown in the past few months since this Congress has been in session that we have cooperated every way we can, as indicated by the work that was done in reducing 91 Democratic amendments on the juvenile justice bill to a mere handful of amendments so we could get that passed by Thursday evening. 
   In short, we want to help. We want to cooperate in any way we can. But we cannot be part of this miracle, because it won't happen.

   Mr. REID. I have been here this morning, and, of course, the manager of the bill has been here all morning. 
   I want to say to everyone within the sound of my voice that nothing has changed on this side of the aisle since yesterday. We have agreed to cut down our amendments from about 90 to a handful of amendments. We have indicated that as far as gun amendments, we had a finite number of those we were going to offer. I don't know what has gone on in the debate here this morning. I have been trying to follow it as closely as possible. But my friend from Utah should realize that nothing has changed since yesterday. We want to have a bill. We have worked hard to cut down the number of amendments. My friend, the manager of the bill, has worked all weekend with the staff to pare down these amendments. In short, we want a bill to go forward. We want to finally resolve something that the American people can be proud of. We have agreed not only on the number of amendments but we have been very fair on the time allocation. 
   On this amendment today, there has been a good debate. We haven't taken an inordinate amount of time. 
   In short, I say to my friend, who was kind enough to yield to me, that nothing has changed since yesterday. We feel very strongly about our positions. We are happy to defend them, articulate, and advocate them this morning.

   As far as final passage, we know that there can be games played with that unless we set a time certain for final passage. We want a bill passed. We want it to pass in a very short period of time. Nothing has changed since yesterday on this side of the aisle. We want to move forward in an expeditious manner.

   The fact of the matter is, we are now debating one of the most important issues we face in this Congress. That is, What are we going to do with violence in our schools, violence in our society generally? 
   We could complete this juvenile justice bill in the next day or two. Amendments have been winnowed down to where we just have a handful. If we stick to the substance of the bill, we could have something very important for the American people. I hope we are allowed to go forward with this juvenile justice bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I really think that is unfortunate. We have worked all week trying to resolve this issue. I have worked personally with Senator DORGAN trying to whittle down these amendments. I have worked many hours these last couple of days. 
   We have now on our side and on the majority side worked to bring down the amendments to a fairly good number. For the life of me, I cannot understand why we cannot proceed working all day today offering amendments. We have people who are waiting to offer amendments. I have an amendment I will be happy to offer. 
   We have Senators who will talk into the night offering amendments. There is no effort on behalf of the minority to delay this matter. We have worked very hard to even get time limits on our amendments. We can complete this legislation very quickly. I have had the opportunity to look through some of the amendments the majority has locked in under a previous unanimous consent agreement. We can work today, all day Monday, and then Tuesday there would not be much left to do. 
   It is tremendously unfortunate that we are unable to proceed on this. I will tell you why, for a couple of reasons. 
   When I came home last night--I worked late on the emergency supplemental. I got home around 9:30 or 10 o'clock last night and looked through my mail. I was surprised to get a letter from a longtime friend. 
   As some of my friends know, I was born and raised in Searchlight, NV, a very small town. There are not a lot of people from Searchlight. But I received a letter from someone who was raised in Searchlight just like me, someone older than I am but someone I have known literally all my life. 
   I can remember when I was a 13-year-old boy. I moved from Searchlight to Henderson, NV, where there was a high school and I was living with an aunt. 
   Early one morning, we were all awakened because one of my uncles from Searchlight came to give us the very bad news that his stepdaughter had been shot while working at one of the hotels in Las Vegas by this crazed man who shot her for no reason. He did not know her. She was very, very attractive, and this man who should not have had a pistol shot her. 
   Much of what is in the letter is personal in nature--and not that this isn't personal in nature--but the other relates to my family. But, let me read the last paragraph. She closed this letter with:  
   Hope you can feel free to support all legislation knocking down the strong gun lobby. I would like to personally shoot the crotch out of Moses, also known as Charlton Heston. I have 46 years of anger built up on this issue.  
   She is a paraplegic.  
   I know it can be political suicide to go up against them, but they are rotten to the core  and selfish in their interests. While I have the best of friends and have managed to live (have not really had a life) I dare them to follow me in my wheelchair tracks.  
   She closes by saying:  
   Stay well, sweet boy [talking to me].  
   This legislation we are attempting to resolve needs to be resolved. People may disagree with my friend from Searchlight now living in Las Vegas, Jean McColl, who has spent 46 years in a wheelchair as a result of being shot by somebody that shouldn't have had a gun. But that is what we are debating in this Chamber. 
   We should have the opportunity to offer amendments. There is no reason in the world that we should not be able to offer the amendments. We have 30-plus amendments on this side. By Tuesday I bet we could get rid of 25 of them, leaving on Tuesday just a handful of amendments to work on. 
   I also not only indicate what was written by my friend, Jeannie McColl, a beautiful, wonderful woman, who shortly after she was injured by this crazed man, was divorced and has raised this little boy by herself; in addition to the letter from Jeannie, I received another letter from a man who was complaining about something he felt was somewhat improper. He lives in Reno.  
   Dear Senator REID: 
   I am writing in regards to the enclosed National Rifle Association membership that was mailed to my 13 year-old daughter. I am not a gun advocate and have never voiced an opinion and I certainly believe in our constitution and the right to bear arms but I am rather astonished that the membership application is addressed to my 13 year-old daughter. 
   As we strive in our community to ensure that our schools are safe for our children, one of the biggest fears that parents have is a gun at school. We have been able to turn her particular school around from a very violent and non-academic oriented institution to one that we are all very proud and where the students are doing extremely well. 
   I am absolutely amazed that the National Rifle Association would have the audacity to mail membership applications to children. At some point, I believe this must be part of our government regulations. Will my youngest 11-year-old daughter be contacted next with another outrageous suggestion that is only supporting violence?  
   It is signed: ``David L. Brody, Registered Voter''--that is how he lists his signature--Reno, NV. 
   Mr. President, Jeannie McColl, David Brody--we need to move forward with this legislation. 
   I see the majority leader. I certainly want to yield the floor to the majority leader. 
   Mr. Leader, what I have said here is that we have some amendments. We have people standing by to offer amendments. We really would like to do that. One of the Senators on the majority side objected to the offering of amendments. 
   I will be very brief. As I said, we want to work our way through these, as I indicated before the leader got here. We have 30-plus amendments. I think we could get rid of 20 of these amendments by Tuesday morning if we had the opportunity to offer these amendments today and Monday.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we want to do something on this bill. I have been asked personally by the majority leader and the minority leader to move this legislation along. I have pled with Members from the minority to narrow the amendment. We have done that. There are time limits on most every one. 
   We have spent 2 hours today trying to offer amendments. We want to offer amendments. We are being told we can't offer gun amendments, so we bring in the second most senior Member of the Senate to offer an amendment dealing with alcohol, and we are told we can't offer that. 
   What can we offer? I say to my friend from Utah, what can we offer? We want to move this thing along. I have been here since early this morning trying to move this bill along, and whatever we do we can't do it. You can't have it both ways. We can't be accused of trying to slow down the legislation and when we want to offer amendments we can't offer anything.

   I don't understand why we can't move forward with amendments. If somebody wants to make an objection to the amendment in the form of a speech, they can come anytime they want. That is how we do business around here. When an amendment is offered, you don't have to have on the floor somebody on the other side to oppose it. 
   We are being accused of slowing down this bill. We are doing everything we can to move the bill along. I hope everyone understands who is slowing down this bill. It is not us.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a Senate resolution which would designate November 20, 1999 as ``National Survivors for Prevention of Suicide Day.'' Let me begin by defining the term survivor. This refers to anyone who has lost a loved one to suicide. As such, having lost my father to suicide in 1972, I am viewed as a survivor in the suicide prevention community. Nationally, more than 30,000 people take their own lives each year in our nation. Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death in the United States and the third major cause of death among people aged 15-19. 
   The suicide rate among young people has more than tripled in the last four decades. Every year 200,000 people become survivors due to this tragic loss of life. We arrive at this number by concluding that for each suicide, seven other lives are changed forever because of the death. As you can imagine, this is a conservative estimate by all accounts. Today in our country, nearly 8,000,000 suicide survivors go on with their lives, many of them grieving in a very private way. This is because there still remains in our nation a stigma towards those who take their own life as well as those who are left behind to cope with the suicide of a loved one. I can't begin to tell you how many survivors have written me expressing the shame and guilt they feel about their loved ones' suicide, many of whom are still unable to deal honestly with the tragic conditions which ultimately led to someone they love taking their own life. 
   In the 105th Congress, both the House and Senate took very courageous steps to address the public health challenge of suicide by passing Senate Resolution 84 and House Resolution 212. Essentially, these resolutions recognized suicide as a national problem warranting a national solution. The resolutions also called for the development of a national strategy to address and reduce the incidence of outside. 
   I am proud to have been the sponsor of Senate Resolution 84 and proud of my colleagues for having lent their support to ensure its passage. I also commend Representative JOHN LEWIS for his leadership in the House and to all the members who provided their support to ensure its passage in the closing days of the last session. We cannot however, stop here. We must continue to show our compassion and assert leadership to take the necessary steps to mobilize our national response for suicide prevention. 
   Recently, there has been a fervor of activity and collaboration in both the federal and private sectors around suicide prevention. On the federal level, our Surgeon General, Dr. David Satcher has included the topic of suicide prevention on his public health agenda. In addition to Dr. Satcher's efforts, staff at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institute of Mental Health and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration have focussed increased effort on the issue of suicide prevention. In the private sector, groups such as the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention, the American Association of Suicidology and the Suicide Prevention Advocacy Network have worked together to increase national awareness 
   as well. There are countless others who, on a daily basis, make their commitment to assist in finding solutions to this national dilemma. The self-help groups, clinicians, researchers, and grass roots advocates are all making a vital difference. 
   In the near future, I hope to see the national strategy that has been developed by many who stepped to the plate, as called for in Senate Resolution 84 and House Resolution 212, to chart a course for our national effort. I hope to see hearings in the Senate soon on this issue and hope we will look at the recommendations seriously and lend our support to making this report one that does more than collect dust on a shelf, but instead a report that charts the course we must pursue to reduce the incidence of suicide in America and to convey our national resolve.  
   This year we will witness two events which deserve our recognition and support. On June 7, 1999 the White House will hold a White House Conference on Mental Health and later this year the Surgeon General will issue his report on mental health. The time has come when we must recognize that mental disorders are illnesses that can be treated effectively. We know that 90 percent of suicide victims have suffered from a mental disorder. Therefore, we must send a clear and unmistakable message that those who suffer should be encouraged to seek assistance and restore themselves to a healthy state of being. The Mental Health Parity legislation introduced by my good friends Senator PETE DOMENICI and Senator PAUL WELLSTONE is a step in the right direction. Their leadership on this issue has my full support and respect. There should be no barrier for individuals to obtaining help for whatever illness, including mental illness, if there is effective treatment available to assist them. We must remove the stigma and have the courage to show acceptance. 
   As you can see Mr. President, there is much that has been done but still much we in Congress can do to advance this agenda. Today, it is my intent to recognize the 8,000,000 survivors who all are at various stages of healing in addressing the loss of their loved one to suicide. I ask you to support me in turning their grief into hope, a hope that with acceptance and understanding, can lead our nation effectively addressing this very preventable public health challenge.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, two American soldiers have died in Kosovo, the first American casualties of a war to stop a genocide. 
   The contrast between what is unfolding in the Balkans, and what is happening here in Congress, could not be more clear. 
   A dictatorship, like the government of Slobodan Milosevic, imposes its will through force. 
   A democracy expresses its will through the act of voting. 
   Every vote that we cast in this body is an affirmation of the power of a democracy to solve its problems peacefully. 
   Today, my colleague and good friend JOE BIDEN cast his 10,000 vote in this body. That number reflects a record of public service matched by very few even in an institution like this one, through which so many great men and women have passed. 
   As Senators, we are all Members of a very exclusive club. We have been sent here on behalf of the good people of our respective States, to do their business. 
   With his 10,000th vote, JOE BIDEN has joined an even more exclusive club. 
   Over the history of this republic, thousands of men and women have served as Senators. But only a very few can say that they did such a good job--and kept doing a good job over such a long period of time--that they lasted long enough to vote as many times, on as many different issues, as JOE BIDEN.  
   But the thing that impresses me the most about JOE BIDEN's 27 years in the Senate isn't what he has done on the floor, or the number of votes he has cast--although his leadership, courage and dedication are well-known to those of us who are privileged to serve with him every day. 
   Instead, what impresses me most is his role as a husband to his wife Jill, and father to his sons Beau and Hunter and his daughter Ashley.

   Mr. REID. I rise before you today, not to complicate an already controversial bill, but instead to try to accomplish what I have tried to do through legislation in past years. 
   This is, to pass legislation requiring an independent audit of the Federal Reserve System, as is standard in every other Government entity in this country. 
   In fact, back in 1993, Senator DORGAN and I, requested a GAO investigation of the operations and management of the Federal Reserve System. 
   We were concerned because no close examination of the Fed's operations had ever been conducted. 
   As you may recall Mr. President, we found out quite a bit about the Federal Reserve. 
   We found, among other things, that the Fed has a `slush fund', or what they refer to as a `rainy day fund,' that they have kept there for over 80 years. 
   At the time of the GAO investigation, the Fed has squirreled away $3.7 Billion in taxpayer money. 
   The last report that I have from January 1998, shows that this fund has reached $5.2 billion. 
   You can bet that figure has gone up since then. 
   The Fed claims that this `slush fund' is needed to cover system losses. 
   Since its creation in 1913, however, the Fed has never operated at a loss. 
   The report that Senate DORGAN and I requested in 1993 also found that the Interdistrict Transportation Service had been engaging in questionable business activities. 
   These activities included the awarding of non-competitive contracts for the implementation of Interdistrict Transportation Services, gifts of payments for missing backup and grounded aircraft to nonperforming contractors and a pattern of studied indifference by supervisors to clear evidence of waste, fraud and abuse within its operations. 
   It was further troubling to find that the activities sanctioned by the Federal Reserve supervisors, was intended to have the practical effect of distorting marketplace behavior by competing unfairly against private sector companies in the air courier business. 
   In what remains as the first and only independent comprehensive review of the Federal Reserve System, the conclusions reached by the GAO paints a dreary picture of internal Federal Reserve operations and budgeting procedures. 
   This GAO report that I am referring to, makes a strong case for increased Congressional oversight of the Federal Reserve System operations that are unrelated to monetary policy. 
   Furthermore, only 1,600 out of nearly 25,000 Federal Reserve employees deal with monetary policy.

   Mr. REID. In this article, it states that the rest of these 25,000 employees deal with the Federal banks' check-clearing and other services. 
   Also cited in this article is another example of extreme waste by the Federal Reserve--that is, that the Federal Reserve has a fleet of 47 Learjets and small cargo planes. 
   Furthermore, the Fed publishes hundreds of reports on itself each year that includes something that strikes me as an absurd waste of funds--the Fed publishes a comic book for children on monetary policy--now, Mr. President, I know that we have advanced children in this country, and I'd like to think of my grandchildren as being part of that group, but I don't know many children that have an interest in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, nor do I know any that would understand it. 
   Mr. President, this amendment, in requiring a yearly audit, would help ensure, to the American taxpayers, and my constituency in Nevada, that the Federal Reserve is run more efficient and responsibly. 
   This amendment intentionally leaves monetary policy to Chairman Greenspan and his team. 
   It is my belief that the economy is great and that Chairman Greenspan is doing a great job. 
   In fact, many would say that our economy has never been better, which brings to mind the saying ``if it ain't broke, don't fix it.'' 
   Well, Mr. President, while the economy is not broken, much of the inner workings of the Federal Reserve is, and I, along with many others, intend to fix it.  
   Again, I want to make it very clear--I do not rise before this body today to meddle with monetary policy. 
   I am not attempting to interfere with, or impugn, the monetary policy of the Fed. 
   I am seeking greater accountability in the operating expenses and internal management of one of our more influential institutions. 
   This amendment simply requires a yearly audit that covers the operations of each Federal Reserve bank, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the Federal Reserve System in the form of a consolidated audit. 
   As my good friend and colleague Senator BENNETT pointed out to me last night, an audit of each of the 12 regional reserve banks is conducted now--however, these audits are not conducted in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. 
   For the audits that take place now, the accounting information is given to the auditor by the regional bank staff and the banks basically say, ``accept our figures, that's all you get.'' 
   In short, this amendment requires the Fed to use an independent auditor and for that auditor to use generally accepted accounting practices. 
   This amendment also requires that the report be made available to Congress, in particular the Committee on Governmental Affairs in this body and the Committee on Governmental Reform in the House of Representatives. 
   I believe that the Federal Reserve could do more to increase its cost consciousness and to operate as efficiently as possible. 
   This amendment will be one step closer to that end. 
   I encourage all Senators to support this amendment and to show our bosses, the American taxpayers, that we are looking out for them by ensuring accountability at the Federal Reserve.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Griffith Project Prepayment and Conveyance Act. This act directs the Secretary of Interior to convey the Robert B. Griffith Water Project, located in Clark County, Nevada, to the Southern Nevada Water Authority. To understand the intent of this bill, it is necessary to briefly discuss the history of the water delivery system which supports the Las Vegas Valley. 
   The Robert B. Griffith Water Project, also known as the Southern Nevada Water Project, was conceived as a federal reclamation project in Clark County, Nevada, in the 1960's. 
   Authorized by Congress in 1965, the enabling legislation directed the Secretary of Interior to construct, operate, and maintain the project for the purpose of delivering water to Clark County for both municipal and industrial use. The Congressional authorization also allowed the Secretary of enter into a contract with the State of Nevada, through duly authorized agencies, for the delivery of water and the repayment of reimbursable construction costs. 
   The federal portion of the Southern Nevada Water Project was completed in two stages over a period of 15 years at a cost of just under $200 million dollars, including capitalized interest. In 1982, with federal construction substantially completed, Congress officially changed the name of the project from the Southern Nevada Water Project to the Robert B. Griffith Water Project. 
   Coincidental with the federal construction of the water project, the State of Nevada, acting through the Colorado River Commission, constructed the Alfred Merritt Smith Water Treatment Plant. This facility is integrated into the Griffith Project, and together the facilities are referred to as the Southern Nevada Water System. Principal users of the water supplied by the system include the Las Vegas Valley Water District, the cities of Boulder, Henderson, and North Las Vegas, and Nellis Air Force Base. 
   In 1991, in the fact of dramatic growth in Clark County and the Las Vegas Valley, the State of Nevada, in cooperation with seven other public agencies, created the Southern Nevada Water Authority. The purpose of the Authority included acquisition of additional water supplies and the operation, maintenance, and expansion of the Southern Nevada Water System. 
   Beginning in 1995, the Colorado River Commission and the Southern Nevada Water Authority each began constructing additional facilities to expand the operational capacity of the Southern Nevada Water Authority each began constructing additional facilities to expand the operational capacity of the Southern Nevada Water System. By agreement in 1996, the State of Nevada and the Colorado River Commission assigned all of their interests, responsibilities, and liabilities in the System to the Southern Nevada Water Authority. 
   The Authority has now embarked on a multi-phrase expansion of the Southern Nevada Water System. When completed, this expansion is expected to have a capital cost exceeding $2 billion. The entire cost of the expansion is being financed through the Authority and its members. 
   One can see that the scope of the System is now much greater than that originally foreseen by Congress in 1965. When the first phrase of the original Southern Nevada Water Project was completed in 1971, fully 85% of the costs had been incurred by the federal government. At the end of 1998, the percentage of outstanding indebtedness financed by the federal government had fallen to 14% as compared to 86% for the Southern Nevada Water Authority. When the project expansion now being undertaken by the Authority is ultimately completed sometime around 2017, only 6% of the overall costs will have been financed by the federal government. 
   Because certain portions of the overall system are still in the name of the United States, it is becoming increasingly burdensome for the Southern Nevada Water Authority to manage the operation and management of the system. If for example, a pump station in the Griffith Project portion of the system requires repair or maintenance, Authority employees must notify the Bureau of Reclamation that a repair is needed, describe the exact nature of the work to be performed, obtain permission for a crew to perform the work and schedule the work to be done at such a time as when a Bureau of Reclamation employee can be present to ``oversee'' the repair or maintenance. When the work is completed, the Bureau of Reclamation sends the Authority an invoice for the time spent by its personnel. 
   The time has come for the title to the Griffith Project components of the Southern Nevada Water System to be transferred to local ownership. As proposed, this conveyance will occur under financial terms and conditions that are similar to other title transfer laws which have been enacted for other projects and which are governed by guidance from the Department of the Interior and the Office of Management and Budget. In particular, the conveyance will require a payment to the United States by the Authority equal to the net present value of the remaining repayment obligation. 
   I thank my fellow Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, for his support on this issue and look forward to working with the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee to ensure timely consideration of this important legislation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Patient Safety Act of 1999. This legislation focuses on the major safety, quality, and workforce issues for nurses employed by health care institutions and the patients who receive care in these facilities. 
   Health care consumers need access to information about health care institutions in order to make informed decisions about where they or their loved ones will receive care. My bill would require health care facilties to make information publicly available about staffing levels, patient care outcomes, and specific kinds of errors and avoidable patient care problems--such as bedsores. The Patient Safety Act would not require action to correct these problems. This is not a bill to regulate health care, but one that would provide individuals with the information they want and need when it comes time to make important health care choices. 
   As our front-line health care workers, nurses are usually the first to recognize dangerous patient care conditions. The Patient Safety Act would provide nurses and other hospital employees with ``whistleblower'' protections it they report problems that threaten patient safety to their employers, government agencies, or others. 
   Finally, the Patient Safety Act would dirct the Department of Health and Human Services to review mergers and acqusitions of hospitals to determine their long-term effects on the well-being of patients, the community and employees. While these types of transactions are regularly evaluated from a financial standpoint, little information is made available to the public about hwo such a change would affect the health care services available to them. 
   The Patient Safety Act is a valuable information resource for consumers. I urge you to join my efforts to provide consumers with the data necessary to make informed decisions about their health care providers.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to praise the outstanding accomplishments of a distinguished young man from Florida. At the age of 17, Abhishek Gupta has succeeded in making a greater contribution towards the alleviation of pain and suffering on a global scale than most people can boast of in a lifetime. Last November, Abhishek organized 9 other students and initiated a project designed to provide humanitarian relief to underprivileged citizens in his Southern Florida community and throughout the world. 
   In a rare exemplification of compassion and determination, Abhishek, a junior at Phillips Exeter Academy in New Hampshire, created a non-profit organization called ``Clothes, Food and Education for the Poor and Needy.'' Drawing on Abhishek's inspiration, this group worked toward the goal of raising $50,000 to provide crucial relief for numerous families about whom Abhishek had read in several local newspaper articles. 
   Abhishek went to work lobbying corporate sponsors to pay for operational expenses, and entreating members of his community to help him meet his goal. Ultimately, he exceeded his own expectations by raising $60,000 in a matter of weeks. He channeled this money toward helping impoverished children in Southern Florida and victims of Hurricane Mitch in Central America. 
   Mr. President, I have always believed that the most effective way to give charity is to give time--money comes second. I want to stress that Abhishek did not only formulate the infrastructure for raising such a lofty sum, he also spent part of his Christmas vacation accompanying a medical team to Honduras and Nicaragua in order to contribute personally. During his week in Central America, Abhishek helped administer food, clothing and medical supplies to the disaster victims, and  provided direct medical aid to nearly 600 patients who were in dire need of treatment. 
   ``Clothes, Food and Education for the Poor and Needy'' is continuing to collect donations for relief of the downtrodden, and I commend Abhishek Gupta for his dedication to such a worthy cause. It is rare that so young a citizen can play such a direct role in both reducing human pain and suffering, and providing inspiration to old and young alike.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Ivanpah Valley Airport Public Land Transfer Act. This act authorizes the Secretary of Interior to convey, at fair market value, certain lands in the Ivanpah Valley to the Clark County Department of Aviation. Authorization of this conveyance will allow the Department to proceed with the proposed development of a new airport to serve Southern Nevada. 
   As you are aware, growth in both the general population and the tourism industry in Southern Nevada has been and is expected to continue to be very strong. Statistics show that over half the people who come to Southern Nevada now come by air. From 1985 to 1998, operations at McCarran Airport increased at an annual rate of approximately five percent. Even if this growth rate slows to two percent, activities at McCarran will be at or exceed capacity by the year 2014. At this level, the traveling public will also experience significant delays. It is obvious we must begin to plan now for the future. 
   The Department of Aviation has completed an extensive review of options available for meeting the growing needs for air traffic in Southern Nevada. These options included construction of a new runway at McCarran and the building of an entirely new airport at any one of four different sites. Analysis of these options shows that for a variety of technical, safety-related, and economic reasons, the Ivanpah site is the only option that can accommodate the growing air traffic needs of the region. 
   The bill Senator BRYAN and I introduce today is based on similar legislation that was introduced in both the House and Senate in the 105th Congress. However, this bill incorporates changes from the prior legislation to address environmental concerns and issues that were raised by the Bureau of Land Management in testimony before the House Resources Subcommittee on National Parks and Public Lands last year. Some of those concerns were related to endangered species habitat, potential conflicts with existing uses, and determination of fair market value for the lands to be conveyed. 
   Congress should be aware that this is not a giveaway. Clark County will pay fair market value for the land and the airport will be publicly owned and operated. The bill also provides that the revenues collected by the government for the sale will be available for other use by the BLM under the terms of the Southern Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1998. 
   The Clark County Department of Aviation is committed to the preparation of necessary environmental documentation for airport construction once Congressional approval for the land sale is granted. The County cannot, however, invest the substantial amounts of time, dollars, and resources an environmental study demands without assurance the site will be available for purchase should an airport be deemed to have no significant negative impacts. The bill also provides for return of the land to the Department of Interior, should airport development prove to be infeasible. 
   I thank my fellow Senator from Nevada, Mr. BRYAN, for his support on this issue and urge my colleagues to vote for passage of this bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise to day to pay tribute to James B. McMillan, pioneer and leader of the civil rights movement in Nevada. James McMillan was a longtime Las Vegas dentist whose name was often associated with the local civil rights movement as well as the desegregation of Las Vegas casinos. 
   Dr. McMillan has been widely praised for his role in bringing down the color barriers in Las Vegas. He began his exemplary career in Detroit and then moved to Las Vegas where he became the first practicing black dentist. His pioneering initiatives were displayed through such efforts as helping to form the Human Rights Commission and his 1964 Senate run as the first black from Nevada to run for the U.S. Senate. Additionally, in 1971, McMillan became the first black to be appointed to the Nevada Board of Dental Examiners. 
   When McMillan first arrived in Las Vegas the town was dubbed the ``Mississippi of the West'' and blacks were generally not allowed in hotel-casinos. While serving in the Korean war, McMillan opened his home to house black entertainers. At the time, black entertainers were rapidly escorted in and out of hotels and were not allowed to fraternize with hotel guests but only to perform in the show rooms. However, desegregation began shortly before McMillan first came to Las Vegas in 1955 with the opening of the Moulin Rouge, the first integrated hotel-casino. Throughout his career McMillan worked to further the accessibility to hotel-casinos for blacks. 
   McMillan first felt the call to participate in the civil rights movement amid a turbulent atmosphere in 1959 at a NAACP Freedom Front Dinner. The speaker was NAACP Field Secretary Tarea Hall Pittman whose subject was ``Las Vegas, now is the time.'' Despite death threats, McMillan began organizing for a local peace march on the Strip which turned the tide in the struggle for integration. From this point on, McMillan devoted his life to provide and expand opportunities for blacks. He began to register black voters and recruit black teachers for local schools. At age 74 he was elected to the Clark County School Board. Eventually a school in northwest Las Vegas, The James B. McMillan Elementary School, was named in his honor. 
   Last year, McMillan published his autobiography, ``Fighting Back--A Life in the Struggle for Civil Rights.'' James B. McMillan's life truly was a reflection of a valiant, idealistic, and nonviolent struggle for equality. His lifeworks have opened doors for many blacks in the United States and will continue to be an inspiration for all who are engaged in the race for equality. 
   This U.S. Senator is a better person because of the efforts of Dr. McMillan. Nevada is a better state because of Dr. McMillan's refusal to accept the status quo and his lifelong dedication in the struggle for equality.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, there is a lot going on in the world today. We have the conflict in Kosovo. We have, as the Senator from Oregon pointed out, the calamity that has taken place in the State of Colorado, dealing with the death of 16 children, or maybe even more. 
   In spite of these very dramatic events taking place around the world, I think it is appropriate that we pause and reflect on one of the most important days we have each year, and that is Earth Day, which is tomorrow. 
   As we know, tomorrow will be the culminating day of this week legislatively because of the events that will take place with the 50th anniversary of NATO. So tomorrow we will be unable to celebrate Earth Day here in the Senate. So Senator BOXER and I felt it was appropriate that we spend some time with some of our colleagues talking about Earth Day and the importance of Earth Day. 
   There are a number of ways we can celebrate Earth Day, but I think there is no way that is more appropriate than talking about one of the things which sets the United States apart from any other nation, and that is our great National Park System. We are the envy of the rest of the world. When people talk about successes in Government, I think they must reflect upon our National Park System. 
   We have 54 national parks in the United States. In addition to that, we have a number of other entities within our National Park System that are important. But today I want to talk about our national parks. 
   We are very fortunate in Nevada; we have one of the 54 national parks. It is a unique setting. The Great Basin National Park is the baby of our National Park System. There is only one national park that is newer than the Great Basin National Park. And we are so happy to have the Great Basin National Park. It was 60 years in its coming. 
   I can remember when I introduced legislation to have this beautiful facility become a national park. This chart shows part of our national park. It is Wheeler Peak, which is about 13,000 feet high. You can see the majesty of this great mountain. 
   When I introduced this legislation, President Reagan was President of the United States. There were times that were very partisan then, as now, and the Secretary of Agriculture was asking the President to veto the creation of the national park. 
   I called in the Director of the National Park System, William Penn Mott, and I said, I am really worried that the President is going to veto the legislation creating this national park. He looked at me and said, There is no way President Reagan is going to veto this national park. He said, I have been with President Reagan; I worked with him when he was Governor of the State of California, and he has assigned me to be the superintendent of the parks for our country. He said, It was in the 1930s when I was a park ranger that I was called upon by Senator Key Pittman, a Senator from Nevada, to travel to Nevada to find a location for a national park. I went there, and I found that location. It is this exact spot that you have chosen to designate as a national park. 
   And he said, for political reasons, it has never come to reality. He said that possibility is now, and there is no way that President Reagan would veto the creation of this gem that we have in the State of Nevada. 
   He was right. The President gladly signed the bill, and we now have as part of our National Park System the Great Basin National Park. We could pick any one of the 54 units in our National Park System, and I am sure people from those States would be just as proud of that park as I am of the Great Basin National Park. This park has Wheeler Peak, which I show you here, but in addition to that, we have in the Great Basin National Park the only glacier in the State of Nevada. 
   In addition to that, you cannot see them here, but in this park we have bristlecone pine trees, the oldest living things in the world, more than 5,000 years old. We are going to celebrate a new millennium, 2,000 years. Well, 3,000 years before Christ was born, these trees started growing. That is an old tree, oldest living thing in the world located in this national park. 
   In addition to that, we have the Lehman Caves. The Lehman Caves are interesting because they were discovered unintentionally by a cowboy out doing whatever cowboys do. Suddenly he finds he and his horse have dropped into this subterranean cavern that became the Lehman Caves, which has been visited by hundreds of thousands of people over the years. 
   I am very proud of our National Park System. I am proud of the Great Basin National Park. Senator GRAHAM and I introduced legislation yesterday that will take $500 million a year from a fund that is already created, not new taxes, and put it into the National Park System where we are $4 billion in arrears just maintaining our national parks, maintaining the trails, the bathrooms, the information centers, the things that are so necessary to maintain this great program we have called our National Park System. 
   Certainly as part of Earth Day, we must recognize the fact that part of celebrating Earth Day has to be our National Park System. One last thing, because I see my colleagues on the floor, we are so honored in the State of Nevada, Dale Antonich, who is the chief park ranger of the Lake Mead recreation area, which is part of our National Park System, was chosen as this year's recipient of the Harry Yount National Park Ranger Award for excellence in rangering. This is important because he has been chosen by his peers to be the top park ranger. This says a lot. We are very proud of Lake Mead. It receives about 12 million visitors a year. He is the chief ranger there. I am sure that people who come to the park, to Lake Mead, receive a good experience. I want to give this resident of Boulder City, NV, all the accolades that he deserves as being selected as the 
   top park ranger in our country. 
   As I indicated, we have set aside 30 minutes. That is all the time we could get today to celebrate Earth Day. I did see in the Chamber my friend from California. I wonder if I could get the attention of my two colleagues. We have 30 minutes that we have set aside to talk about the parks. I am wondering if I could yield time to my friend from California. We are very proud of Nevada, but there is no State in the Union that has more natural beauty than California. I think Nevada has as much natural beauty, but there is no State that has any more natural beauty than the great State of California, which is the neighboring State of the State of Nevada. 
   I am very happy that the Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, is here to talk about some of the beauties of the State of California. I am sure that is what she is going to do; is that not true?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to insert into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD an analysis by the noted economist, Michael Evans. This information regards the poorly considered effort by the International Monetary Fund to sell all or part of their gold reserves to ostensibly help poor countries. Dr. Evans is a professor of economics at the Kellogg School at Northwestern University of Illinois. In this detailed analysis, Dr. Evan's reviews the history of recent gold sales and cautions that selling gold often degrades economic performance. Based on this empirical research, Dr. Evans states that countries that have resorted to gold sales have found their currency depreciated, their real growth rate down and their unemployment up relative to countries that did not sell gold. 
   The IMF has established a policy to ``avoid causing disruptions that would have an adverse impact on all gold holders and gold producers, as well as on the functioning of the gold market.'' The proposal that the IMF is now contemplating would directly conflict with this well-founded rule. In fact, the suggestion of gold sales has already adversely impacted gold holders and gold producers by causing an alarming drop in the price of gold. 
   Currently, the price of gold is at its lowest point in twenty years. This is significant because the low price of gold is now nearing the break-even point for even the larger mines. Therefore, these mines will be forced to either operate at loss or shut down entirely. With mining and related industries accounting for 3 million jobs and 5 percent of the gross domestic product, this would have a serious impact on our nations economy. 
   The IMF should abandon this initiative and pursue alternatives to assist these poor nations.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Georgia that this is important legislation. It has bipartisan support and we should move forward with the legislation. There is nothing that indicates that anybody is going to prolong this debate unnecessarily. We simply think it is appropriate that this legislation be handled in the manner that legislation has been handled in this body for many years--in fact, a couple centuries. 
   We understand that we are going to help the fighting men and women of our country, and it is certainly appropriate to do it around tax time because that is what this matter relates to, the tax burdens that face some of our people. There will be a delay, for example, as to when they have to file their returns. We are willing to do that, but we are not willing to enter into a restrictive agreement that just allows the manager to submit an amendment and no one else. We are ready to move forward on this legislation. We should be debating it now. We could go forward with the legislation this very minute and have this wrapped up in a matter of a few hours.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the needless delay is taking time here and being enmeshed in procedural matters that need not be enmeshed. I was asked to listen to a unanimous consent proposal that was advocated and propounded by my friend from Georgia. It is something that we believe is inappropriate. This legislation is going to pass and it is going to pass quickly. I think it will pass with relatively no opposition. The sooner we get to the merits of this legislation, the better off we will be. 
   I think it would not be untoward to allow a Member on that side or this side to offer an amendment. If the amendment is no good, and understanding the underlying importance of this legislation, it will either be defeated or the person will withdraw it. But there may be ways of improving this bill, ways that we can help the fighting men and women of our country in a manner different than is set forth in this legislation. I say to my friend, let's move forward with the legislation. It is now 1:25. I think this legislation could be passed by 4 o'clock with no trouble at all. So I hope we can move just as quickly as possible. This is important legislation for the people that are over in harm's way. We want to assist them in any way that we can.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the underlying bill is a pretty good bill, but it is not perfect. I think we should have the opportunity to take a look at it. Too often around here there is a group of people that get together and they agree on a piece of legislation which they think is miraculous and will solve all the problems of a certain issue. There are 100 Members of the Senate, and five or six people get together and bring it to the floor, and the procedure we follow too often is if anybody wants to debate it, they are considered obstructionists, people who don't believe in the underlying issue. 
   Let me repeat, Mr. President, that we on this side of the aisle believe in the underlying issue here. We want to provide tax relief for our fighting men and women, the soldiers, sailors and airmen who have given so much to this country in the last month. We also think that the legislation should be seen in the light of day. There are 95 other Members in the Senate that should have the opportunity to review this legislation. We are saying on this side, let's give them an opportunity; let's let those people who haven't been in on this so-called deal to bring this legislation up. Let them also take a look at this legislation. There may or may not be amendments offered, but there is going to be nothing done. We will prevent this bill from passing.

   Mr. REID. I am very happy, I say to my friend from Nevada, that I was here on the floor when he came to bring us the bad news. But the question I direct to my friend from Nevada--and there is no one who has worked harder on this issue than he has--is that it is my understanding that there is a consensus being developed by the administration and the Secretary of Energy, a number of the large utilities and somewhat smaller utilities around the country, and Members of Congress who have never been on this issue who are thinking that maybe the best thing to do is have the United States assume ownership of the nuclear waste and, in effect, take care of it on-site until there is a permanent depository. Is it true that there is an intensive development around here in that regard?

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce today, the Nevada Public Land Management Act of 1999. This Act provides a process for the sale of public lands to support the expansion and economic development of rural communities in Nevada. 
   Many of Nevada's rural counties are actively planning for economic growth and expansion. However, they are hampered, because more than 87 percent of Nevada is owned by the Federal Government and some Nevada counties are more than 90 percent owned by the federal government. As these counties seek to expand economic diversification, they find themselves land-locked by Federal lands. 
   But a lack of land is not the only problem these counties face. Many lack an adequate tax base, due to their lack of private lands. As the tax roles shrink and they experience some growth, officials are unable to adequately provide the basic public services expected of them. Adequate police and fire protection, education, road maintenance, and basic health care are suffering. 
   The legislation we introduce today will allow for the coordinated disposal of Federal lands that have already been identified by the Federal government and the Bureau of Land Management as suitable for disposal. Simply put, we are setting up a willing seller-willing buyer scenario. Sale of these lands will allow for economic diversification while implementing smart growth practices. Local governments will benefit from an infusion of revenue and a stable tax base to fund basic public services. 
   Senator BRYAN's and my bill requires that disposal of Nevada's lands be accomplished by competitive bidding, a process which will ensure that the sale of these public lands yield the highest return for the public. It is crucial to rural Nevada that we provide revenues for the basic services so many Americans take for granted, while also giving the Federal government the revenues they need to acquire truly special lands for future generations to enjoy. 
   Mr. President, this bill was drafted with conscious regard for the laws governing the management of public lands. In particular, the bill meets the intent of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act in three ways. First, it only involves lands determined to be suitable for disposal by the Bureau of Land Management's own land use planning process. Secondly, the bill assures that state and local governments are provided meaningful public involvement in land use decisions for public lands. And finally, the bill would allow for expansion of communities and economic development. 
   Two years ago I convened a Presidential Summit on the shores of Lake Tahoe to save the Lake. This Summit created a model of federal, state, local, public and private partnership. It is a model that the President said can apply across the nation and across the world. We learned there that we can call work together to preserve the nation's special places and promote economic growth. The legislation we introduce today is crafted with the Lake Tahoe Model in mind. It encourages cooperation between all levels of government and the private sector. It is supported by Nevada state and local officials on a bi-partisan basis and our Republican colleague Representative JIM GIBBONS has introduced similar legislation today in the House. 
   This kind of bill shows truly how government can work for the people in partnership. I urge its swift passage.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, the Social Security notch causes 11 million Americans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive less in Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch years. 
   The notch inequity is a direct result of changes made by Congress in 1977 to the Social Security benefits formula. 
   It is important that we restore the confidence of the notch victims and show them that we in Congress will accept responsibility for any error that was made. 
   While we must save Social Security for the future, we have an obligation to those who receive less than individuals who were fortunate enough to have been born just days before or after the notch period. 
   Many notch babies, through no fault of their own, receive more than $200 less per month than their neighbors. 
   It is time for us to right this wrong. I recently introduced legislation--the Notch Fairness Act of 1999--that proposes using any projected budget surplus to pay a lump sum benefit to notch babies. 
   While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch problem once and for all and restore the confidence of the millions of notch babies across this land. 
   Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been in the case of the notch babies. 
   Please join my efforts to correct the inequity created by the Social Security notch.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a man who is a Member of this body who has devoted his entire adult life to public service. Today I speak of Senator JOHN BREAUX of Louisiana. I do that today because there are a number of things that have been written since yesterday, when the Medicare Commission made their report. I think lost in the information that has been produced is the fact that Senator BREAUX has spent tireless hours, weeks, and months on this one proposal. 
   When I came to the Congress in 1982, Senator BREAUX had already been a Member of the House of Representatives for 10 years. He came to the House of Representatives when he was 28 years old. As I said, he has served his entire adult life in public service. Even prior to coming to the House of Representatives, Senator BREAUX had worked on a congressional staff. 
   Here is a man who could have been a success, as he has been as a Member of the House of Representatives and the Senate, in anything he wanted to do. He had a fine record as a student. He could have made a lot of money practicing law, but he decided to devote his life to public service. I think too often we lose sight of what people do to contribute to the public good. 
   In my estimation, no one has contributed to the public good more than Senator John BREAUX in the years he has been a Member 
   of the House of Representatives and the Senate. If there is a difficult problem, JOHN BREAUX has to be called in to work on that problem. 
   This is an example. He was called to be the Cochairman of the Medicare Commission, a very difficult job, but there was someone needed who understood the finances of this country; and that includes the tax structure of this country, that includes the very difficult health care delivery system we have, not only for those people who are not seniors, but particularly seniors, people who are on Medicare. I think we tend to forget how complex Medicare is and how important it is to the well-being of this country. 
   Mr. President, I served as a member of a county hospital board when Medicare came into being in the 1960s; 1966 through 1968 I served on that board. Prior to Medicare coming into being, about 40 percent of everyone that entered our hospital who were seniors had no health insurance of any kind. And that is the way it was around the rest of the country. 
   Today, though, Mr. President, over 99 percent of seniors have health insurance. That is because of Medicare. Senator BREAUX understood this very difficult problem. That is why he was asked to be the Chairman of this Commission. 
   Of the 17 members of this Commission, 10 of them agreed as to what should be done. I am not going to get into the merits of what the findings of the Commission were other than to say it was very difficult. Ten people agreed to the findings because of the diligent work of Chairman BREAUX. 
   I repeat, he did not spend hours on this program; he did not spend days--he spent weeks of his time. When other people were doing other things with their constituencies at home or taking a little time off from the rigors of this body, he was devoting his time to working on Medicare. 
   I mention that because not only was Senator BREAUX called in to be the Chair of the Medicare Commission, he has also done a number of other difficult things. We in the West understand the Wallop-Breaux legislation which established a program for restoring our coastal areas in the country. It set damages for boats that damaged the environment. It is a very important part of the environmental movement that has taken place in this country. Senator BREAUX was at the forefront of that. The legislation is named after him.  
   When, in 1993, we needed to pass a bill, the Budget Deficit Reduction Act, we needed to pass a bill that would put this country on a sound financial footing, one of the persons that worked on this to make sure that this was able to be accomplished was Senator BREAUX. He worked on the energy part of that legislation. Being from the State of Louisiana, he knew that area as well as anyone. 
   As a result of his good work on that, enough votes were gathered on the Democratic side of the Congress to pass that legislation. Without his work it could not have happened, and we would not be in the economic situation we are in today where we have reduced a series of 30 to 40 years of yearly deficits to now where we are having a surplus, where we are talking now about what we are going to do with the budget surplus. 
   A lot of what we are talking about today is the direct result of work in that legislation and other pieces of legislation by Senator BREAUX. 
   In short, I want to make sure that Senator BREAUX and the people of Louisiana understand our appreciation for the work 
   that he has done with his Medicare Commission and what he has done as a Member of Congress generally. 
   I have worked as a legislator on the State level, and back here now for going on 17 years. I think JOHN BREAUX is really an example we can all look to. I repeat, if a difficult problem arises, we call upon JOHN BREAUX to be part of the consensus building. Legislation is the art of compromise, the art of consensus building. And no one stands for being a good legislator more than Senator JOHN BREAUX. 
   As far as the Medicare problem he worked on, as a result of his leadership, it is going to mean a great deal to this country. As Senator BREAUX has said, the battle is not over. He said, ``I'm going to keep working on this issue as long as I'm in Congress.'' 
   So I again extend my appreciation and applause and recognition to Senator JOHN BREAUX for the good work that he did on this legislation. I do not know of anyone that could have accomplished what he did. It was a masterful piece of work. The people of the State of Nevada and this country should be as appreciative as we are of the work that he has done.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, 
   Groucho Marx used to say that he wouldn't belong to any club that would have him as a member. I get that feeling about the very small club consisting of those who have been awarded the Medal of Honor. 
   Nobody asks to join, the price of admission is too high. Nobody applies, the rules don't permit applications. 
   You get in this select club by doing something that no one would do, or should I say rarely does, and most of the time you pass the test by not surviving it. 
   I dare say that if BOB KERREY had been offered membership in this club as a volunteer, he would have declined. But membership isn't voluntary. 
   Once you have performed those acts of outstanding courage, of valor, of heroism--above and beyond the call of duty--once you have come through the valley of the shadow of death and into the light--once you have, in the unique circumstances of military combat, saved lives and taken lives and in most instances, given your own life, to qualify for the medal--you are a marked man.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I didn't know Jacob Chestnut, but I did know Detective John Gibson, as a result of an unfortunate incident with a member of my family. Officer Gibson reacted in a very valiant way on something a couple months before he was murdered last July in this Capitol complex. 
   Jacob Chestnut and John Gibson, about 9 months ago, were murdered. They were murdered when an assailant went through a door, shot both of them, killed both of them, and was after other people as well. The Presiding Officer, being a physician/surgeon, was on the floor and rendered great aid and assistance to others who were injured, for which we are all grateful. After that tragedy, many of us stood on this floor and talked about the need to do something to stop these incidents in the future. 
   Mr. President, I look at this in a number of different ways. I look at it as someone who knows what a valiant man John Gibson was and, of course, I am sure Officer Chestnut also; I just did not know him on a personal basis. I approach this on the basis that I am a Senator and have some responsibility for this Capitol complex. I approach it as a person who is concerned about my staff and the visitors who come to this complex being safe and secure. 
   I approach it also as a former Capitol police officer. I have great empathy and great understanding, I believe, for what police officers go through in this facility. What we talked about last year, after this incident, is that finally, after more than a decade, we were going to do something to create a visitors center in the east plaza. In this beautiful Capitol complex, we have a big parking lot; we have asphalt. We have talked about having a nice grassy area, as well as an underground area where people can come and enter the Capitol. 
   Now, if people want to come and take a tour through the Capitol, they stand out on the east plaza, on that asphalt. No matter the temperature, it can be 5 degrees below zero, they still stand out there. There is no place else for them to go. If it is 
   100 degrees, like it gets here in August, they still stand out there. There is no place else for them to go. There is no place for them to get a drink of water. There is no place for them to go to the bathroom. They stand out on the asphalt waiting to come through the Capitol. 
   After the unfortunate murders of these two police officers, we talked about how we were going to do something. We immediately authorized a bill to allow construction of this facility. After that was done, we appropriated money to initiate the planning of this visitors center. In fact, we are no closer to completion of this facility today than when these two officers were gunned down by this man, this terrorist. 
   We need to move forward with this effort. However, we have created a bureaucratic nightmare. We have four or five committees and subcommittees which have jurisdiction over how it is going to be constructed, when it is going to be constructed, and who is going to be constructing it, in what manner it is going to be constructed. We have heard lately that other committees want to get involved. We do not have enough now. We want to add some more. 
   I say, as a member of two committees that are talking about this, out of the three or four that are involved, I think we should get on with the business at hand. I understand the need for oversight, I understand very much, but there comes a time when we have said enough and we must move forward to do what we have to do. 
   This is not a waste of taxpayers' money. If we have this beautiful facility, not only will it be a convenience for the public but it will be a safety factor, because it will give a way to funnel people in this Capitol so that proper measures can be taken to find out if they are carrying weapons or bombs or anything else that could be of danger to the people inside this facility. In addition to that, it will be a place where people can go to the bathroom and escape from the elements. It will probably be set up so that there will be places for them to eat. In effect, it will be a place where there will be revenues gained from this facility. We owe this facility to the two officers who were gunned down 9 months ago, we owe it to our staffs, for we, as Members, are responsible for their safety and security. We owe it to the millions of people who come to this facility on a yearly basis. We are very proud of this U.S. Capitol; all Americans are. We should be able to come to this Capitol without fearing for our safety. 
   For more than 10 years, well before last year's tragedy, there had been a lot of talk about building a Capitol complex visitors center, but it has only been talk. It is about time we turn this talk into action, for the good of the country. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

Let's round it off and say we have 1 million people in prison, and 820,000 of those people in prison, men and women, have not graduated from high school. If there were no better reason to do something about the dropout problem, that would be it. We have to keep young men and women in school. Three thousand children drop out of school every day, 500,000 a year. This amendment would do nothing to take away from local school districts absolute control as to how they handle dropouts, but it would give them additional resources and assets they now do not have.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have more than 1 million people in our prisons around the country. Let us just round it off and say we have 1 million people in prison. Eight hundred twenty thousand of those prisoners have no high school education; 82 percent of the people in our prisons today are without a high school education. That is why Senator BINGAMAN and I have offered an amendment to create within the Department of Education someone to specialize, to work on, to keep these kids in school. 
   Every day 3,000 children drop out of school in America. Since we started the debate on this legislation, 15,000 children have dropped out of high school. Every one of those children dropping out of high school are less than they could be. I have heard statements here the last several days saying, well, why do we need to talk about kids dropping out of school? Why don't we talk about the children who are handicapped who need money? 
   I acknowledge that. The fact of the matter is, we have tried on this side of the aisle to get more funding for special education and have been unable to do so because of not having enough votes on that side of the aisle. It is not an either/or situation. We need to help local school districts with more funding for handicapped children, and I recognize that. I will do that. If we had a vote on that today, I would vote for it. 
   That does not take away from the fact that we need to do something about high school dropouts. I do not believe, personally, there is a more important problem in education today than kids dropping out of high school, half a million children each year dropping out of high school. I think we should go back and find out where we are. 
   As the manager on the Democratic side of this legislation, Senator KENNEDY, has said, we are not trying to eat up lots of time. We will agree to half hour amendments on five amendments. That takes 2 1/2 hours, 15 minutes on each side, and vote on them, vote them up or down. The legislation, we feel, is important. If the other side doesn't want to vote for them, have them vote against them. I think it would be a very difficult vote, for example, on the Bingaman-Reid legislation to vote against keeping kids in high school, but that is a privilege. 
   The majority leader of the U.S. Senate, on February 23, gave a speech to the National Governors' Conference at their annual meeting:  
   Now when we bring up the education issues to the floor next week, [there will] be some amendments and disagreements........That's great. Let's go to the Senate floor, let's take days, let's take a week, let's take 2 weeks if it's necessary. Let's talk about education.  
   I respectfully submit to the majority leader that he must have left his remarks with the Governors and didn't bring them to the floor of the Senate, because after a little more than a day of debating Ed-Flex, we in effect have been gagged. It seems around here that we can only vote on amendments the majority wants to vote on; that we have no ability to bring up amendments we feel are important. 
   The Ed-Flex bill is important legislation. We support that legislation. But we do not support the legislation without having the legislation made better. I am not going to talk about the afterschool programs and the new teachers we need and school construction; others can do that and do that well. I am here to talk about the Bingaman-Reid legislation which talks about children dropping out of school. 
   The Ed-Flex bill would be made a better bill if we said within the Department of Education there would be $30 million a year--that's all--$30 million a year out of this multibillion-dollar budget that we would use to work on keeping kids in high school. Think if the bill succeeded to the effect that we could keep in school every day 500 of those 3,000 children--500 kids that would be what they could be. They would have a high school education. They could more easily support their families. They could go on to college and trade school. You cannot do that if you have not graduated from high school. We would only--and I underline ``only''--only have 2,500 high school dropouts a day. 
   Mr. President, I think we need to move forward and have a debate on education. A debate on education allows us to talk about what we want to talk about, and we would improve the Ed-Flex bill.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from New Mexico I went to a high school that had a few hundred kids in 
   it. I moved from a very small rural town in Nevada to what I thought was a very, very big high school. The size of that school today is insignificant compared to the size of the high schools in the metropolitan Reno-Las Vegas area. There are numerous Las Vegas high schools that have over 3,000 students. 
   The Senator displayed a chart indicating the reasons kids drop out of school--failing, couldn't get along with teachers, didn't like school. Can you imagine how lost a person would feel coming from Searchlight, NV, which had 1 teacher teaching all 8 grades, to a school with over 3,000 kids? I think it would be easy not to like school, wouldn't the Senator think?

   Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from New Mexico, he was always very faithful in attending when I had the responsibility of the Democratic Policy Committee and we did a retreat. And he will remember a woman by the name of Deborah Meier came to speak to the group of Senators assembled. As the Senator may recall, she had been an elementary school principal in New York in this very, very large public school. She came to the realization one day as principal of the school that she was basically wasting her time. The scores of the children were very bad; there was nothing she could seem to do that was right in helping these kids achieve. 
   So she went to the school board and said she would like to try a radical experiment: We have this elementary school; let's break it up into four separate schools. We will have four separate principals, four separate sets of teachers. It will be like four schools in one building. They will each have their separate identity, with separate names. 
   She has written a book entitled ``The Power of Their Ideas.'' In this book she talks about this and how immediately the grades soared, the scores on their national tests soared. 
   Does the Senator remember that presentation?

   Mr. REID. I thank the Senator. 
   Mr. President, I express my appreciation to the Senator from New Mexico for his substantive contribution to what goes on here in the Senate. There are very, very few Senators in the history of this body who add so much substance as the Senator from New Mexico. He is a person who, by education alone, should contribute--Harvard undergraduate, Stanford Law School. But it is more than just the education. He has put his education and his experience to the benefit of the people of the State of New Mexico and this country. 
   There is no better example of that than this legislation which I am honored to be able to cosponsor with the Senator. Again I repeat, of the people in prison today, if there were 100 people in prison in our country today, 82 of those prisoners would never have graduated from high school. 
   Let's say there were 1,000 prisoners in America today; 820 of those would never have graduated from high school. If there were 10,000 prisoners, 8,200 would never have graduated from high school--and on and on, until we get to the point where we have approximately 1 million people in prison today, and 820,000 of those have never completed high school. 
   Mr. President, every day, 3,000 children drop out of high school. Every day. It would seem to me that there should be no greater concern in this body than making sure that that does not happen. 
   Now, I don't expect magic to occur tomorrow after this legislation passes, and that we are going to have all 3,000 children stay in school, but let's say that we could make some progress so that only--I say that with some trepidation--only 2,500 dropped out every day. That would mean 500 children every day would be children who could arrive at a better life. They would be able to achieve what they should be able to achieve. 
   The concerns that we have with this dropout rate is magnified every day when you read in the paper about people doing things wrong. Most of them are high school dropouts. And 500,000 students dropped out of school before graduating from high school every year. I am sorry to say that dropout rates are the highest in the southern and western regions of the country. 
   I am very embarrassed to say that in the State of Nevada, 1 out of every 10 children drop out of high school. I wish we did not lead the country, but we do. We have to do something to change dropout rates all over the country. Of course, Nevada, as I have said, leads the Nation, but no one else should feel very high and mighty about the fact that only 8 or 9 out of 100 drop out in other States. It is too many. We have to make sure that there is progress made in lowering the national dropout rate. 
   Why do children drop out of school? The reasons are diverse. We talked about some of them with Senator BINGAMAN earlier. We must invest in diverse, innovative solutions to help kids stay in school. What we are talking about here, Mr. President, is not some vast Government program. In fact, the same legislation that we are talking about today, Senator BINGAMAN and I offered last year in the form of an amendment, and it passed. We got 74 votes in the Senate, but it was killed in the House. I hope we get more than 74 votes this time. I can't imagine how anyone could vote against this legislation. 
   We are asking that there be $30 million a year for the next 5 years--a drop in the bucket out of the $1.5 trillion we spend basically every year--establishing within the Department of Education a division, a bureau, the sole responsibility of which would be to work to keep kids in school. They would do that by looking around the country at programs that are successful. There are some that work pretty well. We would tell school districts to apply for a grant, a challenge grant, and we would give them the money to implement that program. 
   This would not mean the Federal Government is micromanaging what goes on in school districts. The school districts would manage every program the Federal Government would assist them with. There are some really fine programs around the country. In fact, on a web site, every month, there is a model program dealing with dropouts. Every month, they put on the web site a program that they think should focus attention on keeping kids 
   in school. The model programs in March were called the Truancy Intervention Project and Kids in Need of Dreams. The pseudonym is TIP and KIND. These programs have dealt with kids of all levels. We can't just go to a high school and say that is where we are going to start keeping kids in school. We have to work from the time they start kindergarten. It is a program that kids don't just drop out of school in the 9th, 10th, 11th or 12th grades. Their inclinations and feelings about school develop much earlier than that. That is why I talked with the Senator from New Mexico about the great program in New York where they broke up a very big elementary school and suddenly found that the kids weren't slower than other kids, that they weren't less inclined to learn than others; they just needed a setting for learning. That is why we need to have this bill passed, so that schools around the country that are having problems with dropout rates can at least meet part of their needs. 
   The program I talked about--the model program in the month of March--is a program whose objective was to provide an early positive intervention with children reported as truants, because truancy usually characterizes other symptomatic behavior. TIP volunteers work to determine and satisfy their clients' needs so that the clients may return to school. The program works to meet the daily necessities of clothing, water, heat, transportation and long-term needs. They even go into drug, psychiatric, tutoring and child care. It is a program used in Fulton County, GA. Its funding came from an Atlanta law firm and other private donations--the law firm of Alston and Byrd. As I say, this is the model program of March on this web site. 
   In Las Vegas, at Horizon High School in the Clark County school district, there is a program there dealing with teen mothers and fathers and pregnant teens. This is a program that is part of the alternative education project that facilitates high school graduation of teen parents and pregnant teens by providing quality day-care services. There may be some who say, Why should the school district get involved in such a program? Well, as the Senator from New Mexico mentioned, we are going to cut back on social promotions, but we don't want to dump out in the streets all of these kids who  are not going to be socially promoted. We need programs to get them into the next level honestly. We can do that with summer alternative programs, afterschool programs, tutoring programs. When a child, for whatever reason, becomes a parent, he or she should not automatically have to drop out of school. That is why the program in Las Vegas is something that I think deserves national attention. 
   These classes are set up to keep these kids in school--kids having kids--and are structured to provide these children with skills in listening, speaking, independent thinking, and even personal hygiene. There are programs in the Western States--and I am certain the Senator from New Mexico can appreciate that. We have programs where we focus on Indian children. There is a program in the Washoe County school district that focuses on keeping Indian students in school. There is a tremendously high dropout rate with Indian children. The program that is being tested really to work with these children is one that I think will work very well; it is called Phone Work. It is a voice mail approach to assist parents and teachers in the monitoring of the students' homework assignments. Parents are able to leave recorded messages for the teacher, providing a two-way communication between home and school. The teacher's responsibilities include recording daily assignments by a certain time of day, verifying each student's class assignments, written in the Phone Work assignment book, and that each student takes home books and materials that are needed. Student responsibilities include recorded homework assignments, taking books and materials home, and having parents check completed assignments and assign a designated time and place for a student to study. These are details that some may think are not important, but if you are trying to keep children in school--and there are some difficulties because the parents work, but this system allows, through the telephone--a program called Phone Work--that the teacher and the parent keep in touch and work to keep this child in school. 
   One of the programs that I have worked on and have been impressed with is a program called OLA in Carson City. Surprising to most people is the fact that Nevada has a large number of Hispanic students, Hispanic people, but more students than adults. We have in the State of Nevada, in the Clark County school district, in the Greater Las Vegas area, the eighth largest school district in the United States, and over 25 percent of the students in the Clark County school district are Hispanic. 
   Other places in Nevada also have large Hispanic populations. In Carson City, NV, our capital, we have a program, as I have indicated, called the OLA Carson City Program, designed to keep Hispanic children interested in school. It has done a remarkable job. It has been in existence for 4 or 5 years. They produce a television program where they interview people who work in government, who work in the private sector. I have been doing interviews in their program at their station for some 4 years. They are excited young people. They not only do television, they are not only involved in the TV station, but they are involved in other things. This has helped these kids--I have heard them say so--develop self-confidence. They are proud of the fact that they can speak two languages. When I go there, one of the students will interpret for me. They have become more confident since connecting with the community. They have a recognition of the opportunities that are available to them. Their personal goals have risen steadily. They have won awards and honors in the community for their efforts. They have become actively involved in communicating their importance to their peers and to younger Hispanic youth. They started a tutoring program. There is a youth leadership club, advanced group, enthusiasm, volunteers for all kinds of programs in the community. They work in the juvenile justice system. The Governor selected them to work in the Goals 2000. 
   This is a wonderful program, Mr. President, one that should be available to the rest of the country. That is what this amendment provides. It makes these programs available to the rest of the country. I think that is all we can ask for--that school districts have the ability. If they want to make an application saying they have a dropout problem, what programs are available? What programs would meet their needs? Have experts give them different alternatives, and they can choose from those. If their grant is in effect, then it is up to them to implement the program; the Federal Government stays out of their lives. 
   We have a significant problem in southern Nevada especially. That is rapid growth. We have the most rapidly growing city and the most rapidly growing State in the country. We have to keep up with the growth in the schools. We have to build a school and a half a month to keep up with the growth in the Clark County school district. We hold the record of dedicating 18 schools in 1 year. The growth is phenomenal. Our long-time superintendent of schools is a very courageous, very good superintendent by the name of Brian Cramm. He has become more of a construction superintendent than a school superintendent. Think of that--a school and a half a month. The goal has been met. In 1 year, 18 schools were dedicated in the Clark County schools. But in an effort to accommodate all of these students, we have huge schools. As Senator BINGAMAN and I have spoken about, we really need to focus on ways of having smaller schools. 
   I frankly don't think, unless the Federal Government recognizes this high school dropout problem is the problem that it really is, that we are going to get help. One of the things we have tried to do, separate and apart from this amendment but which will complement this amendment, is to get school construction money. School districts all over the country are having bond issues fail. We are very lucky and fortunate. We are blessed in southern Nevada because the people in Clark 
   County are continuing these bond issues. Over $2 billion in bond issues have passed in four separate elections during the last 10 years--over $2 billion. Around the rest of the State of Nevada, though, they haven't been so fortunate. Schools are not being built because they cannot get the bond issues passed. We have some counties which simply do not have the financial wherewithal to build new schools. They are in counties where there is a lot of Federal land. There is no mining. There is minimal ranching going on. They simply can't afford to build new schools, and kids are being educated in facilities that really, in the eyes of some, should be condemned. 
   The bill for school construction would help rapidly growing school districts such as Clark County and Lincoln County, which need help because of the lack of economic growth in those counties. That is something that could complement this and hopefully would have school districts focus on not how big they can build a school but how many schools they can build to accommodate the children. 
   I hope, Mr. President, that this issue dealing with 3,000 children dropping out of school every day is something the Senate will focus on. It is, as I have indicated, the No. 1 problem as far as I am concerned with our schools today--children dropping out of school. I recognize the reason for children dropping out of school is varied. There are a lot of reasons they drop out of school. But whatever the reason, it is a situation that we must focus on. We must do something to keep children in school. 
   Mr. President, let's talk about the future for high school dropouts. We know that unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice those of boys or girls who graduate from high school. The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high school dropouts than for those who have finished high school. The median personal income of high school graduates during the prime learning years--25 to 54--is nearly twice that of high school dropouts. 
   I have to mention again that 82 percent of the people in our penitentiaries or prisons or jails around the country are high school dropouts. The children of high school dropouts, it has been statistically proven, have a much higher probability of dropping out of school than children whose parents did not drop out of high school. 
   Let's look, as Senator BINGAMAN did, at Hispanics and what is happening around the country with Hispanic children. I talk about the OLA Carson City Program, which is a miracle program. It is working wonders in Carson City.  But we have too many Hispanic children all over the country dropping out. We have too many Hispanic children dropping out of schools in Nevada. We talk about a dropout rate of over 30 percent, which is some 200 to 300 percent higher than other children and something we should become concerned about. 
   Why are so many Hispanic children dropping out of school? The bulk of Hispanic students who come to Nevada and the western part of the United States are from Mexico. Mexico does not have a tradition of public education. In addition to that, there are language problems that we all realize. We also have the phenomenon that Hispanics are noted for having a really good work ethic. They believe in working hard. They are not afraid to work. That is a bad combination, because with the shortage in the labor market there are people who entice young men and women who are Hispanic to go to work. That gives them another excuse not to be in high school, because they are making fairly decent money. The fact of matter is, they are still doing those entry-level jobs when they are 55 or 65 years old. 
   We have a problem that we have to identify. The Hispanic students have a dropout rate of 30 percent compared to an overall rate of 11 percent. And the 30 percent is lower than it is in a lot of places. Unemployment rates for Hispanics is high. That is because, for those who have not finished high school, it is really hard to get a job. Forty-nine percent of all persons living in Hispanic households receive some type of means-tested assistance. 
   We can make all of these figures disappear with a high school education. We need to do that. 
   As we all know, with this new census that is going to be completed in a year and a half or so, it is going to show a tremendous rise in the number of people of Hispanic origin making up the population of the United States. By the year 2030, Hispanics will make up 20 percent of the population of the United States. Even about 10 years from now, by the year 2010, the Hispanic origin population is projected to become the second largest ethnic group in the United States. 
   Soon, as you know, it will be the No. 1 ethnic group. We need to address the dropout problem in this country for everyone, but especially for the Hispanics. Hispanic leaders all over America understand this and are working hard. But I think we need to focus on what we can do in the Department of Education to assist them. 
   I have spoken to the Hispanic leaders in the State of Nevada and this is clearly the No. 1 problem--keeping their youth in school, having them finish high school. That is how the national Hispanic leaders feel also. 
   If we do not address the dropout problem in this country now, we will be faced in the future with a weak and uneducated workforce. We don't need that. We can't stand that. We will have increased unemployment rates, increased prison incarceration rates, and an increase of people on welfare and other Federal assistance programs. By keeping our kids in school, we are attacking much larger social and economic problems. 
   It may be a surprise to many, but there is no national plan to lower the dropout rates--there is none--and no targeted program to help schools most in need of restructuring to lower dropout rates and raise achievement. We would all think this should have been done a long time ago, but it has not been. I think it is time to keep our children in school. It should become a national priority. 
   Again, unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high school dropouts than for those who have finished high school. The median personal income of high school graduates is twice that of high school dropouts. The median income of college graduates is three times that of high school dropouts. For the fourth time: 82 percent of our people in prisons have not graduated from high school. Need we go further? 
   So I hope this bill will receive overwhelming support and that we can get this bill passed in the House of Representatives. This is something that is important. This amendment is as important as the underlying legislation--I believe more so. I, again, express my appreciation to the people of the State of New Mexico for sending to the Senate someone with the abilities, the skill of Senator BINGAMAN. This amendment is an important amendment. It has been an honor for me to work with him on this. I repeat, I hope the Senate overwhelmingly passes this much-needed amendment.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Vermont, the manager of this bill, we need flexibility now and I acknowledge that. But we also need something to address these children who are dropping out of school now, 3,000 children a day. I can tell my friends in the majority, they may table this amendment today or tomorrow--whenever they decide they want to do it--but they better get used to voting on it. Because every time a bill comes up, whether it is missile defense--it doesn't matter what it is--I am going to offer this amendment. 
   Mr. President, 3,000 children are dropping out of school every day and we have to do something about it. It received 74 votes last year. Let people who voted for this bill last year come and vote against it this year and get it lost in the hole on the other side of the Congress. 
   This bill needs to pass. We have children dropping out of school every day, 3,000 of them, 500,000 a year. Eight-two percent of the people we have in prison are high school dropouts. Do you think that is something we should address, or wait for a 5-year education bill? 
   This is something that people, if they are going to vote against it, they are going to vote against it more than once, because I am going to keep offering this. I do not think there is anything more important we can do than vote on keeping our children in school. 
   Mr. VOINOVICH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. REID. The Senator would have to ask Senator Miller--a Freudian slip there--Governor Miller that question. There are a lot of good programs in the country. That is the whole point of this amendment, that we have to have these amendments, these 
   different programs available to everybody in the country. Then the school districts can pick and choose those. You may think that program is the best program in the country. Others may disagree. But the fact of the matter is, this amendment that I am offering does nothing to take away from the ability of school districts to manage their schools any way they see fit. It does give the resources to the school districts all over the country that they now do not have. I think it certainly seems that we should have a national strategy for dropouts, which we now do not have.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to designate the new hospital bed replacement building at the Ioannis A. Lougaris Medical Center in Reno, Nevada, in honor of Mr. Jack Streeter. 
   Jack Streeter is Nevada's most decorated veteran from World War II. He was born on December 1, 1921 in Ely, Nevada. For his valiant service, he was awarded five Silver Stars, five Purple Hearts and the two Bronze Stars. He was a combat infantryman and served with the 1st Infantry Division (Big Red One). He left the service as a captain, U.S. Army. 
   Mr. Streeter has an incredible life history of business and professional success. Mr. Streeter is an attorney at law, practicing for over forty years in the State of Nevada. 
   Jack graduated from the University of Nevada Reno in 1943, where upon after completing Officer Candidate School at Fort Benning, Georgia, he entered the U.S. Army as a second lieutenant. He saw combat throughout Europe in the Second World War in such places as the Normandy invasion on D-Day, the Battle of the Bulge, the St. Lo Breakthrough, Battle of Mortain, Battle of Mons, Battle of Aaachen, and the Battle of Hurtgen Forest. 
   After leaving the Army in 1945, Jack attended Hastings Law School in San Francisco, California, graduating in 1948. He returned to practice law in Nevada. In 1950 he entered politics and was elected district attorney in Reno. As District Attorney he compiled an impressive prosecution record and founded the National District Attorney Association. 
   During the next 43 years of private legal practice, jack specialized in business law representing a variety of different enterprises. He was active in many civic groups serving as president of the Nevada State Jaycees, Sertoma Club, Reno Navy League, and Chairman of the Commissioning Committee for the U.S.S. Nevada trident submarine. 
   Jack is on the boards of directors of the Society of the First Infantry Division, the University of Nevada Foundation, Saint Mary's Hospital Foundation, and he is a Knight of Malta. He also serves as the president of the World Association of Lawyers. 
   Veterans in northern Nevada have long needed this new wing to their VA Medical Center and it is only fitting that it be named in honor of Nevada's most decorated veteran from World War II. 
   The new facility I am requesting be named in honor of Jack Streeter is located in the complex known as the Ioannis A. Lougaris Va Medical Center. Mr. Lougaris was the first living individual to have a VA Medical Center named in his honor. 
   Before World War II, John Lougaris remembered the veterans of World War I and the lack of medical aid, especially in Nevada. As a National Executive Committeeman from Nevada, he made many trips to Washington, DC, sixteen of them at his own expense, endeavoring to get a Veterans Hospital established in Reno. 
   The first success was a 26-bed unit, built in 1939 with a $100,000 federal grant. In 1944, John's efforts led to increasing the facility to 125 beds. He did not stop working and today the Reno VA Medical Center which bears his honorable name, serves Nevada's veterans well as a 107 bed facility which includes a 60 bed nursing home facility and 12 intensive care unit beds. The new bed replacement facility, which the bill I am offering today seeks to name after Jack Streeter, was built at the cost of $27 million and brings this hospital to a modern day standard. 
   In recognition of John Lougaris's devotion, deep interest, and untiring efforts in the development of a hospital to serve veterans in Nevada and Northern California, the Congress of the United States, by Public Law 97-66, rededicated the Reno VA Medical Center as the Ioannis A. Lougaris VA Medical Center on December 17, 1981. 
   It was certainly a well deserved gesture when Congress designated the VA Medical Center in honor of Ioannis A. Lougaris. It would now be equally fitting to name the new hospital wing in honor of Mr. Jack Streeter for his outstanding record of service to this Nation.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, I want to express my appreciation to the senior Senator from Illinois for arranging this opportunity for us to talk about education. 
   Mr. President, what I want to talk about today is an amendment that Senator BINGAMAN from New Mexico and I are going to offer on the Ed-Flex bill. Senator BINGAMAN and I offered this amendment, which passed the Senate last year. The problem has gotten no less complicated and no less important. Every day in America 3,000 children drop out of high school; that is 500,000 a year. This is something about which this country should be embarrassed. ``So what,'' some say. Well, each child who drops out of high school is less than they could be. 
   It also complicates societal matters by increasing the cost of welfare and the criminal justice system. It even complicates increasing costs in our educational system. 
   If you look at the people in prison, 82 percent of the people in prison are high school dropouts. I repeat, 82 percent of the people in our prisons are high school dropouts. That should say it all. 
   We need to be concerned about high school dropouts. We know statistically without any question that the children of dropouts have a much higher dropout rate than those who finish high school. 
   The median income of college graduates is more than three times that of high school dropouts. The probability of falling into poverty is three times higher for high school dropouts than those who had finished high school. Unemployment rates of high school dropouts are more than twice those of high school graduates. 
   The statistics are replete with evidence that we should do something about this. What should be done? There are a number of things that we can do. 
   But the legislation that has been offered by Senator BINGAMAN and I, which will be an amendment to the legislation that will be before this body next week, would establish a department within our Department of Education whose sole function, sole responsibility, would be to focus on high school dropouts. 
   There are programs around the country that some of the school districts have adopted mostly on a very small basis that work, and work quite well. We want someone to be gathering information to find out which of these programs work and which programs don't work. 
   We would provide $30 million a year for this program, and a total of $150 million. 
   Think of the money it costs us to keep people in prison. Is it $20,000 a year? Is it $30,000 a year. It is a huge amount of money to keep somebody in prison. Remember, Mr. President, that 82 percent of the people in prison are high school dropouts. 
   Our legislation would establish within middle and high schools around the country--those that have high dropout rates--an ability to compete for grants that would enable them to implement proven and widely replicated models of comprehensive reform. 
   The State of Nevada, I am not proud to say, leads the Nation in high school dropouts. I wish we didn't, but we do. We worked on a number of programs, one of which I am sure will be, if this legislation passes, one of the model programs. It is a program in Carson City, NV, our capital, where Hispanics are in a program called Ola, Carson City. It is a program where these young Hispanic students have a little TV station. They do TV programs. It has kept scores of these young people occupied and in high school. They are proud of the fact that they are going to be high school graduates. This is a program that has been going for 6 years. 
   Mr. President, I don't know of anything that we could do that would be more important in the education field than keeping our young people in school; in high school. There are 3,000 dropouts a day; 500,000 a year. 
   I hope that as we proceed through this debate, we will understand that the problems are not the same with every ethnic group. 
   For example, in the State of Nevada, 25 percent of the students--actually more than 25 percent of the students--in our Clark County school district, Metropolitan Las Vegas area, are Hispanic children. I am sorry to report that the Hispanic children have a dropout rate that is about 20 percent higher than any other ethnic group. Some ask why. There are a number of reasons. Most of the Hispanic students in Nevada come from Mexico. Mexico doesn't have a tradition of public education. There are at times language problems. And also one of the problems is Hispanics have such a great work ethic. They are willing to work as young kids, and they perform so well that their employers really do not in any 
   way inspire these young people to complete high school. As a result of that, they are doing the same thing when they are 55 years old that they are doing when they are 16 or 17 years old. 
   We need to recognize that within a few years. In fact, by the year 2030, in America, Hispanics will make up 20 percent or more of our population. The Hispanic leaders in this country know  that the most important thing for them is educating their youth. We have to participate so that we join with the Hispanic leaders in this country to keep Hispanic youth in high school. 
   I hope that we all realize that this legislation, the Ed-Flex bill, is something that gives us a vehicle to focus on education. 
   I heard the Senator from Illinois talk about the fact that we no longer are an agrarian society. Why should kids be out of school 3 months out of the year in the summertime? Should we have year-round school? That is a debate that should take place. 
   I remember when I went to the State legislature almost 30 years ago I talked about year-round schools. People laughed at me at the time. But now in Nevada we have year-round schools in a number of places, mainly because of the population growing so large they can't build the schools fast enough. And now we have year-round schools. 
   In short, Senator BINGAMAN and I are going to do everything we can to see that this legislation passes. 
   I, again, express my appreciation to the Senator from Illinois for allowing me to come and speak on this very important issue.

   Mr. REID. Yes. I also say, before yielding, as the Senator from Illinois has already pointed out, that it is tremendous to have someone who has been in the classroom teaching children.

   Mr. REID. I say to the Senator from Washington, without question, the answer is yes. There are programs that work. I would also say that the Federal Government has to identify national problems in all areas. Education is an area where we have to identify national problems. I believe that if there was ever a problem that this country has, it deals with high school dropouts. 
   I repeat. There are 3,000 children a day dropping out of school. Can you imagine how much better society would be if we could keep only 500 of those children in school so that we only--and I emphasis ``only''--had 2,500 children dropping out of high school a day. 
   I have heard every day the constant refrain that the Federal Government has no business dealing with local education. 
   The program that Senator BINGAMAN and I are sponsoring is a 
   program that gives local school districts absolute control. We are not telling them what to do. All we are saying is we are going to be a resource for you. Washington, DC, is going to be a resource. We have all of these programs that we have analyzed and evaluated. Here is how they work. If you have a problem in your school with a dropout, make an application and we will give you a grant and we will extend the money to the local school districts. They can implement the program, if they think it will help their kids.

   Mr. REID. I say to my friend from Illinois, I keep throwing these statistics out because to me they are overwhelming. They are mindboggling. I didn't take a lot of mathematics courses in high school or college. But I don't have to be a mathematician to understand that 82 percent of people who are in prison who are not high school graduates, that there is some reason people who do not graduate from high school are more likely to go to prison. We have to recognize if we can keep kids in high school, we are going to keep them out of prison. I don't know how much more we need to talk about prevention. That is one of the biggest prevention programs. We don't need to build youth centers, although that is a help. We don't have to come up with new inventions every day to keep kids in school to realize that if we keep them in school we keep them out of prison.

   Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999''. This legislation is designed to protect our sickest, most vulnerable seniors from the adverse effects of arbitrary limits on crucial rehabilitative services. 
   The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) created annual caps for two categories of therapy provided to beneficiaries under Medicare Part B: a $1500 annual cap on physical therapy and speech language combined; and a separate cap for occupational therapy. These arbitrary limits on rehabilitation therapy were hastily included in the BBA without the benefit of Congressional hearings or thorough review by the Health Care Financing Administration. As a result, the $1500 limits bear no relation to the medical condition of the patient, or the health outcomes of the rehabilitative services. 
   The $1500 caps would create serious access and quality problems for Medicare's oldest and sickest beneficiaries. Senior citizens who suffer from common conditions such as stroke, hip fracture, and coronary artery disease, will not be able to obtain the rehabilitative services they need to resume normal activities of daily living. A stroke patient typically requires more than $3,000 in physical therapy alone. Rehabilitation therapy for a patient suffering from Multiple Sclerosis or ALS costs even more. Without access to outpatient therapy, patients must remain in institutional settings longer, be transferred to a higher cost hospital facility, or in some cases, just go without necessary services. 
   Coverage for rehabilitative therapy should be based on medically necessary treatment, not arbitrary spending limits that ignore a patient's clinical needs. During the 105th Congress, I joined with Senator GRASSLEY to introduce legislation that would correct this problem. The ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999'' builds on our effort to ensure that all Medicare beneficiaries have access to the crucial therapy services they need. 
   Our bill establishes criteria by which Medicare beneficiaries would be eligible for an exemption from the $1500 cap. According to our bill, any beneficiary who would require hospitalization if he did not receive the necessary therapy services would be allowed to exceed the cap. Beneficiaries suffering from a diagnosis that requires therapy services and has an additional diagnosis that exacerbates this condition would also be eligible for therapy services above the $1500 limit. In addition, any beneficiary that is diagnosed with an illness, injury, or disability that requires additional physical, speech-language pathology, or occupational therapy services that are medically necessary will receive the therapy services he or she requires. Finally, our bill gives the Department of Health and Human Services Secretary the flexibility to establish additional criteria if necessary. 
   The $1500 therapy caps penalize our most frail and elderly citizens. Not only does allowing our seniors to have access to critical outpatient therapy services makes sense, it is the right thing to do. I urge you to join me in protecting Medicare's most vulnerable beneficiaries by supporting the ``Medicare Rehabilitation Benefit Improvement Act of 1999''.

   Mr. REID. Mr. Chief Justice, I extend to you my personal appreciation for the dignity that you have extended to each of us during these proceedings. I also say that I have been disappointed. It appears the vote is going to be very comparable to the vote in the House, down partisan lines, even though during the break I understand two of my colleagues from the other side of the aisle announced that they would not vote for conviction on the articles of impeachment. 
   But in spite of this, I want to extend my appreciation to the Republican leaders. Senator NICKLES has been available any time that there is a problem that has arisen during this proceeding. And you, Senator LOTT, have 10 more votes than we have and you on many occasions during this proceeding could have steamrolled us. You chose not to do that. I think that is the reason we have had this feeling of harmony, even though we have had some disagreement on what is going to transpire. So I, again, on behalf of all Democratic Senators, express our appreciation to you for the work you have done. 
   Often as I stand before this body, I am reminded of the lessons of great books. Today, though, the beginning of a novel keeps running through my mind--Charles Dickens' ``A Tale of Two Cities'':  
   It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.  
   I have often felt, these last weeks, as if I were trapped in a work of fiction. Like all really interesting fiction, the story now before us reduces itself to an examination of the human soul--or, to be more accurate, to an examination of human souls. I use the plural because this trial has been about the flaws of two people, each with the gifts to make them great, and of the contrast between them--one who has failed to rise above his flaws and the other who has embraced them. Much of what we call great literature is about the petty failings which destroy great men. It is about how common sins, of which we are all to some degree guilty, bring low the mighty and turn to ashes the fruits of victory in the mouths of monarchs. 
   We have heard much in this historic Senate Chamber about the judgment of history, but I daresay that, even more than by historians, the truest judgment of these events will be written as novels and plays. On the one level, these works will deal with some or all of the seven deadly sins: Pride, anger, greed, gluttony, sloth, envy, and, yes, especially lust. 
   But on another level, those plays and novels will deal with the theme of all literature. They will be written about conflicts between great men, great men who are flawed; great men, each with their own public and private failings. We are here to sit in judgment of the President of the United States, a very public man, for his very private failings. Bill Clinton fell from grace. Driven by the private sin of lust, he violated his marriage vows and when his sins were uncovered by his enemies, he tried to conceal them by lying to his wife, his friends, and ultimately to all of us. It is a common story, the sin of lying. It begins in the Old Testament with many examples--Cain, of course, is a good example, who asked, ``Am I my brother's keeper?''--and with the lie, the kiss of Jesus by Judas Iscariot in the New Testament. 
   It may be the beginning of a great work of art, it may be the first chapter in a summer day's light reading, but it is not a good reason, it is not the beginning of a good reason, for removing an elected President of the United States. 
   The core issue is one which has apparently eluded many in this Capitol, but which is obvious to the American people. Great dreams are dreamed by people with human flaws. Great policies and actions are sometimes set in motion by those with broken souls. Great deeds are not always done by good men. Recent history gives us  many examples. Winston Churchill, one of my heroes, a man who initially stood alone in leading the defense of Western civilization, was by most standards an alcoholic--at least modern standards. Franklin Roosevelt, Churchill's stalwart comrade and the author of policies which saved the very lives of families of many in this Chamber today, died in the arms of his lover. Each of us, each one of us in this Chamber, every human being, is flawed. Each of us needs all the forgiveness and forbearing we can be granted by the charity of others. 
   Bill Clinton has been a friend of the State of Nevada. He has been a friend to me. But he has committed grievous wrongs against his family and his friends. He has dishonored his high office and lowered the standard of public behavior. I have no doubt that he has strayed from the path of goodness. But I do have very real doubts as to whether he perjured himself or suborned perjury. But I have no doubt whatsoever that, under the circumstances of this case, the crimes alleged do not rise to the level of an impeachable offense. Because of what the President did in public and in violation of the public trust, if I have the opportunity I will vote to censure. I will not vote to impeach. 
   I said a few moments ago that great men are not always good men. But there is an obvious corollary: Good men are not always capable of doing great deeds and they are not even always capable of doing good. I began today by saying this trial was about the flaws of two people. Both are men with God-given gifts. Both are extraordinary in their intellect, perseverance, and dedication to certain core values. Both are capable of great goodness and even good greatness. Both have sinned. One is the President of the United States. His sins are of the flesh and of the spirit. About these I have already spoken. The other is the special prosecutor, Ken Starr, who has pursued the President beyond all bounds of reason and decency. His are the sins of unremitting, undiluted, unrepentant McCarthyism. They are the sins of pride, the sins of anger--they are damning sins indeed. 
   I don't use lightly McCarthy's name or accuse others of his tactics. I am old enough to remember how he misused and abused this sacred Chamber. My friend and my client, the late newspaper publisher, Hank Greenspun, was a victim of his lies, a victim who had the courage to stand up and fight back. Others fought, but many also suffered irreparable harm because of Senator McCarthy. 
   I know McCarthy's tactics were the back room stab, the whispered smear, the half-truth, the leaked calumny. I know that he subpoenaed witnesses and forced them to choose between betraying their friends or committing perjury. I know he destroyed the careers of innocent men and women, drove some to suicide and sent others to jail. But at least McCarthy had an excuse, of sorts. For all his lies, leaks and libels, there really was a Communist threat. There really were Communist spies. Some of the people he accused really did commit treason. They were guilty of treason. At least, Mr. Chief Justice, McCarthy and his cohorts had that excuse. Kenneth Starr doesn't have an excuse. 
   Before I came to the national legislature 17 years ago, I was a trial lawyer. At various times, I prosecuted and defended people charged with crimes. Long before that, I served as a police officer. I never argued a case in the U.S. Supreme Court, but I tried more than 100 jury trials, hundreds of other cases before various courts, and argued before different appellate courts. I tried criminal cases, lots of them, and I know something about when a case should be pursued and when it should be dismissed. I know something about the impact that a criminal charge has on any man or woman, about how they agonize over telling their children, how they struggle to face the community. I know something about prosecutorial misconduct, and I know something about prosecutorial discretion. 
   Every American is entitled to equal justice, no matter their rank in society; equal justice but not equally unfair justice. 
   The independent counsel's argument throughout his tenure seems to be that any U.S. attorney, any criminal prosecutor would treat any defendant in the same unredeemedly savage and unfair fashion in which Mr. Starr and his office have treated the witnesses, the defendants in peripheral cases and the President of the United States. Almost $60 million has been spent--Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate and now this. I think not. 
   No prosecutor of integrity, of principle, of fairness would have tried to bootstrap a sexual affair into something criminal. A truly independent prosecutor would not make deals time after time with organizations established to embarrass the President, cavort with attorneys for Paula Jones, do business with Linda Tripp and others to entrap the President. A fairminded prosecutor would not have leaked salacious details to the press in an effort to force the target to resign from office. And, most fervently, a principled prosecutor would have the common sense and the common decency not to misuse their office to go all out, no holds barred, to ``get'' that targeted individual out of pride, anger and envy. 
   I invite each of you to look at Justice Scalia's brilliant dissent in the Morrison versus Olson case where he talks about the constitutionality of the independent prosecutor. He predicted what we are now witnessing. Justice Scalia was visionary. Here is one of the things he said:  
   The context of this statute is acrid with the smell of threatened impeachment.  
   He was right. What else did he say? His opinion was 8 or 9 years ago. He said then: 
   ..... Congress appropriates approximately $50 million annually for general legal activities, salaries, and expenses of the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice. 
   Fifty million dollars the whole year covers everything for the whole civil division of the Department of Justice. We are spending more than that to go after one man. Scalia could see that coming. 
   He also said, and my friend, the Senator from Vermont, earlier today talked about what Justice Jackson had said, but he also quoted Scalia. Scalia said:  
   If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his case, it follows that he can choose his defendants. Therein is the most dangerous power of the prosecutor: that he will pick people that he thinks he should get, rather than cases that need to be prosecuted..... . it is not a question of discovering the commission of a crime and then looking for the man who has committed it, it is a question of picking the man and then searching the law books, or putting investigators to work, to pin some offense on him.  
   Justice Scalia could see this coming, and we got just what he said we would get. 
   This is a bad situation. When you have someone of the brilliance of Ken Starr and the viciousness of Ken Starr, you get what we have here today. 
   I want to use this occasion to say something to the American people, to the people of the State of Nevada, to leave them with the hope that those in high office have not been bereft of all reason, sense and sensibility. What the President did was wrong. It was immoral. I don't believe it constitutes a crime justifying his removal from office. What Mr. Starr did, and continues to do, is also wrong, and it is also immoral. 
   But their conduct is not the standard to which we must hold ourselves. We, all of us in Government, can do better. We must do better. The American people have the right to expect that or it doesn't matter how great we are, how great our ideas or how powerful our values. Set the standard high and judge by that standard. That is how the system is supposed to work, and in the long run it is how our constitutional form of government, with a legacy of more than 200 years, has worked and, with the help of a power greater than any of us, will continue to work.

    Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would correct a problem that plagues a special group of older Americans. I am speaking on behalf of those affected by the Social Security notch. 
   For my colleagues who may not be aware, the Social Security notch causes 11 million Americans born between the years 1917-1926 to receive less in Social Security benefits than Americans born outside the notch years due to changes made in the 1977 Social Security benefit formula. 
   I have felt compelled over the years to speak out about this issue and the injustice it imposes on millions of Americans. The notch issue has been debated and debated, studied and studied, yet to date, no solution to it has been found. Because of this, many older Americans born during this period must scrimp to afford the most basic of necessities. 
   Mr. President, I am the first to acknowledge that with any projected budget surplus we must save Social Security. In many ways, my legislation does just this. It restores confidence to the many notch victims around the country and will show them that we in Congress will accept responsibility for any error that was made. We should not ask them to accept less as a result of our mistake. While we must save Social Security for the future, we have an obligation to those, who through no fault of their own, receive less than those that were fortunate enough to be born just days before or after the notch period. 
   I believe we owe a debt to notch babies. Like any American family, we must first pay the bills before we invest in the future. We have the resources to make good on our debt to notch babies. We should come forward and honor our commitment.  
   Mr. President, the ``notch'' situation had its origins in 1972, when Congress decided to create automatic cost-of-living adjustments to help Social Security benefits keep pace with inflation. Previously, each adjustment had to await legislation, causing beneficiaries' monthly payments to lag behind inflation. When Congress took this action, it was acting under the best of intentions. 
   Unfortuately, this new benefit adjustment method was flawed. To function properly, it required that the economy behave in much the same fashion that it had in the 1950s and 1960s, with annual wage increases outpacing prices, and inflation remaining relatively low. As we all know, that did not happen. The rapid inflation and high unemployment of the 1970s generated increases in benefits. In an effort to end this problem, in 1977 Congress 
   revised the way that benefits were computed. In making its revisions, Congress decided that it was not proper to reduce benefits for persons already receiving them; it did, however, decide that benefits for all future retirees should be reduced. As a result, those born after January 1, 1917 would, by design, receive benefits that were, in many cases, far less. In an attempt to ease the transition to the new, lower benefit levels, Congress designed a special `transitional computation method' for use by beneficiaries born between 1917 and 1921. 
   Mr. President, we have an obligation to convey to our constituents that Social Security is a fair system. In town hall meetings back home in Nevada, I have a hard time trying to tell that to a notch victim. They feel slighted by their government and if I were in their situation, I would too. Through no fault of their own, they receive less, sometimes as much as $200 less, than their neighbors. 
   The legislation I am offering today is my proposal to right the wrong. I propose using any projected budget surplus to pay the lump sum benefit to notch babies. While we have a surplus, let's fix the notch problem once and for all and restore the confidence of the ten million notch babies across this land. 
   Government has an obligation to be fair. I don't think we have been in the case of notch babies. My support of notch babies is longstanding. I introduced the only notch amendment in April 1991 that ever passed in Congress as part of the fiscal year 1992 Budget Resolution. Unfortunately, it did not become the law of the land as it was dropped in Conference with the House of Representatives. I have cosponsored numerous pieces of legislation over the years to address this issue. With this legislation, my effort continues.
