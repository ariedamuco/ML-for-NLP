   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to be sure before I go into my remarks that neither of the leaders, the majority leader or the Democratic leader, is waiting for some floor time for some special things they want to go ahead with because I hope not to cover every day of the 18 years I have served here. 
   But I do want to make some remarks about this moment in time --a moment that I have kind of looked at with some amount of trepidation because this is the end for me, at the bottom of the ninth inning, and we have a couple of things to do before it is pretty much all over. 
   I am probably speaking now for the last time in the U.S. Senate. After 18 years as a Member of this institution, some time ago I made a reluctant decision to step down--not to try again after three terms. And, to be perfectly honest, there are those moments when I look at that decision not to run for a fourth term with considerable regret. This has been an incredible experience--an experience that so few ever get to have and such a worthwhile thing to do. 
   While my friends, the Democratic leader and the Democratic whip, are on the floor, I want to express to each one of them how deep my appreciation is for the cooperation and the ability to work together on issues of concern--not just for my State but for the country at large--and how helpful Senator DASCHLE, our leader, has been; and my good friend HARRY REID from Nevada, the only State that really competes with New Jersey in the hospitality of the gaming industry. I hope we will continue to do more business than Nevada. 
   In all seriousness, these are States that have a certain kinship that is not always easy to recognize because our coast is far larger than their coast, and sometimes we differ on issues but never on intent. 
   This is a job that has been the highlight of my life, next to my family--my children, my grandchildren, eight of them; the oldest is seven. I want to make sure they understood what their grandfather did when he was spending time in Washington. They are too young to really know what the job is about. But they know who the President of the United States is. Some of them knew because the oldest one is seven. There are eight of them, obviously, and one is just 2 months old. The little one could not understand what I have done. I was lucky and brought all of them down for Father's Day. I was able to take them to the White House and take some pictures with the President. They will look at these pictures one day and say, OK, that is where our grandfather spent his time when we didn't see much of him. I hope they will feel the same kind of pride and love for country as I do. 
   This job, one of some 1,850 people who ever served in the Senate, is such an honor to have. It is such an exciting place to be. I look at my desk now as a reminder of why I had this desk moved as my seniority improved from the far corner next to where it is now. I brought it with me wherever I went. It was a fairly easy task. I don't want the citizens to think I had people put to work for little reason; just a couple of screws lift out of the floor and we move it over here. 
   When I think of my parents and what this country meant to my grandparents when they brought my parents as little children to these shores, I open the desk. As everyone here knows but the public probably doesn't, there is something one could call ``graffiti'' in these desks--a signature, a carving, a writing in indelible ink that gives a name and the State that the individual represented. I never got discouraged about this job, but anytime I needed a little stimulation about how important the work we were doing was outside of the legislative routine, I looked in this desk and I seen ``Truman, Missouri.'' Harry Truman sat at this desk when he served in the Senate. It is such an honor for me to be able to fill the seat, not the shoes, as they say. 
   Every day I came to work here was a privilege, even when the day didn't turn out as one expected. The people of New Jersey sent me here to accomplish things that affected their lives and their families, and it is not easy to relinquish those duties. I hope they will believe that FRANK LAUTENBERG served them honestly and diligently. I will leave it to them to mark the report card to see how we did. 
   My service was a way for me to give something back. I had a successful business career, and I spent 30 years doing that, but there was something more that was needed as far as my life was concerned. I am so grateful my grandparents, in their wisdom in the earliest part of the last century, decided to pack up bag and baggage--they didn't have much baggage, I can tell you that; all they had was the spirit and desire to live free--and come to this country, my mother a year old from Russia, and my father 6 years old from Poland. They believed so much in America. They were so sensitive about things. For my grandparents, whose native tongues were reflective of the country they came from, anything but English was almost prohibited in the house. They wanted to talk English. They wanted to speak the language that their friends and their neighbors believed should be used as Americans. Now we understand people can live in multiple cultures and continue to treasure the language that they or their parents had before they came to America. In those days, any indication they could get that they were truly Americans meant so much. 
   So they came and worked hard, with no education. My father went to the sixth grade only; he had to help his parents. But they never dreamed their children would have the opportunities that were so robust and so fulfilling. 
   I spent 30 years in the computer business, running a company called ADP, Automatic Data Processing. The company started with two boyhood friends of mine. We started without any money of our own, without any outside financing. The company today has 33,000 people and is one of America's best performing companies in terms of its products and the stock market's response. 
   I got there because this government was there to render service to our people. The one thing that bothers me when we 
   get into political campaigns and speeches are made on the stump and people talk about the government and how small it ought to be and why it is too big and the loaded bureaucracies, I can't stand it. Honest to goodness, I work with the people who populate this place day in and day out--not the Senators exclusively but those who work here on both sides, Democrat and Republican. I see how diligent they are in trying to get their day's work done and how committed they are in the service of the people. I respect them. Of course, those whom I have gotten to know in my office, I love them as well. One develops a respect and almost a reverence for people who will come in and go to work at 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock in the morning and stay; if we stay until 2 o'clock in the morning, they stay until 2 o'clock in the morning. For many years, until very recently, there was never any compensation for overtime; that was considered part of the job. For those in the management of the office, and the leadership position among the staff, there is still nothing like overtime. They do it because they feel the responsibility. It has made an enormous difference in the way we conduct ourselves. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line view that I bring is one that has developed as a result of the opportunities that were afforded me. I know I probably have said it too many times, but I ask my colleagues to indulge me once again when I talk about my family. 
   My father died a very young man, at age 43. I had enlisted in the Army and  was given the benefit of the GI bill. The GI bill made the difference in my life, enabling me to use the knowledge and programs I studied and learned to start a business that became an industry. It is the computing industry, as contrasted to the computer industry, the hardware industry. To me it was a great example of the way government can empower individuals and families to improve their lives. 
   It is a lesson I will never forget. The education I got through the GI bill set the foundation for me to build that business. When I look at what happened with ADP and the number of people it has put together, 33,000 employees, processing paychecks for 33 million people across our country and others. 
   When I was finishing my 30th year in business, I thought there were other things I ought to try to do to help pay back what I thought was a unique opportunity. I wanted to make sure that it continued to exist for others, as well. I came to the Senate. I ran in 1982 and was elected then. I brought what was a fairly unique perspective because there weren't, at that time, as there are now, so many businesspeople who came from not having had an elective office experience but came in fresh from the business to the Senate. 
   When I got here, my goals were to try again to permit people to think independently, to make sure that the rights and the freedoms we enjoyed would be protected, to make sure there 
   would be an opportunity for those who could learn without having, necessarily, the financing to do it. That is what the GI bill taught me. It has been my hope that people would understand that these opportunities must continue to exist. That is why we have these discussions about investing in education, making sure children have the appropriate nutrition, and that people can count on getting their health protected when they have a problem, or at least making certain as they grow and mature that they know they don't have to worry about an illness wiping out not only their assets but also demolishing their health. 
   Just so everybody knows, I am going to take some time here. Therefore, it may take a little time for me to do the whole story. I see the majority leader either looking at me so anxious to hear the whole story that he wanted to ask me what it was.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Pennsylvania for not only his comments but for his help. He is someone we counted on to work so closely with us, to bring seriously a bipartisan aspect to the protection that we are looking for to make sure that Amtrak--the national goal for railroading all across this country--will be able to continue. 
   It is obvious to me, as we have listened to the comments, that unless these investments are made now, or very soon, we will be unable to fulfill the objectives of having Amtrak as a self-sufficient entity operating with its operating budget met by the revenues that it derives. The funds that we will be able to get from this proposed bond issue will enable it to make the capital investment it so desperately needs.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, one of the things I wanted to do, as I tried to plan my Senate objectives, was to make sure the children of our country were as protected as they could be by legislation that we developed in the Congress. 
   Under Republican leadership, when President Reagan was the President in 1984--Elizabeth Dole was the Secretary of Transportation--we were able to write a bill and create a law that made the 21-year-old drinking age the minimum drinking age for serving liquor across the country. Since that time, 17,000 families have been spared the need to mourn the loss of a child. 
   Mr. President, 17,000 youngsters, that is enough to fill a large arena. If one looked at the number of young people who would fill that arena, you would say: My Lord, are we lucky that these children have lived and will survive to their adulthood and through their full life because we were able to restrict their access to alcohol. 
   Therefore, it was appropriate, toward the later days of my career, that we were able to add another item of protection by lowering the blood-alcohol level to .08, a standard which will save an additional 500 to 700 lives a year. President Clinton recently signed that into law, as well. So I am pleased with the fact we were able to get that done. My team and I worked very hard to make that happen. It took several years for it to be accomplished, but accomplished it was. 
   A large part of that accomplishment, I must say, was because of our distinguished friend and leader--I think they would have a reference in totalitarian governments, but I mean it in the kindest way--as a leader for life, that Senator BYRD has brought to us, not only with his knowledge, his understanding of the process, but he is virtually the historian of the Senate. The thing that has always amazed me is he can do it virtually from memory, and bring us all to our senses about how we conduct ourselves and how we process legislation. I am not only so delighted and honored to have been able to serve with him as a mentor but as a friend as well. 
   We learn on a continuing basis in this place that Senator BYRD is someone to whom we can always turn, not only to understand his thinking on issues, and the decisions that he provides, but also his leadership. 
   We saw it manifest again this day because he wanted to help us out of the dilemma with which we were struggling, to find a way to get Amtrak the strength and resources that it needs, but reminding us at this moment there were so many things in front of us that it was not the time, but nevertheless was helpful in his reassurance that he, too, would help process this early in the next Congress. I just am sorry I will not be here to see the day when that takes place. 
   But I am grateful for the friendship and guidance that the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia has given me, and all of us, over these many years.

   I have said about Senator BYRD in the past that he is a model for what a computer might do, and he does it without all of the transistors and switches and chips, and all of that. If anyone doubts Senator BYRD's capacity, let them attend one of his lectures on the kings of England or the development of government in the Roman Empire. 
   One will be astounded. I have always felt a little bit like a student when I listened to Senator BYRD. I thank him for his warm comments.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his laudatory comments. It is nice to hear that one will be missed. We haven't discussed the degree, but nevertheless being missed counts. 
   I wish to say one thing in response to the thoughtful statement of the Senator from Arizona about Amtrak and a national railroad. I am glad that he did it because I misunderstood. Frankly, perhaps it is something I thought I heard the Senator from Arizona say in times past about the fact that he would resist advancing resources to Amtrak. I think it was described in terms of a ``cash guzzler,'' if I am correct in that recognition. But I am glad to hear the Senator from Arizona. 
   Let it not ever be mistaken that Senator JOHN MCCAIN and I have had some differences on the floor and off the floor, but the fact is that I believe there is mutual respect. Certainly, I respect him for his contributions to America and for his contributions to this body. 
   If anyone has any doubts about JOHN MCCAIN's capacity to deliver a message, one only need to look at the recent election to see that with very limited resources JOHN MCCAIN was able to influence the direction of policy that we are going to be witnessing in the next administration. 
   But I also hope that Senator JOHN MCCAIN, the Senator from Arizona, and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, will be able to accomplish something that has been lingering over this place. It is overdue. It has been talked about forever, and it has never been accomplished. The reason I made a decision to leave this body that I love dearly was because I didn't want to go out and raise that money. 
   The Senator from Arizona and the Senator from Wisconsin, Mr. FEINGOLD, have done a masterful job in working inch by inch to get to the place where we examine as a proposal for the near future, I hope, how we ought to finance Senate races. I think the moment is near at hand. I hope that examination, frankly, obviously without my participation, will be taken. I will be encouraging you from the sidelines.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to take some time to discuss the importance of investing in our Nation's high-speed rail infrastructure. 
   We have what could fairly be termed a looming transportation crisis in the United States. Business and personal travelers are overwhelmingly relying on air travel to get from city to city, and the system is plagued with delays and congestion which is not only undermining people's personal plans but also harming the business community. 
   Air travel has become so inconvenient and unreliable, the public needs alternatives. According to the Federal Aviation Administration, aviation delays increased 58 percent between 1995 and 1999. And to add to passengers' frustration, the average delay is getting longer each year--averaging 50 minutes in 1999. 
   Even worse, flight cancellations increased 68 percent over that same period--1995--1999. Overall, nearly one in four flights was either delayed or canceled in 1999. 
   The summer of 1999 was the most delayed summer in aviation history. That is until this summer, which blew past last year's delay record. 
   The number of delays, the number of cancellations, and the length of delays all have continued to go up so far in 2000. And consumer complaints more than doubled in 1999 and are up almost another 50 percent so far this year. 
   With aviation travel expected to increase more than 50 percent over the next decade, we have a crisis looming. 
   The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that boardings will increase to 917 million by 2008. Our current aviation system can't handle this demand. 
   Fortunately, we have a solution to this problem right before our eyes. A solution that we have ignored and neglected for too long--high-speed passenger rail. 
   Nineteen of the 20 most-delayed airports in the United States are located on potential high-speed corridors. And high-speed rail can provide a competitive travel alternative, particularly over distances less than 500 miles. 
   The situation on our roads is almost as dire as the problems in our skies. One study estimated that $72 billion dollars was lost in 1997 as a result of traffic congestion through lost productivity and wasted fuel. And this situation continues to deteriorate. People now spend 50 percent more time stuck in traffic than they did in 1990 and triple the time they did in 1982. 
   Critics have complained about Amtrak receiving $23 billion federal subsidies since 1971. But this is pocket change compared with the funding we have provided other modes over that same period. Since 1971, we have spent over $160 billion on aviation programs and over $380 billion on highways. 
   The High-Speed Rail Investment Act can is the vehicle for giving Americans more transportation options. This legislation would allow Amtrak to sell $10 billion in high-speed rail bonds over ten years. The Federal Government would leverage private sector investment in our rail infrastructure by providing tax credits to bondholders. 
   States would be full partners in this effort and would have to put up a 20 percent match which would go into an escrow account to be used to repay the bond principal. 
   These funds would enable high-speed rail projects to go forward in the Midwest, the Southeast, the Gulf Coast, and along the Pacific Coast. 
   And it would allow us to finish the Northeast Corridor high-speed rail project. 
   High-speed rail means better, faster, more competitive rail service. It means a comfortable travel alternative to those who want to avoid congested highways and cramped and delayed planes. 
   The High-Speed Rail Investment Act, S. 1900, is supported by a bipartisan group of 57 Senators representing all regions of the country. And companion House legislation, H.R. 3700, introduced by Congressmen AMO HOUGHTON and JAMES OBERSTAR, now has over 150 cosponsors. 
   Our Nation's governors, state legislators, and mayors understand our transportation problems and see high-speed rail as a vital part of the solution to our transporatation woes. Newspapers from across the Nation have come out in support of investing in high-speed rail. 
   Mr. President, the benefits of High Speed Rail Service are clear. High-speed rail is the future of transportation in America. We cannot maintain a productive and efficient transportation system without modernizing our  rail infrastructure and providing a competitive alternative means of transportation on our rails. 
   I am therefore pleased that I have the commitment of my colleagues to provide resources for high speed rail next year. While I won't be in the Senate, I know the Senator from Delaware and other colleagues will work relentlessly toward this goal.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Carol Browner, the longest-serving Administrator in the history of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and one of the people with whom I have been most honored to work. I can think of no finer role model for young women, or young men, considering a career in government today than Carol Browner. Since she came to the EPA seven years ago, she has set a gold standard for public service and for protection of the public's health. A dedicated advocate for the environment, she has never neglected her responsibility to protect and preserve the water, land and air that our childrens' children will inherit from us. 
   Carol Browner has been a tireless advocate for the environment and made significant contributions in every area that the EPA touches. As just one example, Administrator Browner set up a childrens' office at the EPA for the first time, signaling her commitment to strengthening the ties between the environment and children's health. Under Administrator Browner's control, the EPA began to take children into account when developing air and water safety standards, such as the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Food Quality Protection Act was the first law that made health of children, rather than adult males, the benchmark for evaluating safety. These two acts are monuments to Carol Browner's dedication to the environment and to children. 
   To better protect our nation's surface waters, Administrator Browner was a principal architect of the Clinton Administration's Clean Water Action Plan. One component of this program was to increase the public's knowledge about the potential health threats from swimming in contaminated waters at our nation's beaches. Under her leadership, EPA established a publicly-accessible Internet site containing information about water quality and beach closings across the nation. Administrator Browner and I worked closely together to strengthen the water quality standards for our nation's coastal recreation waters, and to assist states in setting up beach monitoring and notification programs. Our efforts were successful through the enactment of Public Law 106-284, also known as the ``Beach Bill.'' 
   Through the Clean Water Action Plan, Administrator Browner demonstrated her ability to take on the tough fights and to do what was right for the environment. Under her leadership, EPA adopted policies to reduce polluted runoff from factory farms and from aging urban wastewater systems, and helped obtain the funding to implement these controls. 
   As a proponent of corporate responsibility and the citizen's ``right to know,'' an area of particular interest to me, Administrator Browner, the law and EPA's implementation of it, effected a 50 percent drop in the rate of industrial emissions, without creating any new regulatory mandates. As another example, Administrator Browner fought to limit the industrial pollution generated by coal fire plants in Midwestern states that contributed to air pollution in New Jersey. Under Administrator Browner and President Clinton, the EPA has both vigorously enforced environmental laws and reached out to industry to find creative new incentives and environmental results. This is the kind of leadership that Democrats and Republicans can both rally around. 
   Perhaps most importantly to my home state, during Administrator Browner's nearly eight-year tenure, the Superfund Program has completed three times the number of waste site cleanups than in its previous twelve years. She helped keep Superfund strong, and held fast to the belief that justice and the environment are best served when polluters pay to clean up the messes they create, even while she strove to improve the program and accelerate clean-ups. I was honored to share the stage with Administrator Browner recently at Pepe Field in Boonton, New Jersey, which was Superfund's 750th clean-up. What was once a malodorous eyesore is now a thriving community park. Pepe Field is but one of many Superfund success stories under Administrator Browner's leadership. 
   With her oversight of the Brownfields program, Carol Browner has demonstrated the vital ties between a healthy environment and a healthy economy. Revitalizing these sites created more than 8,300 construction jobs. And once the work was done, another 22,000 jobs were either created or retained. Much of this economic revitalization happened in communities in need, where per capita incomes averaged just over $10,000 a year, versus a national average of almost $14,500. This program brings both environmental and economic justice to these neighborhoods. Communities once on the verge of despair are back on the road to revitalization, thanks to Carol Browner. 
   Carol Browner is one of the best friends this nation's environment has ever had. As I prepare to leave the Senate, I will remember her for many things, but most of all for her optimism, her commitment, and her integrity. I thank her for her work and salute her accomplishments.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the great work of a civil rights pioneer and chapter president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People of Willingboro, New Jersey, Reverend Willie James, on the occasion of his receiving the award for exemplary community service. 
   Reverend James began his work for civil rights in 1958 when he attempted to buy a house in Willingboro's Levitt community. He was told that houses would not be sold to African-Americans. Reverend James decided to sue. Two years later, the United States Supreme Court officially integrated Willingboro, enabling Reverend James to become one of the community's first African-American residents. 
   In 1974, work demands forced Reverend James to move to Rhode Island. While in Rhode Island, Reverend James joined a statewide commission that studied disparities in white and minority prison rates than whites. 
   Eventually Reverend James returned to New Jersey where his level of activism flourished. He became president of the Willingboro chapter of the NAACP. During his time as president, Reverend James made great progress researching the issue of disproportionate African-American male imprisonment. 
   In the recent election, Reverend James and the local chapter of the NAACP worked on motivating minorities to vote. Reverend James is a recipient of more than 30 local and national awards for his commitment to public service. 
   I am pleased to honor Reverend Willie James on this joyous occasion. His family, his friends, and his community are indebted to him for his unyielding service. This honor is richly-deserved. I salute him on yet another great achievement.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I would like to inquire of the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State and Related Agencies, Senator HOLLINGS, about a particular provision of the conference report. 
   The conference report to the Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 specified that $1 million is available for land acquisition in Raritan, New Jersey under the National Estuarine Research Reserve system.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. As I understand it, the intent of this language is to allow for the purchase of specific parcels of wetland habitat in the Raritan  Bay region of New Jersey. The Raritan Bay area in Monmouth County, New Jersey, is the area of focus of this provision, not Raritan Borough in Somerset County, New Jersey nor Raritan Township which is located in Hunterdon County. In addition, the intent of this provision is for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Estuarine Research System to work cooperatively with the State of New Jersey to coordinate the acquisition and management of these lands.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I say to Senator BOXER and Senator REID, thank you for your comments, but, more than that, for our ability to work together to try to take care of our citizens as we believe they would want, to look at the issues fairly and squarely, and not spend as much time dancing around the truth and around the issues, as often goes on here. I thank the Senator, and I will send my thanks to Senator REID. I will miss working with both of you and colleagues on both sides of the aisle.  
   I am particularly grateful to the occupant of the chair, the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, who, although we had some disagreements in terms of particular policies, always tried to work them out. I appreciate that balanced view, even though we didn't win as many as I wanted to.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, last month, and again last week, the Republican staff of the Senate Budget Committee released two reports criticizing what they wrongly described as the economic plan proposed by Vice President GORE and our distinguished colleague, Senator LIEBERMAN. I wanted to come to the floor to discuss these reports, which I believe were inappropriate, and a misuse of taxpayer dollars. They also were grossly inaccurate and unfair. 
   Let me read from a section of the Senate Ethics Manual.  
   Campaign Use of Official Resources 
   Official resources may only be used for official purposes. It is thus inappropriate to use any official resources to conduct campaign or political activities.  
   Mr. President, as we all know, and the Senate Ethics Manual makes clear, it is inappropriate to use any official resources to conduct campaign or political activities. Of course, it can be difficult to draw a clear line between official Senate business and campaign activities. And reasonable people can disagree about many of the documents that are produced routinely here in the Congress. But, having said that, the reports issued by the Budget Committee staff, in my view, go well over the line. These reports are focused entirely on AL GORE's campaign proposals, or at least the staff's erroneous interpretation of those proposals. And their obvious purpose is not to provide an objective analysis, but to attack the Vice President. These staff reports aren't just biased, they're pure propaganda. And I would note that the latest report was issued just hours before the last Presidential debate. Not surprisingly, they issued no comparable critique of Governor Bush's budget plan. 
   Now, Mr. President, I recognize that the Budget Committee is not like the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is supposed to operate in a nonpartisan manner. The Republican staff of the Budget Committee makes no pretense to being nonpartisan, and serves only on behalf of Republican Senators. So one would expect them to issue reports that further a partisan agenda. But, Mr. President, that does not justify the issuance of reports that are so obviously intended for campaign purposes, and that are so blatantly misleading and factually inaccurate. 
   Mr. President, I could take a long time reviewing the many flaws of the Republican staff reports, but let me–     
       NOTICE--OCTOBER 23, 2000

By order of the Joint Committee on Printing.     WILLIAM M. THOMAS, Chairman.  
   mention just a few. Perhaps most importantly, the reports dramatically and inappropriately exaggerate the costs of the Gore plan. First, they suggest that the Vice President's $360 billion Medicare ``lock box'' represents new spending that somehow would use Social Security funds and increase the budget deficit. This claim is preposterous. In fact, the Medicare lock box reserves funds for debt reduction, not new spending. It wouldn't spend a penny of Social Security surpluses, or any surpluses, for that matter. Yet by, in effect, counting as spending the $360 billion Medicare lock box, and an additional $99 billion of General Fund transfers to Medicare, the Republican staff has artifically created a $450 billion raid on Social Security that simply does not exist. And, Mr. President, that's just the beginning. 
   The GOP staff also charges the Vice President with the costs of budget proposals put forward by President Clinton, even though the Gore plan clearly does not endorse the entire Clinton budget. This results in doublecounting many similar proposals put forward by both Clinton and Gore, such as their different retirement savings plans. And, of course, it exaggerates the real cost of the Gore/Lieberman plan. Another way that the GOP staff inflates the costs of the Gore plan is to adopt its own scoring rules. The GOP staff went well beyond the scoring of the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget. It created its own special methods of evaluating the costs of the Vice President's proposals. And it shouldn't come as any surprise that they lead to much higher cost estimates. 
   Take, for example, the Vice President's Retirement Savings Plus proposal, which the Gore campaign says would cost $200 billion. The Republican staff cites a figure of $750 billion. This number is simply made up, and is not backed up by any official CBO or OMB estimate. Similarly, the GOP staff exaggerates the cost of Vice President Gore's preschool proposal. Their report characterizes the Gore plan as if it were an open-ended entitlement, with no state match. That leads to much higher costs. In fact, though, the Gore proposal is for block grants that require a state match. 
   Another trick that the GOP staff used to create a misleading impression about the Vice President's proposal was to deviate from standard practice and use a so-called ``freeze baseline.'' In other words, the GOP staff counted as a cost of his plan $1.2 trillion in discretionary spending, and related interests costs, that simply reflect the costs of maintaining current policy. These costs normally are considered part of the budget baseline, not new spending. The well-respected, nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made this point in a sharp critique of the GOP staff report. The Center concluded that the Budget Committee's analysis, and I quote, ``is marred by several serious flaws''--unquote--which the Center said inflate the cost estimate assigned to the Gore plan. 
   Mr. President, the Republican staff was so intent on slandering the Vice President as a big spender that they went to extremes in characterizing some of his proposals. The GOP staff calls anything new spending--even tax cuts. Look at what they include in their long list of new ``spending and regulatory programs'': 
   Marriage penalty relief. 
   A long-term care tax credit. 
   A disabled workers tax credit. 
   Mr. President, is marriage penalty relief ``new spending''? Even George Orwell wouldn't go that far. In fact, the GOP staff's blacklist goes beyond tax cuts. It even includes gun control. Closing the gun show loophole. Banning junk guns. Requiring mandatory gun safety locks. 
   Mr. President, would closing the gun show loophole amount to a return of Big Government? Would requiring gun manufacturers to include trigger locks amount to a whole new spending program? I don't think so. 
   Mr. President, I could go on and on about the Republican report, but I won't. And, frankly, the misstatements and distortions in their report are only part of the problem. This report should not have been produced in the first place. It's obviously intended to be used in the presidential campaign to harm the Vice President. And it's just not the type of report that should be produced with taxpayer dollars. Campaign materials should be produced by campaigns, Mr. President, not congressional staff. And, at a minimum, if reports on issues related to the campaign are issued, especially this close to an election, they ought to at least be fair and accurate. I don't think that's too much to ask, Mr. President. 
   Let me recite some facts on Gore and the size of Government. 
   Under the Clinton-Gore administration Government is smaller: Between 1981 and 1992, the size of the Federal civilian workforce increased. Since 1993, however, the Federal workforce has been reduced by 377,000--a 17 percent decline. 
   The Federal workforce is now the smallest since the Kennedy administration in 1960. 
   Under the Clinton-Gore administration Federal spending is lower: Spending as a share of GDP increased between 1981 and 1992--rising from 21.7% to 22.5%. Since 1992, however, federal government spending as a share of the economy has been cut from 22.2 percent to 18.7 percent in 1999--its lowest level since 1966. 
   Although Bush promises to reduce government, under him, Texas government spending increased at twice the rate of the federal government. While the Federal workforce has been reduced by 17 percent, under George Bush, Texas has added 6,200 bureaucrats--a 2-percent increase. 
   With that, I will yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to raise an issue that I believe is critical for the Congress to address before we adjourn this year. It is an issue on which environmentalists, the business community, and the labor community strongly agree. It is called the Brownfields Revitalization Act. I say it is called that. I have to explain exactly what we are talking about here. 
   It is an issue upon which Republicans and Democrats agree. The Brownfields Revitalization Act of 2000 is a bill I introduced with Senator CHAFEE. It now has 67 cosponsors. Two-thirds of the Senate say this is a good piece of legislation and we ought to pass it. That includes, obviously, a majority of both sides of the political aisle--a rare example of overwhelming bipartisan support. 
   Some accuse us of being a ``do-nothing Congress,'' that we are stuck in partisan disagreement. That can be said. But I can tell you, it cannot be said about this brownfields bill. We ought to pass it here and now as a way to show that we can still move bipartisan legislation in the Senate. 
   We have strong support. Dozens of environmental organizations, business, labor, and State and local governments support the bill, including the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Real Estate Round Table, and the National Association of Realtors. It is a mix of people and interests, including the Institute of Scrap Recycling Industries and the Natural Resources Council. The list is a very long one, including various communities throughout the country as well as the organizations I mentioned. 
   Many don't know what we are talking about when we say brownfields. We will explain it. These are contaminated sites. They are abandoned properties that blight our communities. But also, they lie there waiting to be developed because they offer great promise for the future. 
   According to the Conference of Mayors, there are over 450,000 brownfield sites in the United States. They are, of course, in every State of the Union. There are brownfields in rural and urban areas and large and small communities. Citizens everywhere would benefit from this bill. 
   There are economic and environmental benefits from cleaning up brownfields. That is why the business community and labor so strongly support the bipartisan brownfields bill. 
   The Conference of Mayors has estimated that redeveloping these sites would create almost 600,000 jobs, would increase tax revenues, by their estimate, from somewhere between $900 million to $2.4 billion. What a benefit that would be to communities. 
   In a city in my State, Elizabeth, NJ, a town I lived in when I was growing up, we turned an abandoned site, that lay fallow for years, into an enormous shopping mall, with more than a million square feet of retail space and 5,000 permanent jobs. Elizabeth is one of the oldest industrial cities in the State of New Jersey. It is actively trying to build for the future. They are looking at hotels and a convention center thanks to brownfield revitalization. The successes in Elizabeth established proof that brownfields create jobs, hope, and opportunity for communities. 
   In Trenton, NJ, we have a very famous company that builds steel for bridges and structures all across this country, formally called Roebling & Sons. We have a picture of what happened to this site as it sat for years. I know my State so well; I remember the dump site. It was almost a lagoon of toxins. It was broken down. Anyone could see in the picture the terrible deteriorating condition. 
   Then we have a brownfield restoration program and this is what happened: It became a full-service supermarket, the first market in the city in many years. This is our capital city, with an office building and senior housing. It is almost a miraculous rebirth. 
   There is a risk in letting these brownfield sites sit there. The risks are substantial. They pose threats to human health and the environment, they create blighted downtown areas often leading to crime and loss of jobs. It forces development of farmland and open spaces. It causes sprawl. The result is increased driving time for those who have cars living in these cities,  with traffic congestion and air pollution. 
   The bipartisan brownfields bill will make major strides in revitalizing sites across the country. They are small sites, typically for $200,000 and less. They can be turned into productive urban centers or rural centers where commerce can take place and jobs exist. 
   The bill provides critically needed funds to assess and clean up abandoned and underutilized brownfield sites. They can use them for parks and greenways. They encourage cleanup and redevelopment of the properties by providing another important element: legal protection for innocent parties such as contiguous property owners and prospective purchasers, innocent land owners. They need to know that their liabilities are limited. Otherwise they are not going to take the risk in putting money into the sites. 
   It helps, also, to encourage other cleanups of State and local sites creating a certainty for those who would invest there, and ensures protection for public health. When the sites are revitalized, the results are obvious: jobs, a stronger local tax base, curbing sprawl, preserving open space, and protecting the health of our citizens. 
   Some suggest there are other ways to solve this problem by revitalizing or reforming or reauthorizing our Superfund Program. That is a nice idea, but unfortunately, we have been working 8 years to get the parties together to get the Superfund Program reauthorized. The Superfund handles the enormous sites that dot our landscape, without success. 
   I, personally, since I have been so involved in the 
   environmental committee and in environmental issues, wanted to get to work on Superfund and get it done before I left the Senate, which is effectively in the next few days. I will have lost my opportunity to talk on this floor and get some of the things done that we still have ahead. The value of this legislation is real and it is current. 
   While the sites, by their very definition, are not the size of Superfund sites, the overwhelming majority of brownfields are not Federal cleanup problems but are being cleaned up by States and local governments. 
   This bill will give incentives and protection at those hundreds of thousands of State sites. We owe this relief to our communities. They can take the money and get an investor to develop the site. We should not hold this bill hostage. There are 67 Members, two-thirds of the Senate, bipartisan, who do not want to see this bill lying around here and not getting passed. Mr. President, 67 Senators have spoken. Business groups support this, as do environmentalists, and State and local governments. The legislation ought to pass. 
   It is a very simple task. The time for this bill to pass is now. I hope my colleagues will act to move this legislation as quickly as possible. They have cosponsored the bill. If we can just put it in the line of things, it need not take a long time to debate or discuss. I hope we can pass this legislation soon. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the President of the United States today nominated Ms. Lois Epstein to be a Board Member of the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board. 
   Ms. Epstein is a licensed professional engineer with over 16 years of technical and regulatory experience involving toxic and hazardous chemicals, with a significant focus on accident and pollution prevention. She currently is a Senior Engineer with Environmental Defense. In that capacity, she has served on three federal advisory committees, two for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and one for the Department of Transportation (DOT). She has also served as a consultant to the Science Advisory Board of EPA. Prior to coming to Environmental Defense, Ms. Epstein worked in the private sector and for the federal government in the EPA Region 9 office. 
   Ms. Epstein has demonstrated integrity, technical and analytical expertise, industrial plant knowledge, and a stong understanding of environmental laws and regulations. She has the ability to work with a diverse array of interests, and a commitment to resolving environmental and worker safety problems. These qualities, in combination with Ms. Epstein's expertise in engineering, petroleum refining, and her familiarity with the National Transportation Safety Board--the model for the Chemical Safety Board--make her a strong candidate. 
   Although she is being nominated without enough time remaining in the 106th Congress for confirmation, I hope that the next Administration and Congress will look favorably upon this qualified candidate.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take a few minutes to discuss something that has been in front of our eyes and in front of our minds these last couple of weeks; that is, the turmoil we are witnessing in the Middle East. Those horrible pictures of young people engaged in violence and paying a terrible price for the consequence of that violence. Not just the young people--women, children, young men. 
   I think it is fair to say that everyone who sees what is taking place wishes it weren't happening. The question is raised about our responsibility and what do we do about it. Is there an opportunity for us to lend peace a hand, to see whether or not we can encourage the reduction of violence, the elimination of the confrontation with stones and tanks and guns, to see if there isn't something more that we could do than to simply be a witness. 
   Mr. President, I commend President Clinton's efforts. He has been such a wonderful peacemaker in his term of office. 
   I have been to the places he has exerted some effort, i.e., Ireland. I was there many years ago and met with people in the north and met people from the Republic. I talked to Catholics and Protestants and tried to help make adjustments in our funding support so it would be more balanced, balanced towards those people who needed help while asking those who did not to at least participate in a nonviolent manner to get the killing and the mayhem stopped. 
   President Clinton took the initiative there. He sent Senator Mitchell, one of our very good friends from this place, a distinguished Senator; a distinguished judge before he came to the Senate. He worked tirelessly. He would get the two sides to at least stop shooting at one another and come to the negotiating table. It has had a shaky peace arrangement, but at least people are not dying. And if they are, it is an exceptional occasion and not the usual thing. 
   I was in Kosovo and Bosnia with other Members of the Senate and saw the unacceptable behavior of the leadership there, as they committed the genocidal acts against innocent people. We became engaged, and it was a tough fight to become a part of the peacemaking structure. We didn't always agree with our friends in Europe about whether or not it was in their interests or our interests. I think we have seen that too many times. 
   I was a veteran during the war a long time ago. I enlisted in the Army. Even in those early days in the last century when Hitler started to invade neighboring countries, killing people, separating groups from one another so they  could be attacked in an organized fashion, there were people, I understand, as I read the history, who questioned whether it was something in which the United States should become involved. Before we knew it, we had no choice. When our ships were attacked in Pearl Harbor, we were in it 110 percent, with some 15 million people in uniform. We fought hard. Hearts were broken. Families paid a price. Young people died--among others, but those who were involved in the military were young. 
   In the last half of the 20th century, democracy flourished in some of those places. We still have troops in Germany, in Japan, in South Korea--50 years later. 
   Sometimes, I must tell you, I do not understand it when questions are raised here about our role: Are we going to be the policeman of the world? Does it have our interest in it? 
   I remember the debate on Kosovo and Bosnia. There were many who said we have no business being there. I disagreed. I disagreed strongly, and I encouraged us to do what we did. President Clinton and Vice President GORE led the charge, if I may say, by making certain we protected our pilots and our military servicepeople wherever they were in the area as we took on the task of stopping a mad, genocidal attack on people in Kosovo and at times before that in Bosnia itself. It was a wonderful conclusion that we lost no one in combat, but we stopped the killing of innocent people. Kosovo is being rebuilt. Again, maybe it is a shaky peace but a peace. That is the critical issue. The question was raised, as I said, was that in our national interest? Are we going to be the policeman of the world? 
   Now we are faced with another situation. When terrorism rears its ugly head, and when those who want to violate the safety and well-being of ordinary citizens and take it into their hands to determine who is wrong and who is right commit atrocious acts, it does almost always come home to roost. 
   It is proven that at some point in time it is in our national interest. Our national interest is to protect our people. Maybe in the process we reach out to protect others so violence does not spread and we are not looking at wholesale attacks on innocent people. 
   The other day when the U.S.S. Cole was struck by madmen who detonated bombs that tore the U.S.S. Cole apart, left a hole in the hull of the U.S.S. Cole, in a ship that was designed to withstand torpedoes and other pieces of military weaponry, and killed 17 people, if one read the biography of so many of them who died, they were young: 19, 20 years old. I enlisted when I was 18. It is so very young. And 37 more, I think the number is, were wounded, many of them seriously wounded, and just brought home. Today I know there was a memorial service in Norfolk, VA, for those who died. The President was there. He made certain he got back from Egypt on time to be there. 
   I wonder how many people are saying, do we have an interest, a national interest in what is taking place there when terrorism is allowed to flourish, and included in that activity are American citizens, those who were there to maintain the peace? 
   The other day we passed a piece of legislation which I had the privilege of authoring that compensated victims of terrorist activity, families who lost people I knew, who lost a daughter in Israel in an attack on a bus outside the Gaza Strip. She was 20 years old, there on business, innocent, studying, trying to learn something about a heritage that she and her family were proud of --killed by a terrorist's bomb. 
   Iran was held in our courts to be the country of responsibility. We took further action based on legislation that had passed through this House that enabled people to bring suits against those countries, to attach their assets that may have been in America. A resolution was adopted and the President is going to be signing a bill into law very shortly permitting the distribution of funds to those families. They didn't want the money but they didn't want other families to have to suffer the same consequences they did. 
   Now we look at the President's attempt to bring peace to Israel and the Palestinians. We do not know whether that effort is going to work. But we do know that the President did the right thing to assert the presence of America and to say we want to see peace in this area. 
   We are friendly with both sides in the dispute there, perhaps friendlier, as I think we should be, in many ways to the democratic nation of Israel because it is a democracy and people have choices about things. But we do not want to see Palestinians killed. It pained us all to see the picture of that young boy who was shot in a crossfire. It pained us all to see a couple of soldiers, who were doing no harm, taken to a jail and held there as prisoners until a mob was able to get their hands on them and lynch them, mutilate them--lynched them not with a rope but lynched them in terms of taking their lives in a mob attack, parading their bodies through the streets, mutilating them even as they lay dead. 
   It is time for us to ask those who can stop this violence, who can at least slow it down, at least encourage peace, to step up and do so and not hold out a friendly American hand to those who will not. 
   I welcomed Mr. Arafat here in 1993. I was amazed to see Prime Minister Rabin; the President of the United States; and the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat; shaking hands because I had only known about Yasser Arafat in an earlier time when he wore a gun on his hip and went to the United Nations and held the gun up as a manifestation of his view of how disputes are resolved. 
   Now we see what is happening, even though there was a tacit agreement to try and stop the violence and the Israelis were cooperating. They permitted the reopening of the Gaza airport. I was there the week before that airport was opened. I was so positive about it bringing an opportunity to the Palestinian people in Gaza to have their economy lifted, to have their hopes and spirits lifted at the same time, that perhaps an improvement in their way of life and their economy might be possible because they live in desperate conditions. 
   We have seen the violence, the rioting, the abuse, the stone throwing. Stone throwing is not an acceptable way of resolving disputes. It does not matter what the weapon is; it is a weapon; and it is designed to intimidate and punish a people with whom there is a disagreement. The Israelis retaliated. They have a responsibility, in my view, to protect their people and protect their property, protect their integrity as a democratic nation. 
   I did not see any Israeli gloating about the fact that a Palestinian life was taken. We saw some action by some of the so-called settlers in territories in the West Bank who took action against their Palestinian neighbors, and the Prime Minister rebuked them and said: No Jewish Israelis, no Israelis should be taking mob rule into their own hands and harming people or killing them. 
   He came out against it. 
   Chairman Arafat in 1993, when he stood on the lawn at the White House, signed a statement that violence was no way to resolve differences, and he took an oath, practically speaking, that he would do whatever he could to abolish it. 
   What we have seen in the last few days is inconsistent with that position, and we ought to notice it. When the U.N. took up a resolution that blamed Israel for all the problems, I was disappointed that the United States did not veto that resolution. But I know in this administration, this President, the Vice President, and the Secretary of State, all have peace in mind. I thought perhaps that was the reason we did not veto this resolution but, rather, abstained. Therefore, I do not 
   second-guess the decision, but I hope if there are more such lopsided resolutions, the United States will veto it and not permit it to continue. 
   It is fair to say the Israelis are making a genuine effort to stop the violence. And on the Palestinian side, they want it stopped. We heard Prime Minister Barak talking about it. They do not want to kill Palestinians. They do not want to injure people on the other side of the issue, but it is fair to say, Mr. Arafat, I was one in the Senate who supported financial assistance for the Palestinians when they signed the agreement to establish a peaceful relationship. I was one of those who encouraged it. I was one of those who said the Palestinians needed some hope and some expectation that their lives would improve, that their standard of  living would be better, that their children could get an education, that they could have the proper health services they needed. 
   I was filled with hope. I wanted to make certain that we showed our good faith by doing something positive for the Palestinians. 
   I know Israel very well. I have visited there many times, and I know a lot of people there. Yitzhak Rabin was a personal friend of mine. When he was killed by one of his own people, it was a tragedy felt round the world. 
   The nation of Israel continued to try to make peace. Prime Minister Barak, the most heavily decorated soldier in the Israeli military, the most highly decorated soldier, is a prominent peacemaker. He wants to establish peace. He has seen war at its worst. That is why he has the medals that reflect heroism, bravery, and valor, but he did not like the killing. He did what he had to do to protect his country, and he is doing the same thing now, trying to protect his country and is trying to do it without violence, without responding violently to the attacks of his country. 
   He is pleading for there to be peace, some measure of tranquillity on both sides. 
   So as we mourn the loss of our young people, the sailors from the U.S.S. Cole, we wish those who are ill, who are wounded, who are injured, a full and speedy recovery. 
   We also wish we can be witnesses to a more peaceful discussion about where the relationship between Israel and the Palestinians will go. They can get along--they must get along--to try to resolve every difference. Whether it is with slingshots and stones or rifles or artillery pieces, it is not an appropriate way to resolve those problems. 
   But I do respect Israel's right to defend itself, and I do respect the wishes of many of the people in Palestine, the Palestinian community, to have their freedoms enumerated very clearly--their capacity to raise their families, to have an opportunity for the appropriate education and standard of living that all people want. 
   But I call on Mr. Arafat, Yasser Arafat, with whom I have shaken hands many times--and in the tradition of the Middle East, we kissed each other on the cheek in good will when I was there at Gaza at the opening of the airport, when I was there to see the economic development that was taking place; I had so much respect for the things he was trying to do for his people--I send out a plea to him to gather whatever strength he has to take the leadership of the Palestinian Authority and do what he is supposed to as the chairman; that is, call for reconciliation, call for the end of the violence. Get back to the negotiating table. Air your differences. Ask the United States to help. Do not invite imbalance in resolutions and things such as that. Do not search for those who have a bias in this case to present programs for peace. But do what you said you would do, Mr. Arafat, when you came here in 1993, when we sat around dinner tables together, when I visited you in Jericho, and we talked in such friendly fashion that I walked away believing we were seeing the accomplishment of miracles, small though they may be. 
   So I wish both sides the best wish I can, and that is for peace, to take care of your families, save your children by not taking other people's children, by not taking other people's lives. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will allow me a few minutes, I appreciate that. It is very nice of him to do so. 
   I listened carefully. I have respect for our friend from Oklahoma. He has been here, despite his youth, for a long time. He knows how this place works. 
   President Bill Clinton went immediately to the scene of the violence, to Egypt, to the region where so much is taking place, to plead and beg and to force a peaceful resolution, to stop the violence. That is what he said: Stop the violence. He wasn't drawing the terms. It is not fair to say that we have done nothing. 
   We went into Afghanistan with bombs. We attacked what we thought was the appropriate target. Yes, we missed when we went to the Sudan, but is that a criticism of our troops, of our pilots? Are they saying that mistakes don't happen in conflict or in a wartime exercise? I am not talking about practice. I am talking about the exercise of defense. Would we restrict the rights of our citizens to travel? Do we say that our warships can't circulate around the world? Do we say we have to stay home, come back here and just hide in our harbors so that we don't have any problems? Our people who enlist always know there is some risk. They have been asked to do tough duty. 
   I am not sure about how the votes went when we decided to go to Kosovo, in deference to my colleague and friend from Oklahoma. I think there was a vote not to go to Kosovo by lots of people. I am not sure how the Senator from Oklahoma voted, but I do know there was sharp resistance: It was not in our national interest to stop the killing; it wasn't in our national interest to be on the side of antigenocide, to stop the mutilation of communities and families and people and the abuse of women, the likes of which has rarely been seen in history. 
   It is not fair to say we have done nothing. We have tried. We have sent dozens of investigators to Yemen, and we have already made some progress. It is in the papers. I am not telling anything from the Intelligence Committee. But we have already found explosives in an apartment there. We are on the trail. 
   When Pan Am 103 went down, brought down by terrorists, we found, from the tiniest fiber of thread from a jacket, people who were the likely perpetrators. 
   This is not an idle administration. I would never say, because I am a Democrat and we have a Republican President, that 
   there were times that I voted against going to war. There were times that I voted going for it. Because whenever I have a vote such as that, I look to the eyes of my son, when he was 22, and I say: This isn't a war I would send you to and, therefore, I am not sending other parents' sons. I enlisted when I was 18. My father was on his deathbed. My mother was 36 years old. I felt it was my responsibility to serve my country. 
   I think one has to be careful when we start suggesting that nothing is happening. As to the Khobar Towers, the example the Senator cited, it is outrageous that we haven't found the perpetrators of those killings of our troops. But I want to point a finger at Saudi Arabia, the country that we sent our troops to protect in 1990. We sent them out there, 450,000 or maybe even over 500,000, to protect the Saudis, our good friends, who are holding us by the throat with their oil prices. That is where they are. What have they done to help us find the perpetrators of the murder of our troops? Not very much, I can tell you that. 
   I have watched this very closely. So I will point fingers where they belong. Those pointed fingers didn't belong against the Bush administration who served until 1992 and they don't belong at the Clinton administration. Those examples are invalid. 
   We have done what we have to do. We are fully committed, every one of us, to finding those who did that dastardly bombing against the U.S.S. Cole. I predict we will find them, and we are going to get help from people we never expected. When the trade towers went down in New York City, I was commissioner of the port authority. We had offices, before I came to the Senate, in  that building. Unfortunately, a couple of the perpetrators came from my side of the Hudson River. But we searched until we found the people, just as we did in Oklahoma. We searched until we found the people. We can't push buttons and instantly solve these crimes that are planned by crazies, masterminded by people who have lots of skills in the wrong areas. 
   We do our share; we really do. I think it is unfair to cast a net. Yes, I disagree with the decision on the vote of the U.N., but I trusted this administration, I trusted our Government to say, OK, the reason we don't want to do it is to create a further imbalance, to further enrage the Palestinian young people, to further the violence that is going on there. We have hopes for peace. Our mission is peace, not to make more war. 
   So while we disagree--in hindsight it is always easy to disagree--the fact is, President Clinton picked up bag and baggage, went there overnight to try to bring the parties together. He is not disengaged by a longshot. We are not taking the Palestinian side in any issue. We are friends of Israel, but we are also cognizant that the Palestinians are humans. We don't want harm brought to them, either. 
   I am sorry to get so passionate about this, but I have strong views and I just disagree with our colleague from Oklahoma.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, time is short. I will try to get to the point very quickly. 
   I support Senator BOXER's amendments to this VA-HUD appropriations bill. I want to point out one thing. Under the leadership of Senators BOND and MIKULSKI, the bill our subcommittee reported last month was far better than the one before us today. 
   What we see today with these riders that have come over from the House side of the Capitol is delayed corporate responsibility. That is what these amendments ought to be called: Just take care of the corporations and forget about our obligation to our people to protect us from contaminated, polluted environments. 
   One of these amendments is there because it is strongly supported by General Electric, an extremely powerful corporation. I like General Electric. I know a lot of the people who run that company. But they have, according to the League of Conservation Voters, polluted 200 miles of New York and Connecticut coastline with a million pounds of PCBs. Their slogan is: ``Bring Good Things To Life.'' We have heard it. I would rather have them say: ``Bring Good Life To Things,'' like fish and birds and people. That is where they ought to be. 
   I commend Senator BOXER for bringing up this amendment. I hope our colleagues are going to support it. 
   This is a good bill, other than this part. Again, I commend Senators BOND and MIKULSKI for a very tough job well done. But we ought not let the corporations escape getting on with their responsibilities. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to engage the Chairman of the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee in a brief colloquy on an important matter. 
   It is my understanding that the managers' amendment that we are adopting includes a rider which prohibits the EPA from making nonattainment designations under the new 8-hour ozone standard until June 15, 2001, or the final adjudication of the American Trucking Association vs. EPA case now before the Supreme Court, whichever comes first. Is that right?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. While I believe that inclusion of this rider is unfortunate as it will slow progress toward cleaner air, I understand that it should have little practical effect. EPA is unlikely to make those designations much in advance of June 15, 2001, in any case, even though all but about 6 states have submitted proposed areas for nonattainment designation. 
   I would just like to make one thing very clear for the record. This rider is a prohibition on the expenditures of funds. It does not negate the requirement included in TEA-21 that areas be designated under the new ozone standard. It also does not in any way prejudice the litigation pending before the Supreme Court. Would the distinguished Chairman confirm that these points are true?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to clarify a section in the statement of the managers accompanying the conference report. The language directs EPA to take no action to initiate or order the use of certain technologies such as dredging until certain steps have been taken with respect to the National Academy of Sciences report, with exceptions for voluntary agreements and urgent cases. It is my understanding that after June 30, 2001, or when EPA has properly considered the NAS report, whichever comes first, the conferees intend that EPA could proceed to finalize any such plans and act on those plans through steps to initiate or order dredging and other technologies, as appropriate.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is also my understanding that in directing EPA to properly consider the NAS report, the conferees are not intending to change the normal criteria by which EPA selects remedies, such as the factors laid out in CERCLA, the National Contingency Plan, and applicable guidance. Instead, the conferees are asking EPA to disseminate the report to officials within the Agency who make remedy selection decisions and to ask them to review it as part of the larger body of research on scientific and technical issues associated with hazardous waste cleanup. The NAS report is not being singled out for special deference greater than it would otherwise receive.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague, Senator LEAHY, for helping us get an addition to this legislation that we think is critically important. I also extend my thanks to Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas for his assistance in enabling us to get our particular section of this bill into place. 
   Mr. President, a light comes as a result of the fact that we have our female colleagues with us in this Senate. How hard they work to get things done on both sides of the aisle. What a difference it has made in the way we operate. Many of us were here before there was a reasonable presence of women--and it is not yet ``reasonable''; I will strike that word. But that will change in time. We are getting there. They have helped to bring to the consciousness of all America the kinds of abuses that are perpetrated against women and young children who are female--disgusting practices that shock us all; trafficking in young women, forcing them into virtual slavery and being sexually exploited, and losing their identity in the process. It is a humiliation few can imagine. I commend the authors of this bill. Also, I commend them for including the section on violence against women. 
   Mr. President, 3 years ago, when we were hard at work trying to reduce gun violence in our society, I offered a piece of legislation to prohibit those who had even as little as a misdemeanor charge proven against them from getting guns. It was a tough battle, and we were on the losing side a couple of times, with the old song about it which is ``the camel's nose under the tent, and you will be controlling guns,'' and so forth, instead of thinking about how many lives we would save. We know that about 150 times a year a woman has a gun pointed at her head--and I guess the reverse is also true occasionally--and is told, ``I will blow your head off'' in front of children. What kind of wounds does that leave even if the trigger isn't pulled? It is a terrible memory for all of those who are either victims or witnesses. 
   With the help of President Clinton, we were finally able to get a piece of legislation in a budget bill that had to be done--it is almost 4 years now, and it had to be done and it passed and was signed into law--to prevent spousal and children abusers from getting permits to own a gun. The result is that almost 35,000 gun permits have been denied to these people--35,000 potential opportunities for a man to put a gun against a woman's head and threaten to take her life. So I support this bill with these two sections. I have added a section--myself and Senator MACK of Florida--that talks about helping those who have been victims of terrorism, whether on our shores or away from America. American citizens are deserving of protection. I am pleased the Senate is going to pass this package of worthy legislation. 
   The underlying Trafficking Victims Protection Act addresses a very serious human rights issue in Europe and elsewhere, where people are trafficking particularly for sexual exploitation. Finally, we are taking action to combat trafficking and to help these victims. I am pleased that this conference report will also reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and expand coverage to include new programs for immigrant women, elderly 
   women, and women in the military service. 
   Throughout my career, I have worked to help prevent domestic violence. I strongly supported the original Violence Against Women Act, which Congress passed in 1994. I am so pleased that we are going to take care of those aberrations of behavior that leave women and families devastated. But we are getting onto another subject, as well, which I think is critical, and that is to provide justice for victims of terrorism as part of the trafficking victims protection conference report. 
   Mr. President, we all talk about our objections and abhorrence of terrorist attacks against American citizens, whether abroad or at home, and I had an experience that was almost in front of my eyes which shocked me and caused me to think about how we might prevent terrorism against our citizens at any time, at any place. 
   One of those victims was a young woman named Alisa Flatow. She was a junior at Brandeis University and she was studying in Israel for a time. In 1995, on April 9, she boarded a bus that took her from a place called Ashkelon to another destination. She never arrived. Shortly after noon, when the bus was in the Gaza Strip, a suicide bomber drove a van loaded with explosives into the bus. Seven passengers were killed. Alisa Flatow was among those injured. An Israeli Defense Forces helicopter rushed her to a hospital in a community nearby. It was the same day I arrived in Israel from a trip in the Middle East. When I arrived there, our U.S. Ambassador informed me of the terrible tragedy that had occurred and that one of them was a constituent from New Jersey and that she had been severely injured in that attack. I immediately reached her home in West Orange, NJ, an area very familiar to me because I lived near that neighborhood. 
   I spoke to her mother, Rosalyn, and was informed that Alisa's father, Steve, was already on his way to Israel. By the time he arrived, the emergency surgery had failed to save his daughter's life. She died on April 10. She was 20 years old. 
   For any of those who have children, they know that 20 years of age is almost the beginning of life. 
   I have three daughters and a son. Those were marvelous years as they approached the end of their college terms and prepared for life beyond. 
   But that didn't prevent a faction of the Palestinian Islamic Jihad from claiming responsibility and being proud of what they did with that suicide bombing. What good was it going to do their cause to have one mission of terrorists to frighten people and prevent them from conducting their lives as they would like to without any specific gain to be had? 
   There was a sponsor who paid something to somebody to have these young people assassinated. It was Iran. That is one of the reasons that country is still on the State Department's list of terrorist countries. 
   I want to tell you, Mr. President, that I am befuddled by some of the policy decisions we make.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank Senator LEAHY. 
   There is no stronger advocate for the protection and safety of our citizens than President Clinton. But I don't understand why we take a country such as Iran and start to deal with them in trade of insignificant items. Would you believe--I am almost embarrassed to  say it--that caviar, pistachio, Persian rugs are vital items for the well-being of our society? It is outrageous. 
   But there are differences in point of view. I am not a professional diplomat. Maybe I fail to understand the longer term value of something that looks trivial to me as I express myself. 
   For the past five years, I have been proud to stand with Steve Flatow in his effort to achieve some measure of justice for the killing of his daughter. He and I both want to hold Iran accountable. 
   But Alisa Flatow was not Iran's only victim. Matt Eisenfeld of Connecticut and Sarah Duker of New Jersey, a young American couple in Israel, also were killed in 1996 when a suicide bomb from an Iran-sponsored group ripped through a bus they had boarded. 
   One cannot comprehend what these missions are supposed to accomplish. 
   I don't want to bring the situation in Israel and the Middle East up to a full-scale debate at this moment. But there can be nothing gained by assaults against people or their property. 
   I made a speech yesterday in which I pleaded with Mr. Arafat to stop the hatred of his people; to stop the inflammation; to stop the propaganda that induces this kind of hatred and action; to stop ugly cartoons about people who inhabit Israel, the Jewish community; and to stop the anti-Semitic diatribes that still occur in Palestine. Stop it; stop it. 
   Well-known journalist Terry Anderson and others were held hostage in Lebanon in the late 1980s by captors funded by Iran. 
   They and their families also deserve justice, as do the families of those killed when the Cuban government in 1996 deliberately shot down two planes used by Brothers to the Rescue. 
   Mr. President, The Antiterrorism Act of 1996 gave American victims of state-sponsored terrorism the right to sue the responsible state. 
   The law carved out a deliberately narrow exception to the sovereign immunity protections our laws afford other countries.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont not only for his graciousness in extending to me additional time but for the help and guidance that he gave as we tried to put this piece of legislation into law. 
   Our goal then, and our goal now, is to allow American victims to receive some measure of justice in U.S. courts and to make state sponsors of terrorism pay for the death and devastation they have wrought. 
   Victims of terrorism have put the 1996 law to good use. The Flatow family won a U.S. court judgment against Iran in 1998. Other victims of terrorism won similar cases. 
   The Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act helps the victims collect compensatory damages they've won fair and square in our nation's courts. 
   Foreign countries that sponsor terrorism should have to pay for the awful toll that terrorist attacks take on families like the Flatows. And we hope that making terrorist states pay that price will deter them from sponsoring terrorism in the future. 
   Let me close, by thanking the many cosponsors and Senators who have helped advance this legislation. I particularly would like to thank Senator MACK, who has been with me every step of the way, and Gary Shiffman on his staff. 
   I also want to thank Frederic Baron of my staff who worked so hard on this bill. 
   I think this bill is a good example of bipartisan cooperation for a worthy cause--helping provide justice for American victims of terrorism abroad. 
   I am sure this legislation will pass overwhelmingly, but I want this message to go out across this globe: that if you sponsor terrorism against American citizens, you will pay a price. We ought to be unrelenting in that. I was proud of our country when we moved against Afghanistan to pay for the perpetrators of dastardly acts against American citizens and their interests. 
   We can never step aside and argue whether or not it is appropriate. We have to find out by testing the waters, by making sure that the legislation is there. If there is a challenge, so be it. But we have to indicate we will not stand by and let this happen without repercussions to those who sponsor terrorism. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as we adopt this valuable legislation, I consider it important to clarify the history and intent of subsection 1(f) of this bill, as amended, in the context of the bill as a whole. 
   This is a key issue for American victims of state-sponsored terrorism who have sued or who will in the future sue the responsible terrorism-list state, as they are entitled to do under the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1996. Victims who already hold U.S. court judgments, and a few whose related cases will soon be decided, will receive their compensatory damages as a direct result of this legislation. It is my hope and objective that this legislation will similarly help other pending and future Anti-Terrorism Act plaintiffs when U.S. courts issue judgments against the foreign state sponsors of specific terrorist acts. I am particularly determined that the families of the victims of Pan Am flight 103 should be able to collect damages promptly if they can demonstrate to the satisfaction of a U.S. court that Libya is indeed responsible for that heinous bombing. 
   More than 2 years ago, I joined with Senator CONNIE MACK to amend the fiscal year 1999 Treasury-Postal Appropriations bill to help victims of terrorism who successfully sued foreign states under the Anti-Terrorism Act. That amendment, which became section 117 of the Treasury and General Government Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1999, made the assets of foreign terrorist states blocked by the Treasury Department under our sanctions laws explicitly available for attachment by U.S. courts for the very limited purpose of satisfying Anti-Terrorism Act judgments. 
   Unfortunately, when that provision came before the House-Senate Conference Committee, I understand the administration insisted upon adding a national security interest waiver. The waiver, however, was unclear and confusing. The President exercised that waiver within minutes of signing the bill into law. 
   The scope of that waiver authority added in the Appropriations Conference Committee in 1998 remains in dispute. Presidential Determination 99-1 asserted broad authority to waive the entirety of the provision. But the District Court of the Southern District of Florida rejected the administration's view and held, instead, that the President's authority applied only to section 117's requirement that the Secretaries of State and Treasury assist a judgment creditor in identifying, locating, and executing against non-blocked property of a foreign terrorist state. 
   The bill now before us, in its amended form, would replace the disputed waiver in section 117 of the fiscal year 1999 Treasury Appropriations Act with a clearer but narrower waiver of 28 U.S.C. section 1610(f)(1). In replacing the waiver, we are accepting that the President should have the authority to waive the court's authority to attach blocked assets. But to understand how we intend this waiver to be used, it must be read within the context of other provisions of the legislation. 
   A waiver of the attachment provision would seem appropriate for final and pending Anti-Terrorism Act cases identified in subsection (a)(2) of this bill. In these cases, judicial attachment is not necessary because the executive branch will appropriately pay compensatory damages to the victims from blocked assets or use blocked assets to collect the funds from terrorist states. 
   This legislation also reaffirms the President's statutory authority to vest foreign assets located in the United States for the purposes of assisting and making payments to victims of terrorism. This provision restates the President's authority to assist victims with pending and future cases. Our intent is that the 
   President will review each case when the court issues a final judgment to determine whether to use the national security waiver, whether to help the plaintiffs collect from a foreign state's non-blocked assets in the U.S., whether to allow the courts to attach and execute against blocked assets, or whether to use existing authorities to vest and pay those assets as damages to the victims of terrorism. 
   Let me say that again: It is our intention that the President will consider each case on its own merits; this waiver should not be applied in a routine or blanket manner.  
   I hope future Presidents will use the waiver provision only as President Clinton will use other provisions of the current bill: to aid victims of terrorism and make its state sponsors pay for their crimes.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what a wonderful coincidence it is that I came to the floor to hear my good friend, Senator BYRD, make such exaggerated remarks about my accomplishments but never about our friendship. 
   Around here, our seats are based on seniority. You kind of move to the middle or to the front as your seniority improves. But it is not where you sit that counts; it is where you stand. 
   Senator BYRD has stood for the right things for this country for more years than any of the people in this room will remember because it has been such a long history. It is not newly emplaced. 
   There is a commercial around that is often seen on television and radio that says--I think it is for PaineWebber --when PaineWebber speaks, everybody listens. That is an adaptation because when Senator BYRD speaks, everybody listens. And everybody can read Senator BYRD's books on the history of the Senate to learn what it really takes to be a Senator. 
   It takes more than just getting a slice of the largess that we call funds; it takes more than the incredible loyalty, as profound as it is, such as Senator BYRD has to this State--it transcends those things--that, frankly, has made a difference in the world in which we live. Whenever there is a question, whenever Senator BYRD speaks--and my experience is principally on our side of the aisle because we have our weekly meetings and occasional get-togethers--people listen because he is the historian of the Senate. He is, in many ways, the conscience of the Senate. He is a spokesman for the Senate, not just because he is an eloquent speaker but because of his knowledge and character. 
   I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, my friend, ROBERT C. BYRD, for his comments. There is always a degree of eloquence and recall when he speaks. And if you have some spare time, if you ever want to hear about the history of battles that took place in Roman times or the list of Kings and Queens of the UK from a time earlier than William the Conqueror to the present date, how they died and what they stood for or what counts in terms of the Constitution of this country, Senator BYRD has that knowledge. Senator BYRD walks around with the Constitution in his pocket just as people walk around with phone numbers, and it is used and remembered. 
   It was a happy day for me when I was able to get on the Appropriations Committee and join Senator BYRD on so many issues for which we have fought. He reminds us that there is kind of a cultural aspect in the United States that so many of us want to give something back. I learned to give back by watching my parents as they struggled to raise a family in very tough times, with very modest wages and opportunities. I understood it in the Army when my father was on his deathbed, my mother was 36 years old, and my sister was 12. That was our family. My father was 42. I did it because it was my duty. At that time, I saw what happened to a family that was without health insurance, without any Social Security, without any kind of a benefit that would really help a widow with a small family. 
   Not only did my father die and leave the grief that followed, but his sickness, which lingered for a year, took any and all resources the family had. As a matter of fact, debts piled up as my father disintegrated. So I saw what happens to people who don't have a way of taking care of these needs. I saw what happens when a family is bereft of the opportunity to recover from that kind of a challenge. 
   I was lucky in some ways because as we lost a great man in our household, I was the beneficiary of an opportunity to help my family later on. The GI bill allowed me to go to a university that otherwise would have been out of my reach, no matter how far we stretched. We didn't have student loans and the kind of scholarships that exist now. I was a soldier and I had the GI bill. It armed me with an avenue to the future not simply because, as I have said here before, of the subjects I studied but because of the horizons that were opened to me about what could be, not that to which I was accustomed. 
   My experiences taught me about giving back. It is an honor and a privilege to be able to give back, whether it is to help create an industry--Senator BYRD referred to our business success. Two colleagues and I started a business, as they say, without a dime. Today, that company employs not 16,000, as it did when I came to the Senate in 1983, but 33,000 people. It is a business that was begun by three kids, literally, who came from the wrong side of town--the right side of the street but the wrong side of town. On our side of the street there were hard-working people. Most of them were immigrants, I would say. They knew they had to work with their hands to make a living. They weren't the scientists, the doctors, and the professionals we see today coming out of colleges. They didn't even have a chance, for the most part, to get to high school. So we created an industry, not just a company. What good fortune there was in our lives. The fact is that we are all healthy and we have terrific grandchildren. I have eight of them and the oldest is only 6, and they are more satisfied to see and talk to Senator BYRD than anything else in life. 
   The next great honor to me, after fatherhood, was to come to the Senate and to be able to be in this body--even with all of its defects--which reflects the structure of man and the structure of community. But if you look beyond the defects, you can see how many great people have come through this place and how many great people have yet to be recognized who are now Members of this great institution. 
   Mr. President, I leave with considerable misgivings. I am not happy about the decision I have made to leave. I do know this: Just as we came at different times in our lives, others will follow us who will also make contributions, who also will do the right thing for the people of our country. This country is in good hands. Every moment may not be a great moment, but this country's fundamentals are in place to make sure society will continue to grow and progress and harmonize in the years ahead. When we look at the defects, we see problems here and there and everywhere. But look beyond that. Look at the number of great people we have in our country who are fair-minded people. Look at what is happening now in the Presidential race, where one fellow is an Orthodox Jew who has been accepted and embraced across the country because the country is so fair. They  are looking at this person as an individual and judging him on his ability to serve. That is what tells us about the character of our people. When you look at places in Government, you see people who, though listed as minorities, are great achievers, whether in administrative posts or law or science. That is what we are looking at as we look ahead into this 21st century. 
   I thank all of my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats. I believe that I am considered at times an argumentative fellow by some of my colleagues on the other side. That doesn't mean there is no affection. 
   One of the things that Senator BYRD portrays is character--a very special kind of character. 
   It is amazing to me how much respect and admiration one can have for people with whom one can have enormous differences and yet have incredible affection for them because they are respected for their beliefs, even though those beliefs may differ at times with the ones you hold. Whether it is the most ardent progressive or liberal or the most ardent conservative, they are done honestly. They are expressed honestly with respect for people. 
   That should be our mission--not to try to overturn or lecture people at various stages, but when someone comes here, having been selected by his or her State to serve, that is their entrance to the debate; their entrance to legislate; their entrance to decisionmaking and how this country is going to function. 
   I don't want to leave here with a tear in my eye. I may feel that way, perhaps, but I am so proud that I was able to serve my country and to be a part of the Senate. 
   Senator BYRD could give you the statistics immediately. I round it off. I think it is about 1,820 people--1,853. I knew Senator BYRD would be precise--1,853 have had the privilege of serving here since the founding of this country. 
   Think about it. Millions of people have lived and passed through society, and, in all those 200 years, 1,853 have been granted the honor and the privilege of serving here. 
   When it comes time to pack up the bags and leave, I will not do it necessarily willingly, but I will do it gratefully, knowing that I have had a chance to be here to witness history in the making, which occurs almost daily, and to know that someday one of my grandchildren--the oldest is six; he has some way to go before he goes to college--will be able to look in the database from his home, from his school, and say: There was my grandfather. He was the one who stopped smoking on airplanes. He was the one who raised the drinking age to 21--saving thousands of families from having to mourn the loss of a child. But he was the one who did other things to help this country that will last way beyond his service in the Senate. 
   I say to Senator BYRD that when he gives testimonial, it has meaning and credibility. It is special, and I truly appreciate it. 
   Mr. President, I ask whether the Senate is going to remain open for a while or do we have an order that would have us be closing down soon?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am thoroughly upset about what is happening in the Middle East--watching people cower in fear, and some dying moments later as violence escalates. It is a terrible sight to see on television. It is a terrible sight to see in pictures and in the newspapers. It is terrible news to hear reports that after so much effort and so much concern for peace there is this carnage. 
   I think everyone probably knows that I have had a longtime interest in Israel. I have been there many times. But I also have an active interest in a peace resolution. I got to know some of our friends in the Palestinian community. I got to know Mr. Arafat and the people who assisted him--and the Palestinian Authority. 
   Whether a child is Jewish or Moslem or whether he or she is an Israeli citizen or whether he or she is someone out of the refugee camps in Palestine and the surrounding areas, or from the nation of Lebanon, I don't like to see any child taken from a family. 
   I want to make a point. I visited Gaza. I was at the airport just weeks before it opened--maybe days. It was very close in time. I was very enthusiastic about giving help to the Palestinians to get their economy going and providing some hope and vision for them so their lives could be improved and their freedoms expanded. 
   I think it is fair to say that Israel is taking enormous risks in that promotion, particularly the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr. Barak, who went further, I believe, than anybody else in Israel. We all know that Prime Minister Rabin was assassinated because of his beliefs by someone in the Israeli community of the same faith--Jewish. He died for his interest in peace. 
   But I don't understand how there can be joy expressed in the destruction of Joseph's tomb or to see books and artifacts destroyed and burned, and people taking joy and gloating over the killing of an Israeli. They are people who are beyond control. We condemn their acts of violence against the Arabs in the area and within the state of Israel. 
   I condemn that violence. It is not acceptable wherever it occurs. 
   However, I say to the Palestinian Authority, they have no right to use weapons that were given to provide police and law enforcement against the country that gave it to them in the first place. They have no right to promote violence, no right to have television programs coming over Palestinian television that talk about it being necessary to kill people in Israel, to destroy the country. 
   That kind of action, that kind of encouragement, is antithetical to the possibilities of peace or the possibilities of life. Anti-Semitic articles, cartoons, and newspapers, whether it be in Syria or even with our friends in Egypt or Lebanon, are unacceptable. Those are the kinds of things that ultimately promote violent action from one people to another. 
   I want our friends--Mr. Arafat, the people in the Palestinian Authority--to understand they will get nowhere by promoting assaults on Israel, whether they be on person or territory. It is not going to do them any good in the final analysis. A state of conflict, of war, is going to be painful to people on both sides. There will be no victors. 
   Help came from the United States to try to elevate the standard of living in the Palestinian community because people such as I promoted it. I was active on the issue. I wanted to show good faith and provide funds for the Palestinians to get their airport open. I visited the economic settlements they were erecting, development settlements to give jobs to people, to give hope to people. I supported it enthusiastically. 
   I think what is going on is unacceptable by any standard. The United Nations resolution issued last week was so lopsided that it looked as if they were trying to eliminate Israel from the family of nations. I don't understand it--encouraging the criticism of Israel and denigrating Israeli efforts to make peace, at some considerable risk again, as we have seen. Those young men captured and taken someplace in Lebanon or wherever, captured by a group that considers violence the way to resolve things--Hezbollah is proud of the fact they kidnap people. That is not the way peace is going to evolve or relationships develop. 
   I hope sense will come to the area very soon because what we see there is not, in my view, a limited conflict but, rather, a possibility that we will be seeing a conflict that will be very hard to put out. I hope we will soon hear better news from that area. I urge Mr. Arafat to curb violence where he sees it among his people. It cannot be fostered. It cannot be encouraged and at the same time gain the advantages that I am sure he would like to see for his people; that is, a peaceful existence and an improved quality of life. 
   I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Conference Agreement on the Transportation Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2001. I have served on the Appropriations Committee for all but 2 years of my 18-year career in the Senate. 
   For 14 of those years, I have served either as chairman or ranking member of the Transportation Subcommittee. I can say without reservation--and I compliment the chairman of the subcommittee, Senator SHELBY, and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, for the work they did--that this is the best transportation bill in those 14 years. 
   The bill makes historic investments in our transportation infrastructure and, simultaneously, takes dramatic steps forward in our efforts to improve safety. 
   Under this Conference Agreement, funding for highways will total almost $33.4 billion, a 16 percent increase over the Fiscal Year 2000 level. Funding for our nation's mass transit systems will grow by 8.4 percent. 
   Investment in our nation's airports will grow by an astronomical 69 percent, and funding for the FAA's facilities and equipment account, which makes critical investments in the modernization of our nation's air traffic control infrastructure will grow by 22 percent. The bill also includes substantial growth in the critical accounts that ensure safety in all modes of transportation. 
   Funding for the Coast Guard's operating budget will grow by 15 percent and funding for the FAA's operating budget will grow by almost 10 percent. The new Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration will receive a funding boost of almost 70 percent--an investment that is long overdue in addressing the problem of truck safety. 
   Most importantly, Mr. President, this Conference Agreement includes a provision establishing a new national intoxication standard at .08 blood alcohol content. This provision has passed the Senate twice before. First, during Senate consideration of the last highway bill and, most recently, as part of this Transportation Appropriations bill. 
   Indeed, this bill passed the Senate by a vote of 99-0, the first time in my memory that we had not even one dissenting vote on the Transportation bill. 
   The .08 provision contained in this conference report represents a historic step forward in the federal government's effort to combat drunk driving. 
   Not since we passed the Minimum Drinking Age Act, a law I championed back in 1984, have we made such significant progress in saving lives on our highways. 
   The .08 provision in this conference agreement largely follows the outline of the Minimum Drinking Age Act. 
   It imposes sanctions on states' highway construction funds at an increasing level until they adopt the national .08 standard. States that have their funds sanctioned will have the opportunity to have that highway funding restored so long as they adopt the national standard within the first six years after enactment of this bill. 
   But states should not wait for the sanctions to even begin--I urge states to act as soon as possible and save lives now. 
   The reason for a national .08 standard is simple--the medical and scientific communities confirm that you are too drunk to drive at .08 blood alcohol content. 
   Critical driving skills, such as steering and braking decrease by as much as 60 percent at .08 BAC. 
   NHTSA estimates that this provision will save more than 500 lives per year. And the Senate should be very proud of its efforts today to spare 500 families from that horrifying phone call in the dark of night telling them that one of their loved ones has died at the hands of a drunk driver. 
   There are a great many people to thank for our success in this bipartisan effort. Most importantly, I would like to thank the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator SHELBY, who has stuck by me on this provision since the very beginning. As I've mentioned, this was truly a bipartisan effort. And it was not easy. We faced stiff opposition from powerful interests. 
   My Chairman showed great courage and stood up for the safety of America's families. 
   I also want to thank Chairman WOLF, the Chairman of the House Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. Through his six years as Chairman of the Transportation Subcommittee, Representative WOLF has been a true champion for safety. 
   He is the leading congressional expert in the area of truck safety and he spent months convincing his colleagues of the merits of a national intoxication standard. 
   I also want to thank President Clinton and Vice President GORE who both personally lobbied the Conferees on this issue, along with members of their staff, including John Podesta and Jack Lew of OMB. 
   I would also like to thank Millie Webb, a victim of a .08 driver and the President of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. 
   She lost a daughter and a nephew--both about 4 years of age--to a drunk driver. She then gave birth to a child prematurely who became blind early in her life. This has been Millie's interest for some years because the driver who committed this horrible crime had a blood alcohol content of .08. She is here today to witness this law becoming effective because she didn't want any other families to suffer the pain and grief she went through. 
   I also want to thank Brandy Anderson, MADD's Congressional representative and the rest of the MADD leadership. In addition, I want to thank Jackie Gillan and Stephanie Mennen of Advocates for Highway Safety.  
   The help of these public interest groups was critical to getting this law passed. They deserve a great deal of credit. 
   In recent months, my office has resembled a ``war room'' on the .08 issue, doing everything we can in concert with MADD and Chairman WOLF to see to it that the .08 provision could become law this year. 
   I want to thank the members of Mr. WOLF's staff, especially John Blazey and Stephanie Gupta, as well as members of my own staff, Peter Rogoff, Sander Lurie, Dan Katz, Denise Matthews, Gabrielle Batkin, and Laurie Saroff who have worked tirelessly on behalf of this provision. 
   I also want to thank one individual who is no longer on my staff. During consideration of TEA-21, Elizabeth O'Donohue was a tireless advocate for the .08 provision. We were able to get the .08 provision adopted in the Senate on the TEA-21 bill, but we ran into an ambush in the House of Representatives, thanks to the negative work of the liquor lobby. 
   While Liz is no longer with my staff, I want to recognize the extraordinary groundwork that she laid in past years. There is no question that her efforts contributed greatly to our success here today. 
   In addition, I want to thank Tom Howarth, a former member of my staff who helped us get the 21 year old minimum drinking age passed, and has worked for years to make the .08 standard the law of the land. 
   I also want to thank Senator SHELBY's excellent staff, including Wally Burnett, Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, Tom Young and Kathy Casey. 
   Finally, as I make my parting comments as a leader on the Transportation Subcommittee, I want to make one last request of my colleagues. When the Senate considers a new highway bill in 2002 or later, I will no longer be a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee or the Senate and I certainly am not going to be in a position to work as hard as I did in the past on this issue. There is no question, when the Senate considers a new highway bill, there could be an attempt to repeal the national .08 standard. I am sure my colleagues are sensible people and I implore them not to bend to the pressure of those that would bring more bloodshed to our highways. I urge my colleagues not to flinch from their commitment to safety. Please do not condemn 500 American families a year to the tragedy of losing a loved one to drunk driving. 
   I urge my colleagues to maintain a national drunk driving policy based on safety, sanity and science. You must not bend to those who would seek to undo the progress we have made. 
   I yield the floor for this my last transportation bill as a Member of the Senate. I have enjoyed my service on this subcommittee. I think it has been important to the country, but particularly to my State, to see the improvements we have been able to make on highway safety and mass transit. 
   Finally, I think we are on our way to getting high-speed rail service and inner-city rail service in place. That is the only way to relieve the congestion in the skies and on the highways. There is no more room in the skies for additional airlines, no matter what we put on the ground. 
   I hope we will give high-speed rail the resources it needs to say to those people who are unable to make their business appointments or their contacts because of delayed flights, here is one way to make a difference in the way we travel in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to inquire of the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, Senator GORTON, about one aspect of the conference report. 
   Mr. Chairman, the conference report to the Interior Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2001 does not include funding for construction projects in the Great Falls Historic District, located in the City of Paterson, New Jersey.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chairman, by way of background, the Great Falls Historic District was established in Section 510 of Public Law 104-33, the Omnibus Parks bill of 1996. This legislation, which I coauthored, is designed to preserve the historic character of the City of Paterson, New Jersey. Like Lowell, Massachusetts, Paterson holds a prominent place in our nation's industrial past. Few people realize that Paterson was the first planned industrialized city. Alexander Hamilton himself chose the area around the Great Falls for his laboratory, and he established the Society for Useful Manufacturers right in Paterson. The work of its citizens and the wealth of its natural resources soon caused Paterson to thrive, and it became a mecca for countless numbers of immigrants, including my own family. The skills and spirit of these immigrants made Paterson one of our nation's leading centers for textile manufacturing, earning the nickname ``Silk City.'' 
   Mr. Chairman, the 1996 legislation authorizes the Secretary of the Interior to provide grants through the Historic Preservation Fund for up to one-half of the costs of preparing a plan for the development of historic, architectural, natural, cultural, and interpretive resources within the Great Falls District. The Secretary may also provide matching funds for implementation of projects identified in the plan. The total federal authorization for the Great Falls Historic District is $3.3 million. 
   Mr. Chairman, since the authorizing legislation establishing the Great Falls Historic District specifically enables the City to receive up to $250,000 in matching federal funds for preparation of a historic preservation plan, the Secretary could provide these funds through the funds provided in the conference report for the Historic Preservation Fund.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chairman, I understand that the Great Falls Historic District would be eligible to receive up to $250,000 of these funds for preparation of a historic preservation plan, and that, once these plans are completed, an additional $50,000 in matching funds is available from the Historic Preservation Fund for technical assistance and $3 million is available for restoration, preservation, and interpretive activities. 
   Mr. Chairman, I would like to include a letter from the Mayor of the City of Paterson to the regional director of the National Park Service, expressing the City's interest in moving forward with development of the Great Falls development plan. I hope that this letter will confirm to the Service and to the Chairman and Ranking Member, that the City is fully prepared to provide the necessary match to develop the plan. I am confident that the City will work closely with the Service on development of a plan, and that, once it is completed, the City may apply for the remaining authorized funds for completion of specific projects.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Abel and Mary Nicholson House National Historic Site Study Act of 2000. This bill would require the Secretary of the Interior to study the suitability and feasibility of designating the Abel and Mary Nicholson House located in Elsinboro Township, Salem County, New Jersey, as a unit of the National Park System. As part of the study the Secretary would also be required to consider management alternatives to create an administrative association with the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route. The bill I am introducing today would authorize the National Park Service to acquire this land in compliance with the service's standard rules and regulations. 
   Mr. President, the Abel and Mary Nicholson House is prized for its architectural and historical significance to, not only my state, but, our entire nation. It is a unique resource which can provide unparalleled opportunities for studying our national cultural and natural heritage. Situated along Alloway Creek, a tributary of the Delaware River, the house is surrounded by an intact cultural landscape of farm fields, wetlands and forests. The original access to the house was from the creek, as rivers were the highways of 18th century America. 
   The Abel and Mary Nicholson House is a Delaware Valley, brick, patterned-end mansion constructed in 1722. The original portion of the house has existed for 280 years with only routine maintenance, no major remodeling or restoration, and without the intrusion of either electricity or a central heating system. It stands alone as the only known, pristine survivor of an Anglo-American building tradition that existed for three quarters of a century. 
   The Nicholson House is changing the thinking of architectural historians about the construction and use of rooms in the earliest houses of the Delaware Valley. The house has been called an architectural Rosetta stone that provides new insight to our understanding of the use and function of interior space during the 18th century. Additionally, Mr. President, an 1859 addition to the house enhances the significance of the property with a similar level of architectural integrity. 
   Mr. President, the Abel and Mary Nicholson House also has cultural significance in its well-documented associations with the earliest Quaker settlement in North America and the first permanent English settlement in New  Jersey. Abel Nicholson arrived in New Jersey at the age of three. He was brought to New Jersey by his father, Samuel Nicholson, a follower of John Fenwick. They arrived in 1675, seven years before William Penn arrived to settle Philadelphia. John Fenwick was the founder of Greenwich and Salem, New Jersey, the first permanent English-speaking settlements on the Delaware River. 
   Samuel Nicholson purchased 2,000 acres in Elsinboro Township, New Jersey and a 16-acre lot in the City of Salem where he constructed a home. It was in the Salem house that the first Salem Meeting of the Society of Friends was organized in 1676. In 1680, Samuel Nicholson donated the Salem house to the Salem Meeting and relocated to the Elsinboro property. In 1693, Abel Nicholson married Mary Tyler, the daughter of another Quaker. Abel and Mary Nicholson built the present house, in 1722, which historians believe either replaced or abutted the earlier structure built by his father. 
   Mr. President, the Nicholson House represents the Mid-Atlantic region's colonial history and traditions. Because of its architectural integrity and what it is teaching scholars about how 18th century building spaces were used, it is considered to transcend regional significance and ranks as one of America's iconic early structures.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution honoring Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry, two individuals to whom approximately 3,200 individuals owe their lives and the world owes a tremendous debt of gratitude. 
   The tragedy of the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of more than 13 million people, will forever stand as a painful reminder of the frailty and value of human life. During this dark hour of history, two remarkable individuals among many other heroes, Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry, overcame difficult and dangerous circumstances and risked their lives to save their fellow human beings. 
   The deeds of Oskar Schindler, a German factory owner immortalized by such authors as Thomas Keneally and film maker Steven Spielberg, have inspired millions of people around the world. During the Nazi occupation of Poland, Mr. Schindler put his life on the line and demonstrated that one person truly can make a world of difference. Mr. Schindler acquired an enamelware factory in Zablocie, on the outskirts of Krakow. The factory, which produced mess kits and field kitchenware for the Nazi army, was staffed by Jews drawn from the Krakow ghetto. When the Jews of Krakow were transferred to the Plaszow concentration camp, Schindler arranged for his workers to be housed at the factory. After the factory was disbanded and the workers sent to the camp, Schindler used his connections and personal fortune to secure their release and transfer. 
   Through his cunning and perseverance in the face of adversity, Oskar Schindler succeeded in saving the lives of over 1,200 Jews. One of the individuals whom Schindler saved was Abraham Zuckerman, a constituent of mine and a great American in his own right. Mr. Zuckerman knows perhaps better than anyone else what a heroic individual Oskar Schindler was. As a builder, Mr. Zuckerman, along with other Schindler survivors, have honored Oskar Schindler with over 20 Schindler Courts, Terraces and Plazas throughout New Jersey. 
   Oskar Schindler was named a ``Righteous Gentile'' by Yad Vashem, the Israeli Holocaust Remembrance Authority, on April 28, 1962. Today, over 6,000 descendants of the Jews saved by Schindler live in the United States and Europe. I think it is high time that the United States government officially recognize Oskar Schindler's incredible contribution to humanity. Awarding him the Congressional Gold Medal is a fitting way to pay tribute to a man who touched the lives of so many people from all over the world. 
   Another remarkable individual who overcame adversity and acted with extraordinary courage is Varian Fry, an American editor from New York. During World War II, Mr. Fry volunteered to travel to Nazi-occupied Marseilles, France, where he helped form the Emergency Rescue Committee. Working with a small group of associates, Mr. Fry offered assistance to Jews and antifascist refugees threatened with extradition to Nazi Germany under the ``Surrender on Demand'' clause of the Franco-German Armistice. 
   Varian Fry was instrumental in the rescue of approximately 2,000 individuals, including artists Marc Chaggal, Andre Breton and Max Ernst. Mr. Fry was the first American to be awarded the ``Certificate of Honor'' and the ``Righteous among Nations'' medal by Yad Vashem in 1996. The United States Holocaust Memorial Council honored Mr. Fry with its highest honor, the Eisenhower Liberation Medal in 1991. He has also been awarded France's top civilian honor, the ``Croix de Chevalier de la Legion d'Honneur.'' Yet sadly, Varian Fry's heroism and bravery have yet to be officially recognized by the American government. 
   Mr. President, the Talmud states that, ``Whoever saves a single life saves the world entire.'' As we are left to wonder and mourn what the world has lost in the lives of those who perished during the Holocaust, we rejoice in the company and contributions of their survivors. We are enriched not only by the presence of the survivors, but by the example that Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry set for all of Humanity. Their actions are a testament to the ability of all people to act righteously and courageously even under the worst of circumstances. 
   The heroic deeds of Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry are sterling examples of heroism and humanitarianism. It is time the United States government recognize and pay tribute to these men and the noble deeds they performed. Oskar Schindler and Varian Fry are highly deserving of the Congressional Gold Medal. I sincerely hope that the 106th Congress will take up and pass this resolution.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Endangered Species Recovery Act. The bill will update the original Endangered Species Act, provide tax and other incentives for landowners, and help increase the number of species that are recovered and taken off the protected list. The bill has been endorsed by the 380 conservation, religious, and scientific organizations that belong to the Endangered Species Coalition. 
   Public support for strong endangered species protection is high. Also, a majority of the nation's biologists are convinced that a mass extinction of plants and animals is underway. Some believe this loss of biological diversity will pose a major threat to humans in the coming century. At least one in 8 known plant species (which provide medical, commercial, and agricultural benefits) is threatened with extinction. 
   The bill I introduce today includes provisions that will help both landowners and the species themselves. 
   The bill incorporates tax proposals endorsed by both property-rights and conservation organizations. The bill establishes a tax exclusion for cost-sharing payments under the Partners for Fish and Wildlife Program, an enhanced deduction for the donation of a conservation easement, an exclusion from the estate tax for property subject to an Endangered Species Conservation Agreement, and an expansion of the estate tax exclusion for property subject to a conservation easement. 
   The bill significantly revises the Administration's current ``No Surprises'' policy, which allows private landowners to alter or destroy endangered species habitat under a long-term unmodifiable permit. The bill requires the best available science, invites more public participation, and requires adaptive management for development permit. The developer files a performance bond to cover the costs of all reasonably foreseeable circumstances (such as wildfires, plant diseases, and other natural events that can have devastating impacts on weakened populations of wildlife). Then a Habitat Conservation Plan Trust Fund is established to cover all other unforeseeable costs--a safety net for landowners and species--while allowing changes to the permit when needed to protect species. 
   The bill also encourages ecosystem planning on a regional basis, through multi-species, multi-landowner plans, which is essential since ecosystems do not run along political boundaries. The bill encourages cooperation between various levels of government and different jurisdictions, by allowing groups of private landowners to pool resources, and allowing local governments to administer habitat plans. The bill streamlines the permit process and establishes an Office of Technical Assistance. The bill also allows small landowners that have a minimal impact on endangered species to benefit from a quick and easy permit process and to receive planning assurances. 
   The bill clarifies the standards for approving federal actions that may impact endangered or threatened species. Under the existing law, pesticide application, river damming, forest clearcutting, and other habitat destruction are judged by their impact on the survival of imperiled wildlife. The bill requires that taxpayer-funded activities must not reduce the likelihood of recovery. In addition, the bill improves the chances for recovery by identifying specific management actions and biological criteria in recovery plans, placing deadlines on final recovery plans, and encouraging federal agencies to take preventative measures before a species becomes endangered. 
   The bill implements recommendations from the National Academy of Sciences on improving the scientific basis of important endangered species decisions. For unprotected species that means providing protection before population numbers are too low to recover. For listed species that means using independent scientists to peer review large-scale, multi-species habitat conservation plans. It also means asking biologists to set benchmarks and science-based conservation goals to better tell us what it will take to recover and eventually delist an imperiled species. 
   While federal actions already undergo review to ensure minimal impacts on endangered species, the bill requires that federal agencies also make efforts towards further recovery or to consider the cumulative impacts of their actions. The bill requires federal agencies to help plan for species recovery and  then implement those plans within their jurisdictions. The bill also requires agencies to consider the impacts of their actions on imperiled species in other nations. 
   The bill expands public participation by requiring public notification when a federal activity may impact wildlife in a community. The bill also requires public participation in large-scale regional habitat planning. Local citizens may participate in the first steps of regional habitat planning, review relevant science, and work with developers to achieve the best possible plans. If those plans are not met, the bill allows citizens to require the government to take action. 
   The Endangered Species Recovery Act will protect the species and landowners alike. I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am getting very close to the end of my Senate career. One of the issues I consider vital in terms of my knowledge and experience in the Senate for these last 18 years is that I have learned, among several other serious problems, of a problem that looms large and is often ignored. That is, how do we establish our transportation system to satisfy the growing needs for travel in this country? 
   I see a crisis looming in our country because of congestion and because of our inability to move in a timely and reasonably comfortable fashion. We constantly read about delays at airports. As a matter of fact, these days I can almost never travel by air without resigning myself to the fact that I am not going to get there on time. There is a very good chance that I am going to miss my connection. There is a very good chance that a flight may be canceled. There is a very good chance that it is going to be a stressful, tough trip. 
   I was fortunate enough to be a grandparent for the eighth time. My son lives in Colorado. I am, as everyone knows, I hope, from New Jersey. My son and his wife just had their first child, my number eight grandchild. The oldest is six years old. They are little kids. They are an awful lot of fun. I would like to see more of them if I could do it and still make sure I perform the duties necessary to represent the people of New Jersey and the people of this country. 
   The trip I made consisted of two legs: one to Denver, CO, and the next one a short trip outside of Denver. It was on a Saturday. It wasn't on a busy weekday. It left an hour late from Newark. We were told that we should plan on a refueling stop in Wichita, KS. I have nothing against Kansas. I just didn't want to stop there if I didn't have to, because I was in such a hurry to get out and see my newest granddaughter. Her name is Hannah Lautenberg. I wanted to see her in the worst way. We stopped in Wichita long enough, about 40 minutes, to add more fuel. 
   Why did we leave the Newark airport to start on a trip knowing full well that we weren't going to have enough fuel to make the trip? They said, based on the passenger load, the baggage load, and the severe headwinds that we were going to run into, we had to provide for circling over Denver Airport in case that was necessary. We managed to take on the fuel. We didn't have to circle over Denver. The weather was reasonable. But it was enough for me to miss my next flight. 
   I called ahead and tried to reserve the second flight 2 hours later and was told that it was canceled and that the one 2 hours after that was full. Normally I would have exploded. But nobody would have cared. The worst thing is that you kind of resign yourself to saying, ``Oh, well, that is what I expected.'' Instead of getting a 30-minute airplane ride, I took a 2 1/2 hour van ride bouncing along the pavement and trying to figure out what to do to keep myself amused during that period of time. It was hard to read. 
   I got to see that beautiful grandchild. Boy, was I happy, too. She was as glorious as my daughter-in-law and my son described her. I thought she looked a lot like me. They said no. But it was a pleasant experience.  
   I stayed overnight and planned to take a 1:30 flight out because I had only come in 5 o'clock the night before to Denver, CO from New Jersey. But I was told that the short flight was canceled and that I have to go back in the van. I have nothing against the van, the company, or the driver. It was just a lot of time to spend together with a stranger. That is what I did. 
   I got back having missed two legs of the flight for which I paid in advance. I am not blaming that particular airline. 
   It is terrible what we have adjusted to. We have adjusted to 
   poor performance. We have adjusted to discomfort. We have adjusted to not having services that we paid for. That is the kind of society we created. 
   I have all kind of friends. I come out of the corporate world, as the distinguished occupant of the Chair knows, and am accustomed to business travel. In the days before I came to the Senate, you would have a reservation and arrive kind of at the last minute, get on the plane, arrive on time, do your business, and get on your way. It is not so anymore at all. 
   Again, it is not simply because the airlines are neglectful or that the airlines aren't trying. They simply can't carry the load. 
   We have to face up to it. If you have bad weather in Denver, CO, you can bet your boots that you will be held up by aviation travel throughout the country. If you have bad weather, as we do even in Washington, DC, where sometimes they say the weather is always sunny--it is hard to believe that--you get stuck, and you feel it all over the country. 
   We had a meeting at the Newark airport. I sat down with people from the FAA, the Secretary of Transportation, people from the controllers operation, people who manage the airports, and people from the Air Transport Committee who operate the airlines. 
   I asked one question: Is the sky a finite place or can we say it is infinite and just put every airplane that you can get in the sky up there without feeling the impact? I don't think they were surprised. I was. The answer was no. It is crowded up there. 
   I went to a place in central southern New Jersey just about two-thirds of the way down where a couple of weeks ago we had an airplane crash. Two airplanes with a total of 11 people collided in the sky on a bright, sunny day. All 11 people died. It was a miracle that more people on the ground were not killed. I don't want to get too grizzly. But part of the airplane fell through a house roof with people in it. It was a stark reminder about how this system is overloaded. 
   I fly a lot in the second seat in the airplane, listen to the radio, and do some of the observing that one has to do in an airplane cockpit. 
   I hear over the collision warning system ``traffic,'' ``traffic,'' ``traffic.'' That means that there are airplanes close enough to you that you had better be careful. 
   I point these out because we have our heads in the sand. We are not facing up to the problem. There is no more room in the sky. 
   I can tell you this: There are no communities that I have seen begging for more airplanes to come into their airports. I have not seen anybody that says, let's not build more highways. I don't care if the cars pass underneath my window making noise all night. I don't care if my kids read that excessive carbon monoxide and other emissions come out of automobiles and diesel trucks. I don't know of anybody saying that. They are saying, help us get around more effectively. There is one way to do that, Mr. President; that is, get this country into the 21st century transportation mode. 
   Not too long ago, I was on a trip to NATO and went from Brussels, Belgium, to Paris, France, a distance of 200 miles in about an hour and 25 minutes. We are 250 miles from New York. Sometimes I make it in a cool 4 hours by air, because I have to get on the plane. One time they told me: Get on the plane, Senator. I want you to know that we are moving away from the gate but we are going to wait 3 hours because of the line-up of traffic before we can take off. But we have to pull away from the gate. So please make the adjustment. 
   In 1987 I had the good fortune to understand the problem and wrote the law that banned smoking in airplanes. It happened right here. It was a tough fight, but we got it through. I thought, my goodness, suppose we had to sit in an airplane 3 hours before we took off today with the people who are accustomed to smoking in airplanes saying to the pilot while banging on the door: Let us smoke. 
   It would have been awful, and people across the country would have been in rebellion if they had to do that. So there is a solution: Get on with an investment in high-speed rail. 
   I have heard debate on this floor that distresses me, from intelligent people, from people who say: No, we don't want to spend any more on Amtrak, we have spent enough. This is a cash guzzler. 
   The fact of the matter is, we haven't done the job that we planned or that we thought we should have. We have spent $23 billion, approximately, since Amtrak--as we know it now--was developed in the early 1970s. It sounds like a lot of money, but it isn't a lot of money, not when we consider what we put into aviation, what we put into airports over the same period of time. I repeat, $23 billion since 1971. 
   Since that period of time, we have spent $160 billion on aviation programs, $380 billion on highways. Yes, we do collect a highway tax, and I am not saying we haven't done a pretty good job in building highways and airports. I am glad to see things being updated and upgraded. The fact of the matter is, when it is compared to $23 billion in Federal subsidies for high-speed rail, it is a drop in the bucket. Germany is going to spend $70 billion in a decade upgrading its high-speed rail system. We ought to learn from that. 
   To say just because a State doesn't have active rail service they don't want it to happen is crazy. Everybody doesn't have the same kind of aviation airline service we have in Chicago or New York or Los Angeles or Dallas, TX. But we help the system perform. We pay funds into FAA and build control towers and build a flight service network. Why? Because it is good for the country. And so is high-speed rail, even if it doesn't touch your neighborhood. 
   As a matter of fact, we have a bunch of locations that are going to be beneficiaries of high-speed rail. They are included in 14 of the most congested urban areas that are designated high-speed corridors, including Chicago, Los Angeles, Seattle, Atlanta, GA, Houston, TX, Washington, DC, and Portland, OR, just to name a few of the places that are going to benefit by investments in high-speed rail. However, we have a problem convincing people from those States that it is good for them, that we ought to be spending more money on getting this system up to snuff. 
   I proposed a piece of legislation that calls for $10 billion worth of capital investment by Amtrak over the next 10 years to try to bring the system up to grade for the 21st century. That is on top of other subsidies for which we appropriate funds. It gives them the ability to sell $10 billion worth of bonds. The Federal Government does have to take some cost for providing a tax credit for bondholders. 
   The benefits are enormous. Within 2 weeks, we will see the first high-speed rail train set come into Washington. It will be there just as a showpiece to tell us what is coming. Very soon thereafter, within 4 or 5 weeks, we will be seeing high-speed rail service or modified high-speed rail service in this corridor, between Washington and New York. We started in New York, the New York to Boston route. It is not truly high-speed rail; it is modified high-speed. It took an hour and a half off a 5 1/2 -hour trip, and the trains are loaded. It is as if people were standing on the platform for weeks waiting to find a train ride that would get them to their destinations, depending on weather, overcrowded skies, congestion all over the place, getting in your car and sitting there with all of the toxic emissions, all of the pollution, waiting for the traffic to move along. It was indeed a blessing, recognized by the public. 
   When we get the system in the New York to Washington area, it will be considerably less than a 3-hour trip. That competes very effectively with aviation and the shuttle flights. We have approximately 100 flights a day. I don't want to deprive the 
   airlines of revenue. That is not my mission. My mission is to help the American public  get to their destinations on time, not miss connections, and to feel more comfortable, and lift the spirit of people who have to travel for a living, or recreationally, for family reunions or all kinds of reasons--to make it easier. That is the mission we are on. 
   We have endorsements from many organizations. I know the occupant of the Chair was a member of the National Governors' Association when he was the Governor of Ohio. They endorse high-speed speed rail. National Conference of State Legislatures; U.S. Conference of Mayors; we have environmentalists; the American Road and Transportation Association; the AFL-CIO, Rail Labor Division; all people who have an interest in seeing high-speed rail. And newspapers that think about these things and whether or not they are going to be affected by this: The New York Times, the Houston Chronicle, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Chicago Sun-Times, the Tampa Tribune, Minneapolis Star Tribune, and other newspapers support this investment in high speed rail. 
   I think we ought to get on with it. I plead with my colleagues, don't let this be a last-ditch stand to try to uproot the possibilities of getting these trains underway, getting this track underway, getting the signal systems underway. It will make a difference in lives all across this country. Some of those whose States are serviced or will be serviced by this high-speed rail connection have to recognize what it means to them directly and step up to the plate and say this will be a national asset, even if it doesn't touch any of the cities in my State. 
   Recognizing time is precious and not wanting to hold the present occupant of the chair to a stricter schedule than he would like, I am feeling very generous and sympathetic because I know I am going to be able to call on the occupant of the chair to help us with the high-speed rail situation. I thank the chair for the courtesy of permitting me to make these comments. This is a milestone for America. It is a very important point in how we see ourselves getting from here to there. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this with enthusiasm, knowing very well this is going to be the mode of transportation that is essential to continue to carry out our responsibilities. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will soon pass my legislation, S. 522, the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act of 2000. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation and the managers' amendment that is before the Senate. This legislation is cosponsored by Senators AKAKA, BOXER, CLELAND, DODD, FEINSTEIN, KENNEDY, KERRY, LEVIN, LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, SMITH of New Hampshire, SARBANES, and TORRICELLI. 
   Many Americans who visited the beach this summer went home with more than just a tan. They brought back illnesses they contracted because they swam in contaminated water without realizing it. 
   Unfortunately, whether you get sick from your trip to the beach depends on which state you happen to be in. That's because states do not have uniform standards for coastal water quality. 
   For 10 straight years, Mr. President, the Natural Resources Defense Council has issued its report, ``Testing the Waters,'' which provides a comprehensive, highly reliable assessment of the quality of the nation's waters. Since 1991, first with then-Representative Bill Hughes of New Jersey and subsequently with Representative FRANK PALLONE of New Jersey, I have introduced legislation to require states to adopt consistent coastal water quality standards to protect beachgoers from contamination. This legislation also would call on states to develop beach water quality monitoring and notification programs. 
   Over the years, I've been greatly concerned about the increase in beach closings and advisories throughout the nation. In 1999, according to the NRDC's 10th annual report, there were more than 6,100 beach closings and advisories at our nation's oceans, bays and Great Lakes. Since 1988, there have been more than 36,156 beach closings and advisories. 
   There is some good news in this information, Mr. President. For one, it indicates a greater vigilance by state and local governments. Since the first NRDC report was issued and citizens learned more about the risks at their beaches, at least nine states and many local governments have initiated or expanded their coastal water quality monitoring programs. This shows that many states and local governments are deeply concerned about the health hazards faced by people who swim in contaminated water. 
   However, these data show us that we continue to have serious water pollution at our nation's beaches. For example, 70 percent of beach closings and advisories in 1999 were prompted by state and local government monitoring programs that detected bacteria levels exceeding state or local water quality standards. These bacteria levels have been associated with a variety of gastrointestinal diseases. 
   This bill would ensure that all coastal states apply the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's criteria for detecting bacteria in their beach waters. Mr. President, the goal of this bill is to ensure that no matter where people go to the beach, they will know that a uniform level of protection is being applied. 
   Right now, only seven states have adopted the criteria that the EPA called on states to adopt back in 1986. This bill give states three-and-a-half years to bring their standards up to where President Reagan's EPA said they should have been 14 years ago. 
   The second part of my bill provides incentive grants to help states set up beach monitoring and public information programs. Right now, only nine states comprehensively monitor most or all of their beaches. These are Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. 
   My bill does not say how a state should monitor its beaches or how that information should get to the public. To help the states, the EPA would be required to develop monitoring and notification guidance. 
   While we often don't know the exact source of coastal water pollution, we suspect that in many cases, sewer overflows and street runoff following heavy rainstorms are partly responsible. My bill focuses on a critical need: for states to set uniform standards and provide information to the public. My bill does not seek to regulate these sources of pollution. I sincerely hope that the Senate will address this key concern in the next Congress. 
   Finally, my bill would require the EPA to establish a publicly available database containing the information states submit about their monitoring programs. Right now, Mr. Chairman, only California, Delaware, New Jersey, North Carolina and Rhode Island compile and publicize records of beach closings and bacteria levels. The legislation would encourage all coastal states and the EPA to provide this information to the public. 
   I want to thank the managers of this bill, Senator BOB SMITH and Senator BAUCUS, for their leadership in bringing this bill before the full Senate. I also want to recognize the members of the Committee staff for working so diligently on this legislation. In particular, I want to compliment John Pemberton and Ann Klee of the Majority Staff of the Environment and Public Works Committee; Jo-Ellen Darcy of the Minority staff of the Committee; and Amy Maron and Ruth Lodder of my personal staff. 
   Many organizations also made significant contributions to this bill. I want to thank the Natural Resources Defense Council, American Oceans Campaign, Center for Marine Conservation, Surfrider Foundation, Association of State and Interstate Water Pollution Control Administrators, and the Coastal States Organization for their hard work.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the United States is now considering a bill authorizing the President to grant Permanent Normal Trade Relations to the People's Republic of China when that country joins the World Trade Organization. This can radically improve our relationship with the world's most populous country. 
   There is so much at stake, in my view. That is why I traveled last month to China to meet with China's leadership and some of its people, to see for myself what is happening in China, and to ensure that I make a well-informed decision on this day. 
   Some of what I saw, quite frankly, disturbed me. But I also saw and heard encouraging things that gave me hope about China's future. And I have concluded that the best way to promote positive change in China is to grant China permanent normal trade relations status. 
   Many Americans, including environmental activists and members of organized labor and human rights groups, believe this vote is about far more than trade. And I agree. We cannot consider trade policy without understanding the implications for the economy, our society, and the environment in America and the world. 
   Moreover, the granting of PNTR would eliminate the annual debate over granting normal trade relations, which we used to call MFN, to China. That annual debate allowed us to review all aspects of our relationship with China and developments in that country. Successive administrations and Congresses achieved progress on issues of importance to Americans by raising them in the context of that annual review. 
   This time, however, we are not merely considering whether China has made sufficient progress in economic, social, environmental and human rights reforms to merit extending the opening of our market--China's largest export market--for another year. Rather, we are considering whether China is on a firm enough course of progress that we can justify an act of faith and open our market permanently as China joins the WTO and substantially opens its markets to American goods and services. 
   That is why I traveled to China a few weeks ago, joined by my good friend the Senator from Iowa, Senator HARKIN. 
   I went so I could better understand China and raise my concerns with China's leaders about human rights, labor conditions, national security and the environment. I went to see for myself the condition of China's cities and rural areas, to compare the wealthy coast and the underdeveloped interior, to talk to garment workers and farmers, to assess the extent of freedom of religion and freedom of speech, to measure progress on human rights protection and environmental protection, and to look into the proliferation of weapons and the intimidation of Taiwan, to consider the abuse of power and the rule of law. 
   China presented a very mixed picture. The patriotic Catholic Bishop in Shanghai, Bishop Jin, expressed it well when he said, ``China is very complicated.'' 
   One thing was obvious: China is undergoing a tremendous transformation as a result of Deng Xiaoping's 1978 decision to open China to the world. The past two decades have seen the rise of free enterprise and international trade, and many of the Chinese 
   people have experienced a dramatic improvement in their standard of living. China's GDP growth, while surely lower than official estimates, has averaged more than 6 percent over the past two decades and remains strong despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis. China's economic development is amazing, particularly in the modern city of Shanghai. 
   I would like to speak briefly about some of the issues I raised with China's leaders and that will need to be addressed as we proceed in our strengthened relationship with China. 
   We have to consider the national security aspects of the U.S.-China relationship. The United States and China are not natural or historic enemies. But serious problems and tensions exist. 
   One key issue is China's proliferation of technologies and materials for missiles and weapons of mass destruction. Earlier this year, the CIA reported on China's continuing missile-related aid to Pakistan, Iran, North Korea and Libya, as well as nuclear cooperation with Iran and contributions to Iran's chemical weapons program. These relationships are not in China's interest and directly threaten U.S. interests. 
   When I raised this issue, Vice Premier Qian Qichen acknowledged that China provided missile assistance to Pakistan in the past but insisted it had not done so in recent years. Premier Zhu Rongji dismissed my concerns and demanded evidence of China's proliferation activities. Of course, China has not accepted the key Annex to the Missile Technology Control Regime. I hope China will acknowledge its past mistakes and fully commit itself to international non-proliferation efforts. 
   U.S. officials have made progress in addressing Chinese proliferation over the years. For example, they secured China's commitment not to help Iran develop new nuclear projects. But we must do more. 
   The United States and China have a common interest in ending the destabilizing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them. We have to improve cooperation toward that critical goal. 
   A second national security issue concerns Taiwan. Wang Daohan, the Chinese official who conducts the Cross-Straits Dialogue for the Mainland and influences China's policy toward Taiwan, stressed to us that Beijing is willing to give Taiwan considerable autonomy if Taipei accepts the ``One China'' policy and supports reunification. I am not convinced that making Taipei's acceptance of the ``One China'' policy a pre-condition for talks is a constructive approach. 
   I hope that China will withdraw its missiles that are only directed at Taiwan, because these threaten an arms race over Taiwan. As I told Mr. Wang, if you're extending a hand of peace it cannot be clenched into an iron fist. 
   We also need to consider protection for human rights and the rule of law in China. Fortunately, the House addressed these issues constructively in the bill before us by providing for an annual review of human rights in China. The bill before us also rightly authorizes U.S. assistance for rule of law programs in China. I know that the Ford Foundation and other private groups are supporting rule of law efforts in China. We should be prepared to put some of our resources toward achieving this worthy, if long-term, goal. 
   On the whole, we have to acknowledge that China has made some progress on human rights, though it still has a long way to go. 
   The limited ability of the Chinese people to have freedom of religion is a very real concern. The Chinese people, many of whom recognize the vacuousness of Marxist and Maoist rhetoric, are unsatisfied with their daily lives and seek a higher moral purpose, a spiritual side to life. We saw some Chinese practicing recognized religions in permitted places, but others are not so fortunate. Buddhists pray and burn incense at a temple near the Great Buddha in Leshan. Catholics attend Mass at patriotic Catholic Churches or in private homes used by the underground Catholic Church. Muslims pray at the mosque in Xian. But Muslims in Northwest China, who are not ethnically Chinese, cannot worship freely. 
   Judaism is not a recognized religion, so it is illegal. Practitioners of Falun Gong are arrested virtually every day when they do their exercises on Tiananmen Square or in other public places. And no member of any religion is allowed to proselytize freely, even though spreading the word is a key element of many faiths. 
   While Senator HARKIN and I did not have the opportunity to visit Tibet, I remain concerned about efforts to suppress Tibetan culture and religion. I hope the Chinese government will enter into dialogue with the Dalai Lama--without preconditions--with the aim of allowing him to return to Tibet as a spiritual leader. 
   So is there freedom of religion in China? I think a typical Chinese answer might be ``Yes, within limits.'' 
   Freedom of speech is similarly limited. Pre-publication censorship through approved publishing houses ensures that the Chinese government can review and approve the content of any published work. Some books have been  banned, recalled and destroyed after publication because a senior party member or official found them offensive. 
   During my visit to Beijing, I was pleased to hear Premier Zhu Rongji commit to continued progress on human rights. However, much work still needs to be done. 
   One of China's most egregious laws, under which people could be jailed as ``counter-revolutionary,'' was repealed in 1997. But hundreds or perhaps thousands of people sentenced under that statute remain locked up. 
   Perhaps the worst element of China's totalitarian state and arbitrary rule is the system of ``re-education through labor.'' Under this system, people can be deprived of their freedom for up to three years by the decision of a local police board--without 
   ever being charged with a crime, much less having a fair trial. While indications suggest a change in the ``re-education'' system may be in the works, I hope China will eliminate it entirely. 
   Further, I was disturbed by the Chinese government's efforts to suppress dissenting voices. Our Chinese hosts refused to pursue our request to meet with Bao Tong, a former government official imprisoned for warning Tiananmen Square demonstrators of the impending crackdown, saying it was ``too sensitive.'' 
   We will not forget the crackdown on democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square, nor will we sweep current human rights problems under the rug. That is not the mission. I am hopeful that a renewed United States-China relationship will yield better respect for human rights in China. 
   China's environmental policies are another serious concern. During the discussions in Kyoto about the world's climate, China insisted that only the U.S. and other developed countries should have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But China is the fourth largest and the most populous country in the world, so addressing global climate change will demand China's participation. 
   I raised these concerns with China's senior leaders and later with China's Environment Minister, Xie Zhenhua, at the State Environmental Protection Administration. The reaction I got was decidedly mixed. Minister Xie described China's concerted efforts to address environmental problems. For example, China has reduced annual soft coal production, and thus consumption, from 1.3 to 1.2 billion tons, with a goal of a further reduction to 1 billion tons, to reduce sulfur dioxide and particulate emissions and improve air quality. China is also increasing use of natural gas and has taken steps to remove the worst-polluting vehicles from the country's roads. However, Minister Xie then launched into a diatribe, saying that the U.S. bears principal responsibility for the degradation of the Earth's environment and that China has a right to pollute so it can develop economically. 
   I certainly hope recognition of the importance of environmental protection in China and global climate change will overcome the stale rhetoric of the old North-South economic discussions, so the U.S., China and other countries can join together to address common concerns. And I am hopeful that increased trade will foster more cooperation on that issue, including sales of environmentally sound American technology. 
   Many Americans are also rightly concerned about the working conditions and the rights of Chinese workers, particularly since American firms that follow American labor laws have to compete with Chinese producers. 
   Certainly, migrant workers in southeastern China--including underage workers--are exploited. And workers in China cannot meaningfully organize to protect their interests. China has strong labor laws, but enforcement is clearly lacking. 
   I visited a state-owned factory in Leshan, in Sichuan province, which produces equipment for power generation. Workers using large machine tools and working with large metal components had no protection for their eyes or ears, no hard hats and no steel-toed boots, as would be required in the U.S. Their work was clearly hard and dangerous, the hours long and the pay meager. 
   I also visited a garment factory in Shenzhen, the Special Economic Zone established 20 years ago near the border with Hong Kong. The factory manager told me workers are usually on the job for 40 hours a week, occasionally putting in overtime when the factory is busy. Workers themselves meekly said they probably work about 12 hours a day. But my staff looked through the rack of time cards near the door and discovered that virtually all of these textile workers arrive before 8 a.m., take a short lunch break and clock out after 10 p.m.--working nearly 14 hours a day, 7 days a week. And that earns them wages of 80 or 90 U.S. dollars per month, a bunk in a dormitory and meals. 
   The presence of American and other foreign investors and buyers can make a huge difference. 
   Senator HARKIN and I visited a factory near Shanghai that produces clothing for Liz Claiborne. The company appeared to be making a real effort to enforce fair labor association standards. We could see the results in working conditions. For example, the factory was well-lit and well-ventilated, even air-conditioned. Liz Claiborne's interventions led to the construction of a fire escape, and the workers' rights were clearly posted near the entrance. A Liz Claiborne representative on site not only ensures the quality of the product but also monitors compliance with China's labor laws limiting overtime hours. 
   Unfortunately, not all American and other foreign firms are as responsible. When I was in Hong Kong, the South China Morning Post had a front-page story about child labor in a factory in Guandong Province producing toys for McDonald's Happy Meals. Indeed, the toy industry is probably the most notorious for looking the other way as its Chinese suppliers exploit their workers. The bottom line is that trade with the United States and U.S. investment does not automatically lead to better working conditions and fairer treatment for Chinese workers. American and other foreign companies need to make fair labor standards a real condition of their business relationships. 
   So these are some of the problems I observed and concerns I raised in China. 
   I come to the key question: Can we as a nation best make progress on these issues by granting PNTR or by denying it? 
   Our annual reviews of Most Favored Nation treatment of China have provided important leverage with Beijing. Congress reviewed issues of importance to us, and members of the House and Senate and Administration officials raised these concerns with Chinese officials. Many times, China took significant steps to show progress, and arguably future-oriented leaders used the opportunity to promote reforms. Under H.R. 4444, a commission will still look at China's human rights record and other concerns each year, but without the implicit leverage of a vote on MFN. 
   Some have suggested we vote down PNTR to maintain our annual vote and the associated leverage. After all, China will still be interested in selling goods in the U.S. market, though we would not have access to WTO rules and dispute settlement mechanisms. 
   However, voting down PNTR would not simply maintain the status quo. Chinese leaders--and many Chinese citizens--see this debate on PNTR legislation as a referendum on the U.S.-China relationship. Rejecting PNTR means rejecting any hope of a cooperative relationship with China in the near-term. And cooperation, too, has yielded important progress. On the national security front, the U.S. and China have cooperated to promote peace and reconciliation on the Korean Peninsula. And the WTO contains a national security exception that will allow us to maintain technological controls and other national security restrictions on trade. On the human rights front, China has signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, though the National People's Congress has yet to ratify it. The presence of American firms willing to forego some of their profits to treat workers decently has helped raise standards of working conditions. 
   China is going to have access to the U.S. market regardless of how we vote. If we grant PNTR to China, however, we will gain the benefit of WTO dispute settlement mechanisms to better ensure China's commitment to free trade. By granting PNTR, we do give up the right to review China's trade status annually, but we can advance our agenda  on non-economic issues through increased dialogue, by bringing China into multilateral agreements and institutions, and through stronger bilateral cooperation. 
   Economically, I believe the world and the American and Chinese people have a lot to gain by granting PNTR. 
   As I discussed earlier, China's economic growth over the past two decades has been staggering, as a result of its opening to the world some 20 years ago. China has risen to become the world's ninth largest exporter and the eleventh largest importer. 
   In November 1999, we completed a landmark Bilateral Trade Agreement with China, which is contingent on our approving PNTR. In that agreement, China pledged to reduce tariffs on a number of imports. For example, all tariffs on information technology products such as semiconductors, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer equipment are to be eliminated by 2005. Tariffs on industrial products would decline from a simple average of 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent. 
   The agreement also opens China's markets in a wide range of services, including banking, insurance, telecommunications, distribution, professional services and other business services. China is expected to join the WTO's Basic Telecommunications Agreement and end geographic restrictions on wireless services and its ban on foreign investment in telecommunication. Such changes are good not only for China but for America. 
   But establishing Permanent Normal Trade Relations is something we can do only once. Some economists have raised serious questions about whether we have gained enough access to China's markets for goods and services. Did USTR's negotiators get a good deal? I think that's a difficult question to answer now. Our annual trade deficit with China stands at a shocking $56.9 billion. 
   One key factor which will determine how good a deal we got is compliance. How well will China fulfill its obligations? Through China's WTO accession and the establishment of PNTR, we will be able to hold China accountable for its trade commitments through the WTO's transparent, rules-based dispute settlement mechanisms. If China arbitrarily increases a tariff on an American product or engages in retaliatory actions against the U.S., we could seek redress under WTO regulations. 
   How effectively will we monitor compliance and use these mechanisms and our trade laws to bring China's laws and practices into line? This is a very serious question. China is a large country--nearly the size of the United States--and the application of national laws is grossly inconsistent across the country. Moreover, U.S. firms doing business there seem to understand their immense reliance on the goodwill of China's government and Communist Party. Will these firms be willing to risk a deal in Guangzhou by asking USTR to pursue action against arbitrary and discriminatory treatment in Inner Mongolia? Or will American firms continue to emphasize cooperation with Chinese authorities? 
   This bill rightly stresses the need for the U.S. government to monitor China's compliance with its trade obligations and use the WTO's dispute settlement mechanisms. But if we fail to grant PNTR for China, WTO dispute mechanisms will not be available to us. 
   Mr. President, China is already America's fourth largest trading partner. According to administration statistics, American exports to China and Hong Kong support an estimated 400,000 well-paying U.S. jobs. 
   China's WTO accession and the 1999 bilateral agreement will further open China's markets to American goods and services and protects American intellectual property rights. I believe will prove to be a good deal for America's working families. 
   New Jersey undoubtedly stands to benefit from China's accession to the WTO and improved market access. At the end of 1998, China ranked as New Jersey's ninth largest export destination, with merchandise exports worth $668 million. Important New Jersey firms, such as Lucent Technologies and Chubb Insurance, are already active in China and will have more opportunities as a result of China's market opening under the 1999 bilateral trade deal. 
   Mr. President, there are some potential risks in granting permanent normal trade relations to China now. While I have concerns about China's record in the areas I have outlined, I believe that China is undergoing momentous change. The best way to promote continued progress on issues of concern and help our economy is to grant China permanent normal trade relations status.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in recent months, some Members of Congress have questioned the Department of Housing and Urban Development's authority to conduct gun buyback programs under the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act. As the author of that legislation, I rise to set the record straight. 
   In proposing the Public and Assisted Housing Drug Elimination Act, my intent was to make our streets safer, particularly in federally-assisted and low-income housing where the federal government has a clear responsibility to protect families. And that intent is reflected in the statutory language, 42 U.S.C. Section 11902(a), which provides that HUD is to make grants available for use in ``eliminating drug-related and violent crime.'' Certainly, violent crime includes all of the offenses involving guns, whether it is murder, robbery, or gang-related activity. In short, gun buybacks are an eligible activity under the Act, and HUD has acted properly in assisting housing authorities and local communities with this important effort. 
   Furthermore, HUD's efforts to combat gun violence have been very successful. HUD's Gun Buyback and Violence Reduction Initiative has taken about 18,500 guns off the streets in more than 70 cities, and this program has received strong support from community organizations and law enforcement. 
   Every year, gun violence claims an average of 30,000 lives and wounds another 100,000 people. Congress should support, and not impede, local efforts to get guns off our streets and reduce crime.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Joshua S. Weston, a longtime friend, and one of New Jersey's most actively involved citizens, on the occasion of his receiving the ``Distinguished Achievement Award'' by B'nai B'rith International. 
   Mr. President, over the years Josh and I have worked together on many endeavors. In 1949, Josh joined me and a childhood friend to form Automatic Data Processing (ADP), a small payroll services company. Thanks to the tireless efforts of many and Josh's leadership as Chairman, ADP is now the leading provider of payroll services worldwide. 
   When I first heard that Josh was being honored, I was not surprised. Josh has always been an active participant of worthy causes. Josh and his wife, Judy, formed the Weston Science Scholars Program, an innovative science program that affords selected ninth- and tenth-grade students from Montclair High School the opportunity to work with Ph.D. scientists at Montclair State University. 
   While Josh knows the educational value of a good math and science program, he also recognizes the need for American Jewish students to form a bond with Israel. For more than five years, Josh has underwritten the costs of a United Jewish Federation program in which a college student attends a semester abroad in Israel. 
   In addition to Josh's philanthropic contributions, he sits on many committees. Josh is the president of the Josh and Judy Weston Family Foundation of Montclair. He serves on the governing boards of the International Rescue Committee, the New Jersey Symphony, the New Jersey Business Partnership, the Liberty Science Center, Mountainside Hospital, Boys Town of Jerusalem and Yeshiva University Business School, among others. He is the recipient of many awards, including an honorary degree from Montclair State University. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to honor my good friend Joshua Weston on this acclaimed occasion. We are indebted to him for his service. He has demonstrated to his family, his friends, and his community that this honor is well-deserved. I salute him on yet another great achievement.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Wellstone amendment on prison labor. 
   China has an extensive prison labor system, and many people are in China's prisons for expressing their opinions, practicing their religion, or engaging in other activities we would regard as the exercise of their fundamental human rights. 
   Many of these political prisoners have been sentenced to what the Chinese call ``re-education through labor'' without even being accused of a crime, much less having a fair trial. 
   In the early 1990s, the U.S. had reason to believe China was using prison labor to produce goods for export, including goods intended for the U.S. market. China's government denied this until we found a document directing the use of prison labor to produce goods for export. 
   China had long agreed not to use prison labor to make items destined for the U.S. market. In August 1992, after protracted negotiations, the United States and China signed a memorandum of understanding on prohibiting import and export trade in prison labor products. This was followed by a statement of cooperation in 1994. 
   For several years, the system put in place by these agreements allowed U.S. Customs to investigate when we suspected that prison labor was being used to make goods for sale in the U.S. 
   Under the agreements, U.S. Customs officers--working with their Chinese counterparts--investigated suspicious sites. Cooperation under the MOU included visits to 11 sites over several years. 
   In 1997--this is 4 years after the agreement was signed--China stopped allowing U.S. Customs to conduct these inspections. Apparently, the Chinese felt that the U.S. should give them a clean bill of health and accept their assurances on prison labor without further inspections. They went so far as to seek a renegotiation of the memorandum of understanding. 
   For me, China's compliance with its freely accepted international obligations on prison labor is a critical issue in considering PNTR. China's willingness to suspend implementation of the memorandum of understanding is very troubling. 
   For China's accession to the World Trade Organization and the 1999 bilateral market access agreement to be meaningful, we need to have confidence that China will fulfill the letter and spirit of its international obligations. 
   Senator HARKIN and I recently traveled to China, and China's failure to fulfill its commitments on prison labor was a major focus of our visit. Before we left, we worked with the U.S. Embassy in Beijing and the Chinese Embassy in Washington to arrange to accompany U.S. Customs on a long-overdue prison labor site inspection visit. 
   When we arrived in Beijing, we were told that the Chinese authorities did not understand our request, and then we were told such a visit would not be possible. But we did not give up. 
   We pressed the point in our first formal meeting in Beijing, with Vice Foreign Minister Yang. We did not make any progress on the issue, but I think the Chinese Government got the message that we were serious. 
   Later the same day, we met with Vice Premier Qian Qichen. We again pressed the point that China must fulfill its obligations to allow U.S. Customs to inspect suspected prison labor sites, and we asked that we be permitted to join an inspection. 
   Vice Premier Qian agreed that the time had come to resume implementation of the MOU on prison labor. He agreed that the first inspection would take place in September. 
   We had a debate about the interpretation of understanding. We wanted to go with Customs. At first, they said we could go to a prison, but that was not our mission. I was distressed by the fact that they chose to interpret what the understanding was after having worked on it for a month before we left the United States for China. 
   We saw Premier Zhu Rongji and he reaffirmed China's readiness to resume full implementation of the prison labor agreement. We urged that U.S. Customs be allowed to conduct inspections sooner than they planned. 
   While this trade-related agreement should have been implemented all along, without need for our intervention, I am glad our visit produced progress. 
   The first long-overdue prison labor site inspection by U.S. Customs took place last Friday, September 8. According to a preliminary report from our Embassy in Beijing, Chinese authorities cooperated well with U.S. Customs and other personnel inspecting a factory in Shandong Province. 
   I hope the implementation of the agreement will now resume in full, including rapid completion of other outstanding inspection requests. 
   The amendment before us would make China's implementation of the prison labor memorandum of understanding and statement of cooperation a condition for granting PNTR. In my view, this is a reasonable condition that Premier Zhu has already assured me China will fulfill and that appears to be back on track. 
   If the Chinese follow through, the President should have no problem reporting to Congress that China is complying with its international obligations under the prison labor agreement by the time China enters the WTO. 
   I believe this issue of prison labor is critical to our consideration of PNTR for China. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Wellstone amendment so that we can be assured China understands that when we have an agreement, we want it complied with. 
   That is one of the questions that loomed large in our visit. We had an opportunity to meet some of the distinguished leadership of the Chinese Government. We met with the mayor of Shanghai. We met with people who had an influence in provincial policy. More than anything else, I wanted to know that when we had an agreement, when we had an understanding, it was going to be followed through and it was not sufficient to produce excuses such as: Well, we didn't understand what was meant and that wasn't our interpretation; or, we are sorry we can't quite do that now. 
   That is not sufficient. This is an important agreement we are facing overall--this amendment first and then the overall decision on PNTR. 
   We need, in my view, to have a positive relationship with the Chinese Republic. It is such an enormous country with so much potential that it would be a positive step for the United States and China to work together for us to have access, not just to their marketplace. The marketplace is important, but there is something more. One billion two hundred million people reside in China, and we do not want to have an area of constant instability. We want to let them know that democracy works. What they have in place now just does not cut the mustard, as we say. So we want to have this understanding. 
   But in order to move ahead with it, we have to have a clear view that promises made--especially those that are so clear as to have been signed on a document--we want upheld; we do not want them skirted with purported misunderstandings. 
   So I congratulate my friend from Minnesota for having, as he usually  does, a look at the side of the issue that says: This is what is fair and equitable. That is what counts. And when we look at the marketplace, that is important. But in order to have the kind of wholesome relationship I would like to see us have with China, I think we have to deal with this issue of prison labor right now. I hope our colleagues will support it. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. WELLSTONE addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Dennis Cavanaugh to the United States District Court for New Jersey, and I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed him. 
   Dennis Cavanaugh has compiled an impressive record in both the public and private sectors. He has consistently demonstrated the efficiency, fairness and compassion that we have come to expect from our federal jurists. And he will be a tremendous asset as a district judge. 
   Since 1993, he has served as a magistrate judge. In that position, he has handled a number of difficult and complex cases. His current duties include managing all the civil cases assigned to two active district judges and half of the civil cases assigned to a senior district judge. That brings his total workload to more than 600 cases. 
   In fulfilling these duties, Magistrate Cavanaugh has shown the strong work ethic that is essential for judges who are called on to handle literally hundreds of cases at a time. 
   Magistrate Cavanaugh's legal career also includes several years of service as a public defender--from 1973 until 1977. After that, he entered private practice as a trial attorney handling civil litigation and some criminal cases. And he has been a partner with several distinguished firms in New Jersey. 
   His clients have included small businesses, educational institutions, insurance companies, public entities and police benevolent associations. And his experience with such a broad range of interests is one of the reasons he has performed so effectively as a magistrate judge. 
   Magistrate Cavanaugh has also done his part to help ease the caseloads overwhelming other judges. He volunteered for pro bono assignments at the  Superior Court in Essex County, where there was a severe backlog of civil cases. 
   In addition to his judicial duties, Magistrate Cavanaugh also finds time to teach as an adjunct professor at his alma mater, Seton Hall University School of Law in Newark. 
   That is the kind of experience and energy that has made New Jersey's federal bench one of the most impressive in the country. Magistrate Cavanaugh's entire career reflects the integrity and dedication that we want to see in all our federal judges. And I know his service on the district court bench will be equally outstanding. 
   I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Magistrate Cavanaugh's nomination. With his confirmation, there will be no vacancies on New Jersey's district court. I thank Chairman HATCH for moving this nomination so expeditiously, and I thank all of my colleagues for their support of Magistrate Cavanaugh.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to the Senior Senator from Georgia, Paul Coverdell, who passed away Tuesday in Atlanta. 
   Mr. President, while Senator Coverdell and I came from different political parties and ideologies, we shared several things in common. We both served our country in the U.S. Army, and after our service we both returned home to run successful businesses. 
   With our military and business background we decided to turn our attention to serving the public, and Senator Coverdell had a impressive record of public service. 
   Senator Coverdell served in the George State Senate--rising to the position of Minority Leader. He then served as Director of the Peace Corps under President Bush, focusing on the critical task of serving the emerging democracies of post-Soviet Eastern Europe. In 1992, he was elected to serve in the United States Senate. 
   Although we failed to agree on many issues before this body, Senator Coverdell always demonstrated honor and dignity in this chamber. He argued seriously for the positions he believed in. When he pushed legislation to fight illegal drugs or promote volunteerism, it was obvious that his heart was always in it. And his motivation was sincere and simple--to help the people of Georgia and the nation. 
   I send my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, his parents, and the entire Coverdell family. I also extend my sympathy to the people of Georgia. 
   We will all miss Senator Paul Coverdell of Georgia. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Specter amendment. I hope it will prevail for reasons that I don't think have been discussed thus far. 
   One thing that we are not talking about is whether or not, since legislation was passed some time ago that might be more restrictive to Amtrak, the conditions have changed. One need not be a transportation engineer to know you can't get off the ground at airports. I waited the other day 5 hours for a flight to go to New Jersey from here. We were on the ground 5 hours. 
   There are almost no airports of any size that aren't constantly late. There aren't places that one can travel by car or by bus that you can get where you want to be in a reliable period of time. We saw the front page news on the Washington Post 2 days ago about the disappearance of mountaintops, surrounded by smog, because the country is being overwhelmed by transportation and environmental problems. Conditions have changed. 
   When we want to make comparisons between Amtrak and private businesses, we have to recognize there is no place in this world, no place, where there isn't a subsidy provided for rail service so people can travel from place to place--such as the subsidy we offer when we build airports and we provide and charge the passengers a tax to ride in an airplane. We have a passenger facility charge. Or that if one wants to buy gas at a gas station, we have a Federal tax; we have State taxes. Amtrak doesn't have that ability. Amtrak is the poor stepchild. It offers a service to lots and lots of people who can't find any alternative that is satisfactory or available to them. 
   I don't like spending money. I happen to come from a strong business background. I know the difference between business and government. Amtrak is not a business like other businesses. It requires help. What we said in the commitment that was made for Amtrak was that we would not require that they meet operating needs out of the fare box. That is what we said would happen. Capital costs--and those are the things we are talking about--are part of the operating budget. We are forced at times to use operating funds for capital costs. The thing is all backwards. We are similiar to a Third World country in a process that has us asking passenger railroads to do things that no other country does. 
   Germany has advanced their transportation systems, investing $10 billion a year in developing rapid rail transportation. In France, you can travel from Brussels to Paris in an hour and 25 minutes; the distance is 200 miles. That is what we ought to be talking about. 
   Take the pressure out of the skies. There is no more room for airplanes in the skies. There is no latitude. We can build more airplanes but you still won't be able to fly the planes. We have broken the rules. We expanded the number of slots at Reagan National because of requests from some of the people here, Senators who wanted to have particular access. Break the rules. Give us access. What do we care about the rules, about the number of flights that can come in and go, from whatever distances. Break the rules. 
   We are not talking about breaking the rules. We are talking about extending an opportunity for many in the American public to be able to travel and get to their destinations on time with a degree of comfort that permits them to arrive at their destination and be able to conduct their business or see their families or get to school or whatever else they have to do. 
   It is a fairly simple equation. I hope we will support the Specter amendment. 
   I think what it does do is it says to people who need passageway, who need an opportunity to get from place to place that is not otherwise ordinarily available, and that is to permit these leases to be supported by GSA. To save Amtrak? No, not to save Amtrak; to save the passengers, to save the rail riders $15 million a year. That is what we are talking about saving. 
   Amtrak is not the issue. The issue is whether or not we can transport the people who inhabit this country in a way that is reasonable without continuing to foul the air or delay them interminably. 
   I hope we can conclude this vote and get the issue resolved. I do not like disagreeing with the chairman of the Commerce Committee. They have jurisdiction. But in this case I happen to think the perspective is wrong; that there is not recognition of what our country's needs are. They have changed so radically in the past few years. Look at airline passenger traffic. See how much it has grown. See how much more the highways are used now than only a few short years ago. The situation has changed. Are we going to continue to take an attitude that it doesn't matter what we are doing to the environment; it doesn't matter how late the airplanes are; it doesn't matter how costly rides are; regardless of that, we are not going to permit it to happen? 
   I hope we will extend this extra opportunity for Amtrak and for its passengers to continue to operate and get us to the point, when we get high-speed rail in there, we can meet our operating costs and we can provide the kinds of service one would expect in a country such as ours. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Montana. Five minutes, or fewer, will be OK. If we talk about it long enough right now, we won't have any time left to talk. 
   Mr. President, I hope the American public is looking at this because this is kind of ``inside baseball.'' This is what helps people get from place to place, get to work on time, get to the hospital on time, get to church on time. We are terribly short of funds altogether for highway repair and development. Everybody knows that. We have about a $30 billion highway bill. This 5-month hiatus will take $10 billion away. The worst part of it is that the benefits are not going to go to the public because all of us need to remember that the taxes are remitted by the oil companies--by the companies that, in many cases, are gouging the public this very day. So they can hold on to that and that will make the year-end profit statement look even better. Stock prices will be higher. 
   The public will not get what they thought they were getting. They are going to get stuck; that is what will happen. They will be stuck in traffic because we won't be able to continue the highway work. Once you stop it, it is very hard to get it started again. Is that what we are going to say to the public? People in 
   this country who want to go someplace may see a nice yellow barrier saying ``work halted'' on the highway, or an interchange, or at access to factories, their jobs, or other places where the community gathers, including schools, clinics--you name it. Sorry, the work has stopped. We have run out of money. We are certainly not going to take it from the General Treasury, since we are all so fully committed to paying down the debt and keeping this country out of debt. If we are going to give targeted tax cuts, then we ought to talk about those specifically. But to suggest that we want to give the oil companies, the oil producers, an 18-cent-a-gallon tax cut, I think, is really unfair to the public at large. They ought to see through the fog and the smog being created by this. 
   It is not going to happen, Mr. and Mrs. America. You may feel that you are getting a bargain now, and the distinguished Senator from Michigan--who is my friend--talked about people who responded to a price cut at a gas station. But sometimes you put away money for a later day to pay off a mortgage, or to try to accumulate money for a college education for your child, or to assure there is enough there to pay doctor bills that may fall your way. It may feel good at this moment, but when that highway is all backed up, and smog envelopes the place, and the air quality turns sour, then people will be saying: Now what happens? We didn't get what we paid that money for. 
   I know this amendment is offered with all good intentions, but if the public is listening, hear what is being said. You get an 18 cent cut in the gas tax so you can give it to the gasoline company. That is hardly the way we want to see things done. America has to pull together and we have to stand against those on the outside of our borders who are drilling oil, and just enough to keep the prices up. When they dial 911, they want America there immediately. That is why we sent over 400,000 of our best to the Persian Gulf. That is why we did it. So we need help there. I hope they hear the alarm go off here. That will get prices down. I thank the Chair. I thank my friend from Montana for giving me this time.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator ROBB in opposing the Santorum-Lieberman amendment. I support the new markets initiative promoted by the President and Speaker HASTERT, but I think it is important for my colleagues to understand that this amendment is not the President's initiative. No one is arguing against reform, not at all. But to introduce a factor that permits religious discrimination--it does do that--to enter into these evaluations as to who can participate, will we see a sign that says ``no people of this faith allowed'' or ``only people of that faith allowed.'' I hardly think that is an improvement, regardless of the fact that there may be some modest, or perhaps more than that, improvements made in the way the new markets initiative operates. 
   The fact is, we should not be introducing an opportunity to discriminate against one group or another, not to set religious boundaries on how an organization performs these services, how they encourage people to strike out for themselves and to be able to make a living on their own. 
   I hope our colleagues will examine this amendment seriously. Hidden in the good that it is doing is some, I would call, possible serious evil. We ought not to be, in this Chamber, saluting the ability of organizations to discriminate against one person or another based on their religious preferences. 
   With that, I hope we will not support this amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are going to take a couple of minutes to develop our opposition comments regarding the elimination of the inheritance tax. The repeal of it is an interesting prospect but not one that has much merit. My strong opposition to the ultimate repeal of the inheritance tax will be obvious with my comments. 
   This legislation would provide a huge windfall to a handful of very wealthy individuals at the direct expense of ordinary, hard-working Americans. 
   Without meaning to brag, I had a successful business operation before I came here. I was chairman and CEO of a very large company with over 16,000 employees, a company that I began with two other fellows from my home city of Paterson, NJ--a mill town with a great industrial past, at the time I was growing up there, but with a dismal current situation--the three of us, by dint of hard work. My parents and the parents of the two brothers with whom I was associated were all immigrants. My parents were brought as infants by my grandparents, and my colleagues' parents came at a later date and time in their lives. We were poor. 
   I just retraced these roots with a newspaper because I am in the process of ending my Senate career come January 2001. We were very successful. That company we started without anything today employs 33,000 people. It is one of America's leading examples of what happens when there is hard work and initiative and there is creativity in this great country of ours. 
   I am one of those people who will fit in the 2 percent who are going to be principally affected by the reduction and ultimate elimination of the inheritance tax. I have four children. I am a proud grandfather. I have seven grandchildren, the oldest of whom is 6. 
   When I am called upon to ascend to a different place, there is going to be an estate. My children have never said to me: Dad, you have to get rid of the inheritance tax, or, Dad, make sure we are well taken care of. They have had a decent life. 
   I stand here to say, yes, my estate is going to pay a lot of tax when I go, a lot of tax. It is OK; it is all right with me. It has to be all right with my children. 
   Talking about the three of us who ran the company ADP, we succeeded in this country not just because we were willing to work hard and we had some smarts and we did the right thing. We were made successful because of the resources available in this country. We were made successful because lots of people who struggled to make a living and support their families did the work  they had to. We were made successful because this great land in which we live provided the opportunity. 
   We could be just as clever and just as hard working in lots of other places around the world, but we never could have accumulated the resources we had. Neither could Mr. Gates or the other people now almost legendary multibillionaires. They couldn't have done it without lots of little people, lots of people doing the scut work, doing the hard labor, or using their brains that were developed by investments through our society, through this Government, helping to develop schools that would cultivate the thinking and the creativity that went into making their contribution. A lot of them, as was true in my own company, got rewarded, but they were not in the $20 million estate group or even higher. They weren't in the number 374 with an average amount of assets of $52 million. 
   They are not in that group. The group isn't very large, but it is very powerful. This group is very powerful. When they speak, everybody here listens--just about. They hear from the leaders of these companies. They hear from the people who bought the boats, the private yachts, and the airplanes. Now there is almost a contest within our society--and I know some of these folks--about who can build the biggest yacht. They are up to over 300 feet now. That is the largest private yacht sailing the seas. It has a crew of almost 50 people. I don't know what is going to happen to that man's estate, but I don't think he deserves to have that estate protected without acknowledging the fact that he owes something back to this society. He has an obligation--his estate has an obligation to make sure something remains so there can be other entrepreneurs, business leaders, scientists, and physicians created, to make sure this country is able to carry on. 
   Part of what is in the basic ethic of this Nation of ours--and it goes back to its founding days--is hard work; do your share. I used to hear in my household from my grandmother that you had to ``leave something over for those who need help.'' You could not just take it and walk away. What is going to happen to that work ethic? 
   Bill Gates is worth, they say, somewhere around $100 billion. I don't know him personally, but I hear he is a real good guy, very philanthropic. He gives away a lot of money to very noble causes. But if he chose to say, look, my estate will pay the 55-percent tax, that will leave, by my calculation, $40 billion or $60 billion to be divided among his children. I don't hold him out to be evil or the devil. I use the arithmetic description to try to make the point; it is to make the point that we ought to be very careful. 
   None of us like taxes. I don't like them. But I know they are necessary. If you want to belong to ``Country Club America,'' you have to pay the dues--especially if you succeed, as only you can in this country of ours because of the resources that are here. Some of them are natural resources. We have a wonderful location and the ability to ship goods from our oceans. This is one incredible place. Boy, are you lucky to belong to ``Country Club America.'' But I think it is necessary to pay your dues. I think it is necessary for me to pay dues. I think it is necessary for my estate to pay dues. My estate will be assessed at the high rate. It is not going to leave my kids poverty stricken, nor is it going to leave the 346 wealthiest people who will leave estates at $52 million poverty stricken. 
   I don't even think the heirs to estates of from $10 million to $20 million--there are 688 of them and they will pay $3.7 million in taxes--will be impoverished. We are looking at estates of from $5 million to $10 million. There are roughly 1,800 of them. Those estate taxes will be $1.9 million. That leaves $4 million to the beneficiaries. That doesn't sound like impoverishment. 
   Look at what the picture is. On this chart, we have the 374 largest estates. If the Republican tax plan goes through, they will save $11.8 million each. That is just 374 estates. And roughly 300,000 estates will pay zero estate tax. 
   Is that fair? That is the question. Is it fair that we take such good care of people who have a $50 million estate, on average? And some are substantially larger. Where is the conscience here? Roughly, 2 percent of the people in the 
   country have estates that pay any tax at all. Out of the 2.3 million, only 2 percent have any inheritance tax at all. Most people don't leave estates that hit inheritance tax levels. They don't pay taxes. By the way, all through this successful person's lifetime--and some are successful because they pick the right father--those estates pay a very small portion of the inheritance tax revenues. But we want to reduce the portion that they do. 
   All of the rest of the people in America, the people who work hard and try to provide for their kids, the people who try to educate their children so they can go on and succeed in their own right, they don't pay any estate tax because before you must pay estate taxes, you have quite a hurdle to get over. 
   Also, for the benefit of those considering this, let's remember that if it is a husband and a wife in a family, that family can give $20,000 a year to each child. If they have three kids, they can give $60,000 to those kids. The wealthy people we are talking about can do that. They can give $60,000 to those children, and if it is a 20-year lifetime, you are talking about $1.2 million that you can give away absolutely tax free. You can do that to lots of people. They don't have to be your kids. They can be your friends, your neighbors, or distant relatives. You can give a lot of money away in a lifetime. Then you get a $1.3 million exemption before you start paying any tax at all. So we are looking at a tax that is not fair. 
   This Nation has its taxes structured on the basis of graduated incomes, and you pay higher taxes. We have had tax reductions. Now, capital gains is 20 percent. The maximum rate we have on income is 39 percent. I am always willing to look at ways to reduce that. 
   Frankly, I think maybe one of the things we ought to consider--and I haven't run the costs on it--is to say that for people over 65 we even start reducing that 20 percent. Maybe by the time somebody is 70, there would be no capital gains tax, and maybe that will stimulate their investments into the economy and charities--the amount of money given philanthropically--because there is a pebble in the shoe, and also a generosity of spirit. Some people say they would rather give it to a university, a hospital, or a library, than just leave it out there to be taxed. That is a good idea. I know very few people who have these big fortunes who don't do a lot philanthropically. I also know some people who are in the multibillions of dollars worth of estates who have said they are not going to leave anything to their kids, that they will have given them their head start in a lifetime. 
   I see that the Chair is poised to strike the gavel. I thank you for the time I have had. I hope we are mindful of the public reaction. Taking care of the rich is not an obligation in which we have to specialize.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator KERRY's effort to make sure the Federal government plays by the same environmental rules that the private sector lives by. The Defense Department, in carrying out its military mission operates a vast, sprawling industrial complex with a potentially huge impact on the environment. 
   I think I'm only stating the obvious when I say it's absolutely crucial to make sure that the Defense Department and all federal agencies are held to the same environmental standards that apply to the private sector. 
   Under most current environmental laws, that's already the case. Federal facilities, including military installations, are subject to civil penalties for violating the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, certain provisions of the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. Congress specifically recognized the importance of these penalties when it passed the Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, these letters are opposed to authorization or appropriation language that limits the importance of penalties in deterring environmental violations. 
   In fact, the letter signed by twenty-one environmental groups states ``Creating a special exemption for DoD from penalties for environmental violations sends the message that this federal agency can ignore and discount the laws by which everyone else must abide.'' 
   My final point is that every time the Senate Environmental and Public Works Committee has raised this topic in hearings, the Committee has leaned toward expanding the role of fines and penalties in enforcing environmental laws at federal facilities. They did that so federal, state, and local governments would have all the tools they need to make sure all federal facilities comply with health and environmental laws. 
   Finally, as the Administration pointed out, ``all federal agencies should be held fully accountable for environmental violations and should be held to the same standards as the private sector.'' 
   That is precisely what the Kerry amendment would do and I urge my colleagues to support it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the second-degree amendment, which I am pleased to be cosponsoring with Senator CONRAD. 
   This amendment would establish a lockbox to protect both Social Security and Medicare surpluses from being raided to pay for other programs or tax breaks. The amendment would take Medicare completely off-budget, and it would add iron-clad guarantees to ensure that neither Social Security nor Medicare surpluses can be used for any other purposes. 
   This amendment is based on a proposal first put forward last week by Vice President GORE. And I want to commend the Vice President for his leadership in this area. As he has argued so forcefully, it is wrong for Congress to use Social Security or Medicare surpluses as a piggy bank either for tax breaks or new spending. Instead, Social Security and Medicare should be taken off the table, and out of the Federal budget. 
   Social Security already is officially off budget. That is the law. There is a bipartisan consensus that we should not use Social Security surpluses for any other purpose. We all agree on that. 
   But what we have not all agreed on is that Medicare surpluses should be protected, as well. 
   Senate Democrats have long argued that Medicare must be included in any Social Security lockbox. That is why last year, when Republicans sought to move a lockbox that dealt only with Social Security, we held firm and insisted on our right to offer at least one amendment. The amendment we wanted to offer would have added Medicare to the GOP proposal. 
   But the Republicans were so opposed to that, they pulled the bill from the floor. In fact, this happened several times. Each time, we Democrats insisted that Medicare be part of the equation. And, each time, Republicans said: No. 
   I am hopeful that Republican opposition to protecting Medicare is softening, and I give Vice President GORE a lot of the credit for that. He has taken the lead and put this issue at the forefront of the public agenda. With the spotlight now clearly on the Congress, I am optimistic that we will respond. 
   We should not respond with half-hearted measures, like the bill approved in the House of Representatives or the pending Ashcroft amendment. We should do ti right, and that means taking Medicare completely off-budget, with all the procedural protections now provided to Social Security. 
   That is what this amendment does. 
   It treats Medicare just as we are already treating Social Security. It says: Medicare, like Social Security, will now be taken completely off of the Government's books. It will not be counted in the President's budget calculations. It will not be counted in the budget resolution, and it will not be used as a piggy bank for tax breaks, or for any other Government programs. 
   The legislation also creates points of order against any legislation that would deplete the Medicare Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for any other purpose. Similar points of order already apply for Social Security. Medicare deserves the same protections. 
   In addition, the amendment would protect Medicare from across-the-board cuts that could be triggered if Congress exceeds other budgetary limits. Under current law--the so-called ``pay-as-you-go'' rules--if Congress raids surpluses either for tax breaks or mandatory spending, Medicare automatically gets cut. That is not right, and that will end under this amendment. 
   In addition to taking Medicare off-budget, the amendment also strengthens existing rules that protect Social Security. For example, the amendment would establish a supermajority point of order against any measure that would put Social Security back on budget, or violate the prohibition against including Social Security in a budget resolution. 
   Our amendment also strengthens existing law by requiring every budget resolution to include Social Security totals for each year covered in the resolution, and then establishing a point of order to protect those funds in each year. This is an improvement over current law, which protects Social Security surpluses in the first year of a budget resolution, and for the entire period of the resolution, but not in each individual year. There is no similar provision in the pending Ashcroft amendment. 
   Mr. President, I want to take a moment to comment on the Ashcroft amendment. 
   The Ashcroft amendment is described as taking Medicare offbudget, something deserving consideration. But the proposed amendment does not really do it. It does not fully protect Medicare. And the public must know why it is an inferior proposal to the second-degree amendment proposed by Senator CONRAD and myself.  
   The Conrad-Lautenberg amendment calls for more than a surface accounting change. Yes, we take Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund off-budget, and that's important. But we are also insisting that we include procedural protections against any budget resolution or legislation that would use Medicare funds for other purposes, and permit undermining its solvency. 
   We do that by establishing a process that will protect Medicare by requiring a 60-vote point of order against any legislation that would invade the trust fund's solvency to be used for other purposes. Under our amendment, if you want to use Medicare funds to pay for tax breaks, or for anything else, you will need those 60 votes to do it. 
   That is not true of the prevailing amendment, however. The Ashcroft amendment isn't really able to protect Medicare. It does establish a point of order, a higher hurdle, that obstructs creation of a larger budget deficit. And that's a good thing that will help promote debt reduction. 
   But preventing an on-budget deficit is not the same thing as protecting the Medicare Trust Fund. 
   For example, if legislation was proposed that reduced revenues into Medicare's Trust Fund and increased the possibility of earlier Medicare insolvency, that legislation would not be subject to a point of order under the present Ashcroft amendment. That is because, again, the Ashcroft amendment isn't really designed to protect the solvency of Medicare. It is only designed to prevent on-budget deficits. And that just doesn't go far enough. 
   The point of all this talk about Medicare is to ensure that the program will still be solvent and strong in the future, when the baby boomers retire. Well, if you don't protect Medicare's solvency, you are really not accomplishing that goal. 
   That is why the Ashcroft amendment is grossly inadequate and why I urge my colleagues will instead support the Conrad-Lautenberg second degree amendment. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce bipartisan legislation, the Streamlined Environmental Reporting and Pollution Prevention Act of 2000, with Senator CRAPO, my colleague on the Environment and Public Works Committee, as an original cosponsor. 
   This bill will require the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to give businesses one point of contact for all federal environmental reporting requirements, and to otherwise minimize the administrative burdens of environmental reporting. This ``one-stop'' reporting system will use a common nomenclature throughout and use language understandable to business people, not just to environmental specialists. Its electronic version will also provide pollution prevention information to the business. The bill will also  give each State, tribal, or local agency the option of reporting information to one point of contact at EPA, which will facilitate their efforts to streamline environmental reporting. 
   Mr. President, a law streamlining environmental reporting will obviously benefit industry. It will be of great environmental benefit as well. High-quality environmental information is the foundation of environmental policy-making. Unfortunately, there are significant gaps and inaccuracies in the environmental information reported by businesses today. This is because environmental reporting currently involves scouring several different EPA offices for the applicable requirements, and then mastering a bewildering variety of reporting formats and regulatory nomenclatures. Reducing needless complications, as our bill does, will increase compliance with reporting programs and improve the accuracy of the information reported. 
   In addition to improving environmental information, a law streamlining environmental reporting will help businesses prevent pollution at the source. Mainstream business decision-makers--those who design the business's product, decide how to make it, manufacture it, and instruct customers in its use--inadvertently make the vast majority of environmental decisions at the business. When a business designs its product and the process for manufacturing the product, it is locking in its major environmental impacts. Streamlining environmental reporting will make it easier for mainstream business decision-makers to understand their environmental obligations. This will make it easier to incorporate environmental considerations into the design of products and production processes, and instructions on their use--that is, preventing pollution at the source. 
   This bill is endorsed by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, the Printing Industries of America, the National Association of Metal Finishers, the American Electroplaters and Surface Finishers Society, the Metal Finishing Suppliers Association, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, Environmental Defense, the National Environmental Trust, and the National Pollution Prevention Roundtable. I ask unanimous consent that their statements of support, the text of the bill, and a section-by-section summary of the bill be entered into the Record.  
   Mr. President, this is a bipartisan win-win bill that will be good for U.S. industry and good for the environment. I urge my colleagues to join Senator CRAPO and me in supporting this legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the fiscal year 2001 Foreign Operations Appropriations bill, which has been moved to third reading. 
   Most immediately, the supplemental emergency funding for Assistance to Plan Colombia--requested by the President at the beginning of the year, and passed by the House months ago--can finally be included in the Military Construction Appropriations bill already in Conference. 
   In Colombia, we have a real opportunity to work with a democratically-elected government which is committed to combatting drug production  and trafficking in a country which supplies most of the heroin and about 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States. 
   Mr. President, I recently visited Colombia to assess what our aid could accomplish. I went to see the scope of drug crop cultivation and processing, to look into the political context, the human rights situation, the goals of the Pastrana Government, and to assess the capabilities of the military and the police. 
   I went with an open mind, though I was concerned about the horrendous abuses of human rights and with the effects of Colombian cocaine and heroin on the streets of New Jersey and other states. 
   I left Colombia convinced that we can help Colombia and help America by cooperating in the fight against drug production, trafficking, and use. Let me briefly share a few of my observations and conclusions: 
   Aid for Plan Colombia is strongly in the U.S. interest. While there can be legitimate differences of opinion about the exact content of the aid package, we must use the opportunity to cooperate with a fellow democracy to fight the scourge of drugs which harms both our people. 
   This is a genuine emergency and should be funded as such. Drug crop eradication, training, and counter-narcotics military and police operations have been curtailed for lack of funds. Other elements of the package--like helicopters and alternative development aid--have longer lead times, but the process cannot start until the funds are passed. 
   Every week we delay, 1,000 more acres of coca are planted, so the problem grows ever larger and narcotics-trafficking groups grow stronger. 
   Colombia's political will is strong. While the political situation in Colombia is uncertain, President Pastrana and the Colombian Congress have backed away from forcing early elections and appear to be working out their differences. But the Colombian people and their elected representatives want an end to the violence. 
   They support peace negotiations with the FARC and ELN guerrillas. And they know the violence will not end as long as it is fueled by drug trafficking and its dirty proceeds.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for the Kennedy/Smith Hate Crimes Prevention Amendment. 
   Recent events in the news have unfortunately offered a number of disturbing examples of why this legislation is so badly needed. 
   All of my colleagues remember that terrible day in August of last year, when a hate-filled gunman, Buford Furrow, opened fire with a semiautomatic rifle at a Jewish Community Center near Los Angeles. We all remember that line of frightened children, holding hands as policemen led them to safety. Furrow's rampage wounded three children, a teenager and a 68-year-old receptionist. 
   And he later used a handgun to kill a Filipino postal worker. There is every indication that Mr. Furrow, a white supremacist, was motivated by racial hatred. 
   Then there was the brutal attack in August 1998 on Matthew Shepard, a gay student at the University of Wyoming. Matthew was savagely beaten to death by two homophobic thugs who tied him to a fence and tortured him. 
   That assault came just a few months after the horrific attack on James Byrd Jr., who was chained to a pickup truck, dragged along a Texas road and killed by avowed racists motivated by prejudice. 
   Earlier this year, I had the privilege of meeting Matthew Shepard's parents, and the family of James Byrd Jr. at a ceremony honoring victims of crime. They are truly remarkable people, because they've turned their loss into a source of strength for others. They have devoted themselves to helping others--victims of crime everywhere--even while coping with their own personal tragedies. 
   That's an example that this Congress should follow. Crimes that target race, or sexual orientation, or gender, or religion are the ugliest expressions of ignorance and hate. We need stronger  federal laws to deal with these crimes and the people who commit them. 
   Mr. President, current federal law is just too restrictive to allow federal prosecutors to try hate-crimes cases effectively. In 1994, a jury acquitted three white supremacists who had assaulted African-Americans. After the trial, jurors said it was clear the defendants had acted out of racial hatred. 
   But prosecutors had to prove more than that. They had to prove that the defendants intended to prevent the African-American victims from participating in a federally protected activity--a major roadblock for the prosecution's case. 
   The Kennedy/Smith amendment would remove that element from federal hate-crimes law. It would also allow federal prosecutors to prosecute violent crimes based on a victim's sexual orientation, gender or disability. 
   Mr. President, as all of us here know, no area of the country is free from hate crimes. In my home state of New Jersey, there were at least four incidents of hate-related violence between January 12 last year and January 15 this year. One of the victims was a 16-year-old gay high school student who was badly beaten. 
   The Kennedy/Smith amendment would bring the full force of this country's legal system to bear on incidents like this. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this legislation to protect American citizens from crime motivated by bigotry and intolerance.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is in session. 
   These names come from a report prepared by the United States Conference of Mayors. The report includes data on firearm deaths from 100 U.S. cities between April 20, 1999 and March 20, 2000. The 100 cities covered range in size from Chicago, Illinois, which has a population of more than 2.7 million to Bedford Heights, Ohio, with a population of about 11,800. 
   But the list does not include gun deaths from some major cities like New York and Los Angeles. 
   The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today--on June 20, 1999:  
   Ed Barron, 20, St. Louis, Missouri, Wayne Burton, 21, Baltimore, Maryland, Nigal H. Cox, 27, Houston, Texas, Jermaine Davis, 39, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Myron Frenney, 22, Houston, Texas, Jose N. Garcia, 18, Chicago, Illinois, Agustin B. Gonzalez, 21, Houston, Texas, Fernando Gonzalez-Cenkeros, 35, Tulsa, Oklahoma, Jovel D. Gwinn, 22, Kansas City, Missouri, Roshon Hollinger, 5, Atlanta, Georgia, Antwaune Johnson, 29, Denver, Colorado, Edward Johnson, 36, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Loris Larson, 35, St. Louis, Missouri, Robert Mirabela, 20, Chicago, Illinois, Frederick Rathers, 16, Memphis, Tennessee, Coartney Robinson, 20, Dallas, Texas, Arnold Webb, 30, Detroit, Michigan. 
   In the name of those who died, we will continue the fight to pass gun safety measures. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Ohio and congratulate him for his foresight. He is among the best to know what to do in a situation such as this, having served as a Governor of Ohio and mayor, as we earlier heard from our friend from Delaware. 
   We are simply asking for flexibility to use certain highway funds for mass transit investments. I think that is a pretty good idea. The Voinovich amendment merely extends that flexibility to include Amtrak expenses. 
   We do not have much new here, except to make certain that if a Governor, if a State, if the people in that State choose to use some of the highway money they are going to have on rail, they have an opportunity to do so. I, frankly, think it is an appropriate local decision. We often have disputes here about whether we are invading States rights, seizing their prerogatives. This one surprises me because what I hear from the opponents, largely, is: Well, my people have put money into the trust fund from the gasoline taxes and we want it spent on highways. 
   I can tell you, coming from New Jersey, we don't get very much of a return on the money we send down here. As a matter of fact, I am embarrassed to tell some of my constituents that we have among the lowest--perhaps the lowest--return on money we send to Washington. So we understand the concerns there. But this is in the national interest. As we hear the discussion, we say it should be to guarantee a National Highway System. The highway system is getting by far the lion's share. If a State says it would also like to be investing in intercity rail service, I think it ought to be able to do it. 
   Some say all the money going to rail, to Amtrak, is largely in the Northeast corridor. That may be a fact of life because most of the people in the country  are squashed into that little area, the Northeast quadrant of the United States. But also, as we look at plans, there are plans to take trains from Chicago to St. Louis. If the investments are properly made there, we will knock about 2 hours off the trip from Chicago to St. Louis. I assume that is an important route. It is a Midwest route, Chicago to St. Louis, MO--that is a pretty busy area, too. And there is congestion there: Been there, done that; I have seen it myself. Traffic on the highways is bottled up. 
   We are clogging the airlanes to such a point they cannot function. There was an article in the paper the other day about runway incursions. They are way up, 27 percent in just 5 months 
   this year. That is an ominous thing to think about. We are always concerned about airplanes falling out of the sky. Our system is fundamentally safe, but runway incursions happen for a couple of reasons, not the least of which is it is just too crowded. There are too many airplanes fighting for the same space to land or to take off or for slots to permit their passengers to disembark. 
   We are looking at a situation now, as we heard from the Senator from Delaware, where we cannot put anymore concrete down without recognizing there is a terrific consequence to that. We talk about urban sprawl; we talk about consuming all the land that is under us. We know one thing is true: Rail is an efficient way to go. So we ought to say, OK, I will butt out of your business. If the Governor of Missouri or Governor of Illinois or the Governor of New Jersey chooses to use some of their highway funds on intercity rail and convinces their legislature to do that, we ought to agree. We ought to do it. That is usually the cry here: Let the States decide. As much as possible, I would like to see them do that. 
   What we see here is an excellent opportunity to present a States rights issue and allow the decisions to be made at the local scene where they are going to have the greatest impact. I hope we are going to see full support for this amendment. This is a matter of direct choice. 
   I yield the floor and encourage all my colleagues to support the amendment the Senator from Ohio has wisely offered.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to take only 1 minute. 
   This is not a new idea. This has been in Senate bills before, including ISTEA and TEA-21, and it passed with those bills. It died in conference. There was another influence working over there that prevented us from exercising our will and our judgment about what ought to happen. 
   With all due respect to my colleagues who oppose this, we have done this before, and we ought to have a clear opportunity to do it again. 
   The Senator from Ohio was so clear in his presentation. It is simply allowing the governments within the States to make decisions about how they use their highway funds. If they think they are servicing their public better by permitting them to invest in intercity rail, then, by golly, we ought to let them do it. It is better for the highway people. Those who advocate investing more in highways, how about getting more cars off the roads? Doesn't that help the highway people? Doesn't that help clear up congestion? I think so. 
   I understand the jurisdictional dispute. I am on the Environment and Public Works Committee, and I greatly respect the chairman. He was very clear in what he said. He does not oppose the idea, but he opposes the idea of doing it here. 
   It is here, and it is now, I say to the Senator, and we have to take the opportunity as it exists. I hope my colleagues will support this. 
   I yield whatever time remains back to the Senator from Ohio. How much time remains, Mr. President?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the one thing we can always count on from Senator BYRD is to throw in some good, sensible reflection as we go on battering one another, at times over sometimes important things but sometimes not so important. There is a commercial about one of the brokerage firms, that when that firm speaks, everybody listens. When Senator BYRD  speaks, everybody should listen. We have a collection of his papers on the Senate, but he has done so many other things. Just think of the voice, but look at the message, and you capture the essence of Senator BYRD. I am going to miss him terribly when I leave here.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to talk about this Allard amendment because it gives an appearance of reserving $12.2 billion for deficit reduction. I support that goal, and I am not going to oppose this amendment. But I really want to make it clear that, as a practical matter, this amendment has no meaning. Nobody should fool themselves into believing otherwise. 
   The current budget rules already protect budget surpluses by establishing limits on discretionary spending and by requiring offsets for all new mandatory spending or tax cuts. These rules require across-the-board cuts if Congress raids any surplus by exceeding the spending caps or by violating the so-called pay-as-you-go rules. So this amendment doesn't add any new protections to those already in law, nor does it change the provisions in current law that require all surpluses to be used to reduce our public debt. 
   The amendment claims to promote debt reduction by depositing $12.2 billion into a trust fund that generally is used for receipts of gifts from foreign countries, the proceeds of which are automatically dedicated to debt reduction. 
   Well, that sounds good. I don't think it is going to do any harm. But it doesn't change anything, realistically. It is an intragovernmental transfer, taking from one end of the Government and giving it to another. It doesn't affect the bottom line, and it doesn't add any protections that don't already exist. 
   I point out, also, that we are on a course to reduce publicly held debt by a lot more than $12.2 billion this year. Under the budget resolution, all of the roughly $150 billion Social Security surplus, and more than $12 billion of the non-Social Security surplus, is already devoted to debt reduction. So there is roughly a $160 billion reserve for debt reduction already. 
   The Congressional Budget Office is expected to add another $30 billion to $40 billion in their re-estimate to that total within the next few weeks. So while we are on track to reduce the debt by potentially $200 billion this year, including perhaps $50 billion from the non-Social Security surplus, this amendment stands for the bold proposition that we should commit at least $12.2 billion for debt reduction. Again, it is likely that we are going to have a $200 billion debt reduction this year. So I don't understand, and I am not quite sure why we are doing this or why we have to define $12.2 billion as directed to debt reduction. 
   In sum, the amendment claims it is going to reduce debt by a lot less than we are already on track to reduce, and it doesn't have any practical effect. Perhaps it will make some folks feel good, and I am not going to object to its adoption; but this is an exercise that is unnecessary and doesn't accomplish really anything. But we are all in the process of saluting debt reduction, and this is just another salute, I guess. 
   I yield the floor. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to support the Gorton-Feinstein motion to instruct. This states that the House CAFE freeze rider ought not to be accepted by the Senate in conference. 
   When CAFE standards were first passed in the late 1970s, light trucks made up only 20 percent of the market. Back then, light trucks were used mainly for hauling. They did not often travel through congested urban and suburban areas. But all that has changed. 
   Today, light trucks--the category that includes SUVs and minivans--represent half of all vehicles sold. They produce 47 percent more global warming pollution than do cars. Each light truck goes through an average of 702 gallons of gas per year. That compares to 492 gallons per year for cars. Goodness knows what is happening now as we look at these prices, recognizing that our consumption of fuel is way above what it had been, importing more from what at times are very unfriendly sources. We are just on a consumption kick that is affecting our way of life but particularly our environment. I will talk more about that in a minute. 
   Even with the tremendous increase in the number of SUVs, the Senate continues to accept the House's CAFE freeze rider. 
   By the way, just as a note of explanation, CAFE refers to the gas consumed and the emissions by the vehicles about which we are talking. We are talking about CAFE standards; that is, to try to have the amount of fuel consumed reduced and to try to reduce the emissions that are affecting our environment and the quality of our air. 
   The result of the House's CAFE freeze has meant serious consequences for American families' pocketbooks, jobs, and the environment. There is a myth floating around that CAFE standards hurt the American family. The truth is, sensible CAFE standards helps our families. It is a simple concept. If your car or your SUV uses less gas, you save money and you do less harm to the environment in which your families live. Between 1975 and 1980, when the fuel economy of cars doubled, consumers with fuel-efficient cars saved $3,000 over the lifetime of the car. That translated into $30 billion of savings in America for families to spend on items other than gas. 
   Jobs are also an important part of this discussion. The opposition keeps insisting that CAFE standards are going to hurt employment, particularly in the auto industry. A study by the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy says that money saved at the gas pump and reinvested throughout the economy would create a quarter of a million jobs, 244,000 in this country, including 47,000 in the auto industry. 
   Another benefit of CAFE standards is in fighting the most daunting environmental challenge of our time: global warming. Passenger cars, SUVs, and light trucks accounted for 18 percent of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 1998. It is a major contributor to the problem of global warming. A recent National Academy of Sciences study finds that global warming trends are undoubtedly real. In December, a British Meteorological Office study said that 1999 was the fifth warmest year on record and that 7 of the hottest 10 years on record occurred in the 1990s. That tells us something. It tells us we ought to get our heads out of the sand and do something about it. That 10 years in the 1990s was the hottest decade of the millennium, also this winter. 
   I traveled to the South Pole in January because I wanted to see what we were doing about trying to protect ourselves against negative environmental change. When you see this beautiful ice continent and recognize the contribution it makes to the entire global environment and you hear the water rushing off as the ice melts--a condition that is not supposed to exist; it is supposed to stay hard ice; 70 percent of the world's fresh water supply is stored in the ice there--it is a very bad sign. 
   If we look at our families and our world, we say: What is happening? If that continues to mix with the saline, it is a terrible and ominous sign to which we should pay attention. 
   In Australia, a continent thousands of miles away from Antarctica, the Australians pride themselves in recreational water sports, things of that nature. Children going to the beach in Australia today have to wear hats. They have to wear full-body bathing suits because of the high incidence of skin cancer. Australia today has the highest incidence of skin cancer of any advanced country in the world. It is a terrible tragedy; it has such grim warnings attached to that. 
   We still are not paying proper attention. This winter, two gigantic icebergs, collectively about two-thirds the size of New Jersey--one the size of  Rhode Island and another the size of 
   Delaware--broke off from Antarctica. One day we are going to see an iceberg the size of the State of Texas. Then everybody is going to say: Woe be unto us. Why didn't we pay attention when our environment was deteriorating literally in front of our eyes? Why didn't we pay attention when it was predicted that water levels would rise, that temperatures would rise, that a place like New York City could almost have tropical type weather? 
   We just saw that in a report the other day. When are we going to pay attention to the alarm we hear sounding off day after day? We choose to ignore that threat and say: Go on, spend it, use those big vehicles and burn as much gas as you want and issue as much contamination as you want. It is our problem, and it is our responsibility. 
   Scientists project a rise in sea level of 4 to 12 inches on the mid-Atlantic coast in the next 30 years--not 100 years, not 50 years, 30 years away. My little grandchildren who were in the gallery today will be 35 years of age. That is hardly old. That is when it looks as if we will be experiencing the worst of what ignoring the consequences of this process will mean. 
   Scientists also tell us higher seas will lead to greater storm surges, more coastal damage, even from relatively modest storms. 
   CAFE is essential for fighting this danger. A recent analysis shows that CAFE standards could be raised to over 40 miles per gallon for new cars and light trucks by 2010. This would result in emissions reductions of 396 million metric tons of carbon dioxide below business-as-usual projections, which is 6 percent of our current emissions. 
   I don't like to get into those kinds of astronomical figures because they don't always mean much. When we think of 396 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, that is a lot. But when we think of the poor air quality days, where it is hard for those who are elderly to go out and conduct normal travel and normal exercise, normal living, it makes it difficult for them to breathe and be as active as they like. We have few other opportunities for attacking global warming as dramatically and as cost-effectively as controlling auto fuel efficiency. 
   I urge my colleagues to think about this problem, to be able to say to their constituents: Yes, we are concerned. We want you to have the comfort. We want you to be able to have the cars you prefer to drive. You are spending your hard-earned money. But let's make them as efficient as we can. 
   It is something our geniuses in the automobile industry--and they are geniuses; they have built an incredible population of vehicles and conveniences--can make better. We have seen all kinds of samples of that. If we encourage them and know that everybody is going to be in the same competitive bind or competitive environment, they will do it. 
   I ask our colleagues to vote in favor of the Gorton-Feinstein motion. We have few other opportunities for attacking global warming as dramatically and as cost-efficiently as controlling auto fuel efficiency. 
   I will take a minute more, and I ask that my colleague from Louisiana be just a little more patient. I beat her to the microphone. That is what happens. It wasn't a foot race, but it was just a coincidence of circumstances. 
   Since I have been in the Senate 18 years, many wonderful things have happened. I have seen the benefit of things we have done legislatively have an impact on folks back home. Whether it is no smoking in airplanes or mentoring programs or drug control programs in public housing or computers in schools--I come out of the computer industry--all have a direct effect. 
   The health programs we have and the education programs have been terrific. Today, I was personally rewarded by an expression of friendship and appreciation, led by Senator SHELBY from Alabama. He is my colleague, a Republican. He used to be a Democrat. We are still friends, even though his party affiliation changed. He did something today that both shocked and humbled me. He asked that a new facility being built in New Jersey, a railroad terminal, a railroad station, where all of the railroads in New Jersey--and we have a lot of rail passenger lines--come together so that people can choose an option for going to New York City or for going to Newark Airport or for going to the beach for recreation or commuting between cities in New Jersey--he asked it be named for me, and I am, indeed, grateful. I was surprised, nevertheless flattered. 
   Comments by Senator BYRD and Senators JOHN KERRY, CHRIS DODD, BARBARA MIKULSKI, and TOM DASCHLE were all laudatory. I was pleased to have two of my children and grandchildren in the balcony. It was a coincidence because they live a distance away, in the State of Florida. They were here to see their grandfather. One of my grandchildren, who is 5 years old, said, ``Are they doing anything down there?'' I said, ``Perhaps you would not notice it, but they are.'' So they were here to see it. It was a happy moment for me and my family. I am grateful to my colleagues who voted for it. There was no objection when it was offered. 
   While I will miss this place, I will leave it with so many fond memories of opportunities to serve that are rewarded in much more specific ways than having a naming process attached to it. No one has ever exemplified that more thoroughly and more deeply than has Senator ROBERT BYRD, who sits in the Chamber at this moment, who is always talking about the nobility of the service we perform here, about the opportunity we have to give something back, showing our appreciation for being in this country, for being in this democracy, for being able to be in the position that we are to do the things we do. 
   So I am grateful. With that, I know I will make the Senator from Louisiana grateful by yielding the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this bill includes a critical measure to make .08 the national drunk driving standard. 
   Chairman SHELBY and I both care deeply about improving transportation  across this country, but we also share a commitment to making sure our transportation systems are as safe as possible. One of the most important things we can do to keep our families safe on our nation's roads is to keep drunk drivers off those roads. 
   Mr. President, the Senate already voted in favor of the .08 standard in 1998. The Senate overwhelming passed the Lautenberg-DeWine .08 amendment to TEA-21 by a vote of 62-32. 
   But, ultimately, the American public did not get the safety legislation that they deserved when a national .08 standard was not included in the final TEA-21 conference report that was sent to the President. 
   The TEA-21 conference report removed the Senate-passed .08 standard and replaced it with an incentive grant program, that, while well intentioned, frankly is not working. Only two states have passed .08 BAC since TEA-21 was enacted two years ago and it seems very unlikely that any other state will be motivated by the incentive grants over the next few years. 
   Mr. President, we have learned with other effective drunk driving legislation such as the minimum 21 drinking age and zero tolerance that weak incentive programs do not work--but national standards do. 
   I would assure my colleagues that the .08 provisions in this bill today do not alter the TEA-21 incentive grant program. So if your state is receiving incentive grant funds, you will continue to receive every cent you are entitled to under the current program. 
   For over a decade--in both Republican and Democratic Administrations, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has been telling Congress that the .08 standard is the best way to ensure safety on our roads and lower the number of fatalities which result from drunk driving. 
   In fact, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that a national .08 standard will save approximately 500 lives per year. 
   Make no mistake--drivers at .08 are drunk and should not be on the road. According to NHTSA, at .08, drivers are impaired in their ability to steer, brake, change lanes, use good judgment and focus their attention. 
   Their ability to perform these critical tasks may decrease by as much as 60 percent. 
   We must keep these drivers off the road in order to keep our families safe. 
   I am grateful to my colleagues for including the .08 provisions in this bill today. Now we look to the House of Representatives to follow our lead and work with us to produce a conference report that retains this critical safety legislation. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce S. 2749, the World War II Memorial Postage Stamp Act. The purpose of this bill is to raise funds for the construction of the National World War II Memorial by issuing a special World War II Memorial ``semipostal'' stamp. 
   Mr. President, many events have shaped world history, but none so dramatically or so deeply as the Second World War. The war permanently altered lives, communities, and nations, at the same time speeding America's rise as a superpower. 
   The National World War II Memorial will honor the 16 million Americans who served in uniform during the war, the more than 400,000 who gave their lives, and the millions more who supported the war effort at home. A symbol of the defining event of 20th-century America, the Memorial will honor the spirit, sacrifice, and commitment of the American people as well as the cause of freedoom from tyranny throughout the world. 
   To date, the World War II Memorial Fund, chaired by Bob Dole, has raised approximately $92 million. Issuing a World War II Memorial Stamp could raise millions more, helping the World War Memorial Fund reach its goal of $100 million needed to construct and maintain the Memorial. Furthermore, a new stamp would give every American the chance to play a part in building this monument to those who served our Nation. 
   Mr. President, I served this great country as a member of the Armed Forces during World War II, and I know firsthand the sacrifices made by our Nation's veterans. It is my sincere hope that, thanks to this bill, the National World War II Memorial will be a lasting symbol of American unity--and a timeless reminder of the moral strength that joins the citizens of this country.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution on an important human rights issue in the Russian Federation: freedom of the press. This resolution was introduced in the House yesterday by Congressmen GILMAN and LANTOS and Helsinki Commission Chairman CHRIS SMITH, who share my concern for human rights around the globe. 
   This resolution expresses the concern of the Congress over the treatment of the Russian media by the government of Russia. This treatment has included increased intimidation, manipulation, and scare tactics. Most recently, Vladimir Gusinsky, owner of the principal independent television station in Russia, was arrested and the offices of Media Most were searched without due process. 
   The media in Russia, even today, is still mostly state-owned. Of the large printing and publishing houses, newspaper distribution companies, nationwide television frequencies, and the broadcasting facilities that have been privatized at all, the government still maintains an interest and some measure of control over many of them. Such control has reportedly been used for political ends in recent parliamentary and presidential elections in Russia. 
   It is imperative for the future of democracy in Russia to maintain a free and independent media. A free press is essential to achieving stability in Russia and a government that is accountable to the rule of law. Such manipulation and intimidation tactics that have been employed by the Russian Government in recent weeks contradict the democratic values that we hope Russia will embrace. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this resolution to express our support for press freedom in Russia and our concern over its infringement.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. Mr. President, first, Senator SHELBY, with whom I have worked a number of years on more than one committee, has established a working relationship that, frankly, I treasure as one of the best I have had since I have been in the Senate. We rarely agree on policy differences, but one thing we do agree on is that we have respect for one another. We listen and try to resolve our differences. 
   As everyone knows, the way we finally resolve differences is the majority says this is what we are going to do, I concur, and we go ahead and do it. 
   It has been a pleasure working with Senator SHELBY and members of the subcommittee over these past few years. This is my last Transportation appropriations bill. I look forward to reaching agreement among our colleagues and sending the bill to the House, resolving whatever differences there might be, and the President signing it into law while there is still time before we have an omnibus appropriations bill before us. 
   This is a decent bill. It was reported out of the Appropriations Committee yesterday by a unanimous vote. I thank Senator SHELBY for his leadership and skill in maneuvering around the number of obstacles that invariably come up and still not have people angry or unwilling to discuss their issues. 
   During yesterday's markup, a number of amendments were adopted that I believe improve our initial subcommittee product. I, therefore, rise in strong support of the bill and encourage my colleagues to support it as well. Everybody is not going to get what they want in the bill. Senator SHELBY does not even though he is the chairman. I am the ranking member and I do not get what I want, for sure. I would have permitted Senator SHELBY to be even more generous than he has been. That is his choice. He treated me and the members of the committee fairly. 
   Over the last 14 years, I do not believe I have ever managed this bill without expressing the importance of balancing how we address the Nation's transportation needs, and that is to look at all modes. We cannot be attentive to highways without being attentive to transit, by way of example. It is not enough to look out for the marine safety agenda and the Coast Guard; we also have to pay attention to the aviation safety needs of the FAA. We must recognize that while some States are wholly dependent on highways and rural aviation to meet their transportation needs, other States depend heavily on commuter rail and Amtrak to move their citizens. A balanced approach is what is needed, and I believe the bill before us embodies that balance. 
   This bill fully funds the growth in highway and transit funding we called for in TEA-21, the highway bill that was enacted a couple of years ago. The bill also fully funds the request for Amtrak's core capital grant. While the funding levels for certain accounts in the FAA and Coast Guard might appear to be austere, a more indepth review of the bill before us and prior actions by the Senate sheds some further light on this situation. 
   Specifically, the bill before us would cut the Coast Guard by $257 million. However, it is important to note that only a few weeks ago the Senate passed a supplemental appropriation of over $800 million for the Coast Guard, and all of that supplemental funding will be available on a multiyear basis. 
   That is one of the anomalies: We give an agency such as the Coast Guard ever more responsibilities, whether it is just doing the navigation assists, the buoys, and the charts, or whether it is stopping illegal immigration, or whether it is pursuing drug transport by boat, or whether it is managing the licensing of vessels that ply our waters making sure they stay up to date and do not violate the standards that are required for ships entering our waters. They are now putting .50-caliber guns, and some larger, on helicopters in the Coast Guard to intercept or interrupt the drug flow that is devastating our country. 
   Whatever you need, the Coast Guard is always there. We are always squeezing and squeezing, but this year we have figured out a way to take care of it. There is no one who does not respect the Coast Guard for the job they do and looks to them when an emergency arises. Whether there is an oilspill or some other disaster that includes travel on the seas, the Coast Guard is there. 
   In the case of the FAA's operations account, it appears we reduced the administration's request by more than $240 million. It is important to note that within the appropriations for the FAA's facilities and equipment account, the bill includes $64 million for operating expenses. That shortage we talked about, again, was the operations account. 
   Moreover, as a result of an amendment I offered during the full committee markup, there is now an additional $120 million available for operating expenses from the $3.2 billion appropriations for airport grants.  
   I want to clarify what I am discussing. I am talking about putting in over $3 billion in airport grants, airport improvements, be it terminals or access routes in and out. There are all kinds of things for which the airports can use these funds so they can handle the expanding need for passengers who want to take airplanes. I support it 100 percent. We cannot continue to expand a facility without having enough of a crew--I will use the term--to manage it. One would never dream of taking a ship that needs a 1,000-person crew and saying: OK, we are going to put in new electronics, but we are going to cut down on the size of the crew. We would never understand it nor agree to it. 
   The changes we have made enable this bill to provide a $634 million, or 11-percent, increase for FAA operations. Nobody wants to be up in the sky with too few controllers guiding the traffic as they do. 
   I fly a lot in the second seat in airplanes. That is the way I prefer to travel. I know when the controllers are stressed or when the flight service stations are not giving the data needed or when it delays departures or takeoffs. We want to ensure safety, above all. When we put our families in an airplane, whether it is a flight from New York to Washington or whether it is a cross-country flight, we want to know they are traveling in as safe a condition as possible. 
   Our aviation system is safe. I point that out. 
   But when it is not operating as it should, it comes out in delays. It is akin to borrowing to pay your bills. The longer it takes to get a flight started, the worse things become later on. We know that whether it is a flight from New York to Washington, to use that example, or if it is a flight from Denver to Los Angeles; what happens on that leg from New York to Washington affects what happens on the leg from Denver to L.A. That is the nature of the system. It is a huge system. It is all interconnected. We have to have enough people in the key spots to take care of things. 
   There are several other items of importance in this bill that I think bear mentioning at this time. 
   I thank my subcommittee chairman, Senator SHELBY, for including provisions in the bill to implement a national drunk driving standard of .08 blood alcohol content. This provision passed the Senate in 1998 by an overwhelming margin. However, the House never had an opportunity to vote on the measure. 
   The administration still strongly supports implementation of .08 as the national standard for blood alcohol content. It has been said by several institutions that have studied this problem that by reducing the standard across the country from .10--that is parts per million of alcohol to blood--we could save 500 to 700 lives a year. It does not sound like much in the abstract--500 to 700 lives a year--but if it is a child in your household or a family member in your neighborhood or a friend, the effects are devastating. 
   I remember one time I had a discussion with the occupant of the Chair about a friend of his son's who was badly injured in an automobile accident. The pain that permeates a community is unmatched. Thank goodness we are focused on what happens with our children. Whenever we have a chance to do something to protect them, we do it--protecting any member of a family. 
   So when we ask now for .08 to be the standard, we are saying to 500 to 700 families, who will never know they have been protected from disaster, that it was because we demanded a better standard for automobile safety. 
   This provision works in the same way as the minimum drinking age law which I authored back in 1984, signed into law by President Reagan, and assisted by Secretary Elizabeth Dole at the time. To this point in time, it is estimated that the minimum drinking age law saves over 1,000 lives a year. Over 15,000 families have been spared mourning over the loss of a child because this applies almost exclusively to very young people. 
   The .08 provision holds the promise of saving the lines of an additional 500 persons every year. So I thank Senator SHELBY again for including this provision in the bill. 
   The Members should be aware there is a separate provision in this bill that prohibits the administration from implementing its newly proposed ``hours of service'' regulations pertaining to truck and bus drivers. Many interested groups have voiced strong opposition to the administration's proposed rule. I personally oppose certain aspects of it, as well. However, I have concerns with the remedy that is proposed in the bill. 
   The administration has already shown renewed willingness to reconsider aspects of this rule by extending the comment period on their proposal by 90 days. So it gives those who have views about what this bill should look like or the conditions it should carry an extra 90 days to present those views, and then perhaps we will take the subject up again. I note that this 
   prohibition is not included on the House side, so it is something that may come up in the conference. 
   I hope that before we go to conference, all concerned Members can discuss this issue in the time that is available with Secretary Slater, to discuss this issue and advance the cause of safety on our highways. 
   Finally, I thank all the members of the Transportation Subcommittee for their friendship and assistance throughout the process. I am not talking exclusively about the Democrats. We worked with Republicans. Sometimes there are disagreements in policy that can't be bridged, but we talk about it, and we try to iron out the problems and see if we can accommodate, by consensus, the bill. We have again delivered a unanimously supported bill to the floor. 
   I especially thank Senator SHELBY again. His leadership of the subcommittee has been excellent. He has always kept me, the minority ranking member, informed of his plans for the subcommittee. He has been evenhanded in his approach to addressing Members' funding priorities. We have developed a good friendship throughout this process. 
   I want to say, while the chairman of the full Appropriations Committee is here, that I thank him, as well, for his willingness to listen. Too much listening often kills the time that a chairman can get his bill through, but Senator STEVENS held his patience, his temper, and he permitted us to air our views, and we got the bill done in very good form. 
   I also extend my thanks to Senator ROBERT C. BYRD, who is the ranking member on the Appropriations Committee. I have worked with him since my first day in the Senate. He is a brilliant, patient man and has been a leader for me, a mentor for me. Even with all this white hair, we still can have mentors and enjoy a relationship. We can still learn. I have found that out. My kids teach me that every day. But the relationship between Senator STEVENS and Senator BYRD is excellent, as we have always seen in this Appropriations Committee. 
   I also give a special thanks to my team, to Peter Rogoff, who so skillfully manages the staff on our side, Denise Matthews, Laurie Saroff, and Mitch Warren on the Democratic side. And to Wally Burnett; he always knows what side of the aisle he works for and makes sure he is diligent about it, but he makes certain that our messages get through and that they do have a hearing before the bill gets put to bed. I appreciate Wally's leadership, and Joyce Rose and Paul Doerrer, as well. 
   With that, if there are any amendments Members want to bring to the floor, they ought to do that. This bill was moved expeditiously, carefully through the process. It is here. So we can eliminate much of the griping and complaining about having bills linger on forever and winding up--in the final analysis, before the October 1 fiscal year starts, the new year--in an omnibus bill, where a bunch of things are crashed together, without having a good, comfortable feeling about what is in the bill: How does it affect my State? How does it affect the country? If you get it the last minute, you do not have a chance to review those things. 
   Here we have a bill that has been carefully engineered and is ready to go. We would like to get it done. If I asked the chairman of the Appropriations Committee when he would like to get it done, he would say certainly this afternoon. But we will be taking amendments. That is the process. Hopefully, we can get it over to the conference committee and maybe have this bill signed into law by the time the next break comes at the end of June.  
   With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my pal from Maryland. We have been good friends. Senator MIKULSKI said something that got my attention. She said she has looked up to me. We have differences in height in a lot of places, but no one has ever looked down to Senator MIKULSKI. She is a giant. What a welcome addition she was when she first graced the Democratic Party with her presence, followed by nine others. 
   What a difference women have made in this body--not just cleaning up the language, which helped, but also in making sure that we understood there was a far different point of view on many issues. As Senator MIKULSKI so clearly said and has always said, she listened. We can steal a couple of things from commercials to say that when Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI speaks, people listen. The Members here listen. 
   We share a common background in many ways. We both have Polish roots. Second, we both have what I call an ordinary person's background; she in the bakery, and me in the newspaper store with our families trying to eke out a living each and every day. 
   One of the things that I thought we ought to do here, although probably would not get enough votes to carry, is every Senator ought to spend a week in poverty living with a family in either an urban our rural environment to kind of get a feeling for what it is to worry about putting food on the table, about putting decent clothing on a child's back, not stylish things but decent clothing, a roof over their heads, a grandparent or a parent aging and needing help. What a difference. 
   Senator MIKULSKI brought that background, as I hope I did to our function here. That is why we have a special kinship because we care about the people we serve. 
   One of the happiest moments I have had since I have been in the Senate was the other day. I went to visit a school for the blind in New Jersey, the only one that operates in New Jersey. It is run by the Sisters of Joseph of Peace. With help from colleagues on the Appropriations Committee and throughout the Senate, I was able to get some funding so they could build a relatively modest facility. They named a room after me in an ``Independent Life Section'' where they try to educate people on how to live by themselves, though visually impaired and sometimes in total blindness. How do you get by? 
   I came in and there was a little child. I have a weakness for little kids because my oldest grandchild is 6. I have seven, six following him, and No. 8 is going to be on the way before No. 1 turns 7. They are a beautiful litter of puppy dogs. They are so cute I can only smile when I think about them. 
   This little child was 7. She was smaller in stature because her mother was an alcoholic, and she has fetal alcohol syndrome, which reduces size, in effect, and physical and mental health. This child was as bright as any child I have ever met. I picked her up, she said: What's your name? 
   I said: Frank. 
   She said: OK, Frank. 
   She rubbed her hands through my hair. She said: It feels sticky. I said: Yes, I put stuff on my hair. She asked: What kind of stuff? I wasn't doing advertising so I didn't give her the name. 
   Her vision is impaired with similar to a mesh screen in front of her eyes. The only way she can focus her vision is turning her head. Her vision is like Swiss cheese; she had to constantly turn her head to catch the channel through which she could see. 
   She was so bright. We wound up with a picture of her and me in the paper, me laughing, with her hands running through my hair. 
   If there is ever a doubt about the work we do here, about what it is we debate so harshly at times, the things we legislate, the laws we write, about the ultimate test of whether or not we have done the right thing, how does it affect people? What is the impact on a family? What is the impact on a child?  What is the impact of a loss due to a drunk driver in a family? What is the loss when a child 6 years old takes a gun and kills another 6-year-old? What is the impact? It is not only that family; it is the entire community, the entire school. What affect did Columbine have? Was it only the kids who were shot at, the kids who were pleading for help from the police? The kids who were running away in fear? No, it was the entire character of our country. 
   We have to think about those things and their impact. Are these a question of States rights, of rights other than the rights to bring up a child in safety? What is the most important right? 
   What was the Million Mom March about? The million moms marched because they were so hurt, so anguished that no one was listening sufficiently to say, OK, sensible gun control. We weren't taking away everybody's gun. If people want to hunt, they have a right to hunt. People need them for law enforcement jobs. Or if someone really thinks they need it for protection, let them get a license and be identified. A million moms were down here to say: Please help us. 
   That is the measure. That is what I have always found from Senator MIKULSKI, who manages this very important bill, VA-HUD, that takes care of veterans, housing, the National Science Foundation, and NASA. She does a remarkable job and we keep squeezing. 
   My relationship with Senator MIKULSKI, my relationship with other dear friends in the Senate is what I will miss terribly. This has been one great experience. My desk is a couple rows back. If only my father or my mother could have seen what happens when I open the top of my desk. It says: Harry Truman, Missouri. He sat where I sit now. My parents came here from Ellis Island with not a dime. They didn't understand the language. My parents were brought here as little kids. They wanted to be in America; they wanted to talk English; they wanted to be part of the society. And they worked at it. 
   We are in this illustrious place. As Senator BYRD will state, about 1,800 Members have served in the Senate since the founding of this country. And here we are, two good friends, sharing the same. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I salute the fact that the appropriations chairman is anxious to get this finished. The subcommittee chairman and I are also anxious. 
   But the one thing that concerns me--and I am not going to object to the request that was made--is this: Normally, there is a time lapse for filing the report during which there is time to review the report. Suddenly, we are at a pell-mell pace. I want to get it finished. 
   I think it is fair to Senator SHELBY, myself, and the Appropriations Committee chairman to make sure this doesn't trample on anybody's rights so that Senators have the opportunity to review. We are picking up the pace considerably. Thus far, we have had three bills: MILCON, legislative, and Defense. So we are not in the back of the pack by a long shot. 
   This is a bill in which lots of people have an interest. I want to ensure that our people have a chance to look at the report which was filed today. It won't even be seen until tomorrow. We may have to stretch our tolerance level a little bit to give folks a chance. I don't want to drag my feet. Certainly, the Senator from Alabama knows that. I want to be cooperative, and I want people to respond. 
   It is always a frustrating experience when we bring a bill to the floor when time goes by and people who want to offer amendments don't bring them down. 
   I hope someday there will be reform--it won't be during my tenure--that says if you have amendments, you have to bring them up but that you have every right to examine the documents that relate to a bill before you are crowded out in a stampede. I offer that as a suggestion.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Sustainable Green Manufacturing initiative. This is an important effort to help the Army reduce pollution in its key manufacturing processes by introducing clean technologies and techniques onto production lines. Partners in this initiative include the TACOM Armament Research and Development and Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, the National Defense Center for Environmental Excellence, The New Jersey Institute of Technology, and the Physical Science Laboratory of New Mexico State University. 
   Mr. President the objectives of this initiative include the promotion of sound environmental principles in design, material selection and manufacturing of Army products; the reduction of Army costs throughout the product life-cycle by efficient use of resources; the development of sound and environmentally benign manufacturing practices by using the highest quality science and technology and applying these practices, methods and materials to the acquisition process. The House provide $7 million for this program in its Appropriation Bill and I urge the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE to work during conference to provide this level of funding for this important program.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with Senator INOUYE and Senator STEVENS an important Army research and development effort in nonlinear acoustic landmine detection being done at Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. 
   Mr. President, let me begin my thanking Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE for their leadership last year in working with me to obtain $1 million in funds to initiate this very promising effort, in which engineers at the Stevens Institute of Technology are applying expertise in non-linear acoustic phenomena to develop a new method for detection of mines and other buried man-made objects. The technology can differentiate between rocks, other solid objects, and actual land mines. This will improve landmine removal safety and speed, and contribute to our efforts to save lives and prevent injuries. With an additional $3 million the Stevens Institute can fully land this technology's development, which has so much promise for protecting our military personnel as well as civilian populations. 
   Although the allocation's situation we faced in the Appropriations Committee in considering the DOD Appropriations measure made it very difficult to fund this effort, I look forward to working with Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE in conference to continue this research effort. It is my understanding that the House has included $1.4 million related to this effort, half of which is intended specifically for the research and development at Stevens. But given the great life-saving promise of this technology, I hope to work with Chairman STEVENS and Senator INOUYE in achieving an increase of $3 million for the Stevens Institute of Technology effort. In this regard, I yield to Senator STEVENS for his thoughts on this effort.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss with Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE the situation at the Military Ocean Terminal Bayonne (MOTBY). As the distinguished chairman and ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee recall this military facility was closed as a result of the 1995 round of the BRAC Commission closings resulting in the loss of 3,000 jobs and economic hardship in Bayonne and Hudson County. The environmental and infrastructure problems existing at the base at the time of its closure were enormous and not completely disclosed or maybe not completely known by the Army. 
   I thank Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE for their help in providing $7 million for MOTBY last year for demolition and removal of facilities, buildings and structures. This funding was critical for MOTBY as it struggles to deal with the substantial environmental and infrastructure problems left by the Army when it left the base. But, Mr. President, there is so much left to be done. Among the problems remaining are significant amounts of friable asbestos in dozens of buildings, major leaks in the water and sewer systems, contamination of the land and ground water and piers that are structurally unsafe and in danger of collapsing into the water. 
   Mr. President, $5 million is contained in the House appropriations bill for stabilization of the South Berths at MOTBY. I strongly urge the distinguished chairman and ranking member to uphold the House position of $5 million for the MOTBY South Berths in conference.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the New Jersey Devils for winning the National Hockey League's 2000 Stanley Cup Championship. On Saturday night, the Devils defeated the Dallas Stars 2 to 1 in double overtime to win the finals in six games. This is the second time in five years that the Devils have hoisted Lord Stanley's trophy above their heads. 
   The Devils are what New Jersey pride is all about. Their heart, stamina, and drive have endeared them to millions of fans and have made them a permanent part of New Jersey's culture. Team members, who hail from all over the globe, also reflect the tremendous diversity of New Jersey's population. One player--Scott Gomez--is the first Hispanic player to compete in the NHL and the league's rookie of the year. The Devils have turned their cultural differences into a source of strength and have proved what is possible when team members work together to achieve a sport's highest honor. 
   Mr. President, apart from their contributions to hockey, the New Jersey  Devils are also outstanding citizens. Defenseman Ken Daneyko, for example, is a leader both on and off the ice. Ken is one of the original Devil players and was an alternate captain. He has played 1,071 games in a Devils uniform and has participated in all 109 Devils playoff games. Ken is also a community leader who owns an Italian restaurant in Caldwell and is an active member of New Jersey's chapter of the national Children's Miracle Network. Indeed, all the team members are proud to play for New Jersey and spend much of their free time giving back to the community. 
   The success of any organization starts at the top. And there is no question that the success the New Jersey Devils have enjoyed would not have been possible without the leadership of two great New Jersey citizens: team chairman John J. McMullen and co-owner John C. Whitehead. John McMullen is one of the NHL's most innovative, committed owners. A graduate of Montclair High School and the Naval Academy, John has been honored many times for his civic contributions. He and John Whitehead, a former U.S. Deputy Secretary of State, brought the team to New Jersey as a service to their home state. 
   Mr. President, the players, coaches and staff with the New Jersey Devils showed outstanding dedication, teamwork and sportsmanship in achieving hockey's highest honor. They are not only the best team in the NHL, they are one of the finest organizations in professional sports.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is an honor to pay tribute to Jynell Harris as she retires after nearly 40 years of continuous and dedicated service to the Vineland School District in my home state of New Jersey. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Harris' achievements extend back to Clayton High School, where she graduated with honors. She later received her B.A. in Elementary Education from Glassboro State College. Ms. Harris began teaching in the Vineland school system in 1963. She taught pre-school children at the Micro-Social Learning Center, served as a Special Education teacher for the mentally handicapped, implemented seminar programs for gifted and talented 7th and 8th graders and led remedial reading and writing classes for 9th and 10th grades at Vineland High School. 
   In addition to her contributions as a teacher, Ms. Harris has served as Grade-Level Chairperson, Teacher-in-Charge of the Gifted and Talented Magnet School and coordinator of the Cumberland County College Summer Youth Program. 
   Ms. Harris has been honored repeatedly for her achievements. Her honors include the 1989 Martin Luther King Academy's Harriet Tubman Award, the 1992 Delsea Regional High School Black Student Association Outstanding Community Service Award and recognition as an outstanding educator by the Zeta Phi Beta Sorority. 
   Ms. Harris also has been effective in the political arena. She coordinated Jesse Jackson's 1988 presidential campaign in Cumberland County and  served as the county's NAACP Education Chairperson. 
   Ms. Harris actively participates in many community organizations and is a member of New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Harris has shown extraordinary dedication to improving her community and clearly deserves recognition on the occasion of her retirement.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I'm very pleased to announce that, after months of very hard work, we have bipartisan legislation which will clean up and redevelop the abandoned industrial sites known as Brownfields--S. 2700, the Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2000. 
   I first introduced Brownfields legislation in the Senate in 1993, in the hopes of both protecting public health, and addressing the problems of blighted areas. Since that time, it has become clear that there are even more reasons to address Brownfields than we originally thought. In fact, there are few environmental issues which cut across so many problems and offer so many solutions. 
   Mr. President, Brownfields threaten the health of our citizens--and the economic health of communities across the country, by leading to abandoned inner cities, increased crime, loss of jobs and declining tax revenues. Brownfields also lead to urban sprawl, loss of farmland, increased traffic and air pollution and loss of historic districts in older urban centers. 
   But once they're cleaned up and made useful again, they also represent tremendous potential in new jobs and a cleaner environment. Now, finally, we have a bipartisan plan to achieve those goals. 
   The legislation we're introducing today provides federal money to investigate and clean up Brownfields sites. State and local governments would use this money to determine which sites pose environmental problems, to decide which redevelopment options hold the greatest promise, and most important, to get these sites cleaned up. 
   Second, the legislation promises important private investments in the cleanup effort--by providing liability protection for people interested in buying and cleaning up these sites and for people who bought a Brownfields site without knowing it was contaminated. It also removes potential liability for parties who own property which becomes contaminated through no fault of their own, from hazardous substances from an adjacent site. These liability limitations and clarifications will help innocent parties and provide incentives to get these properties cleaned up and back into use. 
   Third, this bill does several new and positive things for communities and for the environment. For the first time, it creates a public record of Brownfield sites handled under state programs, because the public has a right to know what's happening at the sites near their homes. And it is the first Brownfields bill to provide funding not just to assist in redevelopment projects, but also to provide assistance to state and local governments to create and preserve open space, parklands and other recreational areas in former Brownfields sites. 
   Finally, the bill gives states incentives and funding to develop state programs to clean up their Brownfield sites quickly and safely. It has provisions to encourage cooperation and coordination between the federal and state governments, both of whom play an active role in cleaning up these sites and protecting the citizens. The bill strikes a delicate balance. It provides deference to state cleanup programs but still ensures that the federal superfund program will be able to come in  and address problems when a site poses a serious problem. 
   The Brownfields cleanup and redevelopment strategy in this legislation is comprehensive. It's fiscally responsible. And it will improve the quality of life for people throughout the country. It promises thousands of new jobs and millions in new tax revenue. It promises increased momentum for smart growth, which means cleaner air 
   and less congested roads. 
   It promises a new focus on revitalizing downtown areas, which will reduce urban sprawl, lower rates and protect parkland and open space. I come from the most densely populated state in this country, and I understand the importance of protecting open space. 
   Mr. President, the nation's mayors estimate that Brownfields cost between $200 million and $500 million a year in lost tax revenues. Returning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new jobs. 
   Just look at the progress we've made even over the last few years. Grants from the EPA to aid in cleaning up Brownfields sites have helped generate more than 5,800 jobs and about $1.8 billion in revenues. In New Jersey alone, we've rescued more than 1,000 Brownfields sites, replacing polluted lagoons with office centers and covering abandoned rail yards with condominium complexes. 
   These successes benefit everyone--both environmentally and economically. Which is why this legislation has strong support from both Democrats and Republicans. 
   Mr. President, in the 1960s, this country turned its attention away from downtown areas and started focusing on the suburbs. We see now what that got us: clogged highways, overcrowded airports, and increased pollution. 
   It's time to turn that trend around. And that's exactly what this legislation will do. I also want to thank my three colleagues for their determination and hard work in hammering out this compromise. Senator SMITH, our new Chairman, has really reached out to all members of the Committee to try to craft good environmental legislation. 
   Senator BAUCUS, the Democratic leader on our Committee, has been a stalwart advocate for a good Superfund program and a compromise Brownfields bill. We have fought many battles together over the years. Finally, Senator CHAFEE has shown great courage and energy, bringing us together to do what was once unthinkable, a Superfund related bill that has bipartisan support. I look forward to working with all of them to ensure that this bill is signed into law. Thank you. Following is a summary of the bill. 
   Brownfields Revitalization and Environmental Restoration Act of 2000 (S. 2700)--Key Provisions 
   Provides critically needed funds to assess and clean up abandoned and underutilized brownfield sites, which will create jobs, increase tax revenues, preserve and create open space and parks; 
   Provides legal protections for innocent parties, such as contiguous property owners, prospective purchasers, and innocent landowners; 
   Provides for funding and enhancement of state cleanup programs, including limits where appropriate on enforcement by the federal government at sites cleaned up under a State response program. Provides a balance of certainty for prospective purchasers, developers and others while ensuring protection of the public health. 
   Creates a public record of brownfield sites and enhances community involvement in site cleanup and reuse. 
   Provides for deferral of listing sites on the National Priorities List if the state is taking action at the site.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor for me to pay tribute to John P. Sputz on the occasion of his retirement from BAE Systems North America. 
   Mr. President, for more than four decades, John has devoted his life to serving this country's defense needs. Under John's leadership, he and I worked together to further the efforts of the Link-16 program. This program, which includes systems that use secure, anti-jam, line-of-sight data radio communications, has moved from the research phase in 1971 to a major Defense Department program in the 1990s. Thanks to John, this program is about to go into service for the Army, Navy and Air Force as well as for our allies in NATO and elsewhere. 
   John was also responsible for developing and expanding programs like the F-22 advanced tactical fighter program, the Joint Striker Fighter Program and the programmable digital radio technologies that will one day replace all legacy radios with cost-effective and flexible communications systems. 
   Mr. President, John's commitment to BAE Systems North America is unsurpassed. Even after retiring, John will continue serving his company as President of MIDSCO, a multi-national joint venture company which helped manage the development of the MIDS Program. I hope the example that John set will inspire BAE Systems North America to achieve even higher goals. I know I speak for everyone who knows John when I thank him for his dedication to our country and wish him the very best in the future.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator LEVIN for the courtesy of being able to speak at this time. I believe very strongly in the issue which is before us. I am in opposition to section 2410 in the military construction appropriations bill, which in the view of most, I think it is fair to say, effectively terminates the U.S. military role in Kosovo. I opposed this amendment when it was offered in committee, and I am proud to join with Senator LEVIN in offering an amendment to strike it here in the full Senate. 
   Last year, the Armed Forces of the U.S., our NATO allies, and other countries, valiantly fought to stop the killing in Kosovo. They ended Slobodan Milosevic's brutal campaign of ethnic cleansing against the Albanians and prevented his genocidal warfare from being carried out to its full extent. 
   Like many of my colleagues, I have made many visits to the area. I watched with admiration and awe when I saw our fliers flying out of Aviano, Italy, to the front in Kosovo. That flight--in a fighter plane there is not much room--typically would take up to 8 or 9 hours to complete. It also needed four to five refuelings in the air to keep that pilot and that equipment going. It was an incredibly well-done campaign. Our pilots' morale and commitment was second to nothing I have ever seen. I served 3 years in World War II, so I have seen war directly before. I remember even then, when everybody was so committed, how sometimes the morale would flag after a period of time. But these pilots would get in those planes almost daily and exhaust themselves in carrying out their missions. They were at high, high risk. 
   Fortunately, with good planning, skilled pilots, skilled crews and ground personnel, we only had one plane go down, and the rescue of that pilot is something that will live in the annals of military history--how they scooped him up in the middle of the night in a carefully planned evacuation. 
   They got him and brought him home safely. When I met him a couple of days later, he wanted to fly again and was ready to go back and do his duty. 
   In Kosovo, we watched hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people being uprooted from their homes--men, women, and children. A few men they would take away. 
   Even before the air campaign, I met a family in Albania where they lifted grandpa up to cross the mountains along with lots of little kids--about five of them--to cross the mountains to try to protect themselves. It was a sad story they related. They got to Albania to their relatives and slept on the floor and thought they were in heaven. 
   This was a genocidal act, if we have ever seen one. It was a brutal massacre involving the worst crimes that one could imagine--mutilation, rape. It was a terrible situation. We were compelled sometimes by our heartstrings more perhaps than our planning to intervene, and to say to the world you can't do that kind of killing while civilized nations exist around the world. We violated that, if we look at Africa. But we had a direct interest there. 
   When we think now of just pulling out--and I will say arbitrarily. I hate to disagree with two very distinguished and good friends in this Senate, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, chairman of the Armed Services Committee--I don't like to argue with him. He is too smart. He has too much knowledge--and the Senator from West Virginia, not in a different category. But I disagree with them on this very important decision that is about to be made. 
   In my view, and in the view of the Senate in the past, the United States and our allies were right to act last year in Operation Allied Force. And we were right to stay in Kosovo to accomplish our goals in Operation Joint Guardian. 
   We won the war. Now we have to ensure that victory by maintaining the peace. 
   Mr. President, the discussion and the debate on this provision since the Appropriations Committee markup has shed considerable light on the Byrd-Warner amendment and its consequences. 
   Most immediately, it ties our military presence in Kosovo to burden-sharing criteria for European reconstruction and humanitarian aid. They are doing it. 
   It has been my belief for a long time that our allies must do more burden-sharing. I talked about it with Japan; I talked about it with Saudi Arabia; I talked about it with South Korea--that there has to be burden sharing by our allies. I believe that the European countries should fulfill their broad commitment to take the lead in the reconstruction of Kosovo, as well as their specific aid pledges. 
   But I don't think threatening to reduce our peacekeeping presence is a constructive way to speed up European aid disbursement. 
   More importantly, I don't think anyone can predict with any certainty that the President will be able to meet the burden-sharing certification requirements by July 15 as this bill requires. July 15, 2000, is not very far away. Administration people--top people at OMB--say it is unlikely that it can be done. They are saying it certainly cannot be done now, and I know some of my colleagues who supported the amendment in the committee had a different understanding about whether or not the certification of the allies meeting their obligation could be done at this time. It can't be. 
   If the Europeans fail to meet even one of the yardsticks, U.S. funds for military operations could only be used to withdraw U.S. forces. 
   This provision could force U.S. troops to withdraw from Kosovo 
   this July, 2 months from now. I think even some of the sponsors of the measure would consider this highly undesirable. 
   But let us suppose the Europeans do indeed fulfill their aid pledges as is required, after the first phase, which is July of this year, 2000. What happens then? 
   Section 2410 in this bill is quite clear on this point: Unless the President gets explicit congressional authorization in the form of a joint resolution, the next President will have to pull our troops out of the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo by July of next year at the latest. 
   Just a reminder: The Second World War ended in August of 1945. We had troops stationed in Germany and Japan. We still have troops stationed in Europe and Japan as a result of that war. After more than 50 years, we still have troops there. We still have troops in South Korea as a result of that war. Why? Because we have determined we are better off keeping the peace than fighting another war. 
   I believe that is the attitude that ought to dominate. We were never asked permission to keep those troops there. Two-hundred thousand Americans have been stationed around the world--in Japan and Germany, in the Pacific and European theaters. We were never asked if it was OK to continue. It is automatically thrown into the budget. Why, I ask, isn't that question raised? Why doesn't someone say, hey, if the burden-sharing falls behind--mind you, there was a time when it was way behind, and I fought very hard to get that up to date--why don't we write legislation that would say, should one of those countries--Japan, South Korea, or Germany--fall behind in fulfilling their share of the burden, pull our troops out arbitrarily? Just pull them out. One would never dare think of that. 
   It has been 9 years since we concluded the war in the Persian Gulf. We have 9,000 troops stationed there in harm's way. We have lost a bunch of our people during the last 2 years because of an attack on a barracks. But we still have 9,000 people there monitoring the no-fly zones and making sure we have reserve troops to move in in case Iraq gets frisky and attacks again. I do not hear anybody saying, OK, look, done with; let's get out of there. The reason we don't do it is common sense. It is military sense. It is foreign policy sense. 
   We are leaders because of the actions we take. That is the position America is in. This debate, I think, is a real tough one because there are two very popular Senators who are offering this amendment. I know they don't want to win this battle based on their popularity, I am sure, but the fact of the matter is this is a very important policy decision. Proponents of this measure argue that they are upholding the  role of the Congress in deciding when and where to send our troops into harm's way. 
   I just gave you a list of some places where we have troops. We all know that South Korea is on the border with North Korea, and our troops could very easily be in harm's way. 
   The President asked Congress to support his decision for U.S. Armed Forces to participate in the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia. Unlike the House, the Senate, on March 23, 1999, on the eve of the first air strikes, adopted Senate Concurrent Resolution 21 authorizing U.S. participation in the NATO air campaign. 
   The issue now is not authorization for offensive military action but continued deployment of U.S. troops in a peacekeeping mission that is carried out with our NATO allies and other nations. 
   Congress has in the past used the constitutional power of the purse to support or to end U.S. participation in peacekeeping missions. For example, in 1993, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the Senator from West Virginia to cut off funding for the U.S. participation in peacekeeping operations in Somalia after the tragic death of U.S. marines. 
   The Congress has never passed a joint resolution authorizing deployment of U.S. troops in a peacekeeping mission and has never before required the President to seek one. 
   In fact, Congress has generally supported U.S. deployments abroad by providing funding. In my view, that is what we should do right now for Operation Joint Guardian in Kosovo. 
   Historically, when our armed forces have prevailed in war, we have counted on our armed forces to remain deployed to consolidate our victory, to keep the hard won peace, to ensure that our values of democracy and human rights are respected. 
   The distinguished Senator from Virginia knows that. He was in the military for some time. He headed one of our most important divisions of the military. He knows after a conflict is over, we don't just walk away, pack up our bags, fold the tent, and go home. That is impossible. 
   Remember, this whole military engagement started late because we couldn't get agreement among our NATO allies. It was in March of last year, just over a year ago. We are being asked to continue this operation. We ought not put strings on it that impair the ability of the President to make decisions. 
   After more than half a century, in the war in which I was honored to serve, we still have the troops in Europe. I haven't heard my colleagues demanding we withdraw from those situations unless explicitly authorized by a joint resolution in the Congress. In fact, in all of my years in this body, I have never been asked to authorize the deployment of United States forces in Germany, Japan, Korea, or many other places, other than by authorizing and appropriating funds to continue those deployments. 
   The alternative in this bill would not really leave it to the next President to decide whether to continue the deployment of U.S. troops in Kosovo, as the sponsors have asserted. Rather, section 2410 requires that the pullout by July 1, 2001, essentially be a done deal during President Clinton's term of office. 
   Do we want to do that? I have a short term remaining, and I share the same schedule as the President. I am out of office in just a few months. To say that my successor ought to do exactly what I have done, Heaven forbid, we would never consider that. Do we want to tie the hands of the next President of the United States? We don't even know which party that President will come from. 
   Under section 2410, this President, President Clinton, must ``develop a plan, in consultation with appropriate foreign governments, by which NATO member countries, with the exception of the United States, and appropriate non-NATO countries, will provide, not later than July 1, 2001, any and all ground combat troops necessary to execute Operation Joint Guardian or any successor operation in Kosovo.'' 
   This President, President Clinton, must submit ``an interim plan for the achievement of the plan's objectives'' to Congress by September 30, 2000. That means President Clinton has to plan for a pullout and prevail upon our allies to pick up the slack within the next few months. 
   I am not trying to protect President Clinton's initiatives. I am trying to protect the President's initiative, whoever that President may be. Whether it is AL GORE or George W. Bush, our next President would have to reverse course to fulfill our small share of the burden to keep the peace in Kosovo, to keep the soldiers, the brutes from attacking the men and women. By the way, that could be from the Albanians to the Serbs, or the Serbs to the Albanians. 
   Kosovo is a tinderbox. In my view, this part of the bill puts a fuse on that tinderbox. If we pass it, we will light that fuse. 
   I hope my colleagues now understand the issue posed by section 2410 of this bill. 
   It is not about burden-sharing. We don't need to threaten to 
   pull our troops out to make a point that the Europeans need to fulfill their commitments to take a lead in the reconstruction effort. 
   This is not about the prerogatives of Congress. We can exercise our rights by providing or denying funds to continue to deploy. We have every right to do that. 
   This is not about presenting the next President with a decision on a national security issue, since it would instead present the next President with a fait accompli, a done deal. 
   The issue now before the Senate is whether to force the President, this President, to withdraw U.S. troops from Kosovo in this year, or at the latest by July of 2001, hoping our allies will go on without us. If they fail to, are we ready to bring those pilots back and assemble our armada, when we could avoid that? It is a mission that carries some danger, there is no doubt about it. Our brave men and women are there to do that. They are well trained and ready to take on the obligation. 
   The issue we are deciding in the Senate is about policy and about making policy. What we do is immediately strap the hands of the President and the military leaders in our country, a pretty bright group. We strap their hands behind their backs and say: Sorry, we've decided to subject this to a perhaps appropriate political or power discussion. 
   The policy now codified in this bill is against the national security interests of the United States. 
   Why should we support the continued deployment of U.S. forces in the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo? Let me give you some reasons. 
   First, leadership. U.S. leadership in Europe and around the world does not just mean having modern and effective armed forces backed by a nuclear deterrent. U.S. leadership does not mean just defending our territory, our citizens at home, or our supply of foreign oil. U.S. leadership means standing up for our interests and values and standing up for those who cannot themselves prevent genocide, as we have done and should continue to do in Kosovo. 
   The second reason is burden-sharing. United States aircraft, the best technology flown by the best pilots, flew most of the missions in the air campaign against Yugoslavia, but many of our allies were there with us providing aircraft, bases, and other critical resources. 
   The Europeans have agreed to bear most of the burden of peacekeeping and reconstruction in Kosovo, and while some assistance has been slow in coming they are unquestionably doing the lion's share of the tasks we now face. 
   The United States contributes fewer than 6,000 of more than 45,000 NATO troops deployed in Kosovo for Operation Joint Guardian. This is more than a token presence; we have accepted responsibility for security in a sector of Kosovo and have the robust force necessary to do the job right without unnecessary risk. But this limited role shows our allies that we understand the importance of doing our part to achieve a common interest. 
   The third reason is peace and stability in the Balkans and in Europe. Maintaining a significant U.S. presence in a robust, NATO-led force lets the Serbs and the Kosovar Albanians know that the future of Kosovo and its people will not be determined by renewed ethnic violence. Over time, and with a strengthened civilian effort, this should open the way to development of civil society and self-government in Kosovo and a negotiated solution on its international status.  
   Maintaining peace in Kosovo helps prevent a wider war which could otherwise draw in NATO allies as combatants. In contrast, withdrawal of U.S. forces would likely weaken Operation Joint Guardian. The Kosovar Albanians and the Serbs would instead rearm and prepare to resume fighting for control of territory once our allies join us on the sidelines. The killing we intervened to stop 
   would eventually resume, with devastating consequences. 
   The fourth reason we should continue our limited role in Operation Joint Guardian is credibility. 
   If we show the world that we don't have the resources or the political will to stay on the ground in Kosovo, then all our potential enemies will believe they can prevail simply by waiting us out. We were far too reluctant to use ground forces or even helicopters to stop the killing in the first place. Do we really want to cut and run now? 
   Finally, we should maintain our forces in the peacekeeping mission in Kosovo to maintain the NATO alliance which is vital to our national security. 
   The nations of the European Union, in trying to deepen their unity, are developing a European Security and Defense Identity, or ESDI. We are at a critical juncture in the evolution of the NATO, as we work to give the European Union a stronger identity and more autonomy within the alliance rather than dividing it. Failing to stay on the ground to address a threat to European security would reinforce calls for Europe to make unilateral decisions on the use of military force. 
   We must not undermine the unity of purpose and unity of action that has been the strength of an alliance which has been a mainstay of our national security for more than half a century. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will look at this in the context of other decisions we have made about our military presence and its necessity. We will look at it in terms of whether or not in this Chamber, in these offices, we are making decisions that should be reserved for the military. Let's hear from them. We heard from General Clark, one of the brightest leaders we have had in the military in the history of this country. He said this could be disaster. Montenegro and other nearby countries could explode with Milosevic's ambition; he has been looking at Montenegro, salivating for the opportunity to get in that small division of Yugoslavia and absorb it. 
   So to maintain the strength of NATO, to preserve our own credibility, to keep the peace in the Balkans and Europe, to uphold our commitment to burden-sharing, and to demonstrate United States leadership, the United States Senate should reject Section 2410 of the Military Construction Appropriations bill. Instead we should support our Armed Forces deployed in Kosovo by voting for the Levin amendment. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it has been more than a year since the Columbine tragedy, but still this Republican Congress refuses to act on sensible gun legislation. 
   Since Columbine, thousands of Americans have been killed by gunfire. Until we act, Democrats in the Senate will read some of the names of those who lost their lives to gun violence in the past year, and we will continue to do so every day that the Senate is session. 
   These names come from a report prepared by the United States Conference of Mayors. The report includes data from 100 U.S. cities between April 20, 1999 and March 20, 2000. The 100 cities covered range in size from Chicago, Illinois, which has a population of more than 2.7 million to Bedford Heights, Ohio with a population of about 11,800. But the list does not include gun deaths from some major cities like New York and Los Angeles. 
   The following are the names of some of the people who were killed by gunfire one year ago today--on May 18th, 1999: Gregory Babb, 24, Philadelphia, PA; Clifford Clark, 54, Detroit, MI; James Courtney, 20, Providence, RI; Julius Ford, 32, San Antonio, TX; Derrick Hall, 24, Chicago, IL; Jason Horsley, 25, Denver, CO; Keith Mitchell, 21, Detroit, MI; Laredo Schetop, 48, Dallas, TX; Jamaar Wynn, 15, Nashville, TN.  
   In the name of those who died, we will continue the fight to pass gun safety measures.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have just witnessed one of the most significant demonstrations this country has ever seen: 750,000 moms, some pops, some grandpops, some grandmas, people who love their children, people who want to protect their children, sending a message, when they gathered 750,000 strong, just in Washington, DC. There were other cities across the country where not too dissimilar demonstrations and marches were being held. There were large turnouts in lots of cities. 
   As a matter of fact, one in New Jersey, one mom march, was headed by people who have become my friends. Their name is LoCicero. Jake LoCicero and his wife lost their daughter on the Long Island train, killed by an assassin who took quite a few lives. They were active gun club members, NRA. They said: Enough; we are not doing this anymore. We don't want our daughter to have died in vain. She was young, about to get married, in her early twenties. They believed she had to make a contribution. Her life was so valuable, she had to leave a legacy that went beyond her short time on Earth. 
   Then we hear the trivialization of laws to try to protect children, as we just heard: It is just politics; it is only politics. What do you mean, you want to protect your kid when they go to school? That is politics. 
   When are we going to stop this nonsense here? ``Nonsense,'' I use the word advisedly. We just heard our friend from Idaho talk about how many children die in automobile accidents and how many die falling off bikes and how many die suffocating in their cribs. I ask any of my colleagues, don't we have regulations that say put a safety belt on, put a child in a child seat? I have seven grandchildren. I watch my daughters put their children in the seats because they don't want them to get hurt. They know what the rules are. They could violate the rules and say, no, I am not going to do it, but good sense says you have to do it. 
   There are all kinds of warnings about different mattress covers and plastic bags and things of that nature. There are warnings about wearing helmets when you go out for a bike ride. We try to stop the mayhem in those situations. But our friend over here said: No. Don't worry about the few kids who are killed by guns. He made a statement--and I want the RECORD to be checked to be sure that that statement was what I heard, and I listened carefully--guns don't kill. 
   How does that lead pellet get through a kid's heart or his head if it doesn't come from a gun? It doesn't come from a knife. It is not because of a slingshot. It comes from a gun.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have the floor, thank you very much. 
   Trivializing the ownership of guns, saying that if we have gun enforcement laws, guards from the Federal Government will come into every room in every house. Don't protect the children. 
   He wants to have a statistical debate about how many really died. Not that many. Heck, no, not so many. A few maybe, but not a lot--unless it is your kid, unless it is your friend, 
   unless it is your niece or your nephew or your sister's kid or your brother's kid. A lot of us have not experienced it directly, but anyone who doesn't empathize or sympathize with someone who has lost a child, who doesn't understand the emotion that renders, doesn't get it, just doesn't understand it. 
   When 12 young people were shot in Columbine High School, those were not the only wounds. There were some who were hit by guns who also were wounded. But that wounding took place throughout the school, throughout the community, throughout the country. People had a vision of that boy hanging down from the window pleading for help: Save me. We couldn't hear the words, but we could see the gesture. 
   Well, we are detached from that. Why do you have to control guns? Just because a few kids got killed? That is what is being said here. I can't believe my ears. We will check the RECORD. We could be mistaken about one thing, but check the RECORD and see what it says. 
   Kids get killed from drowning. It is as if to say, if kids get killed from bike rides, from car rides, from suffocating in a crib or drowning, then that is kind of normal. It isn't normal because we have lifeguards and all kinds of protections. But when it comes to guns, no, you can't touch that. We hear about the second amendment. 
   I am always reminded, when we discuss the second amendment, it was said by the Supreme Court that the amendment guarantees the right to be armed only in service to a well regulated militia. 
   No one has an automatic right to own a firearm. No one has the right to own a firearm without a license. No one has the right to buy a gun without those of us in the community asking who they are. I authored the Lautenberg law, along with Senator KERREY from Nebraska. Both of us served in the military. I wasn't as heroic. He is a Medal of Honor winner, having lost a leg in Vietnam. I spent my time in World War II. I was not touched. We know something about guns. Should someone be able to buy a gun from an unlicensed dealer? That is the subject. From an unlicensed dealer, no questions asked, buyers anonymous --oh, protect the identity of that potential felon, protect the identity of someone who may be so disturbed, that if they get their hands on a gun, they will kill somebody. It has happened. We have seen it lots of times. We have seen it at Columbine, with two young boys who were too young to buy a gun. A girl testified before the Colorado Legislature that she went around with them to find a nonlicensed dealer to buy guns. She said, ``If I knew then what I know now, I would have never done it.'' Twelve children and a teacher are now dead. There have been bombs and everything else. 
   We didn't have to openly say, OK, because kids get killed in swimming pools, cars, or in bike accidents, you can have guns. Why shouldn't you have guns? What does one thing have to do with the other? Heaven forbid it is a child in your family. 
   Talking about the second amendment, Chief Justice Warren Burger--a conservative appointed to the Supreme Court by President Nixon, and a gun owner himself--called the NRA's distortion of the second amendment ``a fraud on the American public.'' Cases are never tested on the second amendment in court. Now, they can't prove that. But there is this mythology 
   about what happens when it comes to guns. If you want to own them, you can. If you want to identify yourself, fine. If you don't want to, that is OK, too. What I heard proposed was that maybe every child or every person who walks this Earth should have a gun, and they can act quickly enough so if a law enforcement guy doesn't get there on time, they can stop a murder that might be taking place. I ask the manager, is there any more time available?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will wrap up, Mr. President. This is a passionate debate, and it ought to be. It ought not to be called politics. I would like to hear any of those who advocate not shutting down the unlicensed dealers tell it to the 750,000 women out there, those who were talking from experience, who lost a child. We have heard them. The Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois are on the floor. We heard them talk about the child who had a bullet go through his spine here in Washington, DC--19 years old, a promising young man just in the beginning of life. 
   Mr. President, I have to ask this question. If this sense-of-the-Senate resolution is so insignificant that it should have just been in law, then why not let it pass? Why not have this Senate say: Million moms, we salute you; we commend you; we understand you; and we hear you--not, oh, no, no; we don't want to do that because that only encourages, in some perverse way, violence. And you have to get guns in everybody's hands so they can protect themselves. 
   I fought as hard as I could to get an amendment into law--a piece of legislation that would prevent spousal abusers from getting guns. I fought tooth and nail with Senators on the floor. Some might say that is a worthless thing; why bother? Well, 150,000 times a year it is reported that a woman in this country gets a gun pointed at her head and he says, ``I'm going to blow your brains out.'' What happens to the children who see that or the neighbors who hear that? What happens to the woman when he pulls the trigger? We know what happens. They fought me tooth and nail. But the President and I worked together and got it on a budget bill that had to pass. 
   Mr. President, 33,000 permits for guns have been denied when the applicant wasn't of sufficient mind or character to own a gun--33,000 times we have said no in 3 1/2 years to those people who wanted to have guns. We had a fight over the Brady bill. Over 500,000 gun permits have been denied since the beginning of Brady. Does that help prevent lives from being lost?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is time to put the rhetoric aside. Let's see if there really is an interest in doing what we want to do, and that is express ourselves and pass a sense of the Senate that we Senators agree we ought to do something about gun violence and not go into long tales about kids dying from drownings and other things. Why can't we regulate, in some form, the way guns are handled out there and make sure we know who the buyers are, make sure that we have the right kind of law enforcement? We do it because it has increased substantially since gun laws were on the books. We have reduced the number of 
   people who are out on the streets with guns. They are in jail. But to try to minimize the value of controlling who buys a gun--how does that hurt anybody who wants to buy a gun, a legitimate gun purchaser? It doesn't hurt anybody. 
   I hope we can finally come together here and say, OK, this sense of the Senate doesn't hurt anything anyway. Let's do it and say we are serious. Let's say to the moms who marched out there last Sunday: We hear you and we understand what you are talking about. A million moms were marching from across the country. We hear debate about whether or not kids get killed from other sources as well. It hardly seems serious. It hardly seems real. It hardly seems possible that we could be having this kind of debate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, now that we are considering the conference report on the free trade bill, which I support, I point out while this legislation is designed to improve economic conditions in sub-Saharan Africa, many of these sub-Saharan countries have struggled economically for years. As a result, that economic stagnation has also led to political unrest, civil wars, and bloody violence. Reducing violence should be a high priority all across the globe, not only on the African Continent but also a high priority in our country. 
   In this country, we are going to see this weekend hundreds of thousands of mothers and families in Washington marching against violence as part of the Million Mom March. 
   My resolution simply commends the participants of the Million Mom March this weekend for rallying their communities to ask for sensible gun safety legislation. It calls on the Congress to complete action on the juvenile justice bill, which will help promote safety and sensible legislation, and I hope to offer that resolution before the Memorial Day recess. 
   I will be on The Mall for the march this Sunday with, I am sure, many of my colleagues on Mother's Day, May 14, 2000, with Americans from all walks of life. In Washington and communities across the country, people will join together to call for meaningful, commonsense gun safety policies. 
   My resolution commends these families, citizens, members of religious congregations, schools, community-based organizations, businesses, political, and cultural groups for coming together as a local and national community to recognize the violence committed against our children from guns must cease. 
   I am going to continue to try my best to see if we can get action on the stalled gun safety provision that American families want us to pass. 
   It has now been more than a year since that terrible tragedy at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999. Students at that high school were attacked in the halls of their school, in their classrooms. The result everyone knows: 12 students dead, a teacher shot dead, another 23 students and teachers injured. 
   I have to ask, just as they are asking--I hear it; and I know colleagues of mine hear it--what has Congress done since that time, since that awful day 1 year ago? What have we done to help reduce this violence? As I see it, not much--virtually nothing. I think it is shameful. 
   It is shameful because shootings have not stopped. Columbine was the most deadly school shooting. But there have been many others. It is peculiar, you often think--at least I do; I speak for myself--that we have seen the ultimate outrage, one after another: Columbine; the children being led, hand in hand, by policemen out of the school in Los Angeles; young people at a prayer meeting in Texas--and still nothing happens. 
   In February of this year, a little first grader was shot and killed by a classmate--a 6-year-old killing a 6-year-old. The child, Kayla Rolland, a beautiful little girl, is taken from her family. There was no explanation except that this little boy got a gun and pulled the trigger. In December of last year, a seventh grader in Fort Gibson, OK, took a handgun to school and wounded four students. These are just the school shootings since the terrible tragedy at Columbine. 
   Since 1997, there have been school shootings in Pearl, MS, West Paducah, KY, Jonesboro, AR, Edinboro, PA, and Springfield, OR. 
   There have been many other outrages outside our schools. Recently, a racist in Pittsburgh killed six people, and not too far from where we are standing, seven children were shot at the National Zoo. 
   Some of us have tried to address this violence. During the debate on the juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed several gun safety measures, including my amendment to require criminal background checks at gun shows. It was a very close vote. The Vice President, in his role as President of the Senate, voted to break the 50-50 tie. 
   I remind my colleagues that the gun show amendment had bipartisan support. I did not get 50 votes without getting some of our colleagues on the Republican side. I was pleased to have that support from Senators DEWINE, FITZGERALD, LUGAR, VOINOVICH, WARNER, and Senator John Chafee, who is no longer with us. They all voted for the amendment. 
   The final juvenile justice bill passed by a vote of 73-25. There was strong bipartisan support for moving forward on juvenile crime and for trying to reduce gun violence. 
   But what has happened since then? The gun lobby, and its congressional allies, have stalled the bill. It has been held hostage in the conference committee for more than 9 months. We need to move forward on gun safety because stopping gun violence and keeping our kids safe is too important. 
   When you talk about a million women marching, while they would like it, they are not marching for equal pay; they are not marching for job opportunity; they are not talking about ``glass ceilings;'' they are not talking about an invasion of the rights as we conventionally see them. There is one issue that is more 
   important than any other. 
   They say: Dear God, help us protect our children. When we send them to school in the morning, they are healthy and smiling. We want them to come back from school the same way at the end of the day--even though they now know that there are going to be metal detectors, there are going to be guards, and there are going to be additional measures to try to maintain security. 
   Violence has won over much of our attention, certainly much of our budget. But we have to work to help families, some of whom have already paid a terrible price for gun violence, and others who worry about it each and every day. Because the wounds that were received were not simply the wounds that came from the gun attack, as horrible as that was, but everybody in the vicinity, everybody in those schools, were wounded by those attacks, so was our Nation. It changed the tenure of things. It made us all apprehensive.  
   So the gun safety provisions in the juvenile justice bill are simply commonsense measures that Congress should have enacted a long time ago. 
   First, we have to close the gun show loophole. There is no question that closing the gun show loophole will help prevent guns from getting into the wrong hands, including the hands of schoolchildren. 
   The proof is in the testimony of Robyn Anderson before the Colorado Legislature. She is the young woman who went with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to the Tanner gun show in Adams County, CO. She bought two shotguns and a rifle for Klebold and Harris, three of the four guns that they later used in their massacre, their shooting rampage at Columbine High School. 
   She testified, saying very clearly:  
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday. ..... While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check.  
   She said:  
   It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.  
   More recently Patty Nielson, a teacher at Columbine High School, spoke about the need to close the gun show loophole. She said:  
   All we know for sure is that if they [Klebold and Harris] hadn't gotten these guns, they never would have killed those innocent people. And the shocking thing is that they got those guns so easily from the gun show.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the teacher, Patty Nielson, from Columbine is right in her statement. It is shocking that anyone can get a gun so easily at a gun show. The American people understand this issue. In every poll, more than 80 percent of the American people support background checks at gun shows. In fact, two-thirds of the gun owners--66 percent--support background checks on all gun sales at gun shows. Some of the other loopholes in our gun laws are also shocking. There is no reason why we should allow large-capacity ammunition clips to be imported. We banned them from being manufactured in this country, but they can still be brought in, imported.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. It is regular order. 
   Mr. President, I have the right to establish the connection between the trade industry, and that is how I started my remarks. The fact is that one of the purposes of getting this trade matter into law is to make sure the countries we deal with that are having severe economic problems, where we see starving populations, where we see human rights ignored, corruption rampant--that is the mission of what we are doing this day. Frankly, I am not doing it exclusively so we can do more business. We would like to do more business. 
   The fact is that trade has another significant implication. It is a foreign policy implication. How do we deal with it? When we look through the television cameras today, we see people with malnutrition, disease, starving. We are hoping we can do something to try to alleviate those conditions. 
   Why is it out of order? I ask the Parliamentarian, why is it out of order to talk about the subjects that relate at home to the same things we are trying to do to help overseas? I don't understand it. I must say that I have to pose that to the Parliamentarian. 
   We are never so strict that you can't talk about matters that relate indirectly. Or are we going to measure it word by word what is being said here? I think it is an invasion, I must say, of the Senator's right to speak on an issue. 
   I am not finished with remarks on the trade commentary. I 
   intend to close with the trade commentary.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to continue discussing the issue we were talking about earlier. In my earlier remarks, while talking about trade, we talked about the value of trade with the sub-Saharan nations, whose economic subjugation created all kinds of problems. We talked about the economic strangulation that presents so many problems and creates violence and corruption and lawlessness in some of these countries. We are hoping that this trade can suppress those differences and that violence. 
   I was making the point that we in this country have a problem of our own regarding gun violence, which is very detrimental to the harmonious functioning within our society. We have these huge differences between those who think that ``guns unlimited'' ought to be the rule. I had the opportunity to hear a brilliant author, Gary Wills, talk about why it is that people distrust Government. One of the issues he brings up--and I am paraphrasing some here--is that when people see that violence pervades our society, we have to have some sense of a regulation. He pointed out that if we didn't have regulations on our highways, highway safety programs, our system would be rendered useless because people would be afraid to go out on the highways because of the mayhem it would create. 
   I think it is a fairly simple thing to understand that if you were able to drive as fast as you wanted on either side of the road, we would be killing and maiming one another. I don't understand why it is that we can't have some sensible gun violence control in this country, some regulation. Why is this one part of our society so exempt from any kind of sensible regulation that says a person who wants to buy a gun ought to be qualified physically and emotionally to do so, and that if they want to buy a gun they ought not have any history of violent behavior? 
   I wrote legislation regarding spousal abuse. I said anybody convicted of a misdemeanor for spousal abuse ought not to be able to own a gun. I had terrific resistance in this place. I could not get it through, really. Finally, we got it through as a piece of legislation on a budget. 
   What has happened in 3 1/2 years? Well, 33,000 people who are not qualified by virtue of violence against a spouse or their children--domestic abusers--have been prevented from getting guns, where maybe they pointed a gun at somebody and said, ``If you don't listen to me, I will blow your brains out.'' I think it was a positive measure. 
   The Brady bill was fought tooth and nail before it was passed. The Brady bill gave Government time to check out these individuals who are applying for guns or gun ownership at such a prolific rate that we ought to have some measure of control. Well, after a long debate and a lot of suffering, had Jim Brady, who was shot while an attempt was made on the life of President Reagan, not wheeled himself around the Capitol, it never would have passed. 
   What was the effect of the Brady bill--the thing the gun lobby was so afraid of that would ``impair freedom"? Baloney, as we say. Well, 500,000 people were prevented from getting guns, thank the Lord. What would have happened? Those 500,000 people who were not qualified either by virtue of personal characteristics, background, a tendency toward violence, or trouble, could have gotten guns. Thank goodness they were not able to get guns. 
   We wonder whether or not, with a Million Moms March imminent on Mother's Day, anybody thinks mothers are clamoring to leave their homes and march in protest because they have nothing better to do on Mother's Day. That is the most revered holiday, next to Christmas, that we have in our society. It is when people flock to see moms. I know my children want to see their mother. My grandchildren want to see their mother. A lot of them in my family will be out there marching because they are sick and tired of worrying about whether or not their children, when they go to school to learn, to sing, to play, to make friends, are going to get shot, are going to get assaulted, are going to get killed or wounded in such a way that they never recover. That doesn't only mean those who were hit with a bullet. It means friends who saw their classmates at Columbine lying down and trying to crawl out windows to get away from the madness, in fear for their lives. 
   What was the impact of that throughout the school? Did the wounding stop with those hit with a bullet? Or do those wounds go on forever? Some lost friends who were 16 and 17 years old--kids in the prime of life. Those wounds will last forever. So it is not only those who are involved in the fracas; it is everybody--all of us across the country. 
   Look at the physical cost: metal detectors, guards, cameras, rigid processes for transportation. It costs a fortune. Frankly, I think we should just put a lid on this proliferation of guns and stop the unlicensed gun dealers from selling guns and not asking any questions of the buyer--``buyers anonymous''--at gun shows across the country. If you want to buy guns, just put your money down, brother, and you can have all the guns you want and walk away. You could be one of the 10 most wanted criminals in the United States on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list. Even if they recognize you, they have no obligation in the States that don't  have control because the Federal Government doesn't have it all; they are under no obligation to say, hey, we know you are sought after. We know you are a criminal. 
   There are no rules. We ought to stop that and we ought to make a pledge to the mothers who are going to be out there on Sunday that we are going to do something about it, instead of sitting on our hands over a year since Columbine. It is almost a year now since we passed the gun show loophole closure in this body and sent it over to the House as part of a conference. That is what we do here. The House and the Senate confer and they try to agree on a bill. 
   They don't want to act on it. The action is no action. That inaction is the rule because they don't want to bring up the gun issue. It is too sensitive. It might be too offensive to the NRA. It might be too offensive to the gun lobby. We are saying, no, we have to do something about it. The least thing we are going to do today is offer a resolution and, we hope, get it passed. 
   We ask those on the other side who won't join us to stand up in front of the American public and say: I don't think you are entitled to send your child to a safe school; you have to run the risk. After all, guns are more important than my kids or my grandchildren. I can tell you that the so-called ``freedom to own a gun and maim people,'' and the Constitution says you are allowed to shoot at anybody you want to, is not a matter--in the wildest imagination--of the second amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to make a unanimous consent request. In fairness, I want to see a Republican on the floor before we make that request about time. So if the staff would arrange to have someone come to the floor, I would appreciate it because I want to continue talking about this resolution we have already sent up to the desk. 
   We are looking for very simple, commonsense changes. I can't imagine anybody saying we should not prohibit juveniles from possessing assault weapons. It is hard to oppose that. Does anyone seriously believe juveniles need assault weapons? Additionally, we should require child safety locks to be sold with handguns. It is a simple step we can take to try to protect kids who get a hold of guns. We know that the 6-year-old who used a gun to murder another 6-year-old would not have been able to do so, A, if the gun had been properly protected from reach by a child; or, B, if the gun had had a safety lock, the child wouldn't have been able to operate it. 
   We also ought to study--I know the Senator from California wants to talk about this--the marketing of guns to juveniles. She spoke about it a few moments ago. I heard her talk about it. It was so clear and so precise that it is hard to argue against it. 
   Why shouldn't we examine what it is we are doing to convince little kids that their mark of maturity is going to be 
   to own a gun? I don't understand why. 
   When it comes to guns, we are talking about deadly weapons. We are not talking about play toys that might turn over or something such as that. This is automatically associated with killing, with death, with injury--a gun in the wrong hands. 
   No, we are not saying that every gun owner is out for murder. We are not saying every gun owner is out to hurt people, but there are enough people that it makes an enormous difference whether or not guns are out there in the hands of the wrong people. We ought to make sure they are not being sold as toys. 
   These are all commonsense measures. They passed this Senate as part of a juvenile justice bill just about a year ago next week. It was sent over to the House. We got our conference committee together. 
   How much time do I have, Mr. President?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, and ladies and gentlemen who can hear me, what an irony it is. What an irony it is. The Senator from Colorado objects to simple gun safety legislation. What an irony it is that this place is empty, but the voice of negativism creeps through. 
   I want all the million moms across the country to hear this. They are saying: No, no to sensible gun safety legislation. They are saying: No, Mom, your kids are going to 
   go to school and it is too bad, it is too bad if some little maniac, or some confused child has a gun in his or her hand. Too bad, too bad, unless it is their kid, God forbid. 
   What are we witnessing here? Foolishness. The public ought to know it. They ought to stand up and shout: We are not going to take it anymore. A million mothers marching across this country--I hope they are made furious by this objection. 
   Object to a resolution? A resolution, for my friends who do not know, is not a law. It is simply a thought. It is the way we think we ought to do things. We are far from legislation. We just think we ought to protect children. We think we ought to make it tougher for people to have guns randomly. We think we ought to make it tougher for young children to learn that guns are a step toward manhood. They ought to learn. They ought to learn. 
   Remember the image--the kids at Columbine, the bleeding boy reaching out the window for help: Somebody, help me before I get killed. Or the little children at the school in Califor–nia--little kids, like my grandchildren, like your grandchild, being led by policemen so they could get away from a gunman. Or the youngsters saying a prayer in Waco, TX, heads bent in prayer, and some idiot comes by and starts shooting. Or that 6-year-old child killing another 6-year-old child. 
   So we cannot enact a law that says you have to put your gun away if you have one, so a child can't get ahold of it? Or make it childproof? 
   The Republicans say: No. We have 51-50 vote when the Vice President cast a tie vote and it went to the House. The House didn't want to cooperate, the Republican majority there said: No, no, let's bury this thing. 
   Bury it. What a terrible term. What a terrible term. Because we are talking about funerals and burials, instead of laughter, instead of love, instead of friendship. It is a black day, a bad day for America. I hope the million moms, when they get together, will talk about this.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for his always courteous response to a request. 
   It was disheartening to see we could not get a resolution adopted--not law, a thought, an idea, what we would like to do, that says we welcome the committed women who are involved in the march who are going to gather in places across this country to protest the threat of violence to their children. 
   I thank our leader, and my colleague from California, for being such active supporters of this protest against violence. I am sorry we did not have a chance to get a vote on it. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his friendly remarks as well. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Rev. James A. Scott on the occasion of his retirement as Pastor of the Bethany Baptist Church in Newark, NJ. 
   For more than three decades, Rev. James A. Scott has devoted his life to building a new legacy for the Bethany Baptist Church congregation and the Newark community. Since its founding in 1871, Bethany Baptist has evolved into an international network. The church's more than 2,000 members represent 22 different countries, including many in the Caribbean and Africa. Under Reverend Scott's leadership, Bethany Baptist helped establish a daughter church in Johannesburg, South Africa, and renovated a church in Cuba. The church also provides scholarship funds for students to attend the Moscow Baptist Seminary, and it educates primary students in Kenya. 
   Reverend Scott is not just building bridges to the international community, he is also playing a major role in the rebirth of Newark and surrounding areas. In the Roseville Avenue neighborhood, for example, Reverend Scott's church helped build 100 affordable homes. His church also helped build a community outreach building in Newark as well as the Newark-Bethany Christian Academy Day School. 
   These facilities have created a sense of stability and rootedness in their respective neighborhoods. Low-income families now have new housing options and new reasons to feel proud of where they live. 
   Reverend Scott's commitment to Newark is unsurpassed. I hope that Bethany Baptist Church will be inspired by his example to achieve even higher goals. I salute Reverend Scott on his retirement and wish him well.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Tobacco Smuggling Eradication Act. 
   When Congress last debated tobacco legislation, Big Tobacco raised the specter of rampant smuggling to defeat the legislation. Of course, the public only found out recently that Big Tobacco itself is a major player in the smuggling game. A tobacco company executive recently pleaded guilty to money laundering charges in a case involving nearly $700 million worth of cigarettes on the Canadian black market. Although the company denies knowledge of the scheme, they clearly profited from it. 
   The best way to address smuggling concerns is to prevent any large-scale smuggling problem from arising in the first place. The Tobacco Smuggling Eradication Act contains several common-sense provisions to combat smuggling of tobacco products, and associated tax evasion. 
   The bill will require unique serial numbers on all tobacco product packages manufactured or imported into the United States, and will require all packages bound for export to be marked for export. Under current law, export-bound products that re-enter the U.S. too often avoid tax assessment, and are sold at discount, in competition with products on which taxes have been paid. Likewise, re-imported products under current law often evade counting for purposes of the multi-state settlement, and thus cheat Americans twice--once in avoidance of tax, and again in avoidance of MSA assessment. 
   The bill would require retailers to maintain tobacco-related records, which may consist simply of ordinary business records. This provision would ensure that invoices for tax-paid tobacco products match sales, and that the retailer is not an outlet for product on which tax has not been paid. 
   The bill also would require wholesalers to keep records on the chain of custody of tobacco products. This requirement already exists for manufacturers, exporters, and importers. This requirement needs to be strengthened in order to ensure that product marked for export is not diverted back into the domestic market without appropriate taxes having been collected. 
   In addition, the bill would amend the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act, which assists states in enforcing and collecting their excise taxes, by lowering the threshold of jurisdiction to 30,000 cigarettes (from 60,000) and expanding it to cover other tobacco products. Federal law should ensure that states have the necessary tools to stop interstate bootleggers who routinely move tons of tobacco products from low-tax states to higher-tax states.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished Senator from Vermont, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. He has a homespun way of talking at times, but he always brings good sense and good judgment to the debate. I appreciate his comments about how we have to be so mindful of our responsibilities under the Constitution, and we ought not to trifle with amendments to the Constitution. The Constitution is the fundamental text of our democracy and we ought not to amend it if there are other ways to address the problem. 
   Some of those listening may have trouble following all of our twists of logic, but one thing should be clear--we all know we have too many victims in our society. We know we have families torn apart, even if they are not directly victims themselves. Look at Columbine High School. Who were the victims? Were they just the young people and the teacher who were killed and their families? Were they the only victims? Or was the whole high school population of Columbine a victim? Or was the whole community of Littleton, Colorado that was the victim? Was the whole country a victim? I think so. 
   All of us had images seared into our psyches that I think for most of us will last a lifetime. Were we victims of a sort? Were we victims of our lack of understanding of how we got to that point? Are we victimized by violence that does not touch us immediately? I think so because otherwise we would not see these magnetic detectors all over the place. We wouldn't have security guards all over the place, and we wouldn't be spending money building ever more prisons--money that could be used for education or health care or prescription drugs or to help young people in our society. So we are all victimized by crime. 
   That is the problem with the constitutional amendment that is proposed--defining who is the victim. Once again, is it the family whose house was broken into and the terrible deeds that followed? Or is it everybody in the neighborhood? Or is it young child who lost a friend who was 6 years old, who do not understand why the friend was murdered by another 6-year-old child? Who is the victim? Even the family of a perpetrator of a terrible crime is often a victim. 
   Given the difficulty of defining who is a victim, it might be better to address this statutorily. We ought to write a statute that very clearly says: Yes, victims' rights have to be protected. We have said it so many times over the years, writing laws as opposed to amending the Constitution. That is the question, really. No one is saying we should not take care of the victims. But the question is whether you try to address the problem by statute or if you take the much more drastic step of amending the Constitution. 
   And when we talk about victims we should remember all of the people who have suffered because of the proliferation of guns. 
   Look at what happened yesterday at the National Zoo. Seven young people were shot. I have my four children and their spouses and seven grandchildren, the oldest of whom is 6, coming to Washington in a few weeks commemorating, with the grandfather of the family, my career in the Senate. We are going to celebrate. Because they are all so young, to amuse them I said we would go to the zoo. I am not as enthusiastic about going to the zoo today as I was a couple of weeks ago when we thought about this.  
   I am worried about what might happen in public gatherings. The two oldest of my grandchildren--again, they are little kids--are in school. I call my daughters and say: How are the kids? When I see something that goes awry in a school and a 6-year-old child can kill another 6-year-old child because of someone's careless possession of a gun, their careless abandonment of normal safety protections, I worry about them. I worry not only for my family. I worry mostly, obviously, as we all do, about my family. But I also worry about all of the violence that permeates our society. There is enough of that on television--even in cartoons. And I think that some of the depictions of violence may encourage violent behavior. The seeds may be there, but the encouragement, the nurturing of those seeds often takes place in movies and television where the hero is the guy who comes in with a gun blazing. Who he is killing we are never quite sure, but he is killing people. 
   If we want to take care of the victims, then we ought to pass a law and be bold about it and not fall prey to public posturing and say amend the Constitution. How many other rights ought to be included as we talk about victims? Should parents' rights be protected? Should grandparents' rights be protected? Should workers' rights be protected? Should women be protected? We think so. They are very often victims of crimes that do not necessarily leave a mark that one can see but often does enormous damage to their psyche and to their mental well-being--harassment, sexual harassment. Are we amending the Constitution to deal with that? No, we are not. 
   And we need to stop the political posturing about many issues. For example, we need to stop all of the posturing on gun control and take action. 
   I wrote an amendment and presented it to the Senate when we were discussing the juvenile justice bill. The amendment is very simple--it would close the gun show loophole. We received 50 votes on each side. No, that is not fair to say. Fifty votes for and 50 votes against, including some of my Republican friends who agreed with us that we ought to close a loophole in gun shows that permits people to buy guns without identifying themselves. I call it buyers anonymous: Someone goes in, puts their money down, and walks out with as many guns as they can physically carry. They can even come back for another load. There is no identification required. Even though some in this Senate want to protect that practice, my amendment prevailed. With the Vice President casting the tie-breaking vote, the amendment passed 51-50. 
   It was a dramatic day. We all worked so hard. But since then, the juvenile justice bill has been stalled in a conference committee. 
   There is a game played around here--political football. If you are in the majority and do not like something, you have the ability to stop the legislation from moving. We established a Senate conference committee with a House conference committee, which is the normal process. They confer on differences that each of the Houses has on their legislation. We sent it to the House. The conferees took forever to be named. Finally, we got conferees. 
   What did they do to keep the public from knowing, to keep potential victims from understanding what might be happening? They did nothing. The distinguished Senator from Vermont, who always brings sense to our body when he discusses issues with which he is 
   so familiar, mentioned it. April 20 was the 1-year--I do not even like to use the word ``anniversary''--but it was one year since that horrible day we all witnessed--kids running, young people in the prime of life killed. 
   There is nothing more satisfying to me, perhaps because of my white hair and age, than seeing young people in the full blush of youth enjoying themselves. Sometimes they do silly things. It is fun when I see young people, whether they are little young people or 16, 17, or 19 years old. I joined the Army when I was 18. I did not realize how young it was until I looked back. 
   Young people who were enjoying themselves were mowed down by two young killers at Columbine High School. Families were brought to the worst grief anyone can imagine. A young man was hanging out the window pleading for help. We do not know what he was saying. One can imagine what he was saying. His hand was outstretched trying to reach for safety wherever he could go get it, a refuge from the madness surrounding him. That was April 20, 1999. April 20, 2000--nothing has happened. Nothing. I say let's vote on it--you can vote for gun safety or against it. Let the public see how you voted. But no, they do not want to do that because they are all scared in their own way. They are scared the public is going to see that they will not take steps to end gun violence. 
   Here we are. We had promises recently that we would be voting on a conference bill, and we ought to do that pretty soon. All they have to do is say to the conferees, ``Get the job done,'' and the bill will be on the floor. But we cannot get them to do that. 
   The majority--and I talk with all due respect in friendship about the majority--is in charge. That is the way it is. I wish it was otherwise, frankly, but the Republicans are in charge, and the Republican leader has not brought it up, though he said he wants to bring it up. He said it publicly. On April 9, when asked, he said he would bring it up soon. On ``Face the Nation,'' a very well-known program, he said he would be amenable to bringing it up. He was asked by Bob Schieffer: ``Don't you have to get the conference committee to meet? Why don't you at least have a meeting?'' in reference to the conference committee on juvenile justice, one part of which is an attempt to control gun violence. 
   The majority leader said they were talking about it. 
   Schieffer came back and said: ``Let me pin you down. Do you think you're going to get that conference committee to meet to kind of get this started?'' 
   The response by the majority leader was, ``I do.'' 
   That was April 9. Today is April 25. April 9 to April 25, that does not seem as if it is rushing to do things. 
   It was promised. Well, the majority leader said, ``I do.'' 
   Schieffer said, ``This week?'' 
   The majority leader, again, with all due respect, said, ``I don't know if it will be this week, but we will get it done in the next few weeks.'' 
   There have been a few weeks. Why don't we get this done? We are all concerned about victims of crime, but let's pass legislation that will prevent people from becoming victims of crime. 
   I continue to urge the Congress to move forward on gun safety. And what is the response of the Republican Party--the Republican Senate group. Well, here is what GOP aide John Czwartacki said in Roll Call:  
   It is a shame but no surprise that they would exploit the tragedy of these children's deaths to promote a political agenda.  
   That is what he said. He said it in response to a commitment that I and several other Senators made that we would do whatever we could to get that juvenile justice bill moved along so we could discuss ways of reducing gun violence. 
   At times I wonder what it will take for people in this chamber to get the message. Despite what the American public says, despite what parents say, despite the fact that there will be a million moms marching on Mother's Day--some members of this body refuse to act. 
   Why? Why is it that the voice of the NRA, the National Rifle Association, can be heard so clearly in this place and so clearly influences legislation. Why is it that special interest voice sound so loudly in this place that the majority will not bring up legislation that says: Close the gun show loophole so unlicensed dealers cannot sell guns to unidentified buyers? Why is it? 
   Why is it that it drowns out millions of voices? Look at some of the polling data. In overwhelming majorities, up as high as 90 percent, people say: Shut down that gun show loophole. But those voices do not get through here. 
   It is quite an amazing process of physics that the sounds travel all the way here from the NRA office in Washington, but across this country where everybody is supposed to be represented in this body, those voices do not get through. They do not see the tears. They do not understand the grief. They do not hear the pleas of people who have become victims as a result of a loss of a child or a loss of a loved member of a family. Those voices  do not get through. But the voice of the NRA, with its control of some of the people that work here and in the other body--control, that is what happens--they set the agenda. 
   As we discuss victims of crime and constitutional amendments, it bears a note of hypocrisy because buried in there, in my view, is this overhanging question about what constitutes a victim, as I earlier discussed. What should the Constitution be open to? In the more than 200 years we have had the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, it has been amended 18 times. It is a deliberate violation of what constitutes good judgment very sparingly. 
   One of the dreaded thoughts that passes through so many of our minds is amending the Constitution for one thing after another. We have had several goes at that very recently when it was thought maybe we would amend the Constitution to do things that we ought to take care of by law. 
   I will close, but just with this reminder. Here is a picture of one terrible person. He is on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List. 
   Guess what. He can go up to an unlicensed dealer at a gun show and buy guns. He does not even have to worry about them calling the cops because they do not ask his identification when selling weapons. 
   There is enormous pressure to keep this gun show loophole in place. Imagine, those criminals on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted List, and any one of them could walk in to a gun show and approach an unlicensed dealer and say: Give me a dozen of these or two dozen of those, and here is the money, and the deal is done. 
   It is my hope we will resolve the dispute that is in front of us now in a statutory fashion; that is, to write law, not to amend the Constitution. Start there. Extend the debate so that all points of view are sufficiently heard. Let's let the public know what we are talking about when we do this. 
   But even as we contemplate the course of action on this constitutional amendment--I think it was with 80-some votes that we said we ought to move ahead. Some of those who voted for cloture, however, are just interested in opening up the debate and not really supporting the constitutional amendment. 
   I say to all my colleagues, I intend to continue to push for the conferees on the juvenile justice bill to sit down and talk and to come up with a conference report. Come up with their conclusion, whatever that happens to be, and let the American public know that they are not just sitting on their hands as a way of killing this legislation. And those who oppose it should have the courage to speak up and say: No, I don't want to control gun violence that way. Guns don't kill. People kill. Or they may say: The little boy who is 6 years old is a criminal that the police should have been watching, I suppose, before he went to school that day with that gun. 
   There are so many times when a person becomes a criminal for the first time when they pull that trigger. But the response is always the same--guns don not kill, people kill. Well, you do not have many drive-by knifings. It's a lot easier to kill people with a gun. 
   So we are going to do whatever we can. We are going to seize whatever opportunities we can. We are going to stand and shout this message until it is heard all the way across this country, so that people will call this place, call their Senator, call their Representative, and tell them they want to see something done about gun violence in this country, that they are sick and tired of losing thousands and thousands of people to gun violence. 
   There are 33,000 victims in a year, when a country such as Japan and the UK and others have less than 100. We sure do not have 300 times their population. 
   There are ways to control violence. One of them is to take these lethal instruments out of the hands of people who are not qualified to have them. 
   I wrote a law to take guns away from those who are domestic abusers, guys who like to beat up their wives or kids, or guys who like to beat up their girlfriends. 
   We had a heck of a fight here. Finally, with President Clinton's help, we got a bill signed one night that was attached to an appropriations bill. 
   The opponents said: It is not going to do any good; it is not going to matter. That was done in the fall of 1996. Since that time, we have stopped 33,000 requests to buy guns. 33,000 times that a spouse or a friend or a child in a household doesn't have to hear somebody say, ``If you don't do this, I'm going to blow your brains out''; 33,000 times in just over 3 years. 
   The gun lobby fought me and said that is junk, you don't need that, that is silly, that is not where we ought to be going, we ought to be locking people up, and so forth. Of course, we do lock them up. They deserve to be locked up, if they are criminals. We lock up and enforce the law in more cases now than at any time in the past. Convictions are way up. Housing criminals has become a problem. We don't have a sufficient number of jails to accommodate them. 
   I go with this promise: We will be back again. Not just on this bill, but as we consider other pieces of legislation. We are going to fight on this floor. Whether it is kids pulling out guns to resolve fights, or someone using a gun when they want to rob someone, we have to stop the gun violence. I am sure the public will agree. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is the last budget resolution on which I will be working. It has been quite an interesting exercise. 
   I start off by saying that I hope and believe firmly the goodwill that exists with the chairman of the Budget Committee and myself will not evaporate as we discuss this budget. We are good friends, and we have been good partners in debate and discussion. We disagree on the conclusions. That means no disrespect flowing either way, and I am sure I speak for Senator DOMENICI. It is with esteem and--I use the term carefully--affection that we have worked together. 
   Now that we have said the good things, we will get on to the others; that is, I firmly believe this is the wrong budget resolution at the wrong time because we are still in the position that, with rare exception, we have almost no bipartisan agreement. I heard Senator DOMENICI describe the former occupant of the chair as fiscally responsible. I assume that ``fiscally responsible'' is kind of a catchall for the side of the aisle that one is on; that others on this side may appear to be fiscally irresponsible. 
   We can't buy that. We have a difference of view. The difference of view is clearly marked in this budget resolution. What should we do to use the funds we have available on behalf of the American public? Should we focus on those whose incomes are at the middle or the lower end of the scale or should we give the tax breaks primarily to the wealthy of the country? It clearly reflects the values and priorities we each have. 
   This budget conference report calls for costly and risky tax breaks that would, contrary to the statements made, raid Social Security surpluses. It proposes deep cuts in domestic programs such as education and health care and law enforcement and veterans' benefits and environmental protection. It fails to ensure that seniors will be provided with a meaningful prescription drug benefit. It talks about it, but it doesn't arrange for it to happen. On debt reduction--the Holy Grail that Chairman Greenspan held out as being the cardinal first step, the principle by which we operate in terms of maintaining our fiscal responsibility, paying down the debt--this fails to pay down the debt as much as we can. It fails to make it a priority. It hides the long-term cost of its tax breaks and it puts our economy at risk by weakening our commitment to fiscal discipline. 
   To understand my contention that the tax breaks in this conference report would raid Social Security, I will take a quick look at the numbers. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, says that over the next 5 years, the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. We don't dispute that. The sides have not argued on that count. This assumes that Congress freezes discretionary spending at current real levels. ``Current real levels'' means adjusting only for inflation. In fact, if Congress increases domestic spending at the same rate as it has done in recent years, which has been greater than inflation, the actual surplus would be substantially smaller. Still, to give the majority the benefit of the doubt, let's ignore history for a moment and optimistically assume that the non-Social Security surplus will be $171 billion. The conference report--that report which was debated and agreed upon between the House and the Senate, their budgeteers, our budgeteers, and finally both bodies, they have already passed this so we are being asked to pass it--calls for tax breaks of $175 billion. Now, that is in the face of a $171 billion non-Social Security surplus. 
   This reduction in future surpluses also would require the Government to pay about $21 billion more in interest payments because we would have more debt. Thus, the real cost of the tax breaks isn't $175 billion; it is $196 billion, $25 billion more than the entire non-Social Security surplus of $171 billion. In clear words, this budget would raid Social Security of $25 billion. 
   Now, if the tax breaks use the entire non-Social Security surplus, plus $25 billion of the Social Security surplus, how can the conference report also provide funding for any of the new initiatives it claims, such as increases in military spending, prescription drug coverage, and agriculture, to name just a few high-priority items? 
   The real answer is, it just can't be done. The numbers don't add up. Unfortunately, the majority seeks to sidestep this problem by assuming huge, unspecified cuts in domestic programs. The resolution calls for a 7.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary programs over the next 5 years. The cut would be, in the fifth year, 9.8 percent. In fact, since the majority claimed it would protect some specific programs, the cuts in other areas would be substantially higher. 
   We only received a single copy of the conference report last night at about 10 o'clock. So we haven't had the time to fully analyze the impact of cuts such as this. But these cuts are even more dramatic than the cuts proposed in the Senate version of the legislation, which were 8.2 percent in the fifth year. That was the Senate version of the legislation, before it merged with the House in the conference report we are examining now. 
   Here are some of the examples of the impact of the less severe Senate cuts--once again, the bill we sent over to merge with the House--as estimated by the Office of Management and Budget. We would have 20,000 new teachers not being able to be hired to reduce class size; 5,000 communities would lose assistance to help construct and modernize their schools; 62,000 fewer children would be served by the Head Start Program, which is a very successful program that says early education helps kids prepare to learn. We find that is necessary in our society. Then, there would be 19,000 fewer researchers, educators, and students who would receive support from the National Science Foundation. They do the research that talks about climate variations. We all see what the impending disasters might be like, such as tornadoes and other windstorms with higher and higher velocities and more frequency. And funding for all new federally led cleanup of toxic waste sites would be eliminated. Nine-hundred fewer FBI agents could be retained.  
   I wonder how the public feels about 900 fewer FBI agents--when we are looking not only at reduced rates of criminality, but also understanding what the need might be; that includes domestic terrorism, it includes fraud, and it includes all kinds of things for which we know the FBI has responsibility. We are going to work with 900 fewer FBI agents? 
   There would be 430 fewer Border Patrol agents available to safeguard our borders. Well, there isn't anybody I have talked to who thinks we need less protection on our borders. 
   The list goes on. The actual cuts will be even deeper than those suggested since the conference report calls for substantially deeper cuts than the Senate-passed version of the budget resolution. 
   As most people around here recognize, cuts of this magnitude are just completely unrealistic. They are not going to happen. Neither Republicans nor Democrats are going to tolerate them. It is kind of putting it off in the future. It may get us through an election cycle, but reality will come home and we will not be able to stand these cuts. 
   This is not the first time the Senate has assumed deep, unspecified cuts in the budget resolution. Last year's resolution included similarly unrealistic assumptions. Not surprisingly, by the end of the year, the Republican majority of Congress had approved appropriations bills that spent about $35 billion more than it assumed earlier. No doubt something similar is going to happen this year. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican budget relies on these unrealistic cuts for its tax breaks and its various increases in mandatory spending. 
   Just to explain, mandatory spending is funding those programs that are decided by the legislature, the Congress--that these programs get a high priority. We recently voted $2 billion more for the FAA--not that people disagree with the need for improving FAA's operations, but the fact is, it is mandatory. That means it gets priority, and no matter what happens behind it, the increases in FAA take place. Well, it has to come from someplace. It can come from transportation, from the Coast Guard, with all of the services they provide, or it can come from other sensitive places. The cost of that spending and the new tax breaks will be locked in up front. The savings, however, will. 
   When Congress later fails to make the assumed cuts in appropriations bills, funds for the tax breaks and for new spending will require deeper raids on Social Security. We should not let that fact escape. We want everybody to think about it. We want the Congressmen and the Senators who are going home and looking toward reelection to be able to explain to their constituents about how we had to dip into Social Security a little bit, even though everybody basically swore on the sword it would not happen. But it has to happen if this budget is going to stand. 
   One might think the assumption of deep, unrealistic cuts in discretionary spending would allow the Republicans to claim significantly more debt reduction than the budget proposed by Democrats. However, if one assumes GOP spending cuts actually materialize, which is highly unlikely, the Republican budget would still reduce much less debt than President Clinton and the Senate Democrats. The Republican plan claimed to use non-Social Security surpluses to reduce only about $12 billion of debt over 5 years. By contrast, the President's budget would reduce $90 billion of debt over that same period--more than seven times as much. So it is $90 billion under the President's budget and $12 billion in the Republican budget. This difference in debt reduction helps to show just how extreme the GOP tax breaks really are. 
   Throughout the debate on the resolution, the Republicans have claimed that their budget contains over a trillion dollars of debt reduction. However, this figure is based almost entirely on Social Security surpluses. These surpluses are called off-budget, and both parties are committed to protecting them. Yet when it comes to the portion of the budget that remains subject to congressional discretion, Republicans have refused to devote significant resources for debt reduction. In doing so, they have rejected repeated calls by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to make debt reduction our first priority. 
   My next concern about the budget resolution is that it fails to ensure that Congress will really act on legislation establishing a prescription drug benefit--another program that is saluted, generally. But it is not real. This is in marked contrast to treatment of the tax breaks. Tax breaks have an instruction to the Finance Committee that they must report out a way to get tax breaks. They have to do it. There is quite a distinction between saying we should and they have to. The conference report includes two $20 billion reserve funds that, theoretically, could be used for prescription drugs, but there is no requirement for the Senate to act. It is very unspecific. 
   The second reserve fund contains vague language that would allow virtually the entire $20 billion to be used for purposes other than prescription drugs. That could leave little more than $20 billion for prescription drugs, which is far short of what is needed to provide an adequate benefit. The Medicare reserve fund, applicable to the House, would allow virtually the entire $40 billion fund to be diverted to purposes other than prescription drugs. 
   While they say we have to have it, they don't arrange for the mechanism to make it happen. 
   Compounding matters, Mr. President, the language of the second Senate reserve fund requires that the solvency of the Medicare Program be extended before a single penny can be used either for any prescription drug benefit, or new provider payments. In other words, if you want access to this money to help seniors with prescriptions, you have to cut somewhere else within Medicare first. And that seems very unlikely to happen. 
   Mr. President, there is only one conclusion to draw from all this: the Republican Party simply is not committed to providing our seniors with prescription drugs. The senior population has to listen to that. For the Republican Party, tax breaks for the wealthy are a much higher priority. 
   Mr. President, my final concern about the conference report is that it covers only 5 years, not the 10 included in last year's resolution. 
   People might say: Well, what is the difference between 5 or 10? It matters a lot because a tax break has an effect of compounding significantly in the second quintile. It is going to grow by leaps and bounds. 
   This has the effect of hiding the long-term cost of its tax breaks. It also weakens the budget resolution as a means of enforcing long-term fiscal discipline, since points of order would not be available against tax breaks that explode in cost after 5 years. 
   Mr. President, as of last year, CBO has been producing 10-year numbers. There's no excuse for Congress not doing the same. And if we were serious about preparing for the baby boomers' retirement, we would be sure to plan for longer term costs. 
   In sum, Mr. President, the Republican majority has made tax breaks that go largely to the wealthy their highest priority. Higher than Social Security. Higher than education. Higher than prescription drugs for our seniors. Higher than reducing our debt. This is unacceptable. And higher than maintaining fiscal discipline. 
   In so doing, they have produced a budget that is fundamentally at odds with the priorities and values of the American people. A budget that puts our economy at risk. And a budget that fails to prepare for our future. 
   Just to confirm something I earlier said, the budget resolution, as it came out of the Senate, says the Senate Committee on Finance shall report to the Senate a reconciliation bill. That means they must do it. That is the only place we have any force of law in the Budget Committee. Otherwise, ours is generally a guideline or blueprint for how the Congress should act, putting a ceiling on total spending. It is up to the Appropriations Committee to divide that spending. They say this reconciliation bill shall be done not later than July 14 in the year 2000, and not later than September 13 in the year 2000. So they have 2 days. That is a realistic assignment for the Finance Committee. 
   There is no such thing for prescription drugs. The Republicans are not asking that we treat prescription drugs  with the same force and the same outcome as we do the tax breaks. 
   One thing is apparent. One thing is very clear. They are going to protect the tax breaks no matter who they have to take the money from to make it happen--no matter what program they are going to take the money from to make it happen; no matter what it does to the budget and its balance; no matter what it does to debt reduction; no matter what. The primary thing is tax reduction and tax breaks for the wealthy. If you make $800,000, which is kind of the median figure for the top 1 percent, you might get a $50,000 tax cut, if plans go as they are. But if you make $35,000, you could be looking at $1 a week, or maybe even $2, if things go right. 
   We have to make decisions. There is no room for amendments. There is no room for change. This has been decided. The majority decided. The majority will have to carry it because I predict that there is going to be little, if any, support from Democrats. We don't believe it is fiscally responsible. We don't think it is fair. We don't think it is equitable. We don't think the wealthy ought to be the largest beneficiary of the outcome. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for the work he has done on trying to limit the damage from gun violence in this country. He reminded us it is time. We are days away from April 20, the anniversary of the terrible tragedy at Columbine. We are days away. That means in this full year that passed, we could not find time to get on with doing our best to control gun violence by examining what the possibilities are, by closing the gun show loophole, by making sure those who are going to apply for gun ownership were fit to do it. 
   Here is a picture of a fellow who is on the FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives list. He could walk up to an unlicensed dealer in a gun show and purchase all the guns the money in his pocket can buy. We ought not permit that. The American people do not want us to permit that. 
   Mr. President, we are closing the debate now. I congratulate my friend and colleague from New Mexico for his ardent work on getting this done. They have a majority, and the one thing we know about our democratic system is if a majority has been sent here by the American people, we have to acknowledge that, and they have the choice of a majority. I wish we had the majority, and we would be kinder and gentler, although I am not sure everybody would agree with that. 
   That is the die as it was cast. It was cast by a majority. In the process, I see substantial loopholes in this budget conference report. It proposes deep cuts in programs such as education and health care, law enforcement, veterans benefits, and environmental protection. Also, based on just the most simple arithmetic, it is going to raid the Social Security surplus, regarding which so many of us have taken an oath: Touch not a hair on yon gray Social Security head. Here we are, preparing to violate it, even as we present a program for the fiscal year 2001. 
   They did purport--and I am not talking about as a deception; I am talking about it as an analysis of the arithmetic, the mathematics as it is there--that prescription drugs were going to be taken care of. 
   I read from the conference committee report under the heading of prescription drugs. It says: Whenever the Committee on Finance in the Senate reports a bill, a joint resolution or conference report thereon submitted which improves access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. It does not say we are going to develop a program that is going to make prescription drugs more available, cheaper, et cetera. It does not talk about that. It says access. Maybe it means the Government is going to produce lists of places where one can buy drugs off the Internet cheaper. Maybe access means if you visit country X, Y, or Z, you will be able to buy prescription drugs cheaper. 
   Access is a broad term. It does not say anything about having to get it done, but it does say in the tax section that the Finance Committee must reconcile. That means they have to produce a sufficient amount of funding for tax breaks for whomever it affects, and this is going to be principally the wealthy. 
   We leave the prescription drug section and go to the Medicare reform on page 48. It says: Whenever the Committee on Finance in the Senate--they are the people who can do it; we cannot do it in the Budget Committee--whenever the Finance Committee reports a bill, joint resolution, or conference report thereon submitted which improves the solvency of the Medicare program without the use of new subsidies from the general fund--to me that says we are going to dip into the Medicare trust fund in order to reform Medicare. 
   If that is reform, Heaven protect us, keep us from the kind of reform that says we will have to take funds from cuts in the Medicare trust fund. 
   Mr. President, in conclusion, this is my last attempt to work on the Federal budget. As disappointed as I am with the outcome, I am pleased to say I very comfortably and very forthrightly worked with Senator DOMENICI. He is a distinguished Senator. He knows his subjects, oh, so well. I will miss the chance for the fray, but also the chance for the pleasant contact we have had through this experience.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the Senator from Florida. But I am reminded, it is a pathetic thing. It is pathetic to see this child twisted and turned and seduced, if I may say--something that goes far beyond the capacity of a 6-year-old child to analyze and describe in appropriate terms. 
   But I say this: My sympathy goes out to the family in Miami that has been attached. But I also know this is a place where we often preach family values, family control, no interference by government, to remind everyone that this is a country of laws. If we subvert the law simply because there is pressure coming from one corner or another, what kind of message does it send to the millions of people who would crowd our shores and want to be here? It would say, well, we discriminate because we have louder voices in one place than we have in another. 
   Again, I think we have to remember that this country is founded on the principle of being a nation of laws, and one can challenge and go to court. 
   But to say, no, we are not going to obey the law, I don't think, frankly, does the cause of our country or the cause of this little boy, in the final analysis, any value.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. In all due respect, I say this to my friend from Florida for whom I have a great deal of respect and admiration. Reunification of families is something we wrestle with here all the time--people pleading to allow a relative to join a family that has been here for years. And we say: No, the law doesn't permit it, the rules don't permit it. So we say: Sorry, we can't do that. 
   I get lots of pleas in my office--I am sure every Senator does--saying: Let  my mother come from country X, Y, or Z, or otherwise, and let us join together. 
   I say once again, if we forget we are a nation of laws, then all of us--the people in this room and the people throughout the country--ought to be bound by the same rules and the same laws. We cannot make the kind of exception that looks as if it is responding to particular pressure in a particular moment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Democratic alternative reflects six key principles in its budget. It protects every penny of the Social Security surplus; it pays down the public debt by 2013; it funds a badly needed prescription drug benefit; it includes targeted tax cuts for working Americans, and it funds important defense and domestic priorities such as education, health, research, and agriculture. 
   Unlike the Republican budget, this plan is based on realistic assumptions about domestic spending. 
   It contains projections for a full 10 years so we know what will happen. 
   In sum, we have a responsible package that focuses on the needs of ordinary Americans today and the needs of our Nation in the future. I urge my colleagues to support this Democratic alternative.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before Senator DOMENICI leaves the floor, I wish to thank him. 
   I know the public may wonder why it is that Democrats all voted one way yet we say a consensus has been arrived at. I will take a minute to explain it. 
   Yes, the Democrats voted against this budget resolution. It wasn't so much on the issues we wanted to have taken care of. It is fair to say, if one listened to the debate, one could determine that each side wants to protect Social Security in different degrees and in different ways. One could observe we both want to do something about Medicare but, once again, in different degrees and in different ways. The list goes on. 
   There are many things on which we purely disagree. But the fact is, though I am disappointed in the outcome and I prefer the budget resolution to be done differently, I cannot say there weren't times when we agreed we wanted to get to point A, B, or C on things that affect the public generally. 
   We agreed on strengthening defense. We agreed on taking better care of our  veterans. We agreed on raising the minimum wage against the objections of most of our friends on the other side. 
   The budget is passed. It is a consensus in a peculiar way. It is not a consensus arrived at necessarily by Democrats and Republicans, but here I have to commend Senator DOMENICI. He has a rare touch. He knows his business. He understands the budget thoroughly. There isn't anybody I know here who would say he isn't a good, decent guy. 
   He deals with the differences of view that perhaps are the result of being in the majority. People want to make sure their 
   views are taken care of. 
   The minority finds it a little easier to unite, perhaps, because we unite behind issues we think are important, that we realize will not be typically dealt with in the fashion we would like. We are not in the majority. 
   By structure of the branches of Government, we have a President. The President can only lay down his recommendations; he cannot necessarily get them through. There is no veto right in this process. So it makes it a different structure. 
   The public may be scratching their heads as they look at this and saying: What do they agree on? Senator DOMENICI said something that is so true: much of what we did will not have ultimately the effect of becoming law. Why did we do it? We did it because each Member of this body has a right to express themselves about issues. We are concerned about the relevance of a lot of the resolutions that were presented. 
   I hope we will do something about organizing the process, though I will not be here to do it, for the public interest. Before this budget resolution has the effect of turning into appropriations bills that will fund these programs, there is a fairly long way to go. For me, it is the last time I will have a role in passing a budget resolution. I arrive at this point with some wistfulness and anticipation that in years ahead I will be arriving at this time of the year with a degree of nostalgia. 
   It is hard to imagine one could miss this kind of exercise after witnessing the process we just completed. But I must confess, the challenge of arriving at the resolution, as I see it, produces a debate that does raise a conscientious review of the issues, even though we disagree on the paths to get to places we want to be. But each of us, again, has the right to express himself or herself as this process evolves. 
   I am certain the public views some of the antics we have gone through here as curious, to say the least. We heard Senator BYRD, the distinguished Senator BYRD, the historian of the Senate among Members, say he was disappointed in some things. I hope, therefore, a review of the process will take place so we can have a more concise, more orderly program for getting to a budget resolution. 
   In the process, however, of this year 2001 budget resolution, I have to say thank you to Senator DOMENICI, to his chief of staff, now loaded down with the product of his work, Bill Hoagland. I thank Bill, who worked arduously to make sure we had the information we needed, even though we disagreed on some of the process to get to the end of the game. 
   I am grateful to HARRY REID, the Democratic whip, for the role he played in getting this year's budget resolution passed. He was part of a support team for me and left me with time to do some of the things for which I am responsible. He did a wonderful job as a friend and as a leader on the Democratic side, helping us get done. 
   I thank Leader DASCHLE for his faith and support of me throughout the budget resolution negotiations. 
   I thank my colleagues on the Budget Committee, the Republicans, but I am particularly obliged to my Democratic friends and colleagues because of the unity we had through the process. 
   I cannot conclude my remarks without saying the staff support was really special. 
   No. 1 on my team is Bruce King, who is the chief of staff of the Budget Committee, the Democratic staff on the Budget Committee. Sue Nelson is an expert on so many areas, particularly in the health area, on whom lots of the Senators called; Lisa Konwinski and Mitch Warren, who used to work on my personal staff as well; Marty Morris, Nisha Antony, Claudia Arko, Frederic Baron, Gabrielle Batkin, Steve Benson, Maggie Bierwirth, Pat Bogenberger, Rok Chung, and Jim Esquea. 
   I want to thank Randy DeValk, who is part of Senator DASCHLE's team, the person who works on budget for Senator DASCHLE. He was very helpful throughout. 
   I thank our floor staff. They were diligent and always there for information and for support, defining the process so we did not step on too many toes. I think I might have stepped on a couple along the way, but it was not cataclysmic. The process takes a long time to learn. Senator DOMENICI has been doing it for a long time. He is one of the best experts we have. 
   So I thank everyone for their work, some of our Republican friends who voted with us on occasion, and even those Senators with whom I had disagreements on occasion. 
   I want to say--maybe as part of a swan song because come next January I will be doing other things--that even those with whom I most ardently disagreed still earned my respect as Senators, though I could vehemently disagree with their point of view. These are people who are sent here by a constituency we 
   have to recognize. The majority is what it is because the American people sent them here to be a majority. I wish it were otherwise, make no mistake about that. I wish we were in the majority and I had my last year as chairman of the committee. But next best to the chairman on the other side is to be the ranking member and work with a good and decent manager. 
   With that, I say, this is a conclusion of part No. 1 of FRANK LAUTENBERG's retirement from the Senate, an experience which I shall treasure and remember fondly, forever.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Nevada for his courtesy and kind remarks. 
   We have done a lot of work. I commend Senator REED from Rhode Island for his leadership. He had a career in the military before he came to the Congress. He used that background to understand the problem and to put it into perspective. I commend him for his leadership on gun violence issues. 
   I was pleased to hear from our friend from Vermont, the ranking member on the Judiciary Committee. Vermont is known to have a lot of hunters. Vermont is known as a place where there are a lot of guns. As I heard Senator LEAHY say, a lot of these hunters were disappointed at the unwillingness of the gun lobby, personified by the National Rifle Association, in their organization's unwillingness to step forward and make some commonsense adjustments to the law, getting legislation on the books that says guns should not be available willy-nilly to people who want to buy a lethal weapon. 
   I hope we will soon deal with an amendment that will codify our interest in controlling gun violence. We are soon coming upon a very important anniversary. April 20 is the 1-year anniversary of the awful tragedy at Columbine High School. Few can forget that awful day, the shock we all felt when we heard about young people in the high school being assaulted by gunmen and looking at the pictures on television and seeing a young man reaching out for help, fearful for his life, and young people running frantically from the school to get out of the way of the bullets. The consequences were disastrous: 12 classmates were killed, the 2 killers, and a teacher. Twenty-three other students and teachers wounded. I shutter when I recall that bloody carnage. 
   No parent or grandparent can avoid thanking the Lord for the safety of their own families when they see the horror of those moments. Yet that assault was not only an assault on Columbine High School, it was an assault on the sensibilities of our country--the innocent young people scared, desperate, running away from gunmen. 
   Frankly, I thought that would be the ultimate outrage; that would be the ultimate insult to the lawfulness of our society, to our respect for law, to our respect for life; that this would be it and people would stand up and say: Enough; we have had enough; we want to make a change. The cries of people, the tearful students who lost friends and those who lost relatives, sons and daughters, sent an image across this country which I thought would shake through the halls of this Congress which says: Hey, listen, it's time. 
   Poll after poll was done at that time. The numbers were that 80 to 90 percent of the people said they wanted the gun show loophole closed. There are over 4,000 gun shows a year where anyone--any thief, any felon, anyone who is listed on the 10 most wanted list of the FBI--can walk up, take the money out of their pocket, put it down on the table, and nobody asks: What is your name? Where do you live? From what town do you come? 
   That is not what the American people want. I do not understand the NRA and other members of the gun lobby who say this is somehow an intrusion on their personal rights. 
   Where are the personal rights of the family to know that when their children go to school each and every day, they will return home in the same healthy condition as when they went to school? 
   Everyone here has to be aware that on May 14 we are going to have the Million Mom March. I met with people from New Jersey who are participating. I will tell you something. If you talk to women's groups, talk to individual women across this country about what really counts with them, what is the most important thing on their agenda: Is it equal opportunity for jobs? Is it to make sure that pay scales are the same for men and women? What is it that is the most important thing? I will tell you what the most important thing is: To know their children are safe when they go to school. The Million Mom March is organized around that precept that children should be safe, that this society of ours has had enough of guns and the havoc it wreaks in our Nation. 
   That tragic day, almost a year ago, was enough to offend women across the  country to organize a million person march in State after State where it will be taking place. 
   But what has the Congress done to answer the anguished cries of people who have lost a child? Anybody who knows a family who has lost a child, particularly to violence--I guess it does not matter how you lose a child; once you lose a child, it is a terrible thing. The family never recovers. The circumstances never change. Columbine High School will never be the same, even though they had yet another crazy incident there. 
   What happens to those cries? What happens to those pleas? They fall on deaf ears. That is what happens. Not enough people listen, to say: You know what. Yes, we understand there is some debate about the possession of a weapon. But there is nothing in the Constitution--no matter how hard the proponents of guns try--that says you cannot wait a few days while we check to see who you are before we give you a gun. Before we give you an automobile, we check out who you are. 
   What is it that prevents us from saying, look, come on; get together, gun lovers, NRA and the others? What is it that says we have to permit gun purchases by anonymous buyers? There isn't anything in the Constitution that says that. There isn't anything in the Constitution that says you should not have to have a license, that you should not have to be trained before you buy a gun. 
   The Senator from Rhode Island, who is going to propose this amendment, as I indicated, was in the Army as an officer. He is a West Point graduate. He served in Vietnam. He knows what it is to be in war. He served during the period of the Vietnam conflict. I served in Europe during World War II when the shooting was going on. I know what the purpose of a gun is. I learned how to use it. I have never owned one since I got my discharge, I can tell you. 
   But what is it that prevents us from taking up the simplest, commonsense legislation? It is the gun lobby. The response to the cries of the people who want their kids to be able to go to school safely and return is: No, we have a greater allegiance to the NRA and the gun lobby than we have to families across America. What an outrage. But it does not get anything done. 
   I am hoping, with Senator REED's leadership, we are going to get something done today. 
   Congress has done nothing since that time to protect families from gun violence. When I wrote the law to prohibit domestic abusers from getting guns, it was said that it was an unnecessary thing, it was an imposition of law on our citizens. But 33,000--I thank the Senator from Nevada for mentioning it--33,000 domestic abusers have been prevented from owning a gun. We know something else. 
   We know the statistics show that about 150,000 times a year a gun is put to the head of a woman, often in front of her children, and a man threatens to blow her brains out. There is no visible wound, but I guarantee you, there are wounds that carry through life. The children never forget. But we cannot act on it. 
   We are now waiting for something to happen. We are waiting for the juvenile justice bill, which passed overwhelmingly and went to the House, with our gun-loophole-show closer, and it died. The conference committee has been appointed, but nothing has happened since that time. 
   We have had support in the past from Senators on the other side of the aisle on the gun show amendment. Senators DEWINE, FITZGERALD, LUGAR, VOINOVICH, WARNER, and Senator Chafee--who is no longer with us--voted for my amendment at that time. 
   The final juvenile justice bill, as we heard from Senator LEAHY, passed by a vote of 73-25. So there was strong bipartisan support for moving forward on juvenile crime and trying to reduce gun violence. 
   But that was back on May 20--11 months ago. What has happened since then? Shootings have not stopped. We saw a 6-year-old murder another 6-year-old in Michigan. 
   From Mount Morris, MI, to Los Angeles, CA; from Fort Worth, TX, as youngsters in a prayer session were violated by a gun-wielding assaulter, to Conyers, GA; no community is safe from gun violence. 
   But while the vast majority of Americans want Congress to act, some special interests--the National Rifle Association, the gun lobby--have worked with their few allies in Congress, where less than 3 million members of the NRA determine what actions we take on behalf of 260 million Americans. 
   It is not right. Sooner or later, the voters are going to rebel and say: If you do not vote to put common sense into gun possession in this country, we are going to vote you out of office. That is what ought to happen. Boy, if one time that happens in an area where this is the dominant subject, that would be the end of the gun lobby. 
   It is the same old reaction. Every time Congress wants to pass gun safety laws, the NRA works hard to prevent its passage. Lately, we heard a lot of criticism about the enforcement of gun laws. But this is kind of a joke because the rhetoric ignores the facts. The number of Federal firearms cases prosecuted by the U.S. attorneys increased 16 percent from 1992 to 1999--4,754 in 1992 to 5,500 in 1999. 
   So the suggestion that law enforcement is not fighting gun crimes is just wrong. But more importantly, this rhetoric suggests a false choice between enforcement or stronger laws. What we need is both. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor, but not without making mention of the fact that Smith & Wesson, a prominent gun manufacturer, has agreed that they need to do more on gun safety. 
   The company reached an agreement with the administration that will incorporate many of the measures stalled in the conference committee: Background checks at gun shows, child safety locks, and preventing the use of ammunition clips with more than 10 rounds. 
   Congress ought not be trailing behind gun manufacturers when it comes to gun safety. The conference committee ought to complete its job. I support Senator REED's resolution. When it is presented, I hope that all of my colleagues will vote for it. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend from Nevada. 
   I commend the Senator from Virginia for his very thoughtful amendment. I listened carefully to what he had to say. Senator ROBB has the respect of all of us, regardless on which side of the aisle your political initiation or interests fall. 
   As he said, if it looks like and sounds like and talks like it, then we kind of know what it is. I think that is a proper characterization, in all fairness to the distinguished Senator from Georgia. If it is a tax-saving device that later can be used for contributions to private schools, it obviously is. If it is not a voucher, it sure enough resembles one so much that the disguise is more than penetrable. 
   But I wish to talk about the Robb amendment. Senator ROBB talks about the need to modernize our Nation's schools. Boy, I salute that. I am the product of public education. In fact, my parents barely could afford to send me to a free school. 
   I have taken an interest in the community from which I came, Paterson, NJ. It is industrialized, one of the poorest cities in the State of New Jersey--in fact, one of the poorest cities in America in ranking. 
   I looked at the situation with the schools there, schools that I attended. In particular, I looked at one school, a school that we called school No. 6, that I attended where they are barely able to keep plaster on the walls and keep the place in fit condition. I also went to high school in the same city for a while. Knowing my age, one recognizes how old those schools might be. The fact is, we both weathered storms, the schools and I, over a lot of years. But wear and tear shows. 
   We look at these schools and see how inadequately prepared they are for contemporary times. We question what we ought to do there. Since I come out of the computer business, those are my roots. I am a member of something that probably is not noticeable on everybody's calendar, but I am a member of the Information Processing Hall of Fame, which is in Dallas, TX. My former colleague, Bill Bradley, was a Hall of Famer, but of a much more recognizable Hall of Fame, also a much more recognizable participant. 
   But what I know is that unless we go to the Patersons of the country, unless  we go to the cities of the country that are in desperate need of improvements in the physical structure of their schools, we are going to find ourselves leaving out a significant portion of our population--whether rural or urban. 
   I do not mean to boast, but I personally made a contribution to a school in Paterson and stood there and pulled wires with people from the telephone company, who, on a voluntary basis, all pulled wires. And I paid for some small part of the installation of cable that would enable this school, if they ever got the equipment, to at least hook up to the Internet and the world outside their physical building. 
   That is necessary. It is not that we are being good to these kids. We are being good to America. We have to have people who can learn, and we don't care what their background is. If they have the capacity to learn, we ought to give them the tools, as the most advanced country, the largest power in the world that has students who can learn but who don't always get the benefits of the proper tools for an education. That includes the simplest thing, not just pulling cable to hook them up to the Internet, but to make sure the buildings are sound enough to provide reasonable temperatures in the summer and the winter. 
   Nothing is more discouraging to the learning process than to expect someone to function in a school that doesn't have the basic comforts. We have all heard the horror stories about sanitary facilities located floors away from where the classrooms are, where windows are broken, kids can be injured by falling plaster or, worse, even today, asbestos still used in the construction. 
   I commend the Senator from Virginia for standing up for what is right. It is a small cost, when you think about it, as to what we might get in return on investment. Those of us who are in the business world do look at return on investment, and this is one really good one. 
   I hope we are going to get by the partisan divide. We are worried about the digital divide, but we also have to worry about the partisan divide as we discuss the budget and its requirements. We have to kick this football. This is where the game starts, right here in the budget resolution. What we ought to do is have a good clean kickoff and make sure we do it right. I hope when the roll is taken, we defeat the Coverdell amendment and support the ROBB amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will try to consolidate my remarks because I know everybody is anxious to complete work on the budget resolution. 
   I am compelled, as I listen to the discussion here, to talk to the Reed amendment and to talk to those who would disparage our efforts to have sensible gun violence control in this society. 
   I heard it said that what we need in law enforcement is more enforcement; that what we need is a more sincere effort, as if to imply that President Clinton and his administration want to let criminals wander the streets. It is somewhat akin to the argument we hear from those who are NRA spokespersons who say President Clinton is looking for more killings to make his political case. It is an outrageous thing. We hear that all we have to do is note how many laws are on the books. 
   I ask the question: Is the deciding factor how many laws we have on the books? 
   I heard someone say today we have 20,000 laws on the books related to guns. But in this country we kill more than 20,000 a year with guns. We kill over 30,000. That is only a page per victim, if you want to judge it on that basis. It is outrageous. 
   That is not the problem. The problem is that people here don't believe guns kill. People here don't believe a gun is a lethal weapon. People here don't believe we ought to know who it is who buys a gun at a gun show. That is the problem. 
   This morning, I had the privilege of standing with Senator REED and the head of the State police department from Maryland. What he was advocating was more law enforcement, more laws to give them the tools to work with. 
   We had police officers from the area around Providence, RI. They were asking the same thing. They said, give us the tools. It is said, you have enough tools, like the weight of the number of the bills, the numbers of pieces of legislation that you have--again, as if that were the yardstick by which we measure the performance of the society. 
   Go tell the parents of the kids who were killed in Columbine or those who stood in prayer in Fort Worth, TX, or the kids who attended the school in Los Angeles who ran away in fear of a gunman's weapon or in Conyers, GA. Tell those families we have enough laws on the books. Tell them we don't enforce the laws sufficiently--that they will accept that as OK. Well, then I can understand the sacrifice that was made in my family, my home, and the school. 
   I said earlier today that we have a Million Mom March headed for Washington on May 14 this year--a million women from across the country. What are they saying to us? They are saying to us, if you really want to protect women's rights, then tell us our children can go to school, enter the school safely, and leave in the same condition at the end of the day. 
   These are hollow arguments. 
   I hear that we don't prosecute enough. 
   In 1996, there were 22 percent more criminals behind bars for weapons offenses than in 1992. Firearms crimes put 25,000-plus in jail in 1996 compared to 20,681 in 1992. 
   Prosecutions were up 16 percent in 1996 compared to 1992. 
   In 1992, there were 4,754 Federal firearm prosecutions; 1999, 5,500. 
   The argument misses the point when it comes to talking about law enforcement, when in some cases there is no law to enforce. Anybody can walk up at a gun show, go to an unlicensed dealer--an unlicensed dealer can operate in most gun shows, and he is kind of the piggy bank for those who want to escape identity--put their money on the table, and he won't ask them a question. He just gives them as many guns as they can carry, or maybe more than they can carry, in one trip if they want to buy them. 
   Whether you are on the Ten Most Wanted list or you are Osama bin Laden, a terrorist who took refuge in Afghanistan, it doesn't matter; you can buy a gun. 
   We are trying to defend in some peculiar way the right of people to buy guns anonymously. We don't know who they are; we don't know where they are taking the guns. We do know in the Columbine killing, a young woman related to that killing testified before the Colorado Legislature. Robyn Anderson testified she and the two boys, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold who killed the other students, went to the Tanner gun show on a Saturday. She testified:  
   I remember this as being November or December of 1998. When Eric and Dylan had gone the previous day, a dealer told them they needed to bring someone back who was 18. They were both 17 at the time. This was a private--not a licensed dealer. While we were walking around Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check. 
   They bought guns from three sellers. They were all private. They paid cash. There was no receipt. I was not asked any questions at all. There was no background check. All I had to do was show my driver's license to prove I was 18. Dylan got a shotgun. Eric got a shotgun and a black rifle that he bought clips for.  
   The rest, unfortunately, is history. She says:  
   I don't know if Eric and Dylan could have been able to get guns from another source, but I would not have helped them. It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them to buy the guns if I faced a background check.  
   We may need a couple more laws. Despite the fact there are some 20,000 on the books, that hasn't protected approximately 33,000 who lose their lives every year. There are 13,000 homicides, a bunch to suicides, a bunch to accidents. 
   I think the ultimate example of carelessness with guns in our society was when the 6-year-old killed the 6-year-old in Michigan. The gun was left out casually where the child could reach it. Shouldn't we have laws that say a person who owns a gun is responsible for keeping it out of the hands of children? I certainly think so. 
   We are finding the NRA has a broad reach. It reaches into this Chamber. The hand of the NRA muffles sound. It muffles the sound of tearful parents--not necessarily those who lost children but those who are afraid their children might get lost. Those are the sounds we hear, the parents and the grandparents who are saying, in poll after poll: For crying out loud, close that loophole; close that gun show loophole. 
   It is common sense. It doesn't make sense to the gun lobby because they are afraid one inch is a yard. It is ridiculous when we are talking about human lives. 
   I agree with the Senator from New Mexico that we are doing some silly things. But the silliest is to defend against some sensible gun legislation. Ask the people around the country. I know what they want to see. They want their kids protected, their households protected, their communities protected. 
   One thing we have yet to try in this country is to know who owns guns and where the guns will be. We had an incredible battle some years ago when we tried to put the Brady law into place. It is demonstrated on this placard: Gun 
   show loophole goes right through the Brady law. Under Brady, 400,000 people, judged not fit to own a gun, were denied gun permits. We still argue about whether or not there is enough time to check applicants' backgrounds sufficiently to make sure they are not unfit to own a gun. They want to reduce the time from 3 business days to 24 hours. The FBI will tell you; they are out there hunting for 1,500 guns that were sold improperly because they didn't have time to check the information. 
   As we near the close of this debate on a budget resolution, citizens across this country should be aware not only did we work on the numbers, not only did we work on the resources, not only did we work on the guns, we also worked on protecting your children when they go to school. We know the costs that guns have exacted on our society. Yet we cannot pass sensible gun legislation. 
   I commend the Senator from Rhode Island for his amendment. I sincerely hope we can get past the partisan discussion and look into the faces of the families, distant though they are, listen to the pleas of the mothers, the fathers, the grandfathers, grandmothers,  brothers, and sisters and say we have done the right thing--we have tried to reduce gun violence in our society. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000. I would like to thank Senator SNOWE, Senator BOXER, and Senator MURRAY for joining me as cosponsors and I invite others to join us. Congresswoman MALONEY introduced this legislation in the House in February, and it has gained the support of 94 cosponsors on both sides of the aisle in that body. 
   Mr. President, while global population growth has slowed, the world's population reached 6 billion in 1999 and is expected to rise to 8.9 billion by 2050. Nearly all of this growth is occurring in developing nations. High population density puts tremendous strain on water and other resources and takes an increasing toll on the quality and length of human life. 
   Each year, more than 585,000 women die from complications related to pregnancy and childbirth. And millions of women suffer serious health problems following childbirth. 
   International family planning programs are our best hope to slow population growth and decrease mortality rates, and that's why the legislation I'm introducing today is so important. 
   Tomorrow is World Health Day, an appropriate occasion to remember that international family planning programs save the lives of millions of women all over the world. Providing reproductive health care and health education results in safer pregnancies and safer motherhood. 
   Yet this country is paying hundreds of millions of dollars less on international family planning programs today than it did five years ago. We need to restore this country's commitment to helping those in developing countries raise their standards of living, and family planning must be an important part of that assistance. Without this renewed commitment, high fertility rates and rapid population growth will prevent people in the poorest countries from rising out of poverty. 
   The Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000 authorizes $541.6 million--the funding level requested by President Clinton--for bilateral family planning programs and related assistance abroad. It also provides $35 million for the United Nations Population Fund, known as UNFPA. This would return our level of international family planning assistance to where it was in fiscal 1995. This is a sound investment that will bring returns for decades to come. 
   This bill would also reverse the so-called ``gag rule'' that restricts USAID grants to non-governmental organizations abroad that use their own funds to advocate a woman's right to choose or to perform legal medical procedures. Under this bill, the requirements we apply to NGOs would not be more restrictive that the requirements on foreign governments that receive similar assistance. 
   I have fought for years, as a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee, for adequate funding for international family planning programs without restrictions which would limit the reach or effectiveness of our aid.  
   Last year, we were forced to accept the gag rule in exchange for congressional agreement to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations. It was a bitter pill to swallow and we must eliminate this provision now. It's unfair and undemocratic. By restricting the freedom of organizations to engage in public policy debates, the gag rule undermines a central goal of U.S. foreign policy, the promotion of democracy--which has at its core the principles of free and open debate and citizen involvement in government decisions. And this restriction is a serious impediment to our efforts to bring global population levels under control and to protect the lives of millions of women by letting them choose to have only as many children as they can care for responsibly. 
   Mr. President, family planning is even more critical to the health of people in developing countries than it is here in America. Many developing countries lack the hospitals and clinics and doctors and other health-care professionals to provide women with the advice and care they need to have a safe pregnancy. Many lack the facilities and expertise to provide obstetrical and prenatal care women need to deliver healthy babies. 
   Sometimes, a pregnancy can be dangerous, especially if the woman is too young or too old to bear a child. In many poor societies, families have many children because so many die before they reach adulthood and children provide the only support in their parents' later years. As a result, families too often have more children than they can realistically support and face malnutrition or even starvation. Finally, there are those who do not properly consider the potential transmission of deadly diseases such as AIDS or who do not have access to contraceptive devices. 
   For many poor women abroad, family planning clinics offer the only general health care available. Without the critical funding provided in this bill, many of these women will unnecessarily suffer and even die. With this assistance, women and children will have a better chance of living longer, healthier lives. 
   We need this legislation to reduce mortality rates, to combat the spread of HIV/AIDS and other diseases, and to give the poorest nations an opportunity to meet their social, environmental, and economic needs by making family planning available worldwide. 
   Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to join in support of the Saving Women's Lives through International Family Planning Act of 2000. We all have a stake in helping people in the worlds poorer nations plan their families and helping control the impact of population growth on the planet we share.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support the Robb second-degree amendment to help ensure that Congress acts this year to provide a real prescription drug benefit for seniors. 
   Mr. President, prescription drugs are a vital part of health care in this country. In fact, senior citizens spend more of their own money on prescription drugs than on any other health care item. If Medicare were enacted today, it would be unthinkable to create a benefit package that did not include prescription drugs. 
   The resolution before us claims to provide $40 billion for a drug benefit through a reserve fund for Medicare. But there are no reconciliation instructions to make sure that the Congress actually acts--unlike the tax breaks, which the Finance Committee is required to produce. 
   Mr. President, this amendment ensures that Congress really will act on prescription drugs, by requiring that such legislation be enacted before we take up any tax cut. This makes sure that we keep our priorities straight. And that we won't give tax breaks for the wealthy a higher priority than life-saving drugs for seniors. 
   Why is it so important that we move on prescription drug legislation this year? Unfortunately, three of every four Medicare beneficiaries lack decent, dependable coverage for prescription drugs. At least a third of those people have no drug coverage at all. 
   And we're not talking about wealthy people here. Fifty-four percent of the people on Medicare without drug coverage earn about $17,000 a year. Most of those people can't afford to pay the high premiums for Medigap coverage. 
   We just can't justify a health care system that forces elderly Americans to choose between paying for food and paying for medicine. And that's what's happening today. 
   Unfortunately, Congress thus far has failed to act to address the need for prescription drugs. And I'm afraid that if we don't force the issue forward, it will continue to languish. 
   Mr. President, let me be clear. I support targeted tax cuts focused on the real needs of middle class families. But I'm not for moving forward use drain projected surpluses until we've provided seniors with the drugs that could preserve their health, or even save their lives. 
   In my view, before we approve any of these tax cuts, we should do first  things first, and pass legislation to provide prescription drugs to seniors. It's simply a question of priorities. 
   So, Mr. President, I congratulate my colleague, Senator ROBB, for his leadership on this issue, and I urge support of his amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I will take a minute and a half, and then yield to my colleague on the Republican side. 
   Very simply, I fully support this Robb second-degree amendment. We want to be sure that Congress acts this year to provide a real prescription drug benefit for seniors. Senator ROBB offered an amendment that very specifically does that. The only problem we have that I am concerned about is there are no reconciliation instructions. That doesn't ensure that Congress will act to put this very important benefit in place. 
   Having graduated to that status of senior citizen, I can tell you this: When I talk to people in that group, the most important and worrisome thing they have in front of them is whether or not they are going to be able to afford the drugs, not only to keep them healthy but also to provide a decent lifestyle. 
   I commend the Senator from Virginia for having developed this amendment because he knows this is the most critical issue right now affecting the senior citizens beyond having to preserve Social Security and Medicare. 
   I yield the time remaining to my friend from New Mexico.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will speak off the budget resolution itself. I have listened with interest to the comments of the Senator from Colorado. I salute what he says he wants to do to get the debt reduced more than anybody else: Get it lower, bring it down. It doesn't matter how we get it there, if we have to burn the house down to get it. 
   There isn't anybody here who doesn't know we are terribly short of funding for programs we need to have in place, that even the Republican budget resolution--and I serve on the Budget Committee--was passed by the majority without any support from the minority. None of the Democrats voted for this resolution. 
   I think it is fair to say the principle of paying down the debt was established by President Clinton and his administration when they said, ``Save Social Security, pay down the debt.'' They were almost simultaneous acts. Some disagree and say it is another IOU from the Government. But it is an IOU from a much stronger balance sheet. I come from the business world, and that is the way I look at things. 
   I ask the Senator from Colorado, if he will indulge me, what is the total savings he hopes to have or the total debt reduction he plans to have over the 5-year period?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I appreciate the Senator's response. I am trying to get it nailed down to a figure so we can discuss it with a degree of understanding. 
   If it was $15 billion, $30 billion, $45 billion, $60 billion, and $75 billion, it comes to about $255 billion in 5 years.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. To be clear, because I think there is perhaps some misinterpretation of what the Senator is looking for, that is pay down the debt as a mandate of the budget process--pay down the debt, and that is regardless of where those payments come from. I understand the Senator wants to get the debt paid down. But I just want to be sure I am correct in what I understand his intention is, once again to pay down the debt. Regardless, we are going to take $15 billion out next year, and the next year it is $30 billion, and then $45 billion, et cetera, among the first things. That is a mandate.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator. I hope it is clear to everybody who is listening that this is a cut taken without regard for the consequences. It doesn't matter where it comes from. It can come out of Medicare, based on what we are hearing. It could come out of education. It could come out of COPS. Pull in the FBI, cut the number of FBI agents, cut safety programs, cut Coast Guard--cut, cut. It is like the harvest at the end of the growing season--just cut it. The only problem is we have other obligations. 
   Maybe the Senator from Colorado thinks the principal obligation is similar to running an accounting office such as H&R Block, or something such as that. We cut regardless of the 
   consequences. Take down the respirators. Take down the blood transfusions. If the patient dies, the patient dies. 
   We can't have that. Forgive me, but everybody knows that this is a political idea whose time should never come. We cannot plan on eliminating the debt without establishing where it is that the funds are going to come from to pay down that debt. I did not hear the Senator say ``only if there is a surplus.'' He didn't allocate the resource to the surplus. Even if we are in debt because of an economic downturn of some significance, we will just pay down the debt. We will take it out of programs that are life-sustaining programs in some cases--or increasing  taxes. That is where we have to go if there is no accounting. I know the Senator, in addition to being a professional, is also, if I may say, a businessman. He knows what balance sheets and P&L statements look like. We are going to just pay down the debt regardless of where it comes from. 
   I know the distinguished chairman of the committee on which I serve, the Budget Committee, has a word or two he wants to pass along. I must say that this proposal, unless we know where and how the funds are going to be generated to pay down that debt, you will forgive me, borders on the reckless. 
   I ask the Senator to answer in short form, because it is on opposition time, where does the Senator plan to get the funds to pay down this debt?

   I point out that this cut would be to reduce the Republican budget resolution plan for spending by $205 billion.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. While I wasn't present to hear Senator BYRD's presentation, there is no doubt in my mind that the Byrd proposal is one we have to support. The last thing we want to do now is to reduce that tax in order that we might give OPEC or the distributors, whomever, a chance to boost the price for the difference. 
   One of the toughest things we have to do is to try to meet our obligations with the resources we have available. The American people know very well that one of the most important things we do is to maintain our transportation infrastructure. I plan to do whatever I can to see that that is done. 
   My remarks are short, but they are very supportive. I congratulate Senator BYRD for his usual wisdom in presenting something that we have to think seriously about and, frankly, I support fully. I thank him for that.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. I congratulate Senator ROTH for this amendment because this is not an easy one for him to do. The fact of the matter is, there is an assumption that there would be $1.2 billion in revenues resulting from this. But the question is, What is the appropriate thing to do? Again, Senator ROTH, chairman of the Finance Committee, knows only too well how difficult it is to raise revenues, but I wanted to make sure we do the right thing. 
   So I am pleased to support Senator ROTH's amendment. It expresses very clearly the sense of the Senate that these provisions, those that allow drilling in the ANWR, are not to be included in this resolution. 
   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is the second largest wildlife refuge in the United States. It takes in a lot of territory, 19 million acres of mountains, forests, wetlands, wild rivers, tundra. It is home to a spectacular variety of plants and animals--caribou and polar bears, grizzly bears, wolves, quantities of migratory birds, the things that everyone of us would like our children and grandchildren to be able to see, to be able to believe that the animals that were here when their father or grandfathers or great grandfathers came on this Earth--that they will be able to see them as well; not just in picture books, but in real life--grizzly bears and polar bears, wonderful things. 
   A legacy is more important, frankly, than some of the money we are talking about to fund programs. The most important legacy we can leave our children and our grandchildren is a natural condition that enables them to see the animals, see the forests, go fishing in the streams, drink the water. That is the issue. The presence of these migratory birds, and grizzly bears, so many other species, in a nearly undisturbed state, have led some to call the area America's Serengeti. 
   I have been to the Serengeti and I have been to the ANWR. I flew up there right after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was up there within 2 days of the time the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I was chairman of the Subcommittee on Transportation, which had the Coast Guard as one of its responsibilities. The Coast Guard airplane picked me up and flew me up there immediately. I wanted to see what was happening. 
   I will never forget the sight of that oil sheen floating across Prince William Sound. By then, very good people in our Government, the Forest Service and others, were up there picking up birds, seals--oil covered, couldn't breathe--on these tiny little islands, put there by helicopters. It looked like a dangerous assignment. But you could see the reach of the oil just fingering out all across Prince William Sound. It was a devastating thing to see. 
   I was an environmentalist before I came here and I still am. By environmentalist I don't mean I just contribute to the environmental organizations or anything like that. I genuinely love the environment. It is the one thing that gives continuity through the ages that perhaps we can protect. 
   The nearby Continental Shelf provides the coastal waters with a rich nutrient base, allowing the region high productivity which in turn supports an unusually wide variety of marine mammal diversity--ANWR. 
   I flew across the ANWR in a single-engine airplane when I was up on my visit to Prince William Sound because I wanted to see what the area was like. What I saw were abandoned oil rigs in an area called Dead Horse, the Prudhoe Bay area. 
   I saw rusting derricks and abandoned junk lying there. It was a pitiful blight on that beautiful expanse of nature. 
   I then flew over the ANWR, this snow desert. I saw signs of some animals. It was a breathtaking sight. I then made a pledge to myself that I would do whatever I could to protect this pristine area. I owed it to my children who may never get up there to see it, but they have a relationship with that area that is inexplicable but nevertheless real. 
   I returned from the South Pole in January. I am not an adventurer, but I am interested in what happens in our world. I went down there to see what was happening with climate change and the National Science Foundation. I went there to see whether or not there were things we could discover about our climate change and our environment about which we could do something.  
   Scientists are still trying to search out what it is that is causing the ice melts in the South Pole that causes--I address myself to Senator ROTH--a piece of the ice continent to break up, as they described it, twice the size of the State of Delaware and before that a piece the size of the State of Rhode Island. The next thing we know, we are going to see a piece floating out there the size of Texas, and then we will hear a squawk in here because that ice is melting rapidly. Seventy percent of the world's fresh water is stored in the South Pole. 
   I relate the North and South Poles to our existence, and that environmental paradise called ANWR is part of that. 
   Arctic ecosystems are delicately balanced and are some of the most ecologically sensitive ecosystems in the world. The harsh climate and short growing season leave very little time for species that have been harmed to adequately recover. The system's short food chains make a loss of a portion of the chain even more significant. This delicate balance can easily be disrupted by human intrusion. 
   Oil exploration threatens the ecosystems that surround it through noise pollution, air pollution, on and offshore oil spills, and the destruction of the natural habitat. We all remember the horror of the Exxon Valdez spill--the images of the birds and seals and other animals covered in oil, their life literally being choked out of them. We remember the wide eyes on our children's faces as they watched the natural beauty of Alaska being destroyed. We saw it on television. 
   According to the Exxon Valdez Trustee Council, many of the natural resources injured in that spill still show little, if any, sign of recovery. The danger is real. The Exxon Valdez spill took place in 1989. There was a lawsuit against Exxon. It was resolved in a damage suit which awarded $5.3 billion. Of that, $300 million has been paid--$300 million in a $5.3 billion award. That was over 10 years ago. 
   What restitution was given to the fishermen and those who depend on the area for their livelihood? What restitution was made to those species that were endangered, whether it was eagles, seals, ducks, you name it? Some of them suffocated because of the film of oil that covered their natural structure. 
   Here we are. That is what happens when the environment is damaged. 
   We are all aware of the problems this country is facing from higher oil prices, and our people should not have to pay for profiteering by OPEC, especially those people in the modest income category who depend on oil to heat their homes. 
   Prices at the pump have risen dramatically in the last year. My own State of New Jersey was hit hard by extremely high prices for home heating oil during a surprisingly cold winter, as it was throughout the Northeast. The occupant of the Chair who is from the State of Rhode Island knows about what we are talking. 
   We should use this wake-up call to increase our efforts in conservation. I have not heard two words about conservation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes from the resolution. 
   We have to talk about energy conservation. We have to work at it, and we need the cooperation of everybody--citizens, automobile manufacturers, all of us. We need to be energy efficient and explore the use of alternative sources of energy, instead of just falling to: Well, let's drill in the ANWR. 
   We should also strongly encourage our friends in OPEC, as President Clinton has, to significantly increase production. I will tell my colleagues straight out, I believe they owe it to us. Although I think the increase that was just enacted should have been larger, I was slightly encouraged by OPEC's decision to increase production which will help to stabilize our prices. 
   It is essential we continue our efforts on this front, and I look forward to another OPEC production increase at their June meeting. We have to remind the oil-producing nations in the Middle East that when they dialed 911, we answered the phone with over 400,000 of our young people put on their soil to defend Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and the surrounding area. We placed our young people in harm's way to protect what was interpreted to be a global interest. 
   We sent our young people far from home, into danger, causing a lot of disruption in their lives. We are still not sure of the consequences of exposure to a polluted environment. Our citizens are suffering, and it is time for them to return the favor. Friendship is a two-way street. We have to ask for favors as easily as we dole them out. 
   I am pleased to tell the American people that some relief is in sight. I look forward to more positive news in June. What we cannot do is use this situation as an excuse to endanger even more of our dwindling natural resources. 
   I speak as the ranking member of the Budget Committee. While I disagreed with the outcome of the budget resolution, the fact of the matter is, we worked diligently to fashion a budget resolution on which we could agree. 
   One of the things that passed with a majority vote was to gain $1.2 billion in revenues from drilling in ANWR. Senator BOXER, so eloquent in her response, reminds us that even in the Budget Committee there was doubtful about whether or not this source of revenue ought to be allowed. It was an 11-11 tie. It took a bipartisan effort, even though there was only one Republican. It is significant that this Republican Senator was voting with the Democrats because that is almost a no-no, as we say, but it happened. 
   Senator ROTH is making an earnest appeal to save a wildlife preserve, nature's bounty, for all of us. It is not simply an Alaskan problem, it is a national problem. It is a global problem, and we must not allow that drilling to take place. 
   I commend the Senator from Delaware for his amendment. I hope my colleagues will support it. I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate presented by my distinguished colleagues on the other side who are for drilling in ANWR: Don't worry about it. After all, look at what happened in these other places. They are drilling foreign oil for consumption by Americans. We have lost so many jobs in the oil fields. 
   I will tell you about those jobs in the oil fields. You tell me where there is a shortage of jobs in this country, and I will tell you where they can get employed immediately. Tell me where there are people looking for work, I  will tell you where they can get employed immediately. 
   The fact is, yes, we are importing more oil. We ought not to be. I am no different than anybody else when we talk about those who owe us a responsibility to make sure we have the products that we helped save when we sent our young people to war in 1990 and 1991. We cannot disagree about that. One is not less patriotic than the other. This is not a question of loyalty. This is a question of how the world functions. 
   Right now, those of us in the environmental community say we ought to be cautious about the use of our precious, pristine wildlife areas. I heard the Senator from Oklahoma say--I do not want to mimic what he said, but he did say: Well, that area that is reserved for drilling, some 2,000 acres, is not so pretty anyway. 
   It was hard for me to believe my ears. What do you mean it is not so pretty anyway? We have some areas in our country that are not so pretty that attach to areas that are beautiful. It is the not-so-pretty areas that help keep the pretty areas, and those that are essential for our existence as a species, the human species, to function. So we cannot dismiss it like that. 
   With all of the best intentions of managing the way we transport our oil and we explore for it, it is all subject to human frailties. If we have had a pipeline that has worked well for lots of years, I salute it. But, remember this, in 1989 when the Exxon Valdez ran aground--and it was human error, there is no doubt about that but you cannot remove it. We lost a spaceship with our precious astronauts aboard because of some human error. These things do not happen without human intervention. We cannot dismiss this and say: Don't worry about it; everything will be all right. We will take care of it. 
   I say that is not so. 
   I wish we could get all our Senators to do a flyover of the ANWR. I guarantee there would be a majority voting the other way, saying do not drill there unless there is no other way in the world for us to survive. 
   We have other sources of oil, other sources of energy being considered and developed. There is work going on in Azerbaijan. You know, when it is said we should only consume American oil to the extent we need oil, I do not believe that is necessarily so. 
   I would rather save that reserve. Heaven forbid if we need it some day in the future. I would like to bring it in from other sources. There are minerals in this country which we do not mine anymore because it is cheaper and better on the environment to import some of those minerals. That is the way things go. 
   We have become a profligate society in our use of energy. We have SUVs popping up everywhere. The automobile companies do not mind making them. The workers of those automobile companies do not mind working there. The guys who work in the gas stations--whether the oil comes from Saudi Arabia or from Oklahoma or Texas--do not mind their jobs. They have businesses that are based on supplying that energy. 
   We are a society that is overblown with riches, and we are using whatever energy we want. We consume fresh air with congestion. There are more cars out there than we know what to do with, but that does not stop us from using our cars. 
   We are saying, as long as we are profligate, just wasting it, let's get it; let's go up to the ANWR and drill in that pristine area described in different fashions as beautiful or not so beautiful or the home for some of the animals; they will survive anyway. 
   I say do not take the risk. I would rather see us practice conservation, which we have not done in this society of ours. I have not heard anybody--I am talking about either from the administration presently in power or any of us--talk about conservation programs: Save it, don't just use it; save it if you are concerned about it. But no, look at the traffic lines. Nobody wants to save oil.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as to this debate about whether or not it is American jobs, Americans, thank goodness, are working at jobs that are productive and have given us the strongest economy ever seen in the history of mankind. We ought to reduce our dependence. I agree with my friends on the other side, but that does not mean we have to go to a source that raises questions about our ability to preserve the environment. 
   I said it before, when I think of my children, one of the most important assets I see in this country is a good environment, good natural resources. Even if they never get to visit Alaska, I have done it. I do not want to be a ``Johnny's been all over the place,'' but I was also in Kuwait. I saw the situation the Senator from Alaska described. I was in an airplane several thousand feet in the air. The windshield was covered with soot from the burning oil fields. It was a terrible waste of lives and energy, but it happened. 
   What we have to do is make sure our allies, the people whom we worked to save, understand what we mean when we call on them to help us through a crisis. I could not agree more with my friends on that score. I believe we should have gotten much tougher than we did. 
   I had an occasion to speak to a diplomat from one of the Mideast countries. I said: Do you know what you are doing? You may make a better profit right now, but you are alienating the American people, and you are not going to recover from that so easily. Do not depend on us when you issue an alarm--``help save our skins; help save us.'' Some of them went to other 
   countries to enjoy themselves when we did the fighting. That is not going to happen easily again. 
   The Senator from Delaware, the chairman of the Finance Committee, and some of the friends on the Republican side, including Senator SNOWE, who voted with Senator BOXER on protecting the ANWR--there was a commentary in the Washington Post from someone who cannot be declared a cockeyed liberal or crazy environmentalist. I will read the quote before I identify who it is:  
   I totally agree that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a truly unique pristine ecosystem, and I believe we should not damage it. It should be set aside in wilderness designation in perpetuity, Smith wrote to the New Hampshire Citizens for Arctic Wilderness.  
   That is Senator BOB SMITH, someone we know well, who is chairman of the environment committee, and we are hearing from the chairman of the Finance Committee that we ought not do this. These are people who deserve to be heard, and we know there are other people in the Republican Party who agree with us. We are going to find out when we put this to a vote. The vote will come sometime tomorrow. 
   I hope we will close this debate at this point. While everything to be said has been said, not everybody has said everything. I yield back any time I requested from the resolution which I did not use.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank Senator DOMENICI. I appreciate his comments. 
   As noted, this is my last year as the ranking member of the Budget Committee. As everyone around here knows, the ranking member harbors usually one thought, and that is to move to the chairmanship to give their colleague on the other side of the aisle a chance to work as a ranking member, to understand fully what it is like. 
   Before I begin a discussion of the budget resolution--and I again thank Senator DOMENICI for his kind comments; the relationship has been a good one--it has been a privilege and an honor to represent the Senate Democrats on the Budget Committee, and I am going to miss it. In my early days in the Senate, I never played with the thought of being a leader in budget matters, never expecting to be the senior Democrat. In fact, I did not even in the beginning days intend to be on the Budget Committee. But I had a good friend whom I knew before I came to the Senate, Senator JOE BIDEN from Delaware. He pulled me aside early in my career and made me an offer that sounded too good to be true. ``FRANK,'' he said, ``you're such a good friend and such a good Senator that I'm going to resign my seat on the Budget Committee, and I'm going to give it to you.'' 
   Only later did I come to realize what Senator BIDEN was really up to. He knew what the Budget Committee function was. He knew how difficult some of the discussions would become, and he knew conclusions arrived at are rarely satisfactory. I forgive him. It has taken me a decade to do that, and I am not going to hold a grudge any longer. 
   Seriously, while I fell into the position of ranking member--that is, the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee--I found it not only interesting but a rewarding position. One of the principal reasons is that I have had the privilege to serve with a very distinguished Senator, our chairman, PETE DOMENICI. Senator DOMENICI and I worked together from different beliefs, with very different views about Government and its proper role. While we have often disagreed, I have tremendous respect and even affection for him. We learned something about the personal sides of each other's lives, which reduces barriers that often arise from competitive views. When one understands what makes the other person tick and hears his concerns and lets him understand your concerns, it makes for a different kind of alliance than the traditional debate. 
   Over the years, we developed an appreciation and respect for one another. Senator DOMENICI's mastery of the budget comes not only from years of experience but lots of hard work as well. It comes from a genuine commitment he has to serving his country to the best of his ability. I have learned a lot from Senator DOMENICI, and I publicly thank him for his friendship over the years. 
   By their nature, debates on the budget tend to be more partisan than other debates. After all, setting a broad plan for allocating resources necessarily depends on judgments based on established principles we bring with us from our views and priorities influenced by our respective parties and affiliations. 
   It is no surprise that our parties have different perspectives on this. In fact, in some ways, this diversity of views is one of our Nation's great strengths; we can talk 
   about these things and air our views and give the public a chance to hear what it is we are saying and in what we believe. 
   Still, I cannot help but regret that budget debates over the past decade have often become so entirely partisan. I saw it with the Democrats as well as Republicans. No one party is at fault. It does not serve the Nation as we would all want to do. I hope perhaps, if the era of surpluses can be sustained longer, we can finally inject more bipartisanship into the process. 
   I may represent Democrats, but I have respect for my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I do not always appear to be understanding of their views, but they, too, adhere to the principles that brought them here. While it is not pleasant for me to accept it, I am often reminded: They were sent here as a majority by the people across this country and we have to respect or acknowledge that fact. But though I serve in the minority, I sincerely believe the approach the budget brings to the table is the right one for America. I know from personal experience that Government has a role to play, in my view, in the lives of our people and is to exercise that role responsibly. 
   I make that judgment based on personal experience. I have said it before on the floor of the Senate, and I will take a minute in this twilight of my career to restate it. 
   My father died when he was 43. My mother was 36. I had already enlisted in the Army. I watched my father's health disintegrate in front of my eyes--13 months of pain, agony, and degradation. He died, again, after I had enlisted in the Army. He died not only leaving the grief and the heartache which accompanies the death of a young man--my sister, my mother and I comprised the entire family; my sister was 12, and I was 18--not only did we experience the pain of the loss, but we were deeply in debt to doctors and hospitals. My mother tried her best to meet those obligations. I was sending home, when I had the opportunity, $50 a month out of my pay. That was not very much. 
   Oh, if we had only had health insurance at that time, if we had only some way for the Government to join us in our quest to stay alive as a family and do what my father always wanted us to do--be productive citizens. 
   My next experience which helped develop my thinking about Government's role was when I was able to take advantage of the GI bill after my service in World War II in Europe during the height of the war and go to a university that otherwise would have been unavailable to me. We could never have afforded the tuition no matter how  hard we worked because we also had to support and unite the three of us. 
   That GI bill made an enormous difference, not only in my life, but permit me a moment of immodesty to say that I helped create a business that created an industry, the computing industry, which is a bigger part of the computer atmosphere, the computer functioning, the computer industry, than the hardware side: Computing, providing services. We were pioneers. And I am a member of something called the Hall of Fame of Information Processing in Dallas, TX. 
   Education enabled me to do that. I became very active in philanthropy and was national chairman of one of the largest charities in the world. At the same time, I ran a company that employed lots and lots of people--over 16,000--when I came to this Senate. 
   So much of what I have done has been dependent on the education I was able to receive as a contribution by my fellow Americans and my country. 
   Then, the privilege of serving here for 18 years has made an impression on me that will last for life. 
   That is how I have acquired my view of what Government's role might be. And we dare not turn our back on it. 
   With that, I will turn to the business directly at hand. 
   Mr. President, in my role as ranking member, I begin by laying out the broad budget principles with which most Democrats agree. Perhaps most fundamentally, Democrats believe the budget should address the needs of ordinary Americans as it prepares our Nation for the future. It should strengthen Social Security and Medicare; provide prescription drug coverage for our seniors desperate for some relief as they try to protect their health from the financial burden of high prescription costs; invest in education, health care, defense, and other compelling needs. 
   We should provide targeted tax cuts for those struggling to advance the well-being of the next generation. At the same time, it should maintain fiscal discipline, reduce our debt, as most people in our country would want to do on a personal basis. The happiest day for lots of families is when the mortgage is paid off or when the bills are finally paid for something that was necessary to acquire or, as we know these days, to help people provide an education or assist in providing an education for their children. At the same time, we want to protect our Nation's economic prosperity. 
   In my view, this budget resolution fails to meet these goals. It would use virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus for tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the wealthy. It would require deep and unrealistic cuts in domestic priorities, such as education and health care. 
   It proposes far less debt reduction than the budgets developed by President Clinton and the Senate Democrats. It fails to ensure that the Congress will consider legislation to establish a prescription drug benefit. Finally, by covering only 5 years of operations, unlike the 10 years we worked with last year, the resolution hides its long-term costs and weakens fiscal discipline. 
   I want to address each of these points. 
   The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, says that over the next 5 years, the non-Social Security surplus is going to be $171 billion. We do not have any disagreement about that. That is what they say. This assumes that Congress freezes discretionary spending at the current real levels, which means, very simply, that in order to protect the funding of these programs, we have to allow for some inflation increases, 
   some inflationary adjustments, as modest as they might be. 
   In fact, if Congress increases domestic spending at the same rate as recent years, which has been higher than inflation, the actual surplus would even be smaller than that $171 billion. 
   Still, to give the majority the benefit of the doubt, we will ignore history for the moment and optimistically assume the non-Social Security surplus will be as projected, $171 billion. 
   The budget resolution, passed by the Republican majority, calls for tax breaks of $150 billion. I say that is at a minimum because there is a reserve there for additional increases. 
   But this reduction in future surpluses would also require that the Government would pay more interest on the outstanding debt, in this case $18 billion more. Thus, the real cost of the tax breaks isn't $150 billion; it is $168 billion when we add the $18 billion for additional interest. That consumes virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus of $171 billion. This isn't mysterious; it is plain arithmetic. 
   People watching this debate might ask themselves: If the tax breaks use virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus, how can the resolution also provide funding for any of the new initiatives it claims to support, such as increases in military spending, prescription drug coverage, agricultural risk management reform, payments to counties, nuclear waste disposal activities, and various other claims of increases in discretionary programs? 
   The real answer is, it cannot. There is no way to fit all of this new spending in roughly the $3 billion that remains of the non-Social Security surplus. The numbers just do not add up. 
   Unfortunately, the majority seeks to sidestep the problem by assuming huge unspecified cuts in domestic programs. The resolution calls for a 6.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary programs over the next 5 years. 
   Because we are trying to address this to the public at large, I am going to take a moment to explain what this means. 
   A 6.5-percent cut in nondefense discretionary means, outside of defense, those programs that many of us think are essential that have been in place will get a 6.5-percent cut. A 6.5-percent cut over 5 years is pretty substantial because by the time you got to the fifth year, the cut enlarges to 8.2 percent. In fact, since the resolution claims to protect some specific programs, the cuts in other areas would be well over 10 percent. 
   The Office of Management and Budget has analyzed how cuts such as this could affect ordinary Americans. Here are just a few examples. 
   Mr. President, 20,000 teachers planned to be hired would not be hired. Those teachers were planned to be hired to reduce class sizes. 
   Five thousand communities would lose assistance to help construct and modernize their schools. There are not many people in this country who do not realize we have this enormous number of school buildings that are just inadequate for the purpose that they exist; that is, to provide an atmosphere where our children can learn. If plaster is falling from the ceilings, or there is no heating in the winter or ventilation in the summer, we know that is not an atmosphere conducive to learning. 
   So there are 5,000 communities that would get help, but they won't under the Republican plan; 62,000 fewer children would be served by the Head Start Program--one of the most successful programs this country has; 19,000 fewer researchers, educators, students receive support from the National Science Foundation. And if there is one place where America excels, it is in research and in science. 
   I took a trip to the South Pole in January. People ask, ``Why did you go there?'' It's a far and tough trip. I went there because I am worried about the climate, about the forecasts which talk about ever more severe tornadoes and things such as cyclones and other natural disasters. I wanted to know what is happening with the weather and climate studies that we do down there. 
   I will tell you, one need not be a scientist to know that we have problems. Now we are talking about an icefloe that is cracking away from the main part of the continent twice the size of Delaware. We had one the size of Rhode Island float off some years ago. One day we are going to see an iceberg, an icefloe that is the size of Texas. What are we going to do about that? Are we going to say maybe we can push it back and glue it together? Everybody knows that is not going to happen. It says the ice is melting at an ever faster rate, and 70 percent of the fresh water in the world exists at the South Pole. If that starts mixing with the saline of the oceans, we will have serious problems. They may not be problems that affect anybody working in this room today, but I worry about my grandchildren and about their children and about the future of mankind. 
   There will be 19,000 fewer researchers. Funding for all new federally led cleanups of toxic waste sites would be eliminated. I notice that the Republican  candidate for President, George W. Bush, announced his interest in a brownfields program, which is something we have been trying to do here for a long time. I am glad to see that acknowledgement take place, to turn these fallow sites into productive, functioning areas where business can flourish and people can visit. We can give some life to some communities--many of them urban communities that are in various stages of decay and would like to be able to move up and away from that. 
   We would have 430 fewer border patrol people available to safeguard our borders. Everybody knows what that problem is. 
   The list goes on and on. As most people around here recognize, cuts of this magnitude are totally unrealistic, and they are not going to happen. We are going to play games--ping-pong--with the budget of the United States. In the final analysis, neither Republicans nor Democrats will tolerate these cuts. 
   This is not the first time the Senate has assumed deep, unspecified cuts in a budget resolution. Last year's resolution included similarly unrealistic things. Not surprisingly, by the end of the year, the Republican majority--not the President--had approved the appropriations bills, spending about $35 billion more than it planned for the year initially. That is the same time and the same status that we have right now. No doubt, something similar is going to happen this year. We are not going to see Government close down. We learned that lesson. It was vivid and searing, and it is going to stay forever in our memories. 
   So we are not going to take those cuts that would make departments of Government inoperative or inadequate. Who is 
   going to let go all these FBI agents and the border guards? One of the greatest concerns our citizens have is to be secure in their homes, on the streets, and in their communities. Are we going to reduce law enforcement? We are not. We may say so, or we may not even say so. We simply hide it in the volume of pages and numbers that are presented to the public. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican budget relies on these unrealistic cuts for its various increases in mandatory spending, such as aid to farmers, prescription drugs, and other programs long ago, for the most part, considered essential. The cost of those increases--$62 billion for those mandatory programs--would be locked in up front. The savings, however, would not be. When Congress later fails to make the assumed cuts in appropriations bills, funds for these new entitlements, it will come from only one place--Social Security. 
   One might think that assumptions of deep, unrealistic cuts in discretionary spending would allow the Republicans to claim significantly more debt reduction than the budgets proposed by Democrats. However, if one assumes that the Republican spending cuts actually materialize, which is extremely unlikely, if not impossible, the Republican budget still would reduce much less than President Clinton and Senate Democrats. The Republican plan will use non-Social Security surpluses to reduce only $19 billion, which is contrary to what is being said, over the next 5 years. By contrast, the President's budget would reduce the $90 billion of debt, over the same period, nearly five times as much. This difference in debt reduction helps show how extreme the GOP tax breaks are. 
   Throughout the markup on the resolution, Republicans claimed that their budget contained over $1 trillion of debt reduction. However, this figure is based almost entirely on Social Security surpluses, and these surpluses are off budget, and both parties have committed to protecting them. Yet when it comes to the portion of the budget that remains subject to congressional discretion, Republicans have refused to devote significant resources for debt reduction. In doing so, they have rejected repeated calls by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan to make debt reduction our first priority. 
   My next concern about the budget resolution is that it fails to ensure Congress will act on legislation establishing a prescription drug benefit. This is in marked contrast with its treatment of tax breaks which the resolution's reconciliation instructions require of the Finance Committee. This differential treatment is troubling, especially given resistance from the Republican leadership to a meaningful universal benefit. I hope that as the debate proceeds we can take steps to ensure Congress really does approve a prescription drug benefit this year. 
   My final concern about the budget resolution is that it covers only 5 years--I mentioned that earlier--not the 10 included in last year's resolution. Those projections came out with--even though we know that forecasts are not necessarily precise, they are a gauge. Last year, we included them because it seemed to present a favorable position to the Republican few. This year, we dropped back to 5 years because they know very well that the second quintile is going to be one that spells disaster. This has the effect of hiding the long-term costs of its tax breaks, and it also weakens the budget resolution as a means of enforcing long-term fiscal discipline since points of order would not be available against tax breaks that explode in cost after 5 years. 
   During markup, it was suggested that the budget resolution should cover only 5 years because CBO produces only 5-year estimates. That isn't true. In fact, since last year, CBO has been producing 10-year projections. So why are these projections being ignored? Because they, again, don't like the outcome of the second 5 years. Thus, no longer is there a good excuse to restrict the budget resolution to only 5 years. 
   Considering that we are facing huge new liabilities when the baby boomers retire, we need to think longer term. We need to take all long-term costs into account when establishing and enforcing fiscal policy. 
   Thus, I reluctantly conclude that the Republican budget fails to prepare for our future or address the needs of ordinary Americans today. It allocates virtually the entire non-Social Security surplus for tax breaks. It would require drastic, unrealistic cuts in these particular programs--such as education and health care. It fails to make debt reduction a priority. It fails to ensure prompt action to provide prescription drugs to seniors. And it fails to maintain fiscal discipline for the long term. 
   For all of these reasons, I join with the Democrats on the Budget Committee in opposing this resolution. 
   When we discussed tax breaks and discussed what the standard bearer for the Republican party has advocated--tax breaks that come in at over $500 billion the first 5 years--there was a strange silence that took place over the majority of the Republicans sitting on the Republican side of the Budget Committee. 
   There were a couple of murmurs about: Well, we haven't given up. We are not going to pass that now. 
   They did that by a vote. One of our distinguished Democrats proposed it in a vote, and the support just wasn't there. 
   Again for these reasons, joining with the Democrats, I hope we can make appropriate adjustments and amend that process for a more realistic budget. 
   I look forward to working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle in an effort to improve the resolution before it gets voted on in the Senate. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I understand my colleagues are pressed for time and would like to speak. I hope they will be recognized at this point.

But if we can hold off until he makes his remarks, assuming he will be here momentarily, then we can talk together about whether or not we can make an agreement that would constitute a specific number of amendments, equally distributed here, so we can begin a process of amendments.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a moment for those who may be wanting to take a look at the Budget Committee Democrats' new web site--I do not know how rapidly people can write down the address, but here it is in full colored splendor: http://budget.senate.gov/democratic. 
   That is the address. We know people will immediately run, in large numbers, to see what is being said there. 
   At the site they will see a summary of the budget resolution, the Democratic alternative, background on the budget process, links to other budget-related information, presented on a colorful chart. We even provide a budget quiz for those who want to test their perception of what we are doing. We will also be maintaining a mailing list for those people who want to stay up to date about budget matters. 
   Please take a look, if you will, at the address. Once again, we will provide it in case people want to jot it down. I need not read it. I think it is visible. They ought to be able to contact Democratic Budget Committee members. I thank Rock Cheung of our staff for doing such a great job in putting that web page together. 
   I now wish to talk about something that has troubled me, something that, frankly, I do not understand. But to put it simply, there was a change from the budget resolution--if I might have the attention of the distinguished Senator. 
   I want to point out the fact that there was a change from the budget resolution as passed by the committee by a majority vote--a change in numbers, which is hardly allowable, and certainly not acceptable--after the committee deliberation, after the committee passed the bill, after the committee presented it to the Senate body, as we see it now. To make a change in the numbers--whether it is small or large doesn't matter, but the process is not allowed, as I understand it, by virtue of rule XXVI. I want to point out that this resolution is not the same, and it was not only a technical change but, rather, it is dramatically different. It was changed after our markup, after we all sat around and voted; some voted for it and some voted against it. It is a change to the tune of $60 billion in lower spending in each of the fiscal years 2001 and 2002. 
   There was a reason this was done, Mr. President. While it is understandable, it is not acceptable to change it after the markup, after the contract is signed, essentially. If a contract is signed and somebody decides let's change the terms of the contract, that would be unacceptable in a business structure. As a matter of fact, it would engender a lawsuit in very easy fashion if it were done in the business world. This was done to avoid a point of order against the resolution. 
   Whenever we talk in this arcane language around here, I believe we need to spell it out. What we are saying to those who don't work here on a regular basis is that instead of 51 votes, you need 60 votes if you want to make a change. Well, in other words, if there is a call for a waiver of the budget, it falls to one side or the other to get 51 votes, which can easily be accomplished by the majority because they have 55 Members. But it doesn't include any of the Democrats. While none of the Democrats voted to move this bill, nevertheless we don't give up our proprietorship on what goes out of there. No Senator does. No Senator gives up their rights without respect for the rule. 
   This is not appropriate. It is a terrible precedent for the Senate as a whole. When a bill passes out of a committee, it must carry the same message when it arrives on the Senate floor. It ought not be changed on that short trip from the Dirksen Building to this building. It is called a technical modification. We saw initially that $4.4 billion worth of additions were going to be made. When we finally got it here, it was almost a $60 billion cut from programs. It went into a catchall category that can then be distributed. It was $60 billion. So we are looking at something bordering on a 10-percent shift without the public, frankly, being aware of it. 
   Under the Budget Act, there is a point of order against any budget resolution that exceeds the discretionary spending caps. It is very clear this budget resolution is intended to break those caps. In fact, it says so in section 209, on page 41 of the budget resolution. I will read directly from that subsection:  
   The functional totals with respect to discretionary spending set forth in this concurrent resolution, if implemented, would result in legislation which exceeds the limit on discretionary spending for the fiscal year set out in section 251(c) of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act of 1985.  
   That is a quote from the budget resolution itself. In effect, it says that we are breaking the caps and the spending limits as modified in 1997. In fact, when the Budget Committee 
   approved this resolution, it did break the caps, just as it claimed it did. It told the truth. But a funny thing happened on the way to this forum--the difference between the close of the markup and arrival on the floor of the Senate. As if by magic, the spending totals were changed dramatically so that they no longer break the caps. The changes were made to what we call function 920 and left completely unspecified, just thrown in there. This is a catchall. But when it has to be distributed--and it does--then it will hit all of the categories for which we appropriate. I am talking about a significant change. 
   When the committee approved the resolution, the total for function 920, as indicated on the chart, was $4.4 billion in budget authority. In fact, if you look at the committee report--on page 38 and again on page 50--that is what it says: $4.4 billion in budget authority. 
   Budget authority means that which we are allowed by law to spend. That is what the committee approved. Now, when we look at the resolution before us, which is claimed to be the same, the one approved by the Budget Committee, on page 27, line 7, it says that the total for function 920 is negative $59.931 billion. So in the fiscal year 2001--the one we are preparing the budget for--the resolution includes $59.9 billion in unspecified cuts. But the Budget Committee, I remind you again, only approved $4.4 billion in such cuts for the fiscal year beginning October 1. 
   If you look at fiscal year 2002, the same type of thing happened. The committee approved a plan this time that had no budget authority for function 920. That means they weren't allowing any expenditure, positive or negative--well, you can't have negative expenditures, but reductions in the account--in fiscal 2002. Now we have a resolution before us that has $59.729 billion in negative budget authority--unspecified cuts that appeared, seemingly, out of thin air. 
   I have to ask, What is happening here? Well, obviously, the majority is making huge cuts in order to claim they are abiding by the discretionary spending caps, so that they can avoid a point of order and then the need to get 60 votes. They can't get 60 and they know that. 
   I don't criticize them for exceeding the caps. But they are wrong to hide this back-room change to pretend they are not breaking the caps. That is not being honest with the Senate or the American people. 
   The fact is, under the Budget Act--which I negotiated with Senator DOMENICI in 1997--it is supposed to take 60 votes to break the caps. That is the law. Yes, it gives the minority, or at least a few of the Members of the minority, a little bit of leverage. It means the Republicans are supposed to seek some Democratic votes to approve their budget resolution. 
   But instead of playing by the rules, the majority today is flouting them. They are trying to have it both ways--breaking the caps, but then pretending in the resolution that they are not doing that, all to avoid giving the minority a say in this resolution. I think it is wrong that we are here today considering a resolution that isn't the one approved by the Budget Committee; it is a different resolution.  
   At the end of a budget markup, the staff is given the right to make technical changes. That is not unusual, and I don't object to that. But by cutting spending by $60 billion a year, they are eliminating the prospect that this could be a technical change. I know some people around here are used to sloughing off a few million dollars here and there. But $60 billion in a year? Even here that is a large sum of money. That doesn't just sidestep the rules; in my opinion, it goes over the line. I am going to ask the Parliamentarian now whether or not there are prohibitions to changing a Committee-passed resolution or bill without consulting the committee before it is presented to the floor for consideration.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am going to have more to say later about the breakdown of the budget process and what I consider the abuse of the minority rights. 
   I personally believe the exclusion of the minority through the budget resolution and reconciliation process is one reason the whole budget process is in such a difficult mess, and it largely explains why we have these terrible train wrecks and huge omnibus bills at the end of each fiscal year. 
   Be that as it may, I would be happy, before I leave this place, to have a series of discussions with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle about what maybe we can do to get the fiscal year kicked off in a proper fashion with the budget, and as we should do with the Budget Committee. 
   But that is not for the moment because that doesn't have anything to do with the $60 billion per year ``technical change'' being simply wrong. I think it is an abuse of the committee process. It is not fair to the minority. Frankly, it does raise a bit of a sad commentary on the whole budget process. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will respond to my distinguished colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, who assailed my comments about whether or not there was something --let me call it surreptitious; perhaps I even suggested that--in the challenge that I raised to the so-called point of order dispute or technical change. 
   Once again I read, as I did before, from the concurrent resolution on the budget, page 41, line 8:

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are on the eve of establishing a budget priority for the budget year 2000, the one that begins in October and to next September. 
   I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. I would like to establish some parameters about the budget as I see it because we are waiting patiently for the majority to produce a budget resolution, which is a responsibility of the Budget Committee. That is supposed to be done by April 1 of this year. Other than meeting that deadline, the alternative would be for the majority leader to present a budget as he sees it. 
   The question arises: Why is it, when the target as proposed by the chairman of the Budget Committee is for a budget resolution to be here by March 1--and today is considerably past March 1--we are still waiting? 
   I was advised yesterday as the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee that we could expect to have a markup yesterday or today. That was called off at a rather late moment last night. We are sitting here, I will not say breathless but certainly curious, about what it is that prevents us from getting a budget. 
   I have to do my own interpretation because I have not been given any explanation. I know there are competent staff people working to get the budget finished. We have them on both sides --on the Republican as well as on the Democrat side. Why isn't it finished? 
   Let me tell you why I think it is not and why we on this side of the aisle think it isn't being done. It is because they can't get an agreement between the members of the committee. The tax cut package of George W. Bush, candidate for President of the United States, is something that seems to me would break the back of this economy. It would destroy all the rosy plans for paying down the debt, for making sure we rid ourselves of this obligation, this mortgage that we have all over our country. There isn't a family around who wouldn't look forward to the day when the mortgage on their home or the debt that they have could be retired. 
   When we talk about a nice, healthy tax cut, or juicy tax cut for the wealthiest in the country, it doesn't ring a good bell even within the party of George W. Bush, the Republican Party. 
   I know the chairman of the Budget Committee has had his hands full. He is my friend as well as a colleague. He doesn't confide in me. We keep our party business and our intentions separate. We discuss them in the open. This is less than a bad joke. It is a travesty. It worries people. 
   We are enjoying a boom the likes of which has never been seen in this country or anyplace in the world. The economy is perking along--almost boiling along. This is a wonderful opportunity to make needed adjustments within our structure. We can help families, particularly the middle-class families, people who need a little bit of tax relief here and there to help accomplish specific purposes. We can keep this commitment, which we consider sacrosanct, sacred, to save Social Security first. 
   We want to take the surpluses which are generated by the robust economy and use them to extend the solvency of Social Security. At the same time, we want to pay down the debt. It has been the President's objective to try to rid taxpayers of the public debt, that debt which is owed outside of Government, within about 15 years--bring it down to zero. What a difference it would make in our economy. We would be able to see people borrowing money without having to compete with the needs of the American Government, companies able to borrow without having to compete with the Government for capital. It would be an excellent objective if we could get there. 
   Protect Medicare, provide prescription drugs, extend the life of Medicare some 12-15 years, that is what the Democrats want to do. 
   We want to invest in education. I speak about education with a degree of knowledge because I came from a working-class family in New Jersey. My father worked in the textile factories in Paterson, NJ. My mother waited on tables. They struggled to make a living during those very lean years we were going through. We couldn't afford a college education for me even though it was apparent I had the ability. College came later on. I enlisted in the Army and was a beneficiary of the GI bill of rights. What a bill of rights it was for me. I was able to go to Columbia University. I never would have been able to afford that otherwise. The Government said: FRANK LAUTENBERG, you have served your country in Europe during World War II at the height of the war. 
   I came back and was able to get an education that helped me, with two very good friends, start a business in the computing field. It was a long time ago. We were pioneers. That company that I helped start employs in the area of over 30,000 people today. I am listed as a member of the Information Processing Hall of Fame. It is in Dallas, TX. Then I was able to run for the Senate. I am now in my third and last term. It has made such a huge difference. I made a contribution to this society that has been so good to me between establishing a business, an industry, employing people, and now being in this great body. 
   It means a lot when we talk about investing in education. We can say to young people across America: Even if you don't have the money, if you have the ability to learn, we will help you achieve your objectives--make an opportunity for yourself, lift yourself into a better lifestyle or better life pattern than your parents, who so often struggle so hard. 
   Cutting taxes for working families to achieve those objectives, that is the Democratic budget agenda. 
   We talk about targeted tax cuts for families; help families care for an elderly parent with a $3,000 long-term care tax credit; Expand educational opportunities; Provide marriage penalty relief; Help people prepare for retirement; Expand the earned-income tax credit for those who often need it desperately. That is our mission. 
   Instead, we are presented with something that hardly resembles that mission. We show this in graphic form by presenting this picture: a ship at sea facing the tip of an iceberg. The iceberg is the Republican tax proposal,  one that says you can spend more than you have and not admit that if you want to keep on living, you may have to borrow money. 
   From where is that borrowing going to come? It will come from Social Security--that trust fund we hear everybody on each side, who would say under oath, ``I want to make sure Social Security is there for those who work and pay the taxes.'' They want to know when the time comes for retirement they will have something to look forward to. 
   Instead, what we have seen from the House Republican budget presentation that was sent over to the Senate is that we will have a surplus, non-Social Security surplus, in our financial account, our balance sheet, of $171 billion. However, the tax cut proposal we have seen is $223 billion. One doesn't have to be a mathematician to know if one takes $223 billion away from $171 billion, one has to go elsewhere to pay the bills. 
   We made this very sacred promise, this commitment to the senior citizens of this country. I am one of those senior citizens; I like it. It is not bad. 
   The fact is, we made a promise, almost on bended knee, that we absolutely will not touch, to paraphrase, a hair on yon gray heads for retirement opportunities. But the proposal we are looking at is one that says we will spend $50 billion more on tax cuts than we have in our non-Social Security surplus. 
   That is not very good arithmetic. One does not have to be a mathematician, accountant, or economist to see that puts America deeper into a hole that we will have to dig our way out. Just take it from the Social Security, after we so diligently studied and agree that it is the most sacred obligation this country has. 
   Where do we go from there? This graph ought to be presented differently. It shows a tip of the iceberg. The whole iceberg ought to be lifted up because this is a crash we can see coming. If this program stays in place, the economy is going to run into a full-sized iceberg with an enormous negative economic impact. 
   We are not going to be able to protect Social Security. We are not going to be able to pay down the debt. We will not be able to take care of obligations we have to veterans in education and health care. We cannot do that if we go ahead as planned. 
   We need to pay down our obligations. We need to give some targeted tax relief, to take care of the commitments we have. But, no, we cannot do it because we are not going to have any money left with which to do it unless we borrow once again from Social Security. We have been through that. We had years and years of borrowing from Social Security to make up for the lack of revenue coming from the non-Social Security side of the ledger. 
   Finally, we are at a place in time where, with President Clinton's leadership and with the work of people on both sides of the aisle working on a balanced budget, we have developed a surplus and now we are ready to start taking care of the financial structure of the country in a way so that we know we will be able to assure people Medicare will be there for them, that prescription drug costs, which is such a problem for so many elderly, will be taken care of in some form. 
   But we are not going to be able to do it if we put in place this tax scheme--and certainly, if not this one, Presidential aspirant George W. Bush's tax plan, which is more than twice, almost three times, the size of the one that has been proposed in the House budget. 
   So the question for the American public is, Why is it that a Republican majority, a significant majority, cannot get an agreement out that says: This is where we stand. Let the public judge the value of it. Let Democrats, let people outside, make judgments about the truth in the presentation. 
   We have all kinds of smoke and mirrors that disguise what we are going to try to do here. But we know in the final analysis we are going to be borrowing money from the Social Security trust fund. So let's get it out here. Let's let the public see what it is that is going on behind closed doors, because that is not the way we can operate anymore. We cannot operate with significant proposals and not permit the public to scrutinize what it is we are doing. 
   We have to get to the job. We are way past the deadline we thought we would be through. I am not happy about the prospect that a budget resolution will be dropped on the floor without having had the benefit of a committee discussion, some debate, some analysis in the public eye before we go ahead and start voting on it. 
   With that, I conclude by saying I and I know other members of the committee--Democratic members of the committee and I am sure many of the Republican Members of the Budget Committee--are anxious to get out the budget. If the leadership will accommodate us in the obligation we have to the public to present it, we will have a chance to talk about something other than what is whispered about through the halls here. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise now in strong support of a resolution offered by my colleague, Senator JACK REED of Rhode Island. At the same time, I commend him for all of his hard work in support of gun safety measures. 
   We are soon approaching an anniversary. Most anniversaries have a happy ring to them--wedding anniversaries, birthdays are often called an anniversary. Those are pleasant moments. But the anniversary we are talking about now is one we will remember for decades to come. It is the anniversary of a mammoth American tragedy. 
   It is only 31 days until April 20, 2000, the 1-year anniversary of the terrible tragedy at Columbine High School in Colorado. We all remember that awful day almost a year ago. Across the Nation, people saw and heard the shocking news reports. Two students had stormed into their school and systematically shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher. They also wounded 23 other students and teachers. 
   It makes me shudder when I recall the bloody carnage of that day. I had to shake my head in disbelief that this outrage could be committed in a school. No parent and no grandparent could avoid thanking goodness for the safety of their own families when they saw the horrors of those moments.  Those innocent, young people, full of life, running, scared, desperate, trying to get away from the gunmen--the image of the young man hanging out of the window trying to reach safety. 
   We thought that incident, that tragedy, would finally wake up Congress. That Congress would say: Let's end this; let's do what we can to stop this. And here, almost a year later, since that tragic moment, the American people have an obligation and a right to ask: What has Congress done to prevent another tragedy? How has Congress answered the cries and pleading of parents and grandparents who want to protect their children? What has Congress done to protect other families from gun violence? I ask the question and I will give the answer: Absolutely nothing. And it is a disgrace. 
   I and some of my colleagues have tried. During the debate on the juvenile justice bill, the Senate passed several gun safety measures, including my amendment to require criminal background checks at gun shows. It was a very close vote, a 50-50 tie. The Vice President, in his role as President of the Senate, came in to break the tie. And with that vote the Senate passed my measure to require background checks at gun shows. But still Congress has not completed action on that legislation, despite the support of organizations that we all know and agree with when it comes to law enforcement, groups endorsing the Senate-passed gun safety amendments, such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police, the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, Police Executive Research Forum, Police Foundation, Major Cities Chiefs, Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and others. They all ask why we can't do something about controlling gun violence in our society. 
   We tried. I remind my colleagues that the gun show loophole amendment had bipartisan support. I was pleased to have that support from our friends on the other side of the aisle, people such as Senators DEWINE, FITZGERALD, LUGAR, VOINOVICH, WARNER, and Chafee, who is no longer with us. They all voted for my amendment. 
   And the juvenile justice bill, with the gun safety amendments, passed by a vote of 73-25. So there was strong, bipartisan support for moving forward on juvenile crime and trying to reduce gun violence. But that was back on May 20 of last year, 10 months ago. 
   We have to look at what has happened since then. 
   The shootings haven't stopped. Most recently, there was a 6-year-old shot by a classmate in Michigan. There was another shooting spree near Pittsburgh, where five people were shot and three died when a gunman opened fire on a McDonald's and a Burger King. 
   There have been more shootings, from Fort Gibson, OK, to Los Angeles, CA, where a gunman opened fire at a daycare center. We all remember the little children being led from a day school--holding a policeman's hands. They were being led away from someone who would later kill a postal worker because he had a different complexion than the killer. And there was also Fort Worth, TX, where young people at a prayer meeting were assaulted by a gunman. It has been one shooting after another. And these tragedies demonstrate that unless all communities are safe from gun violence, no community is safe from gun violence. 
   But while the vast majority of Americans want Congress to act, there is one special interest that says, no, the status quo is more than enough. The National Rifle Association has worked with its allies in this body and in the House of Representatives to block legislation every time it comes up. The same old reaction. Every time Congress wants to pass gun safety laws, the NRA calls on its friends to prevent progress. 
   Recent statements from the NRA show how desperate and extremist they have become. A man named Wayne LaPierre, the NRA executive vice president, attacked President Bill Clinton. He said that President Clinton was ``willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda.'' That comment is outrageous, insulting, reckless, and irresponsible. But Mr. LaPierre didn't stop there. He also accused President Clinton of having ``blood on his hands'' because of the shooting of the basketball coach, Ricky Byrdsong. Just when you thought the NRA could not go any lower, they managed to do it. 
   The NRA is so wrong because, in that case, it was the State authorities who failed to pursue and prosecute Ricky Byrdsong's killer when he failed the background check. These painful comments are an outrage, and Mr. LaPierre and the whole organization, the NRA, ought to apologize to Mrs. Byrdsong. 
   The NRA is out of touch with the American people. Look at the polls. There is overwhelming support for common sense gun safety measures. The American people are pleading with Congress to reduce gun violence. And they want to close the gun show loophole that permits unidentified buyers from getting guns without a background check. If you have money in your pocket, you can walk out with a gun at your waist. You could be one of the 10 most wanted criminals in all America, or one of the terrorists from abroad whose names have become legendary, and you could buy guns at these gun shows from unlicensed dealers--no questions asked. Who are you? What is your name? Where do you live? Have you had a bad record? No, not one question is asked. 
   But the NRA attacks are nothing new. They constantly spout careless rhetoric. Some of my colleagues, and many other people, will remember when the NRA went after Federal law enforcement officials, calling them ``jack-booted thugs.'' That comment resulted in President Bush's resignation from the NRA. 
   Now we have heard--I listened to it myself on a recent TV broadcast--Charlton Heston, who ought to know better, defending the reckless attacks on President Clinton. And on the NRA web site you even see more rhetoric about the Holocaust that took 6 million people to their death. It says that if the Jews had their weapons with them, it would not have happened. What an outrageous and insulting thing to say. Six million Jews were put in gas chambers, put in trains, and systematically killed. The entire Nazi government and communities across Europe--scientists, doctors, and teachers, all organized to put these people and 8 million more 
   to their death. The NRA drops a casual remark like that and says maybe if they were allowed to carry weapons, or if they didn't have them taken away from them, they could have saved themselves. They are talking about kids who were 6 years old and babies who were thrown from trucks. They could have prevented it if they only had a chance to continue owning weapons. 
   While that rhetoric is the most outrageous, there is more phony rhetoric coming from the NRA. The NRA says that all we need to do is enforce the laws we have on the books. Another outrageous, loose statement. The argument ignores the fact that the number of Federal firearms cases prosecuted by U.S. attorneys increased 25 percent, from 4,754 in 1992 to 5,500 in 1999. 
   So the NRA's suggestion that law enforcement is not fighting gun crimes is just false rhetoric. They will say anything they want to if they feel it can help make their case. But they are not convincing the American people that everybody who wants to have a gun should get it in minutes. They say that 24 hours is more than enough time. But the FBI is trying to track down people who escaped the requirement for a thorough background check because there wasn't enough time to get it done. During the first year of the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, there were 3,849 occasions where three business days went by and the gun transfer had to be allowed, but the FBI later received information that the transfer was to a prohibited person. In other words, even three business days is not long enough.Z! EXT .094 ...SENATE... G21MR6 PERSONAL COMPUTER\J\079060-G21MR6-094-*****-*****- -Name: -Payroll No. -Folios: -Date: -Subformat: 
   And the NRA rhetoric also completely misses the point when it comes to gun shows. The problem with gun shows is there is no law to enforce. There is one giant loophole. 
   As I said earlier, someone on the FBI's Ten Most Wanted list can go to a gun show and buy a firearm from a nonlicensed dealer with no questions asked. The only questions are: How many guns do you want and do you have the money? That is the transaction. It is as simple as that--handguns, assault weapons, you name it; all kinds. This isn't an enforcement issue. There is no background check requirement to enforce. 
   The NRA and its friends are out of touch with the American people. Even  a major gun manufacturer, Smith & Wesson, said we need to do more on gun safety. The company reached an agreement with the Administration that will incorporate many of the measures stalled in the conference committee on juvenile justice--background checks at gun shows, child safety locks, and preventing the use of ammunition clips with more than ten rounds. 
   For the benefit of those who do not work around here, a conference committee is comprised of a committee of the Senate and a committee of the House, both with jurisdiction over particular issues. They sit down and hammer out differences in legislation. The conference committee on the juvenile justice bill has met just once, in August of last year. It has done nothing for months because the NRA and its friends--some of them here and some of them across the Capitol in the House--don't want any gun safety measures to pass Congress. 
   Despite that, the American people are demanding something be done. We have to move this conference. We want background checks at gun shows. We want child safety locks. We want to prevent the use of ammunition clips with more than 10 rounds. It is ridiculous that Congress is behind gun manufacturers on gun safety. 
   We want to stop the phony rhetoric and get on with the job. And the American people should remind their Senators and their Congresspeople that they are demanding safety from guns for their children, their households, and their families. 
   I hope the word goes out across this country that there is time now to start making changes to reduce gun violence. We ought to get on with the job. We have to stop the verbal attacks on law enforcement. We have to stop the excuses. The conference committee should complete its job. The American people should demand nothing less. 
   I support Senator REED's resolution and I hope many of my colleagues will vote for it. And we must show the American people that we have the backbone and the spine in this body to stand up to the NRA and campaign contributions from its political action committee. 
   Listen to the voices of the American people. Listen to the cries of anguished parents who run to the schoolhouse hoping their child was not one of those who are listed as dead or wounded. Listen to the mothers who will march to Washington on Mother's Day--there may be a million rallying across the country--and say: for God's sake, please help me protect my child from violence. There is no more important or urgent plea than that. It must get through these walls. The American people can't understand Congress' failure to pass gun safety measures. I can't understand it and I work here every day. 
   We must complete action on gun safety before April 20, 2000, the one year anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine High school. We cannot allow a year to pass with nothing done except people visiting cemeteries to see where their children are buried. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to discuss a subject that is not terribly different than the remarks made by the distinguished Senator from Virginia just now. He talks about our responsibilities, what we have to do to protect our citizens. He talked about it in a slightly different way than I am going to discuss it now. 
   But we are at a point in time, Mr. President, when there are 43 days on the calendar left until the 1-year anniversary of the shootings at Columbine High School in Colorado. On April 20, 2000, it will be 1 year since the country listened, in shock, to the news that two high school students, Eric Harris and  Dylan Klebold, had stormed into Columbine and systematically shot and killed 12 classmates and a teacher. 
   When we talk about 43 days to go, those are calendar days. If we talked about the number of days left for us to enact legislation, there are somewhere around 23 days left. 
   In addition to those 12 classmates and a teacher killed, 23 other students and teachers were wounded in the assault. 
   It pains me--and I am sure it is true for all Americans--when I think back to the picture of that carnage: Young people running in a high school, fearful that their lives may be taken away, many weeping with terror as they fled. Who could ever forget the picture of that young man hanging out of a window to try to protect himself? 
   But even in some ways more shocking is to see how quickly this Congress can dismiss those images. The American people must be wondering: What we have been doing since that tragic day almost a year ago? What have we done to reassure parents across the country that we are working to prevent it from happening again? We have shown no evidence of that. As a matter of fact, the evidence is quite to the contrary. The evidence says: Congress had a chance to do it, but we chose not to. We have not done anything, and it is a disgrace. 
   I heard yesterday that there was a shooting. I have recounted several incidents in the past year when I have heard news of a shooting here and news of a shooting there. My first question is, Is it a school? Is it a schoolyard that has become another killing field? Yesterday's shooting was not in a schoolyard. But when that 6-year-old child was killed by another 6-year-old child, it was in a schoolyard. It was an adult's fault more than that child's fault--the 6-year-old didn't know any better--the man whose gun was lying casually around when this boy picked it up and took it to kill his classmate. We have not dealt with that. We have not dealt with the problem of adult responsibility, keeping guns out of the hands of children. There is no doubt in my mind that the responsibility should fall directly on the adult and have them pay, and pay dearly, for their role in the crime. 
   On Tuesday, the President tried to help. He met with leaders of the conference committee, where gun safety measures are stalled, to try to move this issue to the front burner. I salute his efforts. He understands the need for action. He recalls routinely the vote we took in this Chamber to pass my gun show loophole amendment. It did pass, 51-50, with the help of Vice President Gore, who voted to break the tie. 
   But nothing happened. The legislation passed the Senate. But the House passed a juvenile justice bill without gun safety measures. While the President tried to make positive progress, the NRA, the National Rifle Association--I name them clearly--and the gun lobby continued to obstruct every single effort to pass commonsense gun safety measures. They do it by spreading false information about what these measures are designed to do. They distort the record to achieve their goal: no gun safety laws. That is what they want. 
   They said my amendment was intended to shut down gun shows. It was a lie. It was an untruth. They also misquoted my remarks at a press conference. But when the video of my speech is reviewed, you see what I said. I said, ``Close the gun show loophole.'' These folks don't respect the truth. 
   My amendment would simply shut out criminals who use gun shows as convenience stores to buy the firearms they will use to rob and commit violent crimes, to kill people. That includes our police officers, law enforcement people. 
   The American people support criminal background checks on all gun sales at gun shows. It has to be hard for people across the country to understand that you have to get a permit, you have to get a bill of sale, to buy a car, in many cases, to buy an appliance. Why in the world would we not insist that people who are buying a gun identify themselves in some way? 
   The support for identification is overwhelming. We saw it in an ABC news poll. Ninety percent of the people said they want to close the gun show loophole, the loophole that says unlicensed dealers, private dealers, can go ahead and sell guns to anybody who has the money. No need to ask the question: What are you going to do with it? They ask if you are 18. If you say you are 18, that takes care of it; then they just sell them. 
   If you are a member of the Ten Most Wanted list, the most wanted criminals in the country, you can step up there and buy a gun. No one will ask you a question. 
   What about the gun owners the NRA claims to represent? In a poll that was conducted by the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, two-thirds--66 percent--of gun owners said they favor background checks at gun show sales. Last year, the FBI issued a report which noted that between November 30, 1998, and June 15, 1999--less than a year, 6 months--the FBI failed to block about 1,700 gun sales to prohibited purchasers--in other words, people unfit, unable to meet basic standards--because it didn't have enough time to complete the background check. The FBI had to allow the gun sales to go through. 
   Those transactions were completed because the FBI didn't have 
   enough time to complete the background check. So consequently, they had to issue gun retrieval notices and law enforcement had to try to track down the criminals who got the guns. 
   So we must not permit weakening of our criminal background check system. We should strengthen it, a system that has stopped more than 470,000 guns from being purchased in 6 years. Half a million people, almost, who wanted to buy guns, who were unfit to buy those guns--criminals, fugitives, other prohibited purchasers--tried to buy a gun and were stopped by Federal law from doing so. I think that is a good thing for people in our country to hear. It includes 33,000 spousal abusers who were denied a gun because of a domestic violence gun ban I wrote only 4 years ago. 
   The NRA makes another outrageous claim, that my gun show loophole closing bill won't make any difference; in other words, if there are guns out there bought by unknown people, that it doesn't matter. They say my legislation won't make it tougher for people to buy a gun to commit a crime. That is also nonsense. 
   But don't take my word for it. Look at what Robyn Anderson told the Colorado State Legislature recently. She is the woman who went with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to the Tanner gun show in Adams County, CO. She said:  
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday........While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check.  
   They needed Anderson's help because she was 18 and they were too young to buy guns. So Robyn Anderson bought 3 guns for them at the gun show, 2 shotguns and a rifle--3 guns that Harris and Klebold would use to murder 13 young people at Columbine High School. 
   Here is what she said. You read it and you will understand it, I hope. She said:  
   It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check.  
   How much clearer could it be? Closing the gun show loophole will make a difference. I plead with all of my colleagues in this Chamber--I don't understand how we can ignore the cries of our people--I plead with them: Follow your conscience. Let's do the right thing. Whom are we hurting if we say you have to identify yourself when you buy a weapon? We are not hurting anybody. 
   By not demanding it, we permit this kind of thing to take place, unidentified gun buyers. That ought to shock everybody in America. Let's do what the people of this country expect us to do. Ten months ago, the Senate passed my amendment to close the gun show loophole. Now that bill is being held hostage in a conference committee. 
   For those who are not aware of what it is, a conference committee is a committee of the House and a committee of the Senate. They join together--it is called a conference committee--to iron out differences in legislation they want to see passed in both Houses. 
   Nothing has happened. The committee has met only one time, last year. They have not debated the issues.  We are asking: Please, let that legislation go free. Don't let the gun lobby prevail over the families across this country who want to stop the gun violence. 
   Don't let the gun lobby rule what takes place in this Senate or in the House of Representatives. We have to do it now, before April 20, before the anniversary of that terrible day at Columbine High School. No one will forget it. No one who is alive and old enough to understand what took place will forget it. One year is time enough to act. April 20. 
   People across this country are asking: What has Congress done? What will they do? If one thinks they will be satisfied to hear that we have done nothing at all, I urge them to think again. And I urge people within the range of my voice to listen to what some are saying--that Congress will do nothing about it, even though children die across this country and adults die across this country. Over 33,000 a year die from gunshot wounds. We wound 134,000. In Vietnam, we lost 58,000 over the whole 10-year period that war was fought. But we lose 33,000 Americans a year--young, old, black, white, Christian, Jewish, it doesn't matter. 
   So I plead with my colleagues, give our people a safer country. They are entitled to that. If we have an enemy outside our borders, we are prepared to fight that enemy. We have service personnel and airplanes with the latest equipment. We try to provide our law enforcement people--the police departments, FBI, drug enforcement agents, and border patrol people--with the weapons to fight crime. But each year, 33,000 people die from gunshots in this country. We ought not to permit that. I plead with my colleagues to help our people. Let's try to move forward with gun safety legislation as quickly as we can when we return the week after next. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues who have worked so hard to get this bill to this point. It is not fun to oppose something that was reported out of the conference committee with such strong support. 
   But I have a different responsibility given the fact that I serve both as the ranking member of the Budget Committee and the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee. In my view, this bill represents a missed opportunity to fully address the financing needs of our Nation's aviation system. 
   To the degree the bill actually guarantees any real funding increases, it does so in a manner that I consider grossly unbalanced. Mr. President, if  you ask the average Senator if they are willing to fund aviation at the expense of the Coast Guard, I guarantee you they would say no. If you asked each Senator whether they were willing to fund aviation at the expense of Amtrak, I guarantee you most would say no. If you asked the average Senator whether or not they were willing to fund aviation at the expense of our federal highway safety efforts, they would say: Certainly not. 
   But if this conference agreement becomes law, we run the very real risk of cutting back funds for NHTSA, the National Transportation Safety Board, Amtrak, the Coast Guard, and other areas just to boost funding for two aviation capital accounts by almost $2 billion next year. And those two aviation accounts don't even finance the core operations of the air traffic control system--the area where the FAA is facing its most difficult challenges. 
   Our national transportation system needs investments in several areas, not just aviation. Look at what is happening with the Coast Guard. All of us salute the Coast Guard. We saw in the papers just yesterday that they do not have enough people to monitor cruise ships that are dumping their waste in the oceans. They do not have enough maintenance funding to keep their aircraft in the air. They do not have enough people to monitor the attempts by illegal immigrants to enter this country. They don't have enough money for pollution control, for fisheries enforcement, and for recruiting. But I don't hear my colleagues on the Commerce Committee, who have jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, advocating for a Coast Guard ``guarantee.'' 
   Mr. President, throughout my entire Senate career, I have led the fight for increased investment in transportation. My support for transportation started when I served as the Commissioner of the Port Authority of New York/New Jersey. At that time, I learned that you can't ignore the needs of one transportation mode in favor of another. Investments need to be made in a balanced way if you are going to avoid gridlock. You can't ignore the rail system or the highways to focus on aviation. You need to keep your eye on safety, not just construction. The requirement to reauthorize our aviation laws presented this Congress with a great opportunity to address the financing of our nation's aviation system in a comprehensive and bipartisan manner. Unfortunately, this bill misses the mark. 
   This Conference Agreement took so long to produce because so many Members wanted to provide big funding increases for aviation without paying for them. Mr. President, the simple fact is that the revenue stream to the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is not adequate to fund the substantial funding increases for aviation that many members want. Because of that basic fact, the aviation conferees have been haggling for the last year over methods to develop a new mousetrap to produce those funding increases without adequate revenue. Over the last week, the Majority Leader and the majority members of the conference committee reached the agreement that is currently before us. It seeks to guarantee a 64 percent increase in airport grants, and a 30 percent increase in modernization funding. These so-called ``guaranteed'' increases come 
   at a time when the Republican Majority is debating among itself whether to impose a hard freeze on discretionary spending at the current year's level, or provide for a minuscule 2.4 percent increase. The arithmetic is simple. The $1.9 billion or 47 percent increase that this bill seeks to ``guarantee'' for airport grants and modernization will either require cuts in the rest of the Transportation Department or the rest of the discretionary budget. 
   I understand that the Chairman of the Budget Committee was a party to these negotiations. I am told that he is prepared to state that the Budget Resolution that he will propose fully funds the needs of these so-called aviation guarantees. While I have great respect for the Budget Committee Chairman, I have to say that I would like to know where the funding is coming from if he plans to impose a freeze on discretionary spending. That should be a concern to all Members, whether they care about the Coast Guard, Amtrak, education, health care, veterans benefits, agriculture, or anything else. 
   Mr. President, one of the areas that will face greater budget austerity as a result of these so-called ``guaranteed'' increases is the operating budget in the FAA. The operating account pays for the operations of the air traffic control system. It pays the salary of every air traffic controller and every aviation inspector. It pays for security at our airports. It pays for the publication of every safety regulation. Three quarters of the operations budget goes just to pay the salaries of the people that keep the system safe every day. This account is where the FAA faces the most severe funding shortfall. So it is absurd that we are now going to pass a bill that will boost capital funding while subjecting the operations budget to even greater austerity. Due to existing shortfalls in its operating budget, the FAA just canceled all training activities except introductory training for air traffic controllers for the remainder of the year. We also have problems with new state-of-the-art equipment sitting in warehouses because the FAA doesn't have the operating funds to install them. There aren't even adequate operating funds to train our air traffic controllers how to use the equipment. FAA has had to delay the certification of new aircraft and new equipment. Those delays are hurting our U.S. aircraft manufacturers. The number of aviation safety inspectors is being allowed to trickle down and FAA can't afford to hire new inspectors to replace them. With that backdrop, the Republican Conferees on this bill produced a conference report that loaded all of the so-called ``guaranteed'' funding increases on capital investment programs and ignored the operations budget. Just two days ago, the FAA released its updated forecast for future aviation traffic. That forecast indicates that domestic airline traffic will increase more than 60 percent through 2011. That increased traffic will also put incredible pressure on the operation budget of the FAA. We will need more safety and security inspectors, not less. We will need better trained controllers and more of them. But the bill before us ignores those needs. This bill is simply lopsided and unbalanced. And in time, Mr. President, I believe the Members championing this bill will realize that they made a mistake. In fact, they may realize it sooner than they think. 
   I am not sure, in the end, that all of these ``guaranteed'' funding increases will materialize. The point-of-order in the Senate that protects these funding guarantees is a 50-vote point-of-order. It will require 51 votes to waive that point-of-order. We all know that it is impossible to do anything in the Senate without 51 votes. So fiscal reality may require the Senate to revisit these guarantees sooner rather than later. It will only require a simple majority of the Senate to do so. 
   Maybe that will not happen for a year or two. Maybe it will happen later this Spring. In my capacity as Ranking Member of the 
   Senate Transportation Appropriations subcommittee, I will manage only one more Transportation Appropriations bill. But I promise that I am not going to silently watch the Amtrak budget, the Coast Guard budget, or the FAA's own operations budget get ravaged to pay for the so-called ``guarantees'' provided in this bill. I will see to it that every Member here will have the opportunity to vote on whether we should shut down Amtrak lines, tie up Coast Guard ships, or lay off aviation inspectors, in order to pay for these guarantees. 
   In summary, Mr. President, this bill represents a missed opportunity. This bill missed the opportunity to provide momentum for funding increases in the FAA across-the-board to address all the agency's shortfalls, including the operations budget. By loading all of the so-called guaranteed funding on the capital accounts, it becomes plain as day, that the Airport and Airway Trust Fund is not adequate to fund all of our aviation needs. It will only be a matter of time before we have to consider a tax increase or new user fees in order to truly meet all of the FAA's needs. 
   Mr. President, this bill is shortsighted. It was produced in the back room without Minority Members present, and I do not believe it represents a sustainable aviation policy for our nation. The funding provisions in this bill may not even be sustainable for the coming fiscal year. For that reason, I cannot support this bill.  
   Thank you, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are about to vote on a bill that purportedly takes care of the problems of the FAA. I have to say, this bill guarantees funding increases in a manner that is grossly imbalanced. It threatens to cut funding from Amtrak, from the Coast Guard, from highway safety, and the NTSB in order to provide an aviation entitlement.  
   Investments in aviation do have to be made, but it has to be in a balanced way if we are going to avoid gridlock. You cannot ignore the rail system or highway safety and only focus on aviation. 
   The agreement seeks to guarantee a 64-percent increase in airport grants and a 37-percent increase in modernization funding. Tight budget caps mean either cuts in transportation appropriations--including the Coast Guard or Amtrak--or cuts to other discretionary programs, such as education, health care, veterans' benefits, or agriculture. 
   Further, it does not provide for the kinds of funding that operations will need to put on more controllers to man this larger system. It does not provide money for the continued training of new controllers.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to start by thanking the Judiciary Committee--particularly Chairman HATCH and Ranking Member LEAHY--for moving the nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes through the committee process so efficiently. 
   Judge Fuentes clearly is the kind of candidate that we want on the federal bench. In many ways, his life demonstrates the promise of America--the idea that anyone committed to getting an education and working hard can build a distinguished career. 
   Judge Fuentes wasn't born to wealth or privilege. He was raised by a single parent--his mother who worked as a nurse. But he pursued his education diligently, earning a college degree while serving his country in the Army's Special Forces. Eventually, he earned not only a law degree but also two Masters degrees. 
   After completing law school, Judge Fuentes began building a successful legal practice, honing his skills as an associate with a Jersey City law firm. He later established his own firm and gained experience handling a wide range of criminal and civil matters. 
   In 1978, he was appointed a judge on the Newark Municipal Court, where he served until his appointment to the New Jersey Superior Court in 1987. As a Superior Court judge, he has presided over criminal cases and a wide range of civil disputes, including product liability actions, environmental suits, and property claims. He has also ruled on a number of federal and state constitutional issues. 
   In addition to his professional endeavors, Judge Fuentes has also volunteered his time to help members of the community. He has mentored many Hispanic youths and he has received several awards for his public service. 
   Judge Fuentes' hard work on and off the bench has earned the respect of his judicial colleagues, the lawyers who appear before him, and the people of New Jersey. The people who know him well describe him as ``bright,'' ``dedicated,'' and ``even-tempered.'' 
   In short, I feel certain that Judge Fuentes' depth of experience, his legal knowledge, his compassion and his temperament would make him an exceptional federal judge. 
   Again, I thank Senators HATCH and LEAHY for their hard work on this nomination, and I urge all of my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge Fuentes.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will begin by talking about the underlying bill which is entitled the Affordable Education Act. I stand in opposition to the bill as it is presented because I don't know who can afford it. Can the citizens of this country afford to have resources diverted from the public school system? With all of its deficiencies, it is the underlying educational system that exists throughout the country. The bill will shortchange our public schools and provide more than 70 percent of the tax breaks to families in the top 20 percent of the income brackets. 
   I come from the State of New Jersey. As everyone knows, New Jersey is the most densely populated State in the country. We are essentially an urbanized State. We do have some suburbs; we have very little by way of rural population. 
   When we say we are going to provide our citizens with an ``option,'' the option is more or less to abandon the public school systems, particularly in our urban centers which are struggling to make ends meet and struggling to educate our children. 
   I was born in the city of Paterson, NJ. It is highly industrialized. Initially its growth was from textile production, textile manufacturing. My father and grandfather worked in those mills. I visit the city of my birth quite often. It is a very low-income city, as is Newark, our largest city in New Jersey, as is Jersey City, another of our large cities in New Jersey--small in comparison with other States, where one city can be 10 or 20 percent of the population. We don't have that. We have lots of cities. 
   They struggle, and we are often disappointed in the SAT scores. We look beyond the SAT scores and we see young people who can learn and accomplish things and get through the maze and make something of their lives despite the inconveniences that often come with insufficient physical structure in the schools, schools with instructors who do not have the appropriate teacher training, and schools that do not have sufficient revenues to make the needed investments. 
   I, personally, since I come out of the computer business, have been involved with some of our schools. I picked Patterson, NJ, in particular and tried to make a financial as well as a physical contribution, pulling wires into some of the schools so they could have some connection to the Internet--not fully, not sufficient for all the students, but we are living almost on spare change in cities such as that. We have to figure out a way to improve those educational standards. 
   By permitting people to avoid going to those schools, those few who have enough income to go elsewhere, we are not going to help the basic educational system that has done so well in this country. Before private schools became as interesting as they are now, public schools produced the talent and the brilliance and the leadership this country has seen. We put up a sign that says: Abandon the schools if you can afford it, abandon the public school system; get out of town if you can. 
   We made mistakes in our planning over the years. One of the most obvious is, although we did something very positive by building our National Highway System--it was begun in the 1950s--it had an unanticipated consequence and that was to encourage abandonment of the cities. Move out of town, get some nice space--and I don't blame people for wanting to do that--and leave the problems behind. As a consequence, the average income of the people who inhabit the cities has gone down substantially; the tax base has gone down substantially, and the revenues are just not there. 
   So, as that happened, as people had less loyalty to the cities, they also wanted different school options. Now what we are seeing is, with these tax breaks for people who can afford to send their kids to private schools, that they, too, will abandon their interest. It will also cost the country, by my calculation, somewhere close to $15 billion over the next 10 years, possibly even more. That is significant when we are trying to pay down the debt, trying to find ways to provide prescription drugs for people who need them, when we are trying to find other ways to improve the educational system altogether. Now we are saying the plan in this act is to have the revenue losses offset by other opportunities. Adding insult to injury, our distinguished friend, Senator ROTH, has offered an amendment that would eliminate the revenue-raising portions of the bill and seek to spend surplus funds for the tax breaks in the legislation. 
   To use an expression: That compounds the problem. Before 
   we start spending projected surpluses that may or may not exist, we ought at least understand how large those surpluses are likely to be and have an overall plan for using them. Otherwise, before we know it, we will have frittered away the surpluses and used up funds that will be needed for higher priorities. 
   In particular, I am concerned we reserve enough of the surpluses to ensure we can protect Social Security, extend the life of Medicare, make sure we consider the prescription drug program, give targeted tax breaks, and pay down the debt. The American people salute that. They know when you are in debt it is never easy to plan ahead. Boy, we would set one incredible example if we could get our debt paid down by 2013, which is the objective of the President's plan. I also think we ought to make sure we protect those surpluses for other needs that will be discussed in our upcoming budget debate, which I hope will commence very shortly. 
   In my view, those priorities I discussed are more important than subsidizing private schools for a relatively small number of families. But even if you support the goals of this bill, I hope my colleagues will agree that, at a minimum, we ought to have in front of us a plan for using the surpluses before we start spending them. That makes sense. Not many people make expenditures without knowing what their paycheck is going to be. That is why we have a budget resolution. That is why we have a budget process. 
   I am the ranking Democrat on the Budget Committee and the chairman of the committee, someone widely respected, is Senator DOMENICI. While we  have our differences, there is a process at play, and we want to see it worked out before we start making expenditures from surpluses we are not even sure of arriving or what the amount of those surpluses is going to be. 
   The Budget Committee has not begun to mark up the budget resolution. We still have some time to meet our deadline, so it is premature to be considering a bill such as this. Before we start handing out scarce private resources to public-subsidized private schools for a few families, let's adopt a plan to protect Social Security, protect Medicare. Let's provide prescription drugs for our seniors. Let's make sure we are on a path toward eliminating our publicly held debt. 
   I also point out there is a technical flaw in this amendment. By eliminating the revenue-raising provisions of the bill, this amendment would trigger an across-the-board cut that we know as a sequester. Such a cut would be required under the Budget Act. The end result is it would force a cut in Medicare, veterans' benefits, farm aid, child support enforcement and foster care, among other programs. I do not think that is the intent of the sponsors. I think the point of this amendment is to spend future projected surpluses. But its actual effect, unless corrected, would be to cut programs such as Medicare and others. Either way, I think it would be a mistake to support this amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to reject the amendment. Let's adopt a budget resolution before we start squandering projected budget surpluses. Let's make sure we can protect Social Security and Medicare before we start raising these funds. And let's not adopt an amendment that perhaps would unintentionally require real and immediate cuts in Medicare, veterans' benefits, and other programs. 
   While I urge defeat for this amendment, I do not want it misunderstood. I do not want it to ensure the passage of the underlying bill, which is to give those tax benefits to people at the upper end of the income scale and help abandon our schools, as opposed to facing up to our problems and working on the public school system; just help people walk away from it. I don't think that is a good way to solve problems. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Fire Safe Dorm Act of 2000. I am pleased that my colleagues in the House, Representatives CAROLYN MALONEY and RUSH HOLT, will join me in offering this important legislation. 
   On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire in a Seton Hall University dormitory claimed the lives of three students and injured 58 others, including at least 54 students, two police officers and two firefighters. The dormitory, Boland hall, was built in 1952, and although it was equipped with smoke detectors, it was not required to be equipped with a fire sprinkler system.  
   Nothing is as painful as a senseless accident that takes the lives of young people. And unfortunately, the Seton Hall community is not alone in its grief. In fact, in the last decade, at least 18 young people lost their lives in dormitory fires. We must do all we can to prevent future tragedies. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an education in a safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know that their children are protected from harm while on school property. 
   That is why I am pleased to offer the Fire Safe Dorm Act of 2000. This legislation is straightforward. It takes two important steps to ensure the safety of student housing. 
   First, the bill requires nationwide standards. Under the Fire Safe Dorm Act, the U.S. Fire Administration would develop comprehensive standards for dormitory fire safety. These standards would include such safety devices as fire sprinklers, smoke detectors, and flame resistant furniture and mattresses. Colleges and universities would be required to develop plans to adopt these new standards within 10 years of the bill's enactment. 
   Second, the Fire Safe Dorm Act requires disclosure. It requires colleges and universities to tell students, prospective students, and their parents, about the safety of campus housing. Specifically, are dormitories equipped with sprinklers? Are the furniture and mattresses fire resistant? Learning institutions are already required to disclose statistics about crime on campus. They should also have to tell the public about the steps they've taken to protect students from fire. 
   Mr. President, the Fire Safe Dorm Act takes important steps to safeguard against another tragedy like the fire at Seton Hall. I urge all my colleagues to support this important measure.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, none of us can possibly ignore what took place yesterday in Michigan. Another child killed by gunfire. Everywhere across the country we see children killing children. And then we see members of the immediate family their faces contorted by sadness. Anyone who has a child or grandchild has to be dismayed and upset by these tragedies. 
   I am fortunate enough to have seven grandchildren, the oldest of whom is 6. Nothing is more joyful than to see their smiling faces--to see them learning about life, reading, playing, and singing. 
   And when I think of my grandchildren, and the other children across this country, I ask myself what it will take to stop the gun violence. When will this Congress say we have enough killing? What does it take to change some minds, to say that guns do kill? 
   I am so tired of that foolish saying: ``guns don't kill people, people kill people.'' Of course, people kill people, but we would see much less deadly violence if we passed common sense gun safety measures. It is getting close to the 1-year anniversary of the tragedy at Columbine. I will never forget the picture of the child hanging out of the window at that school, looking for help, trying to get away from the terror. I thought that terrible violence--12 children killed and many more seriously injured--would force this Congress to act. 
   And yet there has been much more gun violence since Columbine. Shootings in Georgia; in Ft. Worth, Texas, at a prayer meeting. Those young people were gathered to worship and along comes someone with a gun and kills them. And then a gunman in California attacks children at a day care. After that terrible assault, the gunman goes on to kill a postal worker because he is Filipino and not white. 
   When will the National Rifle Association and its friends step up to the issue, not always appealing to the extremists, and say there is a sensible way to approach this problem and reduce the proliferation of guns? They should join with us and help close the gun show loophole that allows guns to be sold without a criminal background check. 
   A person could be one the 10 most wanted criminals in this country and say to one of the dealers: I have $500; give me a couple of guns. The dealer could sell them, and he would not be breaking the law. It is an outrage. 
   Of course, some who oppose gun safety legislation talk about the Second Amendment. But there is nothing in the Constitution that says citizens can buy a gun without identifying themselves. There is nothing in the Constitution that says, buy a gun, carry it anyplace you want. No, no; there are overriding considerations that say we have to protect our citizens. We put people in uniform to protect our citizens. Sometimes it is a military uniform, sometimes it is a police uniform. We do it to protect our citizens. Why don't we reduce the possibility that a gun might be introduced into a situation? 
   In 1996, Congress did pass my domestic violence gun ban. There was a huge fight on the floor of this Senate and the House. In cooperation with President Clinton, on the budget bill, we said anybody who has committed a misdemeanor of spousal abuse or abusing a child, that person should not have a gun. We fought like the devil. People said we have no right to take guns away from people who haven't done something serious. 
   But domestic violence is serious. And guns make domestic violence incidents even more dangerous. The trigger does not have to be pulled to traumatize a spouse or a child. Let a man put a gun to a woman's head and say: I will blow your brains out in front of your children. That is a wound that does not go away in a hurry. Doctors cannot see that wound on the skin, but it does not go away. 
   Mr. President, since that law went into effect, 33,000 purchases have been prevented. 33,000 of those wife abusers, spousal abusers, could not get a gun. I feel good about it. And I still cannot understand those people who opposed it and who continue to oppose gun safety measures. They seem to want guns for everyone, wherever they want, at any age, it doesn't matter, hide them, conceal them, do what you want. 
   That is irresponsible. And we should not have people hiding behind empty slogans like ``guns don't kill people''. Or trying to distort the meaning of the Second Amendment. No one has a right to hurt another. That is not in the Constitution. 
   Just a few minutes ago we learned that there was another shooting near Pittsburgh. We don't have all the details, but someone shot four people in a McDonald's and then went to a Burger King and shot someone else. 
   So the gun violence continues, week by week, day by day, hour by hour. Yesterday it was a six-year-old in Michigan killing another child. And we ask ourselves what can be done. Do you put a 6-year-old in jail? Do you lock him up in a cell? Or do you say to a parent or a friend: It is your responsibility? 
   If you own a car, you have no right to give it to somebody who doesn't know how to drive and tell them to have a good time. That can be criminally prosecuted if a person has an accident. Why is a gun different? Why shouldn't all guns be protected from access by unacceptable users, children, deranged people, et cetera? 
   We ought to do it. We keep avoiding it with silly excuses in this place. I hope people across America understand we ought to stop this now. We can require gun manufacturers to manufacture guns that don't work except in the hands of an authorized user. Thirteen children a day die from gunshots; over 4,500 kids a year. We can pass a bill that Senator DURBIN from Illinois has authored, the Child Access Prevention Act. It imposes criminal penalties on gun owners who allow children access to their guns. 
   And we ought to take stronger measures to prevent easy access to guns. Closing the gun show loophole which allows criminals to purchase firearms without a background check will help. Let me give a graphic example why we cannot afford to wait any longer to do this. 
   Every year, several gun shows are held in Portland, OR at the Expo Center. The Expo Center is managed by a commission established by the local government, the Metropolitan Exposition-Recreation Commission, called Metro for short. Metro officials were concerned about possible criminal activity at gun shows, so they looked at police records and put together a report. Here is what they found:  
   Investigative reports from the Portland Police Bureau demonstrate a continuing pattern of frequent significant criminal activity  associated with the Rose City gun shows at the Expo Center.  
   And the report gives examples of that criminal activity. Here is an example:  
   Three subjects were observed in the gun show wearing gang attire. The three subjects were looking for dealers who do not do background checks. One of the subjects attempted to purchase a Glock pistol without any paperwork. The subjects bought 4 high capacity magazines and exited the show. Officers contacted the subjects and found one subject all in red to be 12 years old. The second subject all in blue had a warrant for his arrest. The last subject was found to be an ex-felon. The two adults were arrested and transported to NE precinct. At the NE precinct officers found marijuana packaged for sale and $1,150 in the last subject's shoe. He was charged with delivery of a controlled substance.  
   So we have gang members--drug dealers--using a gun show as a convenience store for guns. These gang members were looking for gun sellers who were not required to do criminal background checks. 
   And this testimony is similar to what we heard from Robyn Anderson when she testified before the Colorado legislature. She is the young woman who went with Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold to the Tanner Gun Show in Adams County, Colorado. 
   She testified that Harris and Klebold went from table to table at the gun show, looking for gun sellers who were not required to complete a background check. 
   With her help, Harris and Klebold bought two shotguns and a rifle without a criminal background check. And everybody knows what happened after that. They used those guns to murder fellow students and a teacher at Columbine High School. How much more do we need to know before we do the sensible thing and close this loophole? 
   Gang members and teenagers bent on committing murder know they can go to a gun show and get a firearm if they want, without a background check. Is there anyone around here who actually thinks that is all right? Good friends on the other side, good friends on both sides will sometimes defend gun ownership blindly. But we should all agree that you should not be able to buy a gun without identifying yourself and having a criminal background check. 
   The gun lobby says we do not need a new law, all we need to do is enforce the current law. But that completely misses the point. There is a loophole in the law, so when you try to enforce it, criminals simply slip through the loophole. This hole in our gun laws is leaking human lives and we ought to plug it before someone else is killed with a pistol or shotgun purchased at a gun show without a background check. People ought to identify themselves when they buy a gun. Why not? 
   Some of our colleagues who argue against closing this loophole are the same people who go on and on about the need to get tough on crime. But when it comes to this gaping loophole in our gun laws, they are strangely quiet. All of us know why. Those tough-on-crime Members do not hear the huge majority of the people. Ninety percent of the people in this country, according to a recent poll, are calling for us to close this loophole. They do not hear the cries, see the tears of those who have lost a child, a friend, a relative. But what do they hear? They hear the NRA making deposits to their campaign accounts. They hear the NRA saying: Do nothing and we will keep these campaign contributions coming. 
   I have been fighting this battle for a long time, almost a year now on this specific issue. Back on May 20, 9 months ago, the Senate passed my amendment to close the gun show loophole. It passed 51-50, with a huge struggle. But the Congress has yet to finish the job because the NRA has been putting its money to work making sure my amendment stays bottled up in a conference committee. 
   Let's do the right thing and set this legislation free. Let's not allow extremists in the gun lobby to prevail over the families across this country who want to stop the gun violence. 
   April 20 will mark 1 year since the terrible tragedy at Columbine High School. On that day, people across this country will ask, What has Congress done? What have you done to stop gun violence in this country? What have you done to protect my child, my grandchild, my brother, my sister, my parents from this mad gun violence? It is not too late to give the public the answer they want, the answer they deserve. It is not too late to show them that common sense can prevail in this distinguished place.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I introduce the Smoker's Right to Know and Truth in Tobacco Labeling Act. I am joined by my colleagues, Senator LUGAR, Senator DURBIN, and Senator CHAFEE. 
   Mr. President, the Smoker's Right to Know and Truth in Tobacco Labeling Act has two common-sense objectives. 
   First, the bill will require tobacco manufacturers to disclose the ingredients of their products to the public--including toxic and cancer-causing ingredients. 
   Second, our bill will replace the small health warnings on the side of a cigarette pack with larger warnings on the front and back that are simple and direct: ``Cigarettes Cause Cancer.'' ``Cigarettes are Addictive.'' ``Smoking Can Kill You.'' 
   Of the hundreds of products for sale in America that go into the human body, tobacco products are the only ones--the only ones--for which manufacturers do not have to disclose ingredients. Even Coca-Cola, with a proud tradition of keeping its formula secret, has to list Coke's ingredients on every can. 
   Mr. President, manufacturers of every food product and every over-the- counter drug disclose their contents. Cigarette manufacturers do not. Yet, of any consumable product for sale in the United States, cigarettes are by far the most deadly. 
   One in three smokers will die from a smoking-related disease. That is more than 400,000 Americans every year. We should disclose information on cigarette ingredients to the public and provide realistic warnings about the health risks cigarettes cause. 
   Mr. President, how much do smokers really know about the chemicals they are inhaling with every puff of cigarette smoke? When a smoker lights a cigarette, the burning ingredients create other chemicals. Some of these are carcinogenic.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am pleased to join my colleague from North Carolina, Senator EDWARDS, in introducing the College Fire Prevention Act. 
   On Wednesday, January 19, 2000, a fire raged through a dormitory at Seton Hall University, claiming the lives of three students and injuring 58 others, including at least 54 students, two police officers and two firefighters. The dormitory, Boland Hall, was built in 1952, and although it was equipped with smoke detectors, it was not required to be equipped with a fire sprinkler system. 
   Nothing is as painful as a senseless accident that takes the lives of young people. And unfortunately, the Seton Hall community is not alone in its grief. In fact, in the last decade, 18 young people lost their lives in dormitory fires. We must do all we can to prevent future tragedies. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an education in a safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know that their children are protected from harm while on school property. 
   That is why I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of this legislation to provide Federal matching grants for the installation of fire sprinkler systems in student housing. This bill authorizes the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the U.S. Fire Administration, to award grants to equip dormitories, sorority, and fraternity houses with fire sprinkler systems. 
   I thank Senator EDWARDS for sponsoring this important legislation, and I look forward to working with him to ensure that student housing is as safe as possible.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a good day for New Jersey. I am so pleased the Senate has confirmed the appointment of an outstanding citizen of our State, Joel Pisano, for a seat on the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. He is a competent, thorough, well-thought-of individual. I thank Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY for their help in moving Mr. Pisano's nomination through the Judiciary Committee and their support of his nomination. 
   I recommended him in June of 1999. I am grateful to hear he was confirmed by a vote of 95 to 2. 
   Joel Pisano has outstanding credentials. He is going to be an excellent addition to our district court. The backlog of cases is very high. It takes a long time for people to bring their cases and have them adjudged. Joel Pisano will be an excellent addition to our bench and help move that caseload fairly and rapidly. 
   He has served as a magistrate judge since 1991. He is already performing many of the duties of a district court judge, including jury and nonjury trials. He has managed pretrial proceedings in about 600 civil cases, so he is used to controlling the large caseload of a Federal court. He has also dealt with a wide variety of different cases--patent and trademark cases, environmental cleanup disputes, antitrust and securities litigation, employment discrimination cases, and civil RICO matters. 
   I did a lot of personal research, as I have on all of the recommendations I have made to the Federal bench, and I was so pleased to hear of the unanimous approval of Mr. Pisano as a candidate for the Federal bench. 
   He has a reputation for competence, energy, and commitment that perfectly fits the profile of an excellent candidate to sit on the Federal district court bench. 
   He has consistently impressed everyone who appears before him and who works with him in his capacity for fairness and his thorough understanding of the law. 
   I heard not one critical note from the people I spoke to--lawyers, judges, those who make up much of the legal community in the State of New Jersey. 
   Prior to his appointment as a magistrate, Mr. Pisano was a partner in a distinguished law firm. In the 13 years he spent representing clients, he developed an expertise in a wide variety of areas, in both civil and criminal matters. 
   Mr. Pisano appeared in court almost every day and tried 150 cases to conclusion. He also managed the litigation section of his firm, which I think was an early indication of the supervisory skills that have served him so well as a magistrate. 
   Magistrate Pisano's depth of experience and organizational skills are exactly what we need at a time when staggering caseloads are making it more and more difficult for our Federal judges to spend as much time with each case as they would wish. 
   He will tackle his new responsibilities with energy to spare. I am pleased the Senate confirmed him. I am honored that I brought him to the attention of the Senate. I believe he will serve as one of our most outstanding judges in the district court. 
   Mr. President, I thank my friend from Florida and yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on April 20, we are going to mark a 1-year anniversary of the terrible tragedy that occurred at Columbine High School in Colorado. That was the day when two teenagers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, walked into the school and sprayed the library and cafeteria with gunfire, killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding many others. A few who were aware of what took place that day will never forget that horrible scene of a young man jumping out a window, people running, weeping, the whole place in disarray, students lying on the ground wounded, some fatally. 
   You would have thought by now, 9 months after that massacre, that Congress would have been able to get together to pass commonsense gun safety measures. Some of my colleagues will say there is not much we can do about it. 
   No, we cannot go back and undo that tragedy, but we sure can do something that maybe will prevent something similar from happening in the future. It is preposterous to say we can't do anything better. We can do a lot about it. Reasonable gun safety legislation can make a difference. 
   For proof, I ask that we take a look at testimony of the young woman, Robyn Anderson, before the Judiciary Committee of the Colorado House of Representatives. In case the name isn't familiar, Robyn Anderson is the young woman who went with Harris and Klebold to the Tanner gun show in Adams County, CO. It was in late 1998. She wanted to help them buy guns. 
   Harris and Klebold were too young to buy guns because they had an 18-year age limit, but Robyn Anderson was 18. She bought three guns at that gun show, two shotguns, and a rifle, and immediately handed them over to Harris and Klebold. Four months later, Harris and Klebold used all three of those guns in their murderous rampage. 
   This is what Ms. Anderson said during her testimony:  
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold had gone to the Tanner gun show on Saturday and they took me back with them on Sunday........While we were walking around, Eric and Dylan kept asking sellers if they were private or licensed. They wanted to buy their guns from someone who was private--and not licensed--because there would be no paperwork or background check.  
   That was her statement to the committee in the Colorado House. As all can see, they had one mission: to avoid a background check. 
   I am the author of a piece of legislation we tried to get through the Senate that said we ought to have everybody available for a background check. We know those unlicensed dealers who were able to sell at these gun shows--and there are over 4,000 gun shows a year--unless a State law says no, can sell guns to anybody who has the money. They can put them in the back of their car. They can carry them on their shoulder. Even someone who is listed on the 10 Most Wanted--criminals--could qualify to buy a gun from one of these dealers. 
   Tragically, these three young people found three gun dealers, and they bought their deadly weapons. This is what she had to say about gun sales at gun shows:  
   It was too easy. I wish it had been more difficult. I wouldn't have helped them buy the guns if I had faced a background check. 
   Robyn Anderson said that in front of the Colorado legislature. This shows clearly that background checks for gun sales can make a difference. They can keep guns out of the wrong hands. 
   When the National Rifle Association says that our gun laws are sufficient, it is wrong. They are simply out of line. There is a glaring loophole--the gun show loophole--which Congress must close. 
   There is no more time for delay. The American people are requesting action, demanding it, if you look at surveys. I hope my colleagues will complete action on the juvenile justice bill because it did contain a prohibition on gun sales that are done at gun shows without a background check. Now, that was knocked out of the House bill as it came over to the Senate for conference. But the fact is that it was in the Senate bill, and we ought to include it in any bill that finally passes. Let's do it before we mark the anniversary of that terrible day at Columbine High School, showing that we are serious and that we care about what happened. 
   In the nine months since April 20, we have seen more terrible shootings and bloodshed. In May of last year, a teenager in Conyers, GA, shot and injured six of his classmates. In July, a gunman in Ohio shot three teenage girls and the teacher of a Bible study group. In August, a white supremacist stormed into a Jewish community center near Los Angeles and shot two children and a senior citizen. Later that day, before this culprit was apprehended, he shot and killed a postal worker. In September, more gun violence--a gunman in Fort Worth, TX, walked into a Baptist church and killed seven young people who were there for a prayer meeting before shooting himself. In November, the worst mass shooting in Hawaii's history--a Xerox employee killed seven coworkers. Yet another school shooting in December--a seventh grader in Fort Gibson, OK, takes his father's gun to school and wounds four classmates. 
   That is what we see. It doesn't matter what the heritage is of the individuals; race or religion doesn't matter. Everybody is subject to this kind of violence if they are in the wrong place at the wrong time. These are just the shootings that got the most attention. Month after month, the death toll from gun violence continues to mount. From Colorado to Georgia, from Ohio to California, from Texas to Hawaii, families across this country continue to mourn. 
   What do we do here in Congress about it? Nothing. It is a disgrace. 
   Of course, the Senate did pass several reasonable measures as part of the Juvenile Justice bill, including the amendment I mentioned before, which would prevent criminals from being able to buy guns at gun shows. 
   Technically, this legislation is stuck in a conference committee. For those who are not part of the structure here, the conference committee is where legislation is finally resolved when the House committee and the Senate committee, with similar jurisdiction, meet together and argue out the differences, if any, in a bill. But it would be more accurate to say that it is being held hostage by the extremists at the NRA and the politicians who march lockstep to their commands. 
   We have to free this legislation, and we dare not let the gun lobby prevail over the vast majority and the will of the American people who simply want to make their families a little safer. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in pushing the congressional leadership to finish work on the juvenile justice bill. We want to do it before there is another episode of gun violence, another loss of life that could be avoided. We have to do more to stop the gun violence, the epidemic that lies within our country. I hope we will be able to do it soon. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Kansas for his recognition. 
   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment being offered by my friends and colleagues, Senators LEVIN and DURBIN. It would prevent gun manufacturers from using the bankruptcy system to evade responsibility for the damage caused by their deadly products. 
   It is time for this Congress to catch up with the American people. The public is demanding an end to the epidemic of gun violence that has turned parts of this country into shooting galleries. Criminals are amassing arsenals of deadly weapons and using them to gun down whole groups of people, from Hawaii to Seattle, from Texas to Kentucky, yet Congress has failed to see the lesson in these tragedies. 
   As a result, the American people in cities across the country are turning to the legal system, desperate for help. Thirty cities and counties are suing gun manufacturers for death and injuries caused by firearms. Individual families are suing to hold gunmakers accountable for the loss or harm brought to loved ones. 
   These lawsuits are already making significant headway against the formidable power of the gun industry. In the case of Hamilton v. Accutek, a jury in Brooklyn, NY, found several gun manufacturers responsible for the damage caused by that product. 
   In Georgia, a judge allowed a suit filed by Atlanta against the gun industry to move forward. 
   In California, a Federal judge barred gun manufacturers from using bankruptcy as a shield when their products caused death or injury. 
   It was not long ago that gunmakers would laugh when you suggested they take some responsibility for the devastation firearms have caused. But the tears of our citizens have finally wiped away the smile now that 30 cities and counties across the country are taking them to court. 
   Today, gun manufacturers are talking about making safer firearms and working to keep guns away from criminals, things they never would have considered discussing just a year ago. 
   They are making these changes because gun victims are holding them accountable in court. Families, friends, and neighbors of gun victims are using the legal system to seek some measure of solace. Congress ought not to get in the way. The Levin-Durbin amendment sends a clear message that the gun industry must face up to its responsibilities, that it will not find an easy escape in the bankruptcy court when families bring valid lawsuits. 
   And this Congress has to do more to stop gun violence. It is disgraceful that the Congress has not passed reasonable gun safety measures, including my amendment that requires criminal background checks at gun shows. It is especially troublesome when one stops to consider that the Nation's largest gun manufacturer, Sturm, Ruger and Co., has expressed concern about the sale of its guns at gun shows. 
   The gunmakers themselves are seeing the light, but Congress is still fumbling for the switch. Most Americans assumed the horrific shootings in Columbine would be enough. Most Americans thought the vision of two high school students systematically killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 23 others would finally spur this Congress to action. 
   April 20 will mark one year since that terrible tragedy at 
   Columbine, and it would be outrageous for Congress to let that day pass without having passed a single piece of gun safety legislation. The Senate did pass sensible gun safety measures as a part of the juvenile justice bill, including the amendment I offered that would prevent criminals from getting guns at gun shows, but we simply need to finalize a good, tough bill and send it to the President. 
   While this legislation is technically stuck in conference, I am afraid it is being held hostage by the extremists at the National Rifle Association, and we should not allow that to continue. I am going to continue to speak on the Senate floor. I will take whatever other steps are necessary to engage Congress in that action. 
   When the Congress wants to act quickly, it does. We often push legislation through the process in a matter of days, but not legislation aimed at reducing gun violence. Those measures run into one delay after another, even though the vast majority of the American people are pleading for action. Failing to act by that horrible anniversary date, April 20, will be a travesty. How will we be able to answer the families who ask what we have done to stop the killing? 
   I urge my colleagues to join me and others in bringing this nationwide epidemic under control. The forces on the other side are powerful, but we have to help keep our families and communities safe and make the gun industry accountable. Support the Levin-Durbin amendment, and then we ought to complete the work on the gun safety measures in the juvenile justice bill. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, before I start my principal subject, I will take a couple minutes to commend the Democratic leader for his earlier comments. 
   We are all ready to go to work, and tomorrow we start with the Budget  Committee. We are to hear from Chairman Greenspan from the Federal Reserve, and we are going to be talking about where we go from here in terms of the economy. 
   Based on what I hear in the various Presidential campaigns, it looks as though we are going to be discussing paying down the debt to some degree. The question is, to what degree? Where is it that we ought to be focusing the use of the significant balances, the surpluses we are going to see? I hope, consistent with Senator DASCHLE's comments, we will not be looking at tax cuts as a principal direction. To paraphrase Will Rogers, I never met anyone who didn't want to pay less taxes. But the fact is, our economy is moving at the pace it is for very specific reasons--encouraging investment, curbing our spending, and in many cases curbing it where it hurts but is necessary to get through this transitory period where we went from a debit balance to a credit balance. Looking at our surpluses and wondering about the debates, I contemplate where we are going to be spending these surpluses. 
   I think the way to continue this prosperity, the way to make sure that America goes into this new century with as much energy as it can have, is to be looking at paying down the debt, paying it down as fully as we can, taking care of the essential programs that we know are needed by our constituents across the country. 
   The last thing I think people want to see is random tax cuts that benefit the wealthy to an unusually high degree, while those struggling to make a living are concerned about interest costs for mortgages, their schooling, and various other things that are an important part of basic life.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, tragedy struck in New Jersey last week. It was obviously of enough significant interest that it was portrayed across the country. Three students who were 18 years old lost their lives in a dormitory fire, and several others were seriously injured. We are still waiting, with hope and prayer, to hear that they are going to be able to recover. This is virtually in my neighborhood back home. I know Seton Hall University well. I know the president and the archbishop of the diocese; we are very good friends. 
   Everybody wanted to reach out and do something. The first of the three funerals was held today. It is a sad day. It raises a question about what we should expect in a dormitory. Hindsight won't do us much good in this instance. The building they were in was built a long time ago. The tragic fire took place last Wednesday. The fire started inside a six-story residence hall. It took the lives of 3 students and injured 62 others, including at least 58 students, 2 police officers, and 2 firefighters. 
   Mr. President, we don't have to tell anybody that nothing is as painful as a senseless accident--which perhaps we can avoid seeing in the future--that takes the lives of young people. Anyone who is a parent or relative of an 18-year-old would be seriously grieved by what happened. 
   I know I speak for all of us in the Senate in extending our sympathies to the families of the three students who died in the fire. They are Frank Caltabilota of West Long Branch, NJ; John Giunta of Vineland, NJ; and Aaron Karol of Green Brook, NJ, whose funeral was the first one this morning. 
   We also extend our support and prayers to the families of the students and the others who were injured. We are tremendously grateful to the firefighters and the other people who worked so hard to prevent the loss of more lives. 
   It is still too early to know what caused this fire, but we must make sure, once the cause is known, that Federal, State, and local jurisdictions take whatever steps are necessary to prevent this from happening again. Students have a fundamental right to pursue an education in a safe, secure environment. Parents have a right to know their children are protected from harm while on school property. 
   Seton Hall University is holding a memorial service tomorrow for the victims of the fire. The enormity of this tragedy, however, extends far beyond the confines of Seton Hall University's campus. At the very least, the investigation of this catastrophe should sharpen our focus on fire prevention at campuses across the country and should mark this fire, Lord willing, as the last one of its kind. 
   I have introduced this resolution, which should pass the Senate today, expressing the sympathy of the entire Senate to the families of the victims and the Seton Hall community. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Mr. Michael J. Naples. ``Napes,'' as he is affectionately called by all who know him, is retiring after 29 years of teaching at Ocean City High School in New Jersey. He has earned great respect from students and peers alike. Each year the students Mr. Naples' taught and the athletes he coached attest to his dedication to excellence. 
   Although his first commitment was to education, his enthusiasm for cross-country and track leave an enduring legacy at Ocean City High School. Mr. Naples' cross-country record over the last 21 years is 209 victories and 28 losses. His track record is 133 wins and only 8 losses. During his tenure as a track coach, Mr. Naples led the Raiders to two state titles and coached 9 individual state champions. 
   His greatest moment as a coach came during the 1989 cross-country season, when he inspired his girls' team to capture the first state title for an Ocean City High School team in 24 years! 
   Mr. President, it is often difficult to say goodbye to a teacher who has touched the lives of so many people. This is a teacher whose former students are continually coming back to thank him for inspiring them, educating them and, most importantly, caring about them. My deepest respects go to this inductee of the New Jersey Interscholastic Athletic Association Hall of Fame. He has left a lasting legacy of high academic standards and excellence in sports.

   Mr. President, I raise my voice in opposition to this amendment because I think it is a wrong-headed distraction from the real issue that parents all over this country care about--the epidemic of gun violence in our society at large and especially in our schools. 
   This amendment would allow Federal education funding to be shifted from special education, computer technology, bilingual education, and other key programs to provide vouchers to students who are victims of school violence. 
   In a way, I have to tell you that I think this amendment has a cruel twist to it because we all want to be of help wherever we can be to those who are victimized by violence. But look at the way the program is designed. 
   Vouchers to schools? It doesn't, in my view, really make a lot of sense when in fact, if we could keep guns away from our schools, we would not have to be thinking about vouchers but, rather, about how we educate our children. We could bring the teachers into the schoolrooms, as the President would like to have us do--100,000 teachers. Perhaps the workloads of many would be able to be confined to a serious review of the educational requirements. 
   This amendment is disturbing on many levels--so many that I am not sure where we begin. 
   Is this the answer to school violence--ignore the causes, do nothing to remedy the issue, but ship certain kids out of public schools? 
   Does the Republican majority really believe schools should cut special education and computer funding in public schools to fund voucher programs? 
   We are approaching the 21st century. Everyone knows that whatever the 20th century brought by way of technology, computers, et cetera, is likely to be dwarfed in the earliest years of the 21st century. It all starts with a computer base. Why we would want to take funds away from those programs is really hard to understand. It is not what America's parents want. They want answers. We had one of the answers on the floor of this Senate. It passed this body. They want to see a juvenile justice bill passed, but the majority has buried this legislation in conference and declared it dead for the year. It is hardly a way to respond to the anguished calls we hear all over this country. 
   It includes, yes, stricter punishments for those who would violate the rules of behavior in our society. But it also closed a gun show loophole that took the anonymous buyer out of the equation. It reduced the possibility that anyone who is on the 10 Most Wanted List of the FBI could walk into a gun show and buy a gun. As outrageous as that sounds, that is the truth. 
   I don't know when the Congress is going to catch up with the American people. The American people are so far ahead of Congress that it is embarrassing. Poll after poll after poll pleads with the Senate and pleads with the House to take away the availability of guns. At least, if you are not going to take it away, make sure that those who buy guns are qualified; that they know what to do; that they are mature; that they are not likely to use them for a violent ending. 
   The public is demanding an end to the gun violence. It has reached epidemic proportions. The events of last week prove no one is safe from maniacs who amass arsenals of deadly weapons and use them to gun down whole groups of people--people from Hawaii to Seattle, from Colorado to Texas to Kentucky. 
   Just think about it. Schoolchildren, high school children at Columbine--everyone remembers that and will never forget the picture of that child hanging out the window pleading for help before he fell to the ground. Then the next one is office workers running away from a gunman in Atlanta, GA; the next, a picture of youngsters gathering together to pray while being assaulted by a gunman and running for their lives. 
   We have to do something to stop this insanity. We have to do something about a system that makes it easier for someone to buy a gun than to get a driver's license. 
   We are about at the end of this legislative session. One thing is clear--we have given in to the extremists, to the gun lobby, the NRA that opposed even the most commonsense proposal to stop gun violence. If I were their adviser, or counselor, I would say: Listen, guys and women. Let's give in on this one. It doesn't hurt us a darned bit, and it makes us look as if we are in touch with the American people. But no; the extremists went out, and they have their hand in this place. They have their hand in the House, and they turned our programs away from public opinion and public demand. 
   Most Americans assumed that the horrific shootings in Columbine would be enough--the ultimate outrage. Most Americans thought that the vision of 2 high school students 
   systematically killing 12 classmates and a teacher and wounding 23 others would finally spur Congress to action, would finally say ``that is enough,'' ``that is enough.'' 
   After that terrible incident, 89 percent in one poll and 91 percent in another poll asked for the elimination of the gun show loophole. But it was ignored here. The public ought to look at why it was ignored. 
   The reason I think it was ignored is that campaign contributions overwhelmed the good judgment and the demand of the American people--campaign contributions. Get elected; that is what counts. There is more to it than that. 
   It was 7 months ago when that happened. Congress hasn't acted even while the body count rises. Just last week, nine more people were shot and killed in rampages by two gunmen. One of these gunmen owned 17 handguns. 
   In May of this year, the Senate--with Vice President GORE'S help--passed my gun show loophole amendment as part of the juvenile justice bill. The gun show loophole amendment said that where gun shows, where so many guns are bought, traded, and sold, had a place for nonlicensed gun dealers, non-Federally-licensed gun dealers, anyone--it didn't matter who you were--could walk up to one of those gun dealers and say, ``Give me 20 guns, and here is the money.'' There would be no questions asked: What is your name? Where do you live? What do you do for a living? Have you been in jail? Have you been a drug addict? Have you been an alcoholic? Have you been known to have bursts of temper, outrage, beaten your wife, your children? Not one question. It is outrageous--not one question. We tried to close that loophole. It was a commonsense measure that would have stopped lawbreakers, underage children, and the mentally unstable from walking into a gun show and walking out with a small arsenal. 
   We passed it 51 to 50. But as soon as the Senate passed my amendment, the NRA sounded its alarm and its allies went to work to defeat the proposal in the House. 
   The gun lobby spent millions on radio and TV ads, but, of course, those ads didn't mention the gun massacres that followed Columbine. They didn't mention that. In the first week of July, a violent racist went on a shooting rampage in Illinois and Indiana killing two people and injuring nine. Or that a few weeks later, a deranged day trader in Atlanta shot 9 people to death in an  office and wounded 13. Or that in August, a man with a .44-caliber Glock gun killed three coworkers in Alabama. 
   No State is safe. There is no group of people that is safe--no ethnic group, religious group, or otherwise. 
   Five days after that, a white supremacist killed a Filipino postal worker and shot four young people at a Jewish day-care center. Who will forget that scene--these little kids, like my grandchildren, being led by policemen out of the schoolhouse, where they went to learn and have fun, running away from a killer? 
   Last month, a well-armed maniac walked into the Baptist Church in Ft. Worth, TX, and killed seven young people who were at a prayer gathering. 
   Day by day, the death toll mounts. Our family, children, friends, and neighbors are being gunned down in our schools, in our houses of worship, where we work and live. 
   More than 34,000 people are killed by guns every year, more than lost during the Korean war. Additionally, we wind up treating 134,000 gunshot wounds, and the cost to the country is over $2 billion; taxpayers pay almost half of that. 
   While the NRA may be on the Republican side, law enforcement is on our side. I worked with law enforcement drafting my gun show amendment, and I received numerous letters from law enforcement organizations supporting that amendment and other gun safety measures the Senate passed.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, some of my colleagues may recall that former President George Bush resigned from the NRA because the organization referred to law enforcement people as ``jack-booted thugs.'' What a twist to refer to our law enforcement people courageously out there risking their own lives to protect others and referring to them as ``jack-booted thugs.'' I saluted President Bush for that one. 
   We ought to be skeptical when the NRA says it supports law enforcement. We ought to be skeptical when they use the second amendment to promote extremist views. What does the second amendment say?  
   A well-regulated Militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.  
   It doesn't say one ought to be able to buy it without a license. It doesn't say if someone is crazy, they ought to be able to buy a gun. It doesn't say if one is 12 years old, they ought to be able to buy a gun. It doesn't say one ought to be able to buy as many guns as they want. No matter how broadly one interprets that, there is nothing that says one shouldn't have to have a license to buy a gun. 
   The interpretation of the amendment has been broadened and the courts don't hold or support that. That is the kind of gobbledygook that accompanies that. It is like saying guns don't kill; people kill. Who pulls the trigger? Animals. I guess maybe in some ways they are. 
   We never hear the NRA talk about the first 13 words in that amendment:  
   A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State .....  
   They only cite the last 14 words when they argue that the amendment creates an unlimited right for individuals to bear arms. 
   Nonsense. The NRA knows the history of the second amendment doesn't support the organization's radical views. When the Constitution was being debated, each State had its own militia. Most adult males were required to enlist and to supply their own equipment, including their own guns. The second amendment was written in response to concerns that excessive Federal power might lead to the Federal Government passing laws to disarm those State militias. 
   The United States has changed a great deal since then. We no longer have State militias where citizens are required to provide their own arms. Thank goodness we have a National Guard--a State-organized military force--that is more limited and depends on government-issued weapons. They are there to respond to protecting the public. 
   If my colleagues are interested in reading more about reality and the myths surrounding the second amendment, I urge them to read some recent scholarly articles written by independent historians whose research has not been funded by the NRA. These include articles by Saul Cornell, a history professor at Ohio State University; an editorial by Garry Wills, a Pulitzer Prize-winning history professor at Northwestern University; and an article by historian Mike Bellesiles of Emory University.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. The courts have interpreted the second amendment in a straightforward and commonsense way. In the United States v. Miller, decided in 1939, the Supreme Court ruled the amendment guarantees the right to be armed only in service to a well-regulated militia. In other words, no one has an automatic right to own a firearm. 
   The NRA is simply wrong. If they were right, anyone could carry a gun any time they wanted to. People could carry machine guns anywhere they wanted to--to work, restaurants, on airplanes. That is exactly why former Chief Justice Warren Burger, a conservative appointed to the Supreme Court by President Nixon, and a gun owner himself, called the NRA's distortion of the second amendment a fraud on the American public. That is a Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. 
   I hope my colleagues will put aside the false rhetoric of the extremist NRA and listen to other American people, people of every religion, race, color, creed, and profession coming together to try to stop gun violence, people joining together because the right to bear and raise children safely must come before the right to bear arms. People are joining together because there is no need for 200 million firearms in a civilized society. The people are joining together to say if citizens want a gun, they ought to prove they can use it safely. 
   Vouchers are not the answer; a voucher to go to different schools won't solve the problem. Ignoring the problem is not an answer. Instead of wasting our time today on this meaningless amendment, the Senate ought to be working to pass a gun safety bill to close dangerous loopholes. I hope the constituents back home will watch how their Senators vote on matters to control gun violence and compare it to what kind of vote we get on the school voucher issue. 
   On this issue, we will prevail because there is no force stronger than the people united to protect their children. There aren't enough gun lobby dollars to protect politicians who stand in the way. Lord help us. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to join my colleagues in expressing concern about the language that would interfere with enforcement actions against several power companies. Here we have an excellent example of why we should not be addressing complex, controversial matters in last-minute amendments to spending bills. The proponents of the language assert that they have no interest in interfering with the EPA-DOJ enforcement actions. In fact, the language they have been circulating would wreak havoc on the enforcement actions. The proponents assert that they are interested merely in allowing routine maintenance to occur, but in fact their language makes no mention of routine maintenance. The proponents assert that their language would have no impact on the environment, but in fact their language would allow increases in actual emissions. They also raise the specter of drastic effects to the power industry, which we have not seen in other industries that faced similar enforcement actions. 
   At the very least, we should all agree that this issue is sufficiently complicated and controversial, and its impacts on public health profound enough, that it deserves to be worked out in the authorizing process. It is for problems like this that we have authorizing committees, such as the Environment and Public Works Committee on which I sit, and before which I am sure the proponents would find a sympathetic audience. It is in the daylight of the authorizing process, where we can hear from expert witnesses, where we can have public markups, and where we take the time to untangle and properly resolve these types of issues, that we should address this issue.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, overcrowding on our highways and in our skies is almost at the crisis point. We're spending billions of dollars each year in wasted gas and wasted time because there are fewer and fewer ways to get somewhere quickly and comfortably. 
   We're not going to solve that problem by simply building new roads or airports. People don't want airports in their backyards, and there just isn't enough space in many parts of the country for new roads. Besides, new airports and new roads cost billions. And they become obsolete almost as quickly as we build them. 
   Instead of wasting money on ineffective short-term solutions, we should be investing in a transportation plan that promises lasting benefits far into the next century. 
   High-speed rail is the future of transportation in this country. Train travel is comfortable, reliable, and it's getting faster all the time. The rail lines are already there. All we need to do is bring them up to 21st-century standards. 
   The legislation I'm introducing today would make a serious investment in the future of high-speed rail. And an investment in high-speed rail is an investment in less crowded highways and airports, cleaner air, and a new level of productivity for millions of Americans whose jobs and lifestyles depend on efficient transportation. 
   Mr. President, I'm willing to bet that every Member of this Senate has at least one recent memory of a plane flight that went horribly wrong. Missed connections. Hours spent inside an overheated plane stuck on the tarmac. Lost baggage. I know I've had plenty of experiences like that. 
   And even when everything goes according to plan, air travel is uncomfortable at best. You almost have to know yoga just to cram yourself into one of those tiny seats. 
   Commuting by car isn't any better. Parts of Interstate 95 regularly turn into parking lots during week-day rush hours. And all this congestion can lead to truly life-threatening situations. Traffic accidents. Higher pollution levels. Explosions of road rage that actually lead people to pull guns on each other on the highway. 
   Land and financial resources are scarce and we need to make better use of what we already have. Our rail lines are there, ready to help solve the overcrowding problems that are making our other transportation options less and less appealing. But for the most part, U.S. transportation policy has ignored the potential of high-speed rail and our rail system has fallen far below the standards set in nearly every other developed nation on the planet. 
   My legislation seeks to change that by authorizing Amtrak to sell $10 billion in high-speed rail bonds over ten years to develop high-speed corridors across the nation. This leveraging of private sector investment will allow Amtrak to complete the Northeast Corridor high-speed project and provide the funding needed to bring faster, better service to federally designated high-speed corridors in other regions. 
   These corridors cover states in the Northeast, the Southeast, the Midwest, the Gulf Coast, and the Pacific Coast. Our aim is to take what we've learned in the Northeast and provide it to the rest of the nation. 
   The Federal Government would subsidize these bonds by providing tax credits to bondholders in lieu of interest payments. And state matching funds would help to secure repayment of the bond principal. 
   Mr. President, the money we don't spend on high-speed rail today we will have to spend tomorrow--on things like highway construction and pollution controls. 
   Investing in high speed rail is not only good transportation policy, it is good land use policy. Constructing an airport or highway outside of city limits promotes sprawl, robs cities of valuable revenue, and increases the pressure for even more road construction.  Rail travel, on the other hand, is downtown-to-downtown, not suburb-to-suburb. Rail transportation encourages efficient, ``smart growth'' land use patterns, preserves downtown economies, protects open space, and improves air quality. 
   Furthermore, passenger rail stations serve as focal points for commercial development, promoting downtown redevelopment and generating increased retail business and tax revenue. Making efficient and cost-effective use of existing infrastructures is an increasingly important goal and one which this legislation will help achieve. 
   Mr. President, high-speed rail is already proving itself. In 1999, Amtrak's Metroliner train between Washington and New York set its third consecutive ridership record with over two million passengers, and Amtrak reported the highest total revenues in the corporation's 28-year history. The reason is simple--people are becoming less and less satisfied with traveling by plane. And more and more frustrated with gridlock on our highways. 
   You can see why. The summer of 1999 was the most delay-plagued season in history for airlines. And these delays are expensive. In 1998, air traffic control delays cost the airlines and passengers a combined $4.5 billion. 
   Unfortunately, this problem is only going to get worse. The number of people flying is increasing significantly. In 1998 there were 643 million airplane boardings in the U.S., up 25 percent from just five years ago. The Federal Aviation Administration estimates that boardings will increase to 917 million by 2008. Our current aviation system can't handle this demand. We need a quality passenger rail system to relieve some of this pressure. 
   Passenger rail can make a difference, particularly between cities located on high-speed corridors. I went back and looked at the list of the 31 airports expected to experience more than 20,000 passenger hours of flight delays in 2007. The vast majority of these airports--more than three out of four--are located on a high-speed rail corridor. If the funding envisioned in this legislation were made available to develop these corridors, we could take much of the burden of short flights off our aviation system. That would allow airlines to concentrate their limited slots and resources on longer-distance flights. 
   Traffic congestion costs commuters even more--an estimated $74 billion a year in lost productivity and wasted fuel. These commuters, even the ones who continue to drive, will be well served by an investment in high-speed rail corridors. Amtrak takes 18,000 cars a day off the roads between Philadelphia and New York. Without Amtrak, these congested roads would be in far worse shape. Commuters in other parts of the country should be able to benefit from high-quality, fast rail service that takes cars off the road and helps to improve the performance of our overall transportation system. 
   This bill does not just benefit those who ride trains. Everyone who drives a car on congested highways or suffers from delays while using our overburdened aviation system will benefit from the rail investment called for in this legislation. I can tell you, as a former businessman who helped run a very profitable company, that high-speed rail is a smart investment. And it's an investment that deserves support from Congress.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has confirmed Faith Hochberg for a seat on the U.S. District Court for New Jersey. I want to thank Senators HATCH and LEAHY for moving ahead with this nomination at a time when New Jersey's Federal bench is struggling with heavy caseloads and a shortage of judges. Today's action will help New Jersey's Federal courthouses be more fair and more efficient. 
   Ms. Hochberg has served with distinction as the U.S. Attorney for New Jersey since 1994 and she couldn't be more qualified for a Federal judgeship. 
   President Clinton nominated Ms. Hochberg for the District Court on April 22. As the first female U.S. Attorney in New Jersey's history, Ms. Hochberg spearheaded corruption probes that led to the conviction of numerous Newark officials. 
   She also participated in the prosecution of Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski, and she unraveled widespread police corruption in several North Jersey communities. 
   Her office also has a record of aggressively pursuing child pornography cases. From 1994 through 1998, Ms. Hochberg's attorneys handled 67 of those cases, which was the second-highest number among U.S. Attorneys offices across the country.  
   Since 1997, Ms. Hochberg has been a member of the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, which advises Attorney General Janet Reno on issues affecting the U.S. Attorney's Office. Ms. Hochberg, in fact, chairs the White Collar Crime Subcommittee and has focused the committee's attention on cyber-crime issues, which of course will be an increasing concern in the next century. 
   This is particularly true in New Jersey, which has a concentration of high-tech industries and serves as a computer nerve center for large New York-based corporations and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
   Prior to her service as U.S. Attorney, Ms. Hochberg served as Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for law enforcement as well as Senior Deputy Chief Counsel for the Treasury's Office of Thrift Supervision. 
   She also has experience in the private sector, having worked as a partner in a prominent New Jersey law firm. 
   Ms. Hochberg also has outstanding academic credentials. She graduated magna cum laude in 1975 from Harvard Law School, where she edited the Law Review. In 1972, she graduated summa cum laude from Tufts University. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Hochberg has also been a pioneer in her efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. She and a former New Jersey Attorney General organized a project that alerts law enforcement each time a gun is recovered during a criminal incident. That allows those guns to be traced to their sources. 
   Mr. President, this confirmation could not come at a better time. New Jersey's Federal courthouses are stressed to the limit and delays are becoming more and more common. 
   Again, I thank Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY for their efforts to confirm Faith Hochberg. I know she will be an outstanding judge.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair for an opportunity to join my voice with others who have talked about our dear friend, John Chafee. 
   This place is sadder these last couple days because of the unexpected passing of Senator John Chafee. His death has left the Senate and the entire country mourning the loss of one of our most admired and respected elected leaders. 
   Senator Chafee belonged to a breed of public servants who have become a vanishing species in American politics. He was always a gentleman, even under attack while defending causes about which he felt deeply. He always stood for moderation and common sense over political extremism. 
   Senator Chafee was a consensus builder. He believed in bipartisan solutions as an alternative to the typically partisan bickering which is now often a feature of congressional debate. 
   I served for 15 years with John Chafee on the Environment and Public Works Committee--some of those years, obviously, before he became chairman, and these recent years when he was chairman of the committee. He and I were allies on many battles for a cleaner environment. Even when our approaches diverged, his commitment and leadership were always to be admired. He worked tirelessly to make our air cleaner, to keep pollutants from being dumped into our oceans, and to preserve those species that were endangered. 
   He had a wonderful patience factor in his being. Senator Chafee and I spent years trying, in good faith but, unfortunately, unable to reach a consensus on a Superfund reform bill. The reason we failed to reach a consensus was not for lack of effort Senator Chafee put in to try to get a Superfund bill out that was satisfactory to both sides and a majority view. 
   Senator Chafee played an important role in most of the major environmental bills that have come before the Senate since 1977. In standing up for the environment, he often had to stand firmly against overwhelming pressure from powerful special interest groups--not to mention, by the way, pressures from members of his own party, and certainly from some pressures on our side as well--to try and form the consensus we so much wanted to have. He was a role model for all of us in public service and for anyone considering a career in government. He voted his conscience on issues as diverse as child care, welfare reform, tobacco, and transportation, even when voting his conscience meant crossing party lines. 
   I was particularly proud to have Senator Chafee agree with me, when he supported my bill to require background checks at gun shows. These were not easy votes to make because most of the Members of his party felt differently about that. But he stood up for what he believed in and voted that way and spoke that way and was honored for his views. 
   His own gun safety initiatives made him a hero to me and to all Americans. This was noteworthy, considering his wartime experiences in the face of deadly combat. In World War II, he fought with the Marine Corps in the invasion of Guadalcanal. In 1951, he reentered the service and commanded a rifle company in Korea. His political career was exemplary, including 6 years in the Rhode Island legislature, 3 terms as the State's Governor, and 3 years as Secretary of the Navy. And his four highly distinguished terms here in the Senate made him one of the most treasured figures in American politics. 
   In his home State, Senator Chafee was known directly as ``the man you can trust.'' No one was more deserving of that trust or worked harder to earn it. His constituents in Rhode Island and all of us here always knew where Senator Chafee stood on an issue. That was true largely because he believed in the Government's ability to help people, to make their lives better. He didn't buy into the notion that Government was the people's enemy. 
   Mr. President, Senator Chafee's death is an incalculable loss to the Senate and the American people. He set an example that all of us here would be proud to emulate. I know I speak for everyone in the Senate when we extend our deepest sympathies to his wife Ginny, whom we have gotten  to know over the years, and his entire family. Senator Chafee's unique style and his physical and moral courage are irreplaceable. The country has lost a great public servant. We are all poorer with his demise, and we will all miss him. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have heard on this floor that there haven't been any of these late-term abortions performed by doctors or performed in hospitals. The Senator has been diligent on the floor of the Senate in these last days in making sure women's rights are protected. It has been a tough fight. I wonder, to the Senator's knowledge, is it true these late-term abortions have been done exclusively outside of hospitals by nonobstetricians, by nonphysicians? Does the Senator have that kind of information? 
   I had a chance to speak to Ms. Koster, portrayed in the photograph, a woman very happy with her decision to have an abortion in late term. By the way, this is not an unreligious person or not a person we could accuse of immorality. She insisted and told me she had obstetricians and she had it performed in a hospital, as I remember, in Iowa. 
   Is the Senator familiar with that situation?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. My most recent grandchild was delivered 1 week ago, a large baby. My daughter is very active athletically. She produced a 9-pound, 7-ounce baby girl, larger than the two brothers who preceded her. 
   I also have two other daughters, each of whom has two children; one daughter carried a fetus for almost 8 months and something happened. She called me and said: Daddy, I've got bad news. The baby got caught in the cord and apparently choked to death. She wasn't feeling a heartbeat when she went to the doctor. Nothing hurt me more, nothing hurt her more. 
   We are not the kind of family that casually looks at abortion and says everybody ought to have one. This is the right of privacy, is it not?

I inquire as to the Senator's response, if this is an attempt to establish the moral platitudes around which this country should operate--and that is fortified in my view by the fact that while we ignore the opportunity to protect a born child 15 or 10 years old in school, we are unwilling to pay attention to the mother's plea in that case to protect the child; but we hear the National Rifle Association's voice. 
   Does the Senator see a born child, a child going to school, a child walking in the neighborhood, a child at play, as being as protected as the definition that we want to exert here on a woman whose pregnancy is in a late term, and a doctor and she agree that it is an appropriate thing to do? Does the Senator see some kind of conflict here? Or perhaps even hypocrisy? The Senator ought to correct me if I am wrong because I don't want to be wrong about this. 
   As I remember, those who are presently so strongly advocating removing the right of a woman to make a decision, vote against gun control measures that we have when it comes to protecting children. Does the Senator see the same question raised that I see?

Where does the Senator think we are in terms of saying to women, you can't make a choice on your own; you don't have the moral rectitude to go ahead and make this decision, even though you and your doctor agree and there is some risk to the mother's health in carrying this pregnancy. 
   We can't even get an exception to that. Am I right in that interpretation?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a daughter who is my third daughter. She is a superb athlete. She suffers from asthma. It is a very painful thing to witness. 
   My sister was a board member at a school in Rye, NY, a school board in Rye, NY. She was subject to asthmatic attacks. One night at a school board meeting--she carried a little machine she would plug into the cigarette lighter in the car to help her breathe--she felt an attack coming on and she tried to get to her car and she didn't make it. She collapsed in the parking lot, went into a coma, and 2 days later had died. 
   I have a grandson who has asthma and I have a daughter who has asthma. 
   Does the Senator remember anything that got support from the other side to protect lives by adding to the cleansing of our environment by getting rid of the Superfund sites, the toxic sites around which children play and from which they get sick? Does the Senator recall any help we got to protect those children? No. No. No. What we got was a denial. 
   But, heaven forbid a woman should make a decision to protect her health for the rest of her children, or her health for her family, or to continue to be a mother to her other children. Does the Senator recall any similar passion or zeal on those issues when we went up to vote here?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as a member of the Defense Appropriations subcommittee and the conference committee which produced this bill, I am prepared to join with most of my colleagues in voting for its adoption. 
   However, I feel I have a responsibility to raise several serious concerns and reservations about this conference report. 
   First, I am concerned that we as a nation are not allocating our defense dollars as effectively and efficiently as we could to meet future needs. 
   Defense programs sometimes seem to take on lives of their own. They are sustained and even expanded year after year, even if we would not include them in a truly zero-based budget designed to address our top priorities. 
   The Pentagon, and we in Congress, need to ensure that we are giving due priority to real national security needs, particularly opportunities to reduce the risk of conflict, the growing scourge of terrorism, and emerging threats like chemical and biological weapons and cyberwarfare. 
   We need to ask the tough questions, like whether it makes sense to devote billions to accelerating multiple missile defense programs which can be circumvented. 
   My second concern is what I can only describe as budget sleight of hand. 
   This bill is within its allocations, but it would not be if the Congressional Budget Office was simply allowed to do its job. But the political maneuvering forced arbitrary changes to paint a prettier, but fictional picture. The Budget Committees simply directed CBO to revise the numbers downward. This is far more than a minor accounting issue. 
   CBO indicates that its estimates include a $2.6 billion reduction in Budget Authority--the adjustment for spectrum sales--and reductions totaling $13 billion in outlays at the forced direction of the Budget Committees' leadership. We should not fool the public about whether that $13 billion will actually be spent this fiscal year--it will be! 
   We should not be blind-sided by these or other gimmicks through which the majority will claim not to be spending the social security surplus. 
   Earlier this year, many of my colleagues questioned whether certain funding has properly been declared ``emergency'' spending, which means it's a unique expenditure not subject to the budget caps that are supposed to control our spending. 
   How do these cynics feel about the $7.2 billion in Operations and Maintenance funds which this conference report would declare an emergency? 
   This year's Budget Resolution adopted by the majority party which is now in charge even included a requirement that any emergency spending be fully justified in the accompanying report. But the conference report before us simply ignores that requirement. Can anyone with a straight face answer the questions the Budget Resolution would pose? Would they say it in front of a group of accountants or financial analysts? Would they tell their sons or daughters to run their finances that way? 
   Is this Operations and Maintenance spending, much of it requested by the President and funded in prior years, ``sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time''? Is it ``unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated''? 
   An emergency designation such as this in another appropriations bill would be subject to review by the Senate which could only be waived with 60  votes. However, the majority apparently anticipated this emergency because they exempted defense spending from the point of order. 
   My third major concern is what we call the top-line, though most Americans would call it the bottom line. This bill weighs in at $263 billion in new budget authority. That is over $3 billion more than the Defense Appropriations bill passed by the Senate and over $17 billion more than we spent on defense last year. These numbers come straight out of the conference report. 
   I would not deny that we need to address readiness concerns and modernize our armed forces. We live in an uncertain world, a world which has become more dangerous through this body's rejection of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty last night. 
   Can the dramatic increase in defense spending stand at this level while we starve other pressing needs in education, crime prevention, health care, and so many other areas? 
   I am not sure we can. So while I am prepared to vote for this bill today, I would urge President Clinton not to sign it into law until and unless other appropriations bills have reached his desk with sufficient funding levels to meet America's needs. 
   If this can be accomplished without simply resorting to more budgetary sleight-of-hand--and I sincerely hope we can do this--then I hope this bill will become law.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, Chairman BOND, in the Senate report on the Department of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies Appropriations Act, 2000, the committee instructs EPA to ``establish procedures to engage the public in the development, maintenance and modification of information products it offers to the public.'' It is my understanding that the committee does not necessarily intend for this process to consume the time or resources that would be involved in a rule-making. 
   I also understand that, in general, the committee intends that EPA's obligation to honor the public's right to know and to disseminate to the public information about issues affecting human health and the environment should be balanced against the expectations discussed in the ``Environmental Data Management'' section of the report.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this conference report. The East Coast suffered through months of drought this summer, causing enormous crop losses to our farmers. Then Hurricane Floyd arrived with severe rains, further affecting farmers with widespread floods. 
   These two acts of nature are serious emergencies affecting millions of people, yet this conference report does not do nearly enough for farmers on the East Coast. 
   In my state of New Jersey, agriculture is a $1 billion a year business involving 830,000 acres on over 8,000 farms. While in some more rural states these statistics may not be significant on a relative basis. But in a densely populated place like N.J. they are over-powering. 
   This summer's drought caused losses on 406,000 acres affecting 7,000 of those farms. All 21 counties in my state were declared drought disaster areas. It has taken a truly devastating toll on our farm community. 
   According to Secretary Glickman, the drought alone resulted in a total of $1.5 to $2 billion in damages throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions. 
   And now, we have the devastation of Hurricane Floyd on top of the drought disaster. If any state has suffered a true farm disaster this year--it's New Jersey as well as our neighbors in the northeast. 
   Unfortunately, although this conference report contains $8.7 billion in emergency assistance for farmers, only $1.2 billion of that is for weather related disasters. And this $1.2 billion is spread out over the 50 states. That will not leave a fair share for New Jersey and other northeastern states that actually suffered a disaster this year. 
   Numerous New Jersey farmers have been left with no hay, no crops and no livestock worth taking to market. 
   Without our help, the result of these disasters may force some farmers to end decades of family farming and to give up the way of life that they love. 
   This Congress must do more. The situation facing East Coast farmers is a true emergency, in every sense of the word. At a time when we are watching entirely predictable activities like the census being declared emergencies, we are doing little to assist those who face true acts of God. 
   I cannot support this conference report until the farmers in New Jersey and up and down the East Coast receive the help they need.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are about to begin a new century--a new millennium with new opportunities to make the world a safer place. The United States must be taking the lead in pursuing those opportunities. Which will be possible when this Senate ratifies the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty which is our best hope for containing the threat of nuclear war. 
   Unchecked testing of nuclear weapons is the single greatest threat to world peace--and to the security of the United States--as we enter the 21st century. I know none of my colleagues want nuclear weapons falling into the hands of hostile people. None of us want emerging nuclear powers to develop advanced weapons of mass destruction. 
   The CTBT is not a magic wand, but it would make it more difficult for other countries to develop sophisticated nuclear weapons. But unless we act now to ratify this treaty, those remain very real possibilities--with potentially catastrophic consequences. 
   Most of us here grew up during a time when the threat posed by nuclear weapons manufactured by the former Soviet Union were a day-to-day, ever-present reality. That particular danger, of course, is part of history now. But that doesn't mean the United States or any other country can rest easy. In fact, in some ways, the dangers are even greater today. 
   Forty years ago, we at least knew who the enemy was. We knew where to target our defenses. Unless we ratify this treaty and play a role in enforcing it, we won't be completely sure which countries are moving ahead with a nuclear weapons program. 
   Over just the last year and a half, India and Pakistan have conducted missile tests, and Pakistan's elected government has just been overthrown by a military coup. These developments make it more urgent than ever that we hold the line on any further nuclear weapons testing world-wide. 
   That is exactly what this treaty promises to do. In fact, it represents the sort of historic opportunity that was only a dream during the Cold War. An opportunity to create an international monitoring system that would be our best assurance that no country's nuclear testing program moves any further than it already has. But that won't happen without this country's participation. 
   The United States must take the lead in transforming the CTBT from a piece of paper into a force for global security. Our decision to ratify will have a profound effect on the way this treaty is perceived by the rest of the world. 154 nations have signed the CTBT, but many of those countries will ratify it only if the United States leads the way. And every nation with nuclear technology must ratify this agreement before it comes into force. 
   Every President since Dwight D. Eisenhower has stressed the importance of controlling nuclear weapons worldwide. And I hope everyone here will remember that this treaty has strong support from military weapons experts, religious groups, scientists and world leaders. 
   Even more importantly, the American people support ratification of this document. They know how important it is and prove it in polls when they say 82% view the treaty ratification as essential. They will remember how we vote on this issue. And it has to be pretty tough to explain to voters who want their families protected why you didn't vote to ban testing of nuclear weapons. 
   I know the argument has been made that this treaty will somehow compromise our own defenses. But that's a pretty shaky theory. The United States can maintain its nuclear stockpile without testing, using the most advanced technology in the world. So ratifying this treaty won't leave us without a nuclear edge, it will preserve it. At the same time, it will signal our commitment to a more secure and lasting world peace. 
   A number of our colleagues and other people as well have suggested that we don't have the required two-thirds majority to ratify this treaty. As a result, President Clinton has asked that we delay this historic vote a little longer. I am prepared to support that approach with great reluctance because rejecting this essential treaty outright would be the worst possible outcome. But a delay should give my colleagues who are skeptical of this treaty the chance to better understand how it will enhance our nation's security and why it has the support of the American people. 
   I hope that, sometime within the next year, we will have the opportunity to continue this debate and provide the necessary advice and consent to ratify a treaty that would create a more peaceful world in the next century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to make sure we mean it when we say we are going to protect Social Security. Right now I ought to say welcome to the magic show because what we are hearing is rather hypothetical: If we want to protect Social Security by adopting across-the-board reductions in all discretionary appropriations, it should be sufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary. 
   I believe it is more important to say how we are going to do that without at the same time dipping into Social Security. It is not realistic. This is pie in the sky, and the American public ought to know about what we are talking.  
   I do not support deep, indiscriminate cuts in education, defense, or law enforcement. Tell the veterans you want to cut further. I want to hear anybody stand on this floor and say to the veterans who served our country when we needed them and we made promises: Sorry, we are going to cut your benefits. I want them to talk about that. I want to hear them talk about how we are going to provide the kind of law enforcement we want when we will be getting rid of FBI agents and Border Patrol people. Cuts to the Immigration and Naturalization Service could result in a reduction of approximately 2,000 Border Patrol agents, when everybody is screaming about the number of illegal immigrants pouring across our borders. I want to hear them talk about programs such as Head Start that give children a chance to learn if they have not had the benefit of a home life that encourages learning. Mr. President, 43,000 children will be cut from the program. 
   I hope the American public listens. I know they get tired of our droning, but this is the kind of thing they ought to view with interest. I hope we are going to defeat this amendment. 
   Everyone knows it is now October 6. The fiscal year is almost a week old. But obviously, the Republican majority still does not know how they are going to put together their budget. They have declared they do not want to use Social Security surpluses. No, but the declarations ring hollow. In fact, they have been moving legislation that would raid those surpluses of billions of dollars, and they do not want to admit it. 
   The Republican tax bill, for instance, would use Social Security surpluses in the years 2005 through 2008. That is not very far away from our initial attempt to increase the longevity of Social Security. 
   In fiscal year 2008, that raid on Social Security would reach almost $50 billion. Public, listen to this: Now they are pushing bills that will use roughly $20 billion in Social Security funds this very year, the year which started October 1. That is not just my opinion, it is the opinion of the Congressional Budget Office, which is directed by a Republican appointee. 
   The majority has that right. Over the past few weeks, the majority has twisted itself into knots to evade the discretionary spending caps. They have used gimmick after gimmick, to the point where, frankly, the integrity of the whole budget process has been compromised. 
   I hope my colleagues can see this chart. 
   This is what a prominent paper, the Wall Street Journal, had in its issue of July 27: GOP using ``two sets of books.''  
   Lying about the numbers.  
   That is a budget expert, a fellow by the named of Stan Collender on the GOP. ``Directed Scorekeeping''--we will talk about that in a minute.  
   Republicans are double-counting a big part of next year's surplus, papering over the fact that their proposed tax cuts and spending bills already have exhausted available funds.  
   In the House, the Republicans have declared the census that we are required to take, mandated by the Constitution; it comes around every 10 years--they want to declare that an emergency so it gets out of the spending loop. It is hardly an unexpected crisis. Calling it an emergency gets around the discretionary spending caps. For House Republicans, apparently, that is more important than direct, honest budgeting. 
   The Republicans are also using two sets of books, as we see described here, to get around the discretionary spending caps. When it suits their purposes, the majority uses CBO scoring; when it does not, they use OMB scoring. This is mumbo jumbo. For those who are not familiar with what goes on here--using this set of books on the one hand and that set of books on the other hand. 
   If someone was the chief executive of a major corporation--I had the honor of serving in that capacity before I came here--and did that, they could wind up in jail--using books here to describe what is going on on one side, and using books over here to describe a different picture to the public. That is unacceptable behavior but certainly not in this institution. That way, they can pretend they are spending less than they technically are.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Beyond using the emergency designation and using two sets of books, the majority has resorted to the gimmick of artificially shifting huge amounts of spending into the next fiscal year. 
   The Washington Post described this as adding a 13th month to the fiscal year, kind of changing the calendar. It is a gimmick, and the public, again, ought to take notice. It is like getting out of debt by putting existing debts on a second credit card. It may make you feel better today, but it is sure going to make things tougher tomorrow. 
   These are a few of the gimmicks that are being proposed in this legislation. But no matter how many are used, there is no getting around the fact that the majority has busted the spending caps, and they are spending Social Security surpluses. Let's make sure that is clearly understood. They are using the budget surpluses created in the Social Security account to fund Government. They want to take even larger cuts out of programs. 
   There is a better alternative. Instead of using scorekeeping gimmicks, we can use real offsets; that is, take it from another place. For example, we can close special interest tax loopholes. The Republicans even included some of those loophole closers in their tax bill, so this should not be at all that hard. 
   Another option that I personally favor is to simply go to the source that cost this country of ours lots and lots of money, the tobacco industry. Let them fully compensate taxpayers for the costs of tobacco-related diseases that they create. Why should they be protected? I do not understand it. Why cannot we get our friends across the aisle to join us in saying to the tobacco industry: Pay the $20 billion that you cost us with the diseases that you have helped render on our society? 
   It is an outrage. We are going to let them get away with what they do while we say to our citizens: OK, we are going to cut veterans benefits; we are going to cut police efforts; we are going to cut education. Come on. That by itself could virtually eliminate the raid on Social Security--$20 billion by the bills already approved by the Senate. 
   To its credit, the Justice Department is trying to recoup these costs through civil litigation against the tobacco companies. But as we all know, that could take years. Meanwhile, Congress can act now to make the taxpayers whole. We ought to do it. 
   The Nickles amendment, however, proposes another approach. It says: Rather than closing tax loopholes or asking the tobacco industry to pay its fair share, let's cut education, let's cut defense, let's cut the FBI, let's cut the Border Patrol, let's cut environmental protection, and let's cut veterans health care. 
   We heard it said that these across-the-board cuts might be a 2- or 3-percent difference. But those figures are not based on CBO's own estimates; they are based on the so-called ``Directed Scorekeeping.'' That is a direction from the Budget Committee or the leadership to say: Hey, you say it's going to cost $10 billion. I tell you what, let's say something else. Let's say it's only going to cost $9 billion. OK, $9 billion. There is no basis in fact, but let's say it. 
   It is based on politically driven assumptions about how much bills will cost, not the objective analysis of CBO estimators. 
   The truth is that if we are serious about protecting Social Security surpluses, the across-the-board cuts would have to be much greater. And if we look at the bills the Senate has already approved, we would need a 5.5-percent cut. And that is not my figure; that comes from the Congressional Budget Office--5.5 percent. The Transportation bill that we just processed through here--and I shared the Democratic leadership in getting that bill to the floor--would take a cut of over $2.5 billion. 
   But even that is unrealistically low. First, many Senate bills still need to be reconciled with the House, which has adopted a variety of emergency provisions--gimmickry--to allow for increased spending. In addition, Congress almost inevitably will increase spending for other items in the near future: Funding for hurricane victims--that ought to be fresh in our minds--for health care providers that are suffering from excessive cuts, preventing the expected closings of long-term care facilities in major quantities, for operations such as Kosovo; and then it is also a good bet that at some point this year there will be other emergencies: earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes--who knows what--that will also require more funding. If we do not offset that spending, it will come straight out of the Social Security surplus--cut the Social Security surplus. 
   When you account for these additional costs, you would have to cut discretionary spending roughly 10 percent under this amendment--10 percent. Do my colleagues want to go on record in supporting cutting education by at least 5 percent, more likely 10 percent? Do they want to call for cuts in defense, veterans programs, crime initiatives, and health research? I am sure the American public does not want that to happen, and none of us elected to represent them ought to support this wild scheme. 
   Senator NICKLES has offered his amendment as a second degree to his own underlying amendment. But at an appropriate point, once his second-degree amendment is disposed of, I plan to offer an alternative amendment. My amendment will call for rejecting scorekeeping gimmicks and indiscriminate across-the-board cuts. Instead, it will urge that we protect Social Security surpluses by closing special interest tax loopholes and using other appropriate offsets. 
   My alternative amendment does not limit the types of offsets that could be used, nor does it single anything out. But it would put us clearly on record in opposition to the broad-based cuts proposed by the amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, and in strong opposition to the continued use of budget gimmickry to avoid tough decisions. 
   For now, I urge my colleagues to oppose the Nickles amendment. I ask the public who may learn of this amendment to let their Representatives know they do not like it, that they want to protect Social Security surpluses. Let's not make the deep cuts that are arbitrary in education, defense, crime, veterans, and other programs. 
   Instead, let us close special interest tax loopholes, find other appropriate offsets that will allow us to save Social Security, as all of us agree should be done, in a direct and honest way.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma stresses the difference between OMB and the Congressional Budget Office. It is the typical preference to use the Congressional Budget Office. 
   I point out a letter dated October 4 sent to a senior member of our staff. It says:  
   Dividing the projected deficit by the available outlays results in an across-the-board cut of 5.5 percent.  
   This is from the Congressional Budget Office. They are the gospel, I think, when it comes to making decisions in the Budget Committee.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, obviously, I went in a slightly different direction as we introduced our second-degree amendment because I wanted the clerk to particularly read some of the implications of what it is we are facing if we adopt the Nickles amendment. 
   My amendment is a substitute for the Nickles amendment. It is very simple. It expresses the sense of the Senate that the Congress must not permit raiding Social Security surpluses nor indiscriminately cut defense, emergency relief, education, veterans' health care, law enforcement, transportation, environmental cleanup, and other discretionary appropriations across the board. Instead, we should fund fiscal year 2000 appropriations--I point out that the year began October 1--without using budgetary gimmicks by closing special interest tax loopholes and using other appropriate offsets. 
   In my view, this is a much more rational and appropriate way to approach the budget. Deep across-the-board cuts are a bad way to do business. They will prove extremely unpopular. Americans didn't send us to Washington to simply use a meat ax approach to governing. They want us to do it thoughtfully. They want us to go after waste and inefficiencies, to use our judgment and support essential programs such as education. The Nickles amendment, by contrast, puts the budget process on automatic pilot. It would cut indiscriminately. 
   I read from the text of the Nickles amendment where they say in the sense-of-the-Senate amendment that ``Congress should ensure that the fiscal year 2000 appropriations measures do not result in an on-budget deficit''--that on-budget is excluding Social Security trust funds. They put parentheses around it--``by adopting''--this is the solution they offer--``an across-the-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations sufficient to eliminate such deficit if necessary.'' 
   The language is quite clear. But to further clarify, it says cut these programs--the ones I talked about--cut veterans' health benefits, cut educational benefits, cut law enforcement, cut FBI, cut border guards even though our border is saturated by illegal immigration. And we ought to make an orderly process about that. 
   The Nickles amendment makes no distinction between critical priorities such as education, defense, and lower priorities such as corporate subsidies or pork barrel spending. 
   There is no need for a meat ax approach. The Republicans' own tax bill proposed to close various tax loopholes. Now that the bill has been vetoed, why not use some of the same loopholes to help protect Social Security, to prevent potentially painful cuts in education and other priorities? 
   Why not search for waste from other Government programs? How many of us have talked about that waste as we campaigned for office? Shouldn't we go after that before we take money away from our schools or our Armed Forces? 
   My amendment does not specify the offsets we should adopt, and it in no way endorses raising income taxes on ordinary families, but it does say we have to treat the budget candidly. 
   One of the things we should all be alerted to--the public in particular, but certainly we who are going to vote on this--it says: ``GOP Using Two Sets of Books,'' in a commentary by the Wall Street Journal of July 27:  
   Republicans are double-counting a big part of next year's surplus, papering over the fact that their proposed tax cuts and spending bills already have exhausted available funds.  
   If it were up to me, as I said earlier, I would ask the tobacco industry to compensate the taxpayers for the damage they have caused and help pay for the tobacco-related diseases that cost us some $20 billion a year. If we could get that $20 billion a year, we wouldn't have to be faced with the prospect 
   of cutting Social Security surpluses by some $19 billion. 
   Once again, my amendment doesn't endorse that particular approach, or any specific provision. It just says: Let's be honest with the American people, and let's find real offsets. 
   I will tell you what I learned from the Congressional Budget Office in a letter to one of my staff people:  
   Our estimates of the outlays available to be cut is $351.7 billion. Dividing the projected deficit by the available outlays results in an across-the-board cut of 5.5 percent.  
   Across-the-board cuts--that is all of those programs that we have discussed several times. 
   We shouldn't use gimmicks. We shouldn't use that kind of treatment, and not indiscriminate, across-the-board cuts which drastically slash funding for teachers, military personnel, veterans, and other priorities. In fact, we have an endorsement of  that view, I think it is fair to say, when Appropriations Committee chairman BILL YOUNG of Florida says to cut 2.7 percent of all discretionary spending would result in cuts of about $7 billion from defense which would wipe out the pay increase that lawmakers recently provided for the military. 
   We all know the military is having a problem recruiting new members and getting new recruits to join the various branches. Would we want to discourage that effort even though we are having a problem filling those important positions that we must have to protect ourselves? I think not. 
   Mr. President, pretty simply, I hope my colleagues will support the amendment. 
   I yield the floor. I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened to our colleague from Georgia with interest. He said we were not too specific about things. But we are specific about one thing, and that is we do not want to touch Social Security. 
   A long time ago, someone said: Touch not a hair on that old gray head. I have the color hair that evokes thoughts of Social Security, and I am eligible to be a recipient. I know how important it is, as does everybody here. I do not want to diminish everybody else's view. They all know how important it is. 
   Let's start with what is in the Nickles amendment. It says that Congress should eliminate any on-budget deficit by adopting an across-the-board reduction in all discretionary appropriations, if necessary. All discretionary appropriations --that could mean anything: Farmers' aid, Veterans Administration, FBI, drug enforcement, Coast Guard, you name it. All these programs would have to suffer deep cuts under this amendment because, according to CBO, the Senate has already approved legislation that would use $19 billion of Social Security funds. And we're likely to use even more Social Security funds when we conference with the House, which is proposing higher spending levels, and when we provide relief to hurricane victims and others suffering from genuine emergencies. Mr. President, before I go further, I see my colleague from Illinois on the floor. I yield 5 minutes to him, and then we will be able to come back to our point.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I listened very carefully. One of the things that sometimes the public does not understand is, we can disagree on things because it is an honest view of what is taking place. Perhaps our friends on the Republican side would see things one way and we on this side see them another way. But when we talk about OMB and CBO, these are rather arcane acronyms for the public at large. We work with them all the time. They are arcane for us. 
   But OMB is something that usually is thought to represent the White House view, the administration view, on calculating where we are, our budget--how much we are spending and how much we are taking in. So I guess it is easy to say that those of us who are on the same party side as the White House want to pay attention to what OMB says and those who represent the majority in the legislature--the House and the Senate--want to rely exclusively on CBO--except when it is convenient. This difference is what we are seeing now in talking about whether or not we use OMB scoring. 
   Our distinguished colleague from Oklahoma said: Well, we want to use some of the scoring the President uses, from OMB. But, Mr. President, they only want to use OMB scoring selectively--only when OMB's numbers make it appear that they are using less of the Social Security surplus. 
   In court, you are not allowed to do that. I am not a lawyer, but I know lawyers can't pick and choose from the laws of various states when they present their cases, and use only those laws most favorable to their clients. They have to live under the rules of their jurisdiction. 
   But here in the Congress, the Republican majority wants to use CBO scoring when it suits their purposes, and OMB scoring when it doesn't. 
   For example, the majority is using CBO's estimate of the non-Social Security surplus. That's because CBO is projecting a $14 billion non-Social Security surplus, whereas OMB's estimate is much lower--$6 billion. 
   But then when it comes to scoring the defense appropriations bill, all of a sudden the majority wants to use OMB numbers. 
   In other words, they are using two sets of books. 
   Mr. President, there may be rare occasions when the majority will truly believe that CBO has erred in their scoring. But that is not what is going on here. This ``directed scoring'' is not based on the merits. The Republicans are simply trying to make it appear that they are spending less than they really are. And that they are using less Social Security surpluses than they actually are. 
   I also would point out that when the Senator from Oklahoma says, well, they want to raise taxes, let me remind the Senator that when the tax bill was sent to the President, it had $5.5 billion over 10 years of tax increases. So the Republicans themselves have admitted that there are legitimate savings to be had from closing loopholes. But apparently now their position is that there is not a single loophole to be closed in the tax code. Or at least that we should not close any loopholes before we cut education and defense first. 
   I say, let's take a look at the tobacco industry. Let's try to recover some of the expenses they force us to incur. Let's see if we can't get back the $20 billion a year it costs taxpayers to 
   treat tobacco-related diseases. That by itself would essentially solve our budget problem and allow us to avoid dipping into the Social Security trust fund. 
   Mr. President, if there is any time left, I yield it back and hope our colleagues will support this sense-of-the-Senate amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator from Alabama and the Chairman of the Appropriations Committee make a good point. There is more at stake here than just aviation. Our experience over the last two years demonstrates that mandated increases in certain transportation accounts makes it extraordinarily difficult to fund other transportation accounts. While aviation investment is critical to the continued growth, development and quality of life of New Jersey and the Northeast, so is the continued improvement of Amtrak service and an adequately funded Coast Guard. Taking care of one mode of transportation with a firewall belies the reality and the importance of providing adequate investment in other modes of transportation--not to mention investment in other social programs.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I first want to thank the managers of the bill and acknowledge their hard work. The distinguished Senator from Arizona and the distinguished Senator from West Virginia have performed an extremely arduous task to get this bill to the place that it is. I don't enjoy holding the work back. I don't think I am doing that. By some quirk in the process, our amendment was not offered at an earlier time because of a procedural mixup. I thank them. I commend them for their understanding. I know they want to see this bill get into law. It is very important that we do. 
   I offer an amendment on an issue that is, unfortunately, becoming more and more of a problem for American travelers. That is the experience of reserve paid passengers being bumped from overbooked airline flights. 
   I have talked to Members, and I speak from direct personal experience where airlines said: Sorry, seats are filled--even though you have arrived on time, paid for your reservation--that is life, and we are sorry, and you can get there by going first to Boston, or Cincinnati, or what have you. 
   Our skies are more crowded than ever. People need to move quickly between different cities to do business and also to attend to a wide variety of personal functions. As this need has grown, people who fly find themselves increasingly at the mercy of the airlines. The airlines are not quite as user friendly as they used to be when they were scraping to get the revenues and the profits. They do not always treat their customers as they should. 
   They are pretty good. I give them credit. But in 1998, almost 45,000 customers--44,797, to be precise--were bumped from domestic flights on the 10 largest carriers; 45,000 people to whom word was given, well, you have lost your seat, and maybe you can get to your business appointment tomorrow; maybe you can miss the flight you were going to take to India; or maybe the funeral that was going to be held that you were going to attend can be held over for a couple of days until you get there. 
   Mr. President, it is not pleasant news when it happens. This year, the numbers have increased. For the first 6 months, 29,213 customers have been involuntarily bumped. If the trend continues, this year over 58,000 people could be involuntarily bumped--paid for, reserved, and just not able to get on the airplane. 
   People with a paid reservation have a right to expect a seat on the flight they booked. But too often they discover that having a ticket doesn't mean much when they get to the gate. 
   For the first half of the year, the number of people bumped from airlines has increased. Nothing ruins a business trip or a vacation more thoroughly than being bumped from a flight. It is sometimes impossible to make up for the lost hours and the frustration of rearranging longstanding business or personal plans. 
   The airlines ought not to be able to act as an elitist business. They have to treat their customers with respect, just as any other seller of services or products would have to do. They are the only business I know of that deliberately oversells their products. 
   Can you imagine, if you go to your doctor and you have an appointment, it is urgent that you see him, and you get bumped because someone else took your place; or you go to buy 
   furniture, you paid for it, for 3 months you want to go down and see the final product, and they say, sorry, someone else took your place. 
   The airlines have a unique position. They also are users of a commodity that belongs to the American people; that is, our airspace. They use our airports that are paid for by others. They have lots of community services that accompany this process of handling passengers. When people hold a valid ticket to a sporting event or a concert, they know when they get there they are going to have a seat. They deserve the same assurances when they try to fly. 
   Current practices don't go far enough. There are regulations, but they don't have the teeth to get the airlines to respect passengers who hold paid for and reserved tickets. The regulations are out of date. They don't provide incentives for the airlines to pay attention to this overbooking problem. The amount of compensation has not been increased for those who are bumped since the early 1980s. The dollar amounts are not enough to have any impact on the airlines and their decisions to overbook flights. 
   I do not want to see them flying with empty seats. I do not think that is a good idea. People ought not to take advantage and make two, three, and four reservations and then do not show up. But the airlines are smart enough to figure out a different way to do it. Perhaps they will have to have some kind of a deposit on a reservation that is honored as part of the cost of the ticket. If not, then it becomes a reminder to the passenger, as well as to the airline, as well as a benefit to the airline, that they lost their seat. 
   While there are regulations now, we need to make this a matter of statutory law so the airlines step up to this serious issue. The Senate needs to send a strong message to the airlines that it cannot treat our constituents as second-class citizens when they fly. We need to put strong measures into law to protect consumers, and that is what this amendment does. 
   Very simply, my amendment is not out to get the airlines. It is to make sure that people are treated fairly, and we are going to have a chance to see whether my colleagues agree with me. 
   My amendment will make the airlines act more responsibly by allowing travelers who are bumped from a flight to first choose between alternative travel plans or receiving a full refund. Every traveler who is bumped will receive cash or a travel voucher at least  equal to the amount they paid for the flight. The amount of compensation would increase based on how long the person is delayed from his or her destination. 
   If a passenger is delayed more than 2 hours, he or she would receive 200 percent of the value of his or her ticket. If a passenger cannot depart that day, then he or she would receive 300 percent of the value of the ticket, or $1,000, whichever is 
   greater. This will remind the airlines they have, after all, already sold that seat. They have already gotten the income from that seat. 
   My amendment would also require the airlines to disclose these rights to passengers in a one-page, simple-language summary. The burden should not be on the customer to read up on the latest Federal regulation or law to know their rights. 
   My goal is not to sponsor a ticket giveaway. The goal is to hold the airlines accountable when they put profits ahead of respect and service for their customers. 
   I will cut short my presentation. I ask my colleagues to recognize on what we are voting. We are voting on whether or not a passenger who gets bumped is entitled to compensation for being refused that flight or whether we are going to protect the airline's ability to continue to sell more than one person the same seat and hope they will be able to get away with it. 
   That, Mr. President, concludes my comments.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I agree with the exception of one thing that happened I am sure was inadvertent. As I understood it, the unanimous consent agreement did not call for rebuttal in any way. Since the distinguished Senator from West Virginia chose to rebut, I would like to make a couple of sentences to respond to that, and I assume there will be no objection.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, GAO has reviewed voluntary customer service plans and the GAO concluded many of the new measures that the airlines volunteered to do were already required in law or regulation. The problem is the voluntary customer service plan says nothing on the topic of involuntary bumping. Whatever there is already on the books does not do it. 
   I hope my colleagues will support this reminder to the airlines that they have to take better care of the passengers.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I rise in support of the conference report accompanying H.R. 2084, the Transportation appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. 
   I am pleased that during this, the first day of the first full week of the new fiscal year, we are sending a free-standing Transportation bill to the President for his signature. Earlier this year I would not have predicted that we would succeed in getting a free-standing Transportation bill. Credit for his successful accomplishment belongs primarily to our subcommittee chairman, Senator SHELBY. This bill has had a number of difficulties along the way--difficulties that sometimes divided Senator SHELBY and myself. But I think it is fair to say that throughout the year, both Senator SHELBY and I showed a willingness to listen, as well as a willingness to compromise. As such, many of the problems that burdened this bill earlier this year have been worked out over time. 
   Senator SHELBY consulted the Minority throughout this year's process. We may not have agreed on every figure and every policy contained in this bill, but there were never any surprises. His door was always open to me and to the other minority members of the subcommittee. I especially want to thank Senator SHELBY for his attention to the unique transportation needs of my home state of New Jersey, the most congested state in the nation. Our congestion problem makes New Jersey the most transit-dependent state in the nation and Senator SHELBY recognized this fact by working with me to provide substantial investments in projects like the Hudson-Bergen waterfront, the Newark-Elizabeth rail link, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor, the West Trenton line, and a feasibility study of a new transit tunnel under the Hudson River. 
   The Transportation Subcommittee faced a very tight allocation. These funding difficulties were made more challenging by the spending increases mandated for the Federal Highway Administration and the Federal Transit Administration under TEA-21. These mandated increases put extraordinary pressure on the non-protected programs in the Coast Guard, the Federal Aviation Administration, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. 
   The funding level provided for Amtrak represents the largest single cut in this bill below the fiscal year 1999 level. Amtrak is funded at a level fully 6 percent below last year's level. It is to Amtrak's credit, however, that Amtrak's financial turn-around has generated the kind of revenue that will allow the corporation to absorb this cut without any notable service reductions. 
   Funding for the operations budget within the Federal Aviation Administration is another area of concern. While this bill funds FAA Operations at a level fully 6 percent above last year's level, the amount provided remains 2.3 percent below the level requested by the 
    Administration. Also, funding for highway safety within the operations and research account in the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is 19 percent below the President's request. In this instance, the Administration's budget request depended upon the enactment of a new authorization bill raising the authorization ceilings for NHTSA. Unfortunately, by the time that authorization bill was enacted, our subcommittee ceiling had already been established and we did not have the funding to accommodate these funding increases for NHTSA. Mr. President, if I could identify one serious flaw with the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21), it would be the fact that several trust funded programs for highway construction are granted guaranteed increases over the next several years, while the safety programs from the trust fund are not granted similarly privileged budgetary treatment. We need to do better for these critical safety programs, both in the FAA and in NHTSA. I have not given up on the chance to do better for these programs. I intend to work with the Administration to see if additional funds can be included in an omnibus appropriations bill or, perhaps, in a Supplemental Appropriations bill. 
   In the area of truck safety, I am disappointed that this bill does not include the $50 million that I added during full committee markup for grants within the Office of Motor Carrier Safety. The tight funding allocation burdening the subcommittee just made it impossible to accommodate this item in Conference. However, I have to say that while money is important to our efforts to maintain truck and bus safety, guts and determination on the part of the Administration is of even greater importance. The Office of Motor Carrier Safety needs to be willing to shut down the most egregious safety violators to protect bus passengers and the motoring public. 
   There have been several hearings regarding the deficiencies of the Office of Motor Carriers this year. Within the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, we spent considerable time discussing the recent series of fatal bus crashes within New Jersey. The Commerce Committee also held hearings on the overall deficiencies with the OMC. Those hearings painted a very dismal picture of a largely impotent agency that is more interested in outreach than in ensuring safe truck and bus operations. More recently, we have seen indications of a new, more serious attitude at the Office of Motor Carrier Safety. This appropriations bill mandates that that office can no longer be operated within the Federal Highway Administration. Perhaps this will make a difference. In my view, the jury is still out on whether we have turned the corner on improving truck and bus safety. Over the course of the next year, we will need to review carefully whether the changes recently announced by the Office of Motor Carriers represent a true change in attitude or just a change in rhetoric. 
   In summary, Mr. President, I encourage all Members to vote in favor of this  conference report. The conference agreement is a balanced and bipartisan effort to meet the needs of our nation's transportation enterprise within a difficult funding envelope. I believe it deserves the support of all Members.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to respond to some of the things the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee just said, particularly his acknowledgment of the hard work done by the staff on both sides, the majority staff and the minority staff, and to say that I watch Senator STEVENS in action; I see how difficult it is to get some of these allocations in the shape we would like. 
   We are pleased that the Transportation bill was, if I may use the word, hammered out because there are still a lot of needs with which we have to be concerned. One is the FAA, of course, and our safety programs. I was pleased to hear the Senator mention that. 
   The other is the U.S. Coast Guard, in which Senator STEVENS has such an active interest. I share that interest. The State of New Jersey has a great deal of dependence--as well as the entire country--on the activities of the Coast Guard. And the fact is that their funding is presently on the short side. But decisions are made when resources are too spare, and, inevitably, some hard decisions have to be made. 
   I commend the chairman of the Appropriations Committee for being able to ensure that the Transportation bill was moved along. I know how hard he is working with some of the other bills that are still pending.  
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, let me begin by commending Senator SPECTER and Senator HARKIN for their hard work on this bill. Although it's far from perfect, it's a big improvement over the House version, and I know Senators SPECTER and HARKIN have worked diligently to fund critical education and health priorities within the constraints they have faced. 
   I intend to support this bill, Mr. President. But I also need to point out that it's apparently part of a broader plan that would lead to using Social Security surpluses. And I think that would be a mistake. 
   The additional money for this bill has come by shifting allocated funds from the Defense Appropriations bill. But rather than finding savings in military spending, the leadership intends to declare much of the extra spending as an emergency. 
   What we have here, Mr. President, is a shell game. The Republican plan may succeed in circumventing the discretionary spending caps, as they are trying to do. But it doesn't get around another critical problem. It still leaves us on course toward using Social Security funds to run the government. 
   Mr. President, for many months now, we've heard our Republican friends declare their commitment to protecting Social Security funds. They've put together a Social Security lock box in an effort to appear committed toward that goal--though, I must add, it's a lock box with a huge loophole, and one that does nothing for Medicare. 
   But while declaring their commitment to protecting Social Security, Mr. President, the Republicans are actually moving to spend Social Security surpluses. At their current rate, they're going to spend roughly $20 billion in Social Security surpluses. And that total could well go higher. 
   Mr. President, I know that many people around here privately believe that there's no alternative to spending Social Security surpluses, and we need that money to fund government adequately. But that's just wrong. 
   There's a better alternative. If we simply ask the tobacco industry to fully compensate taxpayers for the costs of tobacco-related diseases, we almost certainly could avoid spending Social Security surpluses. 
   Every year, Mr. President, tobacco costs taxpayers more than $20 billion. To its credit, the Justice Department is trying to recoup these costs through civil litigation. But that could take years. Meanwhile, Congress can act now to make taxpayers whole. And we should. 
   Mr. President, I've heard Republicans argue for months that pursuing more tobacco revenues is just, and the word they usually use is, ``unrealistic.'' It's a clever way to avoid responsibility. It's as if some force outside themselves  is preventing Congress from asking anything of the tobacco industry. But that's obviously wrong. 
   If the Republican leadership simply decided to ask Big Tobacco to compensate taxpayers, they could do it. It's completely realistic, if they just summon the will to do it. 
   Now, given the close relationship between the Republican Party and the tobacco industry, I realize that's not a politically easy decision for them. 
   But this is a different world than last year, when the tobacco legislation went down. 
   Now we have a Republican Congress about to embark on a money grab of Social Security funds. Compared to that, asking the tobacco industry to pay their fair share should be less difficult. 
   In any case, Mr. President, it seems clear that the real debate this fall is going to be between tobacco and Social Security. 
   And if we end up using Social Security funds to run the government, it will because the Republican Congress put Big Tobacco first, not Social Security. I think the American people would be outraged at that. And that's why I'm hopeful it won't happen. 
   So, Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, and choose Social Security over Big Tobacco. Let's end this money grab, reduce youth smoking, and protect Social Security.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill authorizing the President to grant permanent Normal Trade Relations status to Albania, overcoming the so-called Jackson-Vanik restrictions in Title IV of the Trade Act. This legislation is urgently needed so that when Albania joins the World Trade Organization later this year, the United States can enter into full WTO relations with this market-oriented country in the Balkans. 
   Mr. President, I offer this legislation and seek the support of my colleagues for three reasons: First, the Cold War-era Jackson-Vanik restrictions are no longer relevant for Albania. We should free our relations with Albania from restrictions applied to communist countries. The Jackson-Vanik restrictions applied to countries with non-market economies which limited emigration. Albania now has a market economy which some may argue needs more regulation. Albanians are now also free to emigrate, sometimes much to the chagrin of Albania's neighbors. The President certified Albania to be in compliance with the Jackson-Vanik requirements in January 1998 and has continued to report that Albania remains in compliance. The certification process is simply a relic of the Cold War. 
   Second, granting Albania permanent Normal Trade Relations, or NTR, status through the WTO will encourage and support Albania's free-trade orientation and integration into the global trading system. Little more than a decade ago, Albania was closed off from the rest of the world by a severely Stalinist regime. Today, all major political forces in Albania--including the governing Socialist Party and the opposition Democratic Party, which led the first post-Communist government--support democracy, free trade and integration with the West. A delegation from Albania's Parliament made clear the breadth and depth of support for Albania's WTO membership. Albania has enacted virtually all the necessary legislation and implementing regulations necessary to meet WTO standards and will implement the rest prior to its WTO accession. They will not even require a transition period. We should reward this tremendous positive change by welcoming Albania into the WTO and opening our markets to Albanian goods on a fair basis negotiated through the WTO. 
   Third, this bill will benefit U.S. firms by securing Albania's commitment to WTO standards and giving the United  States access to WTO dispute settlement mechanisms with regard to Albania. The annual certification requirement under existing law would require the United States to demur from entering into full WTO relations with Albania when that country becomes a member later this year. Thus, without the enactment of this legislation, we will not have access to WTO dispute settlement mechanisms and will only be able to engage in economic relations with Albania on a bilateral basis. 
   Mr. President, for the reasons I have outlined--moving beyond the Cold War, supporting development of a market economy and democracy in Albania, and providing WTO protection of market access for American businesses--I hope the Congress will enact this legislation. The United States has been a leading advocate for Albania's accession into the WTO. We should continue that support by passing this legislation. I would ask the Finance Committee and the full Senate to act expeditiously so this bill can be signed into law before Albania becomes a WTO member.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I offer today a sense-of-the-Senate amendment on an issue that, unfortunately, is becoming more of a problem for American travelers; that is, the experience of passengers with paid reservations being bumped from overbooked plane flights. 
   Our skies are more crowded than they have ever been. People need to move quickly between different cities to do business and also for a wide variety of personal reasons. As this need has grown, people who fly find themselves increasingly at the mercy of casual airline booking practices. In such cases, airlines do not treat people as they should. These are passengers with paid reservations. They have a right to expect a seat on the flight they book, but too often they discover that having a ticket does not mean much when they get to the gate. 
   Nothing ruins a business trip, a vacation, or other trip more thoroughly than being bumped from a flight. It is sometimes impossible to make up for the lost hours and the lost opportunity, let's say, to attend the funeral of a friend or relative. That opportunity is never again presented. There is the frustration of rearranging longstanding business or personal plans or rearranging the connection that one takes from a city a couple hundred miles away from a major hub, and then missing a flight to Europe or to the Far East. 
   I understand the airlines have a problem. I respect that they would like to find a solution to the problem. They should not have to fly with empty seats without an opportunity to cover their costs. Perhaps a deposit on a flight reservation, or something of that nature, ought to be done. But it sure ought not to be simply at the whim of a gate attendant to decide who is going to fly and who is not. 
   On a personal note, I had that experience. I had paid for the tickets. I had a reservation number--with two tickets. I got to the airport, and they said: The flight is full. There was about 15 minutes left before departure, and they said: Well, sorry, just too many people showed up. 
   What happened is they oversold the flight. The airlines should not be able to act as an elitist business. They should have to treat their customers with respect. They are the only legitimate business I know of that deliberately sells a product that they know they can't deliver. 
   When people attend a sporting event or a concert or the theater, they know when they get there that they are going to have the seat for which they paid. They deserve the same assurance when they fly. 
   This sense-of-the-Senate amendment should encourage the airlines to act more responsibly, by allowing travelers who are bumped from a flight to receive greater amounts of compensation for the airline's casual action. The amendment calls for the applicable penalties to be doubled from those under current regulation. 
   The goal is to hold the airlines accountable when they put profits ahead of their friendliness and respect for their customer. 
   People who travel for business or personal reasons should not miss out on an event they planned because the airlines decided to treat them like baggage and said: Well, we can't take all this baggage. 
   So I plan to continue to fight to ensure that airlines are accountable to the American public. 
   I want to acquaint my colleagues with current regulations pertaining to passengers that are bumped involuntarily. 
   Currently on the books, an airline must first request passengers with paid reservations to voluntarily give up their seats. We know that. 
   If a passenger is involuntarily bumped and delayed less than an hour, the passenger is not entitled to any compensation--if you can make the trip within an hour from the scheduled time of departure. 
   Delays between 1 and 2 hours, the passenger can receive 100 percent of the cost of the remaining ticket to the destination but not more than $200; delayed more than 2 hours, the passenger  can receive 200 percent of the cost of the remaining ticket but not more than $400. 
   Other details: Instead of cash, the airline can offer free or reduced air transportation at equal or greater value than the amount of the cash compensation. 
   So what we are doing is we are saying: A, these rules are not adequately enforced; B, the public is ignorant of what kind of redress they have if they get bumped off a flight and the airlines are not adequately informing them of what they are entitled to; and C, the airlines must act more responsibly, toward the passenger and be more concerned about what is happening with the passenger. 
   The airlines owe this to the public. They use our national resources. They use the nation's airspace. They use the FAA system. They use our taxpayer investments in airports. They are using public money all over the place. They ought to be more cognizant of what it is the flying public should have in return. 
   With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we have a sense-of-the-Senate resolution by the Senator from Louisiana. She asked for a study, which in this place is a relatively harmless gesture. But what I hear in response is that suddenly the Senate wants to be an expert on airlines. No. I don't see it that way. What I see is that we are experts on protecting the public. That is our responsibility. That is why we are sent here--to take care of the public and not to take care of the airlines ahead of the public. 
   The airlines are wonderful companies. But they are not beyond criticism. They have what amounts to a very uneven playing field. They get their slots. The facilities are paid for by the airline passengers, not the airlines. The airlines have unlimited use of our nation's airspace. They get preferential treatment. They have an air traffic control system paid for by the taxpayers in this country. 
   There is an objection that I hear to this study that is proposed by the Senator from Louisiana. 
   When we get discount tickets, that is not a freebie. It is a marketing calculation. The airlines say you can buy a discount ticket, and we are going to make it up elsewhere, and make it up elsewhere they do. No one is objecting to that. That is their marketing scheme. 
   I have some objection to the fact that in one case flying down from the New York area costs, at a government rate, $165, and if you fly out of another airport right nearby it is $38. Why? Because one airline has a stranglehold on the traffic at the costlier airport. 
   I am going to relinquish the floor momentarily. 
   I want it abundantly clear that this Senator makes no apology for defending the public first before defending the airlines. I hope the public will take note of this debate. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise not to delay the process at all but just to acknowledge the fact that we have passed a bill that took some time and an awful lot of work, I must say. I commend my colleague and my good friend from Alabama, Senator SHELBY, chairman of the subcommittee. We had some disagreements. This was not just sweetness and light; it was a good, solid debate. We called on the body to make decisions for us at times. That is the way it should be. So I thank Senator SHELBY for being so cooperative on issues and for understanding what we had to do. We went ahead and did it. 
   I also thank Senator CHAFEE and other members of the Environment and Public Works Committee for their cooperation. We had some questions that had to be answered, and it took time to thoroughly review them. 
   Also I want to say, without our respective staffs doing the work they did, this job would be a lot more complicated and would take even more time. I speak specifically about Wally Barnett, the chief of staff on the Republican side, and Peter Rogoff on our side, and the other members of the team: Joyce Rose, Paul Doerrer, Mitch Warren, Laurie Saroff, Denise Matthews, and Carol Geagley on our side, because they made it, if not easy, certainly in many cases they simplified the issues to get them down to digestible form. It did make it considerably easier. I thank them.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Oregon. 
   Mr. President, I think what the Senator from Oregon is doing this morning is offering some help for sat-upon air passengers--people who are totally discouraged by the treatment they get from our airlines. I am not saying the airlines are not a good, effective part of our communications system or that they don't care. Not at all. But they have to be a little more sensitive to what the passengers need. The passengers need to know whether or not reservations they have made are going to be honored. They have to know whether or not they are buying right. If you go into a department store, you see signs telling you how much an article costs. When you call up an airline for reservations, you never know whether you have three seats in L class, or two seats in Y class, or six seats in E class, and you don't know whether you are getting what you are getting. 
   I think there is an expression that is used commonly around here--``a right to know.'' The passengers have a right to know. They have a right to know that when they get to that airport, the seat they have reserved which they paid for is going to be available for them. 
   There is no one whom I like less to disagree with than my friend from West Virginia, the distinguished Senator from West Virginia. But the airlines may know, to use his expression, ``how wide a seat is.'' But they don't want to tell you how wide the seating spaces are in their airplanes compared to others. 
   I fly, as most here do, at least twice a week--once up and once back from my home district in my State. 
   I find that the space gets narrower and narrower. I think we ought to let people know. Give them a choice. Give them a right to know. We are not telling them the seat size. I don't want to do that. 
   I have found one thing. Sometimes if you offer enough carrots as an incentive, you wind up with carrot soup. You don't wind up with a satisfied user. That is what we are talking about. The airlines have voluntarily agreed to do some things; that is, if you can find out, and if you understand what they are talking about when they do it. 
   I see nothing wrong in the sense-of-the-Senate resolutions the Senator from Oregon is introducing. I think he is doing us all a favor, and that is highlighting what the problem is. It is not law that he is proposing. What he is suggesting is something for us to all think about as we consider legislation, or recommending rules to the FAA that the FAA ought to take up. We are focusing. 
   I must say this to the Senator from West Virginia. In my opening remarks and in the remarks of the chairman of the subcommittee, what we are talking about is the shortages that we are seeing in funding for FAA. 
   I know I heard it repeated by the distinguished Senator from Alabama. I said we are underfunding the FAA. That is because the whole transportation budget is inadequate for the things we have to do. It shouldn't be. But the system is safe. People do get there most of the time now--late. But the fact is we are concerned about funding the FAA and the overcrowding of the skies. 
   We want the air traffic control system to operate well. 
   I sit lots of times in the second seat in a small airplane. I hear what is going on. It is not always what you like to hear--that you have to wait a half hour to take off, that you 
   have to wait a half hour or divert to land because it is too crowded. We are concerned about that. 
   But also I make mention of a cause of mine--to make sure that we have high-speed rail in this country to take care of the 200-mile trip, or the 250-mile trip from New York to Washington, or Boston to New York, or Boston to Washington--relatively short trips--to relieve some of the pressure in the skies at the same time that we build the system. 
   I yield the time. I thank the Senator from Oregon.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to deliver a short statement, because I know there are other matters pending that we would like to hear fairly promptly. While on the subject of the CAFE standards, I will register my support for the position outlined by the senior Senator from California and the Senator from Washington. 
   For the last 4 years, the Senate has accepted the House's CAFE freeze rider. The result has been serious consequences for the environment, for employment and for the health of people across the country. 
   There is a myth floating around that CAFE standards hurt consumers. The truth is, good CAFE standards help consumers. It's a simple concept. If your car or SUV uses less gas, you save money. Between 1975 and 1980, when the fuel economy of cars doubled, consumers with fuel-efficient cars saved $3,000 over the lifetime of the car. And that translated into $30 billion of savings in annual consumer spending. 
   Another benefit of CAFE standards is reduced pollution. Air pollution from cars has been a major environmental problem. 
   In fact, gas-guzzling cars and light trucks are responsible for 25 percent of this country's output of emissions that cause global climate change. 
   Few can hear those words, ``climate change,'' and not be concerned about the impact of the severity of storms and poor air quality we are seeing, such as the current hurricane threat, one of massive proportions, which seems to have mitigated a little bit. The fact is, there is concern that changes in our climate, changes that are created in the atmosphere as a result of pollution, are in some way responsible. We have to take a serious look at this, as we consider the question in front of us at the moment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in deference to my friend and colleague from Virginia, I am going to decline to answer the question that he puts to frame my speech. After I deliver my message, then I will be happy to respond. Perhaps I will have covered the turnaround the Senator describes. I will wait until I get the floor before I take a question.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what we are seeing is much more a question of interpretation rather than a violation of the rule. Because the distinguished Senator from Virginia says we had agreed to a specific 10 percent, I think more accurately, in all due respect, is that we agreed to sums of money that added up to approximately 10 percent of the total funding. The programs that were detailed in the list that was going to be supported have grown, by the way. They have grown as the appropriations have grown for highway funding. 
   The one thing to which I want to return, and I am sorry our colleague from Alabama is not here because I want him to know I agree fully with what he has said thus far and the proposition that we are considering, and that is extra moneys that are found in the surplus go directly to the States to finance their programs as they see them. 
   It is funny because so often we have a debate about States rights and Big Brother Government and that kind of thing. But here we are, some of us find ourselves on opposite sides of the debate. The fact of the matter is that each State--and I want my colleagues to know this--is going to get more money. They are going to decide where the highway needs are in their States. They are going to decide what is critical, and they are going to decide it in a year in which the whole country is burdened with congestion. Those States will have those moneys to use for highway construction or as they see fit under their programs. 
   The fact we agreed to a series of programs at the time TEA 21 was developed, and though there was a lot of hard work--and I respect the work the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from Montana did on TEA 21--I disagreed with them. They knew it. I voted finally for the bill because they had some compromises thrown in. My State went from one level of funding in the formula to a lower level, when my State sends more money to this Federal Government than any State in the  country. They said: Frank, agree with us because we will take care of you in this program or that program to try to get a compromise. 
   Believe me, if I had the 50 other votes, I would not have agreed, but I did not have them. So I went along. It was not a happy day. It wasn't a happy day for New Jersey or this Senator who serves, by the way, on both the EPW Committee as well as the Appropriations Committee. 
   What we are seeing is a nuclear explosion in the middle of a chance to dynamite a new hole for a new road. I understand how jurisdictions want to be preserved, and I support that. But the fact is, I agree with the chairman of the subcommittee that this is our interpretation of how that money, how that surplus should be spent. 
   I point out to our colleagues who may be listening who are going to vote on this, every one of your States get more money directly for the programs on what your transportation commissioners, your Governors want to spend money. I do not know that we have heard from any Governors who have called up and said: Listen, don't give us that extra money, put it into those Federal programs. I do not think that message goes particularly well out there. 
   The message that does go well out there is your States get more money. All of the programs that were detailed in TEA 21 are fully financed as outlined in the original TEA 21 
   legislation, and each one of them has gotten more money as a result of the expanded funding available. So we are not cheating anybody. What we are saying is that as we see it, these funds should be distributed directly to the States, simplify it rather than winding up with I do not know how small the smallest change would be on the list of programs, but it would get down to relatively tiny sums of money. We give it to the States. It is done clearly and everybody understands it. 
   My friend from Virginia--this is my closing remark--talked about the ITS program that I worked so hard on, intelligent vehicles. Notice I never said intelligent drivers. Intelligent vehicles was a program I worked very hard to get. 
   New Jersey, I am told, gets $5 million, I say to the Senator from Virginia, out of that $211 million that we are devoting to intelligent transportation systems. New Jersey, though it deserves far more, only has a very small percentage of that. It was not New Jersey based. That was a program I felt strongly about for my country and for the benefit of those who drive across the highways and the byways of this great Nation, including reducing congestion wherever we can and expediting traffic flow. That is what that was. That was not a ``New Jersey special,'' I can assure the Senator. 
   I hope when all is said and done, and very often more is said than is done, we will have our colleagues' support and carry this bill. Let's get done with it. Yes, the debate was worthwhile having because our colleagues wanted it and we respect our colleagues, the Senator from Rhode Island, the Senator from Virginia, the Senator from Montana, but we differ with them. We have a job of getting this bill out and into the hands of those who are going to be using it for their construction needs in the next year, and we ought to move along with it as quickly as we can.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I thank my colleague and friend, Senator SHELBY, for having managed a very difficult problem with, frankly, less money than the amount we think transportation in this country deserves. We are entering a new century. It is hoped that we are going to be able to continue the prosperous and vigorous economy we now see. I think if there is one place where our funding allocations are deficient--and I believe they are deficient in many--transportation heads the list. It is necessary to have the kind of infrastructure that will propel us into continuing leadership in the 21st century, starting with transportation. 
   We see crowding in every mode of transportation--aviation; the skies are jammed. The highways are congested. They are spewing contaminated air all over the place, and our transit systems are operating well above capacity. So I approach this bill with less than total satisfaction because we, frankly, could have used more funds. I will discuss those for a minute. 
   I have served on the Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee for more than 14 years. As they say, time flies when you are having fun. I chaired the subcommittee for 8 years, and I have also had the pleasure of serving under other subcommittee chairmen including Mark Andrews, Mark Hatfield, who was a dear friend and inspired leader, and, most recently, RICHARD SHELBY. 
   Senator SHELBY, as his predecessors, has been attentive to the issues. He has consulted carefully with the minority members of the subcommittee. When it comes to funding levels included in this bill, Senator SHELBY has done the best he could, given the very limited resources allocated to this subcommittee. And though I wish we had more money, I am supporting this bill,  even with the limitations placed upon us, because of the efforts by Senator SHELBY. 
   When you consider the fact that this appropriations bill is going to usher in our national transportation agenda in the next century, it is clear that we are still not making the kind of investments we have to make to ensure continued leadership, economically and functionally, in the next millennium. 
   That is not the fault of the chairman. Rather, it is the fault of our overall budgeting process--and I say that both as the ranking member of this subcommittee and the ranking member of the Budget Committee. 
   The bill before us is almost $700 million below the level requested by the President in his budget. 
   The President's proposed transportation budget for fiscal year 2000, for the first time, exceeds $50 billion. This bill, however, is funded at less than $49.5 billion. 
   While the dollar amount in this bill does exceed the total provided for in fiscal year 1999, the growth is to be found in the highway and transit programs that enjoy firewalled funding under TEA-21. 
   The funding provided in this bill for other modal transportation which do not benefit from funding guarantees is severe. Funding for the Coast Guard is well below the President's request. Fortunately, we were able to include funding for the Coast Guard in the Kosovo supplemental appropriations bill. These funds will remain available and enable the Coast Guard to better meet its needs next year. 
   Funding for the Federal Aviation Administration is more than 6.5 percent below the President's request. 
   Funding for Amtrak: We are now approaching a time when Amtrak is about to step in, hopefully, to the 21st century, but it is at least starting to catch up in the 20th century even as we leave it. High-speed rail is around the corner--delayed, unfortunately, a little bit more than we expected it to be. But it is on its way. It is going to make an enormous difference. By way of example, if we didn't have the investment in Amtrak's Northeast Corridor to keep it going, we would need, as a substitute, 10,000 flights every year--10,000 new flights between the Boston area and the Washington area, including New York. That would be something beyond comprehension in terms of the crowded skies--200 new flights a week. 
   Funding for the critical highway safety functions, or the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is cut by more than $50 million, or 15 percent below the level requested by the administration. A large part of the problem is that, when we marked up appropriations bill in May, we were capped by the low authorization levels in TEA-21. Since that markup, the House and the Senate passed, and the President signed, a sizable increase in these authorization levels for highway safety. But now that the authorization levels have been increased, there is no funding in the subcommittee's allocation to fund even part of them. 
   These are difficult funding cuts. But despite these cuts, I support this bill. Frankly, I am putting some hope in the fact that the bill as passed by the House of Representatives had an allocation that was more than $0.5 billion larger than the allocation granted to the Senate Transportation Subcommittee. 
   As we approach conference on this bill, I expect to work closely with Chairman SHELBY and the chairman of the Appropriations Committee with the goal of bringing back a transportation conference report that better meets the needs of the FAA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the Coast Guard, and the other critical functions of the Department of Transportation. 
   Mr. President, I emphasize once more that the reason this bill is so tight is not because Chairman SHELBY doesn't want to fund the necessary parts of the transportation bill's requirements but, rather, we are caught by the funding caps that have controlled the Appropriations process. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I commend our colleague for this amendment and for the substance of the amendment. 
   There has been constant pressure on the airlines to provide seats and make accommodations available. For those who think they are going on a journey--some emergencies, some recreational, some for routine work--it matters not. The fact of the matter is, when someone makes a reservation on an airplane, they ought to know whether or not there is a pretty good chance they will arrive at their chosen destination. We know there is not a way to positively predict this. However, the passengers who have paid for their tickets should have a pretty good chance of arriving when the flight is scheduled to arrive. 
   I think this is positive amendment. It is pretty simple. The Senator from Oregon deals with the problem of airlines continuing to sell tickets on oversold flights and refusing to divulge that fact to their customers. 
   I consider myself a friend of aviation. I have worked very hard with the FAA and the airlines to make sure we offer reliable and safe service. With all of the crowding, our system is still remarkably safe. It handles far more flights than we ever expected. Are we up to date in everything we can do? I say absolutely not; the requirements far exceed the capacity. 
   The least we ought to do is tell passengers if there is a reasonable chance that they will get to their destination. The person who travels from Cincinnati to New York, perhaps to catch a flight overseas, arrives with their baggage. They have a 2-hour connection or an hour-and-a-half at Kennedy or Newark Airport on their way to Rome. The only problem is, they arrive 3 or 4 hours later because they were bumped off the flight and they miss their flight to Rome. 
   I had an experience a couple of weeks ago. This is probably a good story for democracy. I got to the airport, and they said the flight was sold out. I had made a reservation, given a credit card number. I arrived at the airport, and they said the airplane was filled. I got there 15, 20 minutes before flight time. I said: What do you mean, it is filled? They said: Yes, that seat is sold. I said: The seat was sold twice, and the first one who got there got it. 
   No one told me the rules, that a passenger had to beat the other guy to the starting line to guarantee the seat for which they paid. 
   Needless to say, I was a little annoyed. I didn't jump over the counter and threaten anybody, but it was not a pleasant experience. Instead of taking one direct flight back home, I had to take two--first flying north before I could fly south. All I could get was, ``Sorry, we sold the seat.'' It is an unpleasant experience. 
   When they took the reservation which I made personally and gave my credit card number, they said fine and gave me a confirmation number. When I got to the gate to get on this airplane, the clerk behind the desk said: This airplane has been sold out. But they took my money anyway. 
   The Senator from Oregon is standing behind the passenger who is not getting a lot of attention these days. The airlines handle a lot more traffic than they expected. They are also making a lot more money and I'm glad that they are. But they must also provide the service in a manner that is respectful of their passengers. 
   What the Senator from Oregon is asking for is simple: If you are going to sell a ticket to him, to me, to anybody, please tell them if the flight is oversold. Then passengers can plan for it or figure out a backup instead of being innocently led to a blind wall where they can't go farther. 
   So I support this amendment. I support it enthusiastically. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his contribution in the form of these amendments. We work together on the Budget Committee, and on other matters. He is always thoughtful on the matters he brings to the Senate. 
   Before the Senator from West Virginia leaves the room, I want to say to him that one of the things he talked about, sort of indirectly, in terms of getting the FAA up to the point that it should be in order to take care of the volume of traffic we have--we must make air travel more user friendly. You do that by providing an infrastructure that can accommodate the volume of traffic we have. I commend the Senator from West Virginia. He works very hard on matters of aviation. We are grateful to him for his contribution. 
   I would like to say this. One of the things that kind of pervades the discussion that has gone on here for the last while by the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from West Virginia is that there has to be a change in attitude, in my view. 
   The airlines have to understand that they have a precious commodity when they have license to offer the services that they do. They are not unlike the doctor who provides excellent service who uses the hospital operating room for his or her work. 
   We provide airspace--limited airspace. We provide huge investment in technology to have a system operate better. We provide airports. We provide facilities. And all of this is not designed to punish. My conversation is not designed to punish the airlines but to make sure it is remembered that they are serving the public, with the permission of the Government indirectly, by providing the kinds of facilities that can accommodate the number of flights and the routes that are being used. It is user friendly. 
   I recently proposed something in New Jersey that has some people in government a little nervous. I suggested that when someone has to wait to pay a toll and it gets beyond a certain point, the drivers be permitted to go through free. I call it a deadline, Don't Encumber Drivers--DED--because otherwise those toll road authorities just collect their money. It just takes them a little while longer. But the one who pays and gets less service is the driver. You sit there in all of that smog, fog, and congestion. You miss your appointment, you don't get to work, you don't get to school, you don't get to the doctor, and shopping is not done on time. 
   Why is it that the user is the one always pays the price? 
   You go into a well operated supermarket, and they open more lanes so you can pay your bills faster because they know you don't want to stand around there to have to give them your money. So it is also, I think, with the airlines. 
   I don't want to see them punished. This isn't designed to be punitive. What we are suggesting here is designed to make it fairer for the traveling passenger. Rather than bumping people, there ought to be other ways to deal with it, so that if someone is bumped, the airline also feels the pressure--not just the passenger if the airline chose to oversell the seats. 
   I don't want to see the airlines flying with empty seats. That is not a mission at all. Maybe they have to come up with a different scheme. Maybe there has to be a deposit when you make an airline reservation. I have talked to lots of people who would make two or three reservations on airplanes on different flights so they could do it at their convenience, which means that someone else could not fly because they have blocked these seats. Maybe there has to be a deposit when the reservation is made to be used either for a trip or as a cost for doing business. 
   If you want to have furniture delivered to your house, you can't get it delivered without suffering some kind of a penalty if they deliver it and nobody is home and they have to turn around and take it back, or if you want to cancel midstream. Try buying a car without a deposit. They will tell you no. You can't have your wash done without having a laundry ticket. 
   In any event, I yield the floor. 
   I note the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill that I am offering with my colleague from Alaska, Mr. MURKOWSKI. 
   I would like to thank our broad range of bipartisan cosponsors: Senators BOXER, CHAFEE, DODD, ROTH, SESSIONS, FEINGOLD, KERRY of Massachusetts, LEAHY, LANDRIEU, LINCOLN, FRIST, GRAHAM, COLLINS, SMITH of New Hampshire, GREGG, MOYNIHAN, WARNER, BAYH, MCCAIN, AKAKA, FEINSTEIN, JEFFORDS, and HAGEL. 
   Mr. President, this amendment would restore funds to a program that has helped protect open space in every State in the Nation through the State grants section of the Land and Water Conservation Fund. This amendment restores $20 million in fiscal year 2000 for these matching grants to States. 
   This ``Stateside'' program can be used to fund a variety of public open space efforts, including State and county parks, State forests, boating and swimming areas, and a variety of other recreational sites. 
   Mr. President, the House of Representatives saw fit to include the program at $30 million in its Interior Appropriations bill.  
   We hope to come to their level in conference after our initial funding at $20 million. 
   Over the past 30 years, through the stateside program, over $3 billion has been provided to the States, and through them, to local governments, on a matching basis, to preserve approximately 37,000 park and recreation areas. 
   Mr. President, the decision to fund open space programs through the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of the wisest investments we can make. Open spaces are more than just undeveloped land. We all know that protecting open spaces can guard sensitive drinking water supplies and preserve wildlife habitat. 
   Open spaces are also a lasting legacy we pass on to our children and grandchildren. 
   But there is another equally important benefit of open spaces. 
   In my State of New Jersey--the most densely populated State in the Nation--open spaces provide working families of limited means a place to enjoy the outdoors at little or no cost. A day at the beach or a picnic in the park or a hike in the woods is a day well spent. 
   Mr. President, open space is extremely valuable in my State. In a poll last year by Quinnipiac College published in the Newark Star-Ledger, 70 percent of New Jersey residents said that preserving open space and farmland is more important than commercial growth and development in rural areas. 
   Mr. President, it is extremely gratifying when members of both parties can join together in support of a program that has provided untold benefits for millions of Americans. I want to thank Senator MURKOWSKI and my other colleagues who support this amendment. I ask all of my colleagues to join us to preserve open space for America's families.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination of Maryanne Trump Barry to the United States Court of Appeals of the Third Circuit. 
   I commend Senator HATCH for moving forward with this nomination. We must ensure that the federal bench is at full strength so that our citizens will receive justice promptly and fairly. The distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee deserves thanks from all who believe that our court system is at the core of our precious democratic structure.  
   Judge Barry's reputation is well known and she has excellent credentials. In 1983, she was nominated to a federal district court judgeship by President Reagan, and since being confirmed for that post she has compiled an impressive record and become a nationally recognized expert on a wide range of criminal and civil law matters. 
   Her knowledge of criminal law led Chief Justice Rehnquist to appoint her to chair the Committee on Criminal Law of the Judicial Conference of the United States, a position she held from 1993-1996. Additionally, the Federal Judicial Center asked her to make an instructional videotape called ``How to Try a Complex Criminal Case'' and that tape is played for all new district court judges at their orientation seminar. 
   In the area of civil law, Judge Barry has issued many important rulings including a decision that Blue Cross was required to pay for a bone marrow transplant for a terminally ill young girl who would have died without the procedure. 
   New Jersey residents are particularly proud of her decision holding New York City responsible and in contempt for failing to obey a court order designed to prevent garbage and medical waste from New York's Fresh Kills Landfill from drifting onto New Jersey's shore. Not only do her judicial colleagues hold her in high regard, Judge Barry is also well-respected by the many attorneys who have appeared before her. They praise her command of the law, her professional demeanor, and her razor-sharp wit. 
   As a result of her tenure in the U.S. attorney's office, her 16 years of outstanding service at the district court level, and her legal expertise, Judge Barry is well-prepared for elevation to the circuit court. In fact, she has already sat on the Court of Appeals--by designation--and has written several opinions. 
   Mr. President, I highly recommend Judge Barry for elevation to the third circuit. As some of my colleagues may know, the third circuit is currently facing a judicial emergency, and the appointment of Judge Barry will help. 
   To further address this crisis, I hope that the Judiciary Committee will soon take up the nomination of another excellent candidate for the third circuit, Judge Julio Fuentes. I would also be remiss if I did not point out that the elevation of Judge Barry will create another vacancy on the District Court of New Jersey, and so it would be essential that the committee move forward with the nomination of Faith Hochberg to that court.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENCI, in bidding farewell to Dr. Paul N. Van de Water--a longstanding and highly respected member of the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) staff. Dr. Van de Water is leaving CBO at the end of this week after more than 18 years of service to the Congress. Paul will join the Social Security Administration as the Senior Advisor to the Deputy Commissioner for Policy. 
   Dr. Van de Water's departure from CBO represents an enormous loss for the Congress. His ability to generate objective, timely, and unbiased analyses exemplifies the finest tradition of nonpartisan public service. Paul's work at CBO represents the essence of the agency's mission. He managed--during some very difficult years--to serve both political parties in a fair and effective manner. He leaves CBO with his reputation for impartial analysis intact and his integrity unquestioned and unblemished. 
   During his tenure at CBO, Dr. Van de Water earned a reputation for building a first rate staff and for ensuring that CBO's work was analytically sound, unbiased, and clearly presented. During the dark decades of runaway budget deficits, Paul worked tirelessly with Members and staff on every major budget summit, budget plan, and budget process reform initiative. Like most public servants he rarely received the formal recognition and thanks he deserved. I hope in some small measure to communicate our thanks and appreciation for these contributions today. 
   Dr. Van de Water began his career at CBO in 1981 as Chief of the Projections Unit. From there, he moved on to Deputy Assistant Director for Budget Analysis and, in 1994, assumed his current position as Assistant Director for Budget Analysis. He is the author, coauthor, or editor of more than 50 articles and books on government finance and Social Security and has testified before Congressional committees on numerous occasions. 
   Dr. Van de Water's accomplishments beyond CBO include a Ph.D. in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and two daughters--the first a senior majoring in physics at the College of William and Mary (and former Valedictorian of T.C. Williams High School in Alexandria) and the second, an enthusiastic 7th grader. Clearly, Paul has managed to keep his work and home priorities straight during his tenure at CBO. 
   Paul's first hand knowledge of the Congressional budget process as well as the operations and traditions of CBO cannot be replaced. However, we take some solace from the fact that his contributions to public policy will continue. In his new role with the Administration, I am certain that his work will inform and shape the debate on the future of the Social Security program. I know that all of my colleagues join with me in wishing Paul the best of luck in his new endeavor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I obviously oppose this Republican tax bill. I am going to explain why in a minute. 
   But I would like to start off by using an expression that we heard kind of invented around here, and that is: There they go again. There they go again. Or: There you go again. 
   The party that claims that its mission is fiscal responsibility has, once again, resorted to tax cuts to establish its role in fiscal management. 
   I find it shocking. I must tell you that we suddenly wanted to distribute a tax cut, which everybody likes to do. Make no mistake about it. I heard the President this morning say: After we finish securing Social Security and securing some extra longevity for Medicare, then we ought to distribute some tax cuts to people. 
   But if you ask anybody who has a mortgage--and most people I know have one--whether they would like to get rid of the mortgage before they do anything else, if they had a choice, they would take the mortgage relief. I will tell you that. They would say: Look, that is the one thing that bedevils us, and especially if the mortgage lives on beyond their existence on Earth, and it passes on to their children and their grandchildren. They would say: Look, let's get rid of that mortgage. 
   That is what we are talking about. We are all mortgagees in common when it comes to the national debt. We owe it. My kids owe it. My grandchildren will owe it if we don't get rid of that debt. 
   What is proposed by the Democrats is that we pay down the debt, that we have a target of 15 years to get rid of all the 
   public debt. It would be unheard of in contemporary terms, and maybe in historical terms as well, because I don't think there is any country in the world that has any advancement that would find itself without significant debt outside the government. But that is what is being proposed. 
   Here we are. We want to give a tax break. And it works like this: The top 1 percent of wage earners who average $800,000-plus a year would get a $45,000 tax cut--just under $46,000. The person who works hard and struggles to keep their family intact, who struggles to keep opportunity available for their children's education and training and earns $38,000 a year, is going to get about 40 cents a day in tax relief. This fellow who earns over $800,000 is going to get a $45,000 tax break. 
   I have heard my colleagues on the other side say, well, they pay most of it; why shouldn't they get most of it? Why? Because what difference does it make in the life of someone earning $800,000 and some a year whether they get a $45,000 tax cut? I am not saying they shouldn't get anything, but it sure doesn't compare with the impact that it has when you take $157 and you give it to someone earning $38,000. It doesn't do much for them at all. 
   It permits this guy to buy a new boat, maybe even to make a downpayment on a second home. But to the other people who are struggling, often two-wage earners in the family, struggling to manage the future, it is impossible if you make $38,000 a year and you have a couple of kids. 
   The Republican plan is now stripped down to its bare essentials. It says to raid Social Security if we must to give this tax cut, and don't pay any attention to Medicare, while people all over this country worry about their health care. Over 40 million of them have no health insurance at all. We are talking about Medicare and the sensitivity of appropriate health care for people who are in their advanced years. 
   Our Republican friends are saying: Don't worry about Medicare. Maybe we will find a way to take care of it one day. Or Social Security: Well, if it expires--I guess that is what they are saying--we will have to deal with it.  
   Just think. With all of this robust economy and the surpluses that we have, the Republican tax plan says this: That in a mere 6 years we will be dipping into the Social Security surplus--6 years. With all the promises about the $2 trillion that is going to go into Social Security because it is earned there, it will start to be decimated within 6 years under the Republican tax plan. 
   I hope the message that goes out of here is that we are two different philosophies on how we ought to treat our treasure trough because we have been smart but we also have been lucky. We are lucky that we live in a country that is as rich in resources and talent and opportunity as is America. But, at the same time, it took a lot of work to plan for this. It took President Clinton's leadership when he arrived in office. Deficits were $290 billion a year--much of that attributed to the leadership of President Reagan who made a decision, in all due respect, that tax cuts were the most important thing in the world and cut taxes all over the place while he borrowed from the public to finance it. What was the result? Inflation out of sight, and a lot of joblessness as well. We don't want to do that again. 
   We should have learned. We are smart enough to have learned it the first time we saw it. 
   What will happen now? Beginning 6 years hence in 2005, Social Security starts to decline at a time when a lot of baby boomers arrive at retirement age. It could force inflation upon us and cost more for borrowing. Whether for a house mortgage, an automobile, appliance, people would be paying more. 
   One of the most astounding things I find, all Members hover around Alan Greenspan because he has been so clever in the way he has managed his share of the economic policy in this country. We listen to every word. I know him well. He used to be on the board of my company when I was chairman of the company. We would listen carefully to his advice because it was so profound, so deep, so insightful. The Republican message is, ignore what Alan Greenspan says about the timing not being right; forget that he has warned Members in the Budget Committee--and I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee--that tax cuts are not the best way to go. He said rather than having an outright spending binge, maybe tax cuts, the best thing to do is pay down the debt. 
   The message rings loud and clear. I am shocked that the wise heads who exist on the other side of this aisle don't understand that the risk they are taking is our economy at large. When we look at the projections and we hear what the Republicans are using to finance this tax cut--almost $800 billion direct in higher costs as a result of the interest on the remaining debt--it just doesn't make economic sense. It is not fair to our citizens to see the guys at the top, the people at the top who make all the money, get these incredible bonuses in tax cuts while the person who struggles to keep food on the table and a roof over their head gets a measly 40 cents a day in their tax cut. 
   What will happen? What will happen is, tax cuts will come along if things go as they are, unless the President has the courage to step up and say, no, the American people don't want this; that is not their preference. Everybody wants to pay less in tax, but they want a stable society, a stable economy. They don't want their kids saddled with obligations in the future. 
   This tax cut will also mean we will cut deeply into programs. We will cut education by 40 percent. Will we cut veterans' programs? The veterans now are screaming in pain because they are not being taken care of as they should be or as we promised they would be when they were recruited. 
   Cut the FBI by 40 percent? Thank goodness we have trained FBI people. It is hard enough to recruit. Now we are talking of cutting 40 percent while we still have a significant crime problem in our country, despite prosperity? I don't think so. 
   Will they cut border guards? Are we going to try to hold back the tide of illegal immigration, with fewer people to do it? That is what the result will be. 
   The truth of the matter is, they are talking about a surplus that is largely imaginary. It is forecasting; it is anticipated; it is hoped for. That, enacted into legislation, will make an enormous difference. Once the tax cut plan is in place, that is mandatory. However, the surpluses are hoped for, anticipated. 
   We have to alert the public what is going on. It will be a tax cut that will be talked about as a Republican accomplishment. I make a prediction--and I wish we could look inside everybody's thinking--that the Republicans know very 
   well that this tax cut cannot go through, but what they want to do is have a speaking platform. They want politics, not policy. They want everybody to believe they are the only ones who are thinking about the average working person. The fact is, they are thinking about themselves because they know the President is committed to veto this. They know the economy could not stand this kind of a cut. 
   Imagine cutting those programs and saying to the American people: We have to take 40 percent from various programs, and we will not do a thing to extend the solvency of Social Security, not do a thing about Medicare; when it dries up, it dries up, friends, in 2015. If you are at an age when Medicare will be important to you, don't count on it. You had better save your money because you will have to take care of yourself on that score. 
   In Medicare, the cuts would exceed $10 billion a year. Medicare cuts are squeezing many hospitals and other health care providers. 
   In sum, the game is over. We will be voting at a later time today. We have the disadvantage of being in the minority. It is not my preferred position, but the facts are there. The President is our last hope because the Republicans have decided that no matter what, they are going to give a tax break. No matter what the advice is, no matter what the inequity is, no matter what programs are cut, no matter what we do to veterans' care, no matter what we do to Head Start, no matter what we do to education generally, it doesn't matter. 
   They say a tax cut is the most important thing on our agenda. The numbers are there, and the votes are there. We will lose this one. I believe it is possible some of our Republican friends will see the light and say, this is no time to do a roughly $800 billion tax cut, but it is time to continue to pay down our debt, improve our financial condition, and help preserve Medicare and Social Security for future generations. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to save lives on our highways the Motor Carrier Safety Act of 1999. 
   Every year over 5000 people die due to truck and bus accidents. Since 1992, violent truck crash fatalities have increased more than 18 percent. Large trucks are only three percent of the total national vehicle fleet--but 22 percent of all passenger vehicle deaths in multiple-vehicle crashes involve trucks. 
   Whether we share the road with a truck or ride on an interstate bus, Americans need to be sure their nation's roads are safe. 
   Last December in New Jersey, three intercity buses crashed in five days. That accident rate is unacceptable. We can and must prevent these accidents with stronger oversight of commercial drivers' licenses and the carriers that operate both bus and truck companies. 
   Mr. President, my legislation addresses our commercial vehicle death epidemic with a multi-faceted approach to combating this problem. 
   First, my legislation institutes a strong Commercial Driver's License (CDL) program. All convictions for moving violations, whether in a commercial vehicle or not, are put on the truck or bus drivers' record. A new applicant must have a alcohol and drug free driving record for 3 years before receiving a CDL. All new drivers would be required to have in-vehicle training. It would authorize up to a 5 percent transfer of state's Federal highway funds to motor carrier safety programs if a state does not institute the new CDL program. 
   Second, the legislation focuses on the carriers. All new carriers are required to have training on the Federal Motor Carrier Safety regulations before they receive authority to operate. To close unsafe carriers, they are required to submit information to target high-risk operations and the definition of a hazardous carrier is strengthened. 
   Third, the installation of on-board recorders or other technologies to manage drivers' hours-of-service will be required. 
   Fourth, the legislation supports improve data collection and research for safety issues including vehicle safety and driver performance, (2) improved crash data, and (3) driver compensation and safety. 
   Fifth, the legislation funds grassroots safety campaigns to raise public awareness of the importance of motor carrier safety and discourage drivers from taking safety risks. 
   Finally, the legislation has both incentives for the states to implement motor carrier safety improvements and rewards to the states who improve motor carrier safety fatalities by five percent of the previous year. 
   Mr. President, we must do more to prevent unnecessary deaths caused by the lack of oversight of commercial vehicles. 
   With this legislation, citizens will feel more secure about driving on our roads and highways. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that the Senate has passed legislation that will provide permanent residency in the United States for 15-year-old Vova Malofienko and his family. 
   In order to understand the importance of this legislation, you need to know more about Vova. He was born in Chernigov, Ukraine, just 30 miles from the Chornobyl nuclear reactor. In 1986, when he was just two, the reactor exploded and he was exposed to high levels of radiation. He was diagnosed with lleukemia in June 1990, shortly before his sixth birthday. 
   Through the efforts of the Children of Chornobyl Relief Fund, Vova and his mother came to the United States with seven other children to attend Paul Newman's ``Hole in the Wall'' camp in Connecticut. While in this country, Vova was able to receive extensive cancer treatment and chemotherapy. In November of 1992, his cancer went into remission. 
   Regrettably, the other children from Chornobyl were not as fortunate. They returned to the Ukraine and they died one by one because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not a child survived. 
   The air, food, and water in the Ukraine are still contaminated with radiation and are perilous to those like Vova who have a weakened immune system. Additionally, cancer treatment available in the Ukraine is not as sophisticated as treatment available in the United States. Although Vova completed his chemotherapy in 1992, he continues to need medical follow-up on a consistent basis, including physical examinations, lab work and radiological examinations to assure early detection and prompt and appropriate therapy in the unfortunate event the leukemia recurs. 
   Because of his perilous medical condition, Vova and his family have done everything possible to remain in the United States. I tried to help by supporting their visa applications to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and by sponsoring this legislation. The passage of this measure is the culmination of many years of hard work by Vova, his family, and members of the Millburn community. 
   Throughout all of these struggles, Vova has been an inspiration to all. An honors student at Milburn Middle School, he has been an eloquent spokesperson for children with cancer. He has rallied the community and helped bring out the best in everyone. His dedication, grace, and dignity provide an outstanding example, not just to young people, but to all Americans. 
   I am pleased to have been able to help Vova and his family. I want to thank the House sponsors of this legislation, Representatives ROTHMAN and FRANKS, for their efforts in support of this legislation. I also want to thank Senators ABRAHAM, HATCH, LEAHY, and KENNEDY for moving this bill through the legislative process. It has been an honor to work on Vova's behalf, and I hope that he and his family enjoy great success and much happiness in the years ahead.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise as a proud cosponsor of legislation the Senator from California, Senator BOXER, is introducing today, the ``International Tuberculosis Act of 1999.'' This bill seeks to control the growing international problem of tuberculosis. 
   Mr. President, we cannot stand idly by while tuberculosis kills more people worldwide than AIDS and malaria combined, and yet still receives substantially less attention and aid dollars. 
   Although the introduction of antibiotics in the 1950's led to the near eradication of tuberculosis, it still plagues many nations throughout the world. In 1993 the World Health Organization declared tuberculosis to be a public health emergency, with an estimated 1,700 million people, or nearly one third of the world's population, infected with the tubercle bacillus. The World Health Organization estimates that eight million people get TB every year, and an estimated 3 million die from the disease annually. 
   Mr. President, the registered number of new cases of TB worldwide roughly correlates with economic conditions: the highest incidences are seen in those countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America with the lowest gross national products. We must now face the realization that without much needed aid, most of the countries with a high burden of TB will not be able to reach the targets for TB control established by the World Health Assembly for the year 2000. In human terms, this means that each year millions of lives could be lost due to a preventable and curable disease. 
   Thankfully, Mr. President, efforts to combat this terrible disease have been largely successful inside U.S. borders. In my own State of New Jersey, the number of people with active tuberculosis has declined each year for the past six years. But the problem still persists. Each year over 25,000 people in the United States contract TB. The treat of infection here in America still looms large for anyone who travels abroad or comes into contact with those who have recently traveled outside the United States. This disease does not discriminate: People of all ages, all nationalities and all incomes can get tuberculosis. 
   An airborne disease that can be spread through a simple cough, TB can be carried around the world in a matter of hours on a transcontinental flight. Nearly 40 percent of TB cases in the U.S. are attributable to foreign-born persons. Until TB is eradicated worldwide, no person--no American--will ever be safe from its affliction. 
   Only small steps have been taken to eradicate TB outside the United States. Medical experts estimate that over $1 billion is necessary to control TB. This money will allow scientists and doctors to take the necessary steps to wipe out this disease, much like the world community has already done with malaria and small pox. The longer we wait, the larger the TB population will be. This translates into higher costs to eradicate this debilitating disease. International organizations note that for every dollar spent on prevention, a nation saves between three and four dollars in treatment. 
   Mr. President, TB control efforts have received approximately $12 million a year for the last two fiscal years under USAID's Infectious Disease Initiative to create a TB Global Action Plan. However, this is not enough; an increase in funding is critical if tuberculosis is to be vanquished. The U.S. must do its part. 
   An increase in funding to $60 million for TB would help expedite global action, and give aid officials the necessary resources to develop and implement country specific plans for control programs for nations with a high prevalence of TB. Once a plan is implemented, it is necessary to formulate a systematic program to avoid increases of drug resistant strains of TB. 
   A plan, coordinated with the World Health Organization, the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health and other organizations, will expand and provide a framework for enhanced direction and coordination of worldwide tuberculosis research activities, translate research results into efficient and effective TB control practices which are applicable to all environments, and engage society and government control programs more quickly and widely. 
   The American Lung Association, American Thoracic Society and International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and other renowed organizations support an increase in funding for TB prevention. 
   Mr. President, a global TB prevention effort makes sense. The benefits outweigh the costs. Given the importance of a global plan to eradicate TB, and its potential in saving lives, I urge the Senate to approve this bill. 
   Mr. President, tuberculosis is a global problem. We will never control TB in this country until we control it worldwide, since infectious diseases do not stop at the border. I commend the Senator from California for introducing this important and timely legislation to address tuberculosis effectively now. I hope and believe this bill will gain the support of the full Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I was heavily involved in the negotiations over the manager's amendment to S. 880 as passed by the Senate by unanimous consent on June 23, and have carefully studied the House's amendments to S. 880, which we accept today. I rise to clarify the congressional intent with respect to S. 880, the Chemical Safety Information, Site Security and Fuels Regulatory Relief Act of 1999, as we pass it and send it to the President. 
   Balance between the right-to-know effect and risks of criminal activity (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(ii)): The amendment directs the President to promulgate regulations governing the disclosure of the off-site Consequence Analysis (OCA) information in a way that minimizes the likelihood of releases of the regulated chemicals, whether these releases are accidental or the result of criminal activity. In  other words, the amendment calls for a balancing of the risk-reducing effect of public disclosure (the ``Right-to-Know Effect'') against the potential of increased risk of criminal activity associated with the posting of the OCA information on the Internet. Most importantly, reducing the threat of criminal activity is not the sole or even primary focus of the rule-making. Rather the objective is to minimize the release of regulated chemicals, which requires a balanced approach, and nothing in this Act necessarily precludes the eventual electronic dissemination of the information. 
   Off-site consequence analysis information (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(i)(IV) and (V), and (xii)): The amendment defines ``off-site consequence analysis information'' (OCA information) as a portion of a ``risk management plan,'' which is in turn defined as referring only to information ``submitted to the Administrator by an owner or operator of a stationary source under subparagraph (B)'' of section 112(r)(7) of the Clean Air Act. Similarly, the amendment makes clear that its restrictions apply only to OCA information in the form submitted to the Administrator (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(xii)). In other words, no information, except OCA information submitted to the Administrator, in the form in which it was submitted, is affected by the amendment. Even identical information that is made available to members of the public (unless there is a legally-binding restriction) or that is submitted to state or local agencies is not affected by the constraints on disclosure established by the Act. 
   Official use (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(i)(III) and (vi)): The amendment defines ``official use'' broadly--``an action ..... intended to carry out a function relevant to preventing, planning for or responding to accidental releases or criminal releases''--to reflect the sense that there are a broad range of official uses to which the OCA information may appropriately be put, so long as its public availability is constrained in accord with the regulations developed under the amendment. The bill does not authorize the Administrator to establish restrictions on such official use. 
   State and local official access to all OCA information (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(ii)(II)(ee)): The amendment requires that any covered State and local official be provided, upon request, OCA information on any facility in the country, not just on facilities in the individual's State or community. This reflects, among other things, the fact that a comprehensive evaluation of the facility next door should include comparison with other facilities, including those owned by the same company or its competitors. Similarly, a comprehensive evaluation of the hazard reduction programs of Community A requires a comparison of the hazards presented by facilities in Community A with those presented in Community B. 
   Public access to OCA information regardless of geographic location (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(ii)(II)(aa)): The amendment makes clear that the regulations shall allow any member of the public access to the OCA information for a limited number of facilities regardless of geographic location. This reflects the fact that the need to compare the neighborhood facility with facilities in other locations, or to compare one's community with others, is just as important and appropriate for the public as it is for officials. 
   Voluntary disclosure of OCA information: New section 112(r)(7)(H)(v)(III): The amendment directs any facility that chooses to provide its OCA information to the public without legally-binding restriction to inform the public, through EPA, of that voluntary disclosure. 
   Qualified researchers (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(vii)): The amendment directs the Administrator, in consultation with the Attorney General, to develop a system for providing access to OCA information for ``qualified researchers.'' The Administrator is given authority to determine whether researchers are ``qualified,'' but is otherwise given no authority to screen researchers nor to deny them access to OCA information on the basis of political persuasion, likely findings, purpose to which findings would be put, or any other such factor. 
   Interaction with State law (New section 112(r)(7)H)(x)(II)): The amendment makes clear that States with existing or new laws that collect even data that is identical to OCA information are not precluded from making the State- or local-gathered data available. 
   Reports on vulnerability to criminal activity (New section 112(r)(7)(H)(xi)): The amendment directs the Attorney General to submit a preliminary report in one year and a final report in three years on the extent to which the Risk Management Program regulations have resulted in actions, by stationary sources among others, that are effective in detecting, preventing, and minimizing the consequences of releases caused by criminal activity. The Comptroller General is specifically directed to study the ``design and maintenance of safe facilities'' so that Congress may learn the extent to which the best protection against criminal activity is to maintain a facility that is inherently safe. 
   Reevaluation of disclosure regulations (Section 3(c)): The Act directs the President to reevaluate the regulations governing disclosure within six years. This reevaluation should be made on the same basis used to promulgate the regulations--i.e. the President should perform two separate assessments: (1) an assessment of the increased risk of criminal activity associated with the internet posting of OCA information, and (2) an assessment of the incentives created by public disclosure of OCA information for reduction in the risk of accidental releases. Written documentation of the two assessments and all information and data the President utilizes in preparation of the assessments should be a part of the administrative record associated with any determination the President makes regarding the regulations, or any modification of the regulations. 
   General duty; Finally, the Act leaves the general duty clause of section 112(r) of the Clean Air Act unchanged, in recognition of the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency believes that the general duty clause applies to releases caused by criminal or terrorist activities.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the motion is very simple. It directs the Finance Committee to correct the bill so that it does not raid Social Security surpluses in any year to pay for tax cuts. In its current form, this bill would use Social Security surpluses in each of the second 5 years after enactment. 
   Altogether, $75 billion of Social Security money will be used to pay for the broad-based tax rebates that are largely for special interests and for the very wealthy. That is the intent, and it is inconsistent with the Social Security lockbox that the Republicans claim to support. 
   If my colleagues are serious about stopping Congress from raiding these surpluses, they will support my motion. The Finance Committee can correct the problem very quickly, and then we can proceed to consider the bill within only a few days.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Chemical Security Act of 1999, a bill which will address the threat of criminal attack on chemical facilities. 
   The FBI and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry have warned us that the possibility of terrorist and criminal attacks on chemical plants is a serious threat to public safety. The scenarios they describe are truly chilling. 
   The concerns about criminal attack on chemical plants were initially raised in the context of Internet access to chemical accident information. Some were concerned that criminals could use chemical accident information, gained through the Internet, to target their attacks. In response, we will soon send a bill to the President that will balance the benefits of public access to chemical accident information against the threat of criminal attack. 
   However, Mr. President, the underlying issue is not Internet access to such information--no resourceful criminal needs the Internet to find a chemical plant to attack. A chemical plant target can be found by driving through neighborhood, reading a city map, or accessing information already available from government and business sources. 
   The real issue is the vulnerability of chemical facilities to attack--a vulnerability which can arise from a lack of adequate security at chemical facilities, as well as the use of inherently hazardous chemical operations, even when safer technologies are available. 
   The Chemical Security Act of 1999 will directly address the potential danger of criminal attack on chemical facilities. First, the Act will clarify that it is the general duty of chemical facilities under the Clean Air Act to reduce their own vulnerability to criminal attack. Second, it will require the Attorney General, within one year, to determine whether chemical facilities are taking adequate measures to reduce their vulnerability to criminal attacks that could cause substantial harm to public health, safety, and environment. Third, if the Attorney General finds that chemical facilities are not taking such actions, the Act will require the Attorney General, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, within two years, to promulgate regulations requiring appropriate measures to detect, prevent, and minimize the consequences of such criminal attack. 
   Mr. President, the American public has the right to chemical facilities that are safe from criminal attack. 
   I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. I appreciate this opportunity to state my opposition to the Chafee-Breaux amendment, which would provide a $500 billion tax cut. 
   The proposal is being put forward by some of the moderate Members of this body, and I have tremendous respect for Senators CHAFEE, BREAUX, and the other cosponsors. Its sponsors may be moderate, but this amendment is not. If you really look at the numbers, I would say it is fiscally irresponsible. 
   It is always tempting to believe the best solution to a conflict is to split the difference. But that is not true when one side is taking an extreme position. That is what is happening. 
   In this case, splitting the difference would be terrible policy. It would force either unreasonable cuts in education, defense, and other priorities or, more likely, it would eventually force excessive cuts in Medicare and Social Security. 
   Supporters of large tax cuts have been coming to the floor arguing that we have a $3 trillion surplus to divide up. But that is wrong. I have even heard the arguments being made about how well regarded the original Finance Committee bill of $792 billion was, and claiming that it is the only fair thing to do--to give it back to the people who paid the bills in the first place. The fact of the matter is, we are all on a mortgage; all of our citizens share a mortgage, all of us in this room and outside in the countryside. It is our national debt. 
   I don't know any family that, given a chance to get a couple of bucks in their pockets--less than $150 in the tax cut for modest-income earners of $38,000--would not rather have their mortgage paid off for them. That is the condition we ought to be in--paying off our mortgage and paying off our national debt, not giving it back in forms that produce most of the benefits for people in the highest share of the income strata. We were talking about people who are wealthy, who make $800,000 a year--by any judgment, they are pretty well off in this country--getting $23,000 a year worth of tax cuts in the original bill. Now we are in the compromise stage, and we are down at a level that still, frankly, doesn't make economic sense. 
   It is expected that we are talking about a surplus. Well, first, I want to point out it is a projected surplus. There is a big difference. Hardly anybody who has looked at CBO's projections truly believes that they are without question. To be fair to CBO, even they have acknowledged their estimates are uncertain. 
   They depend not only on guesses about our economy, but they depend on assumptions that the Congress will make drastic cuts in a broad range of popular programs from veterans' health care, to education, to law enforcement. If Congress merely maintains defense spending at the levels requested by President Clinton, all of these other programs would have to be cut about 40 percent. 
   Alan Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, who is really the most esteemed spokesman on the economic condition in our country, has said: Hey, be careful. The Fed Chairman told the Banking Committee in an article from the Washington Post this very day:  
   It would be unwise to cut taxes now altogether on the basis of surplus forecasts that could be far off the mark. If Congress goes ahead with a major tax cut, I think it also has to be prepared to cut spending significantly in the event that the forecasts on which they are based are wrong.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is less time than I thought I would have to speak on this subject. I have waited patiently. I guess I will try to wrap it up now. 
   The projected surplus is truly a mirage. If Congress were to maintain basic Government functions at this year's level, it would be a $1 trillion non-Social Security surplus, yes, but it would be more like one-tenth of that, or $100 billion, by the time we finish with this tax cut. 
   We are slashing prospectively important domestic programs such as VA and other programs, trying to find trick ways to satisfy our obligation to the Veterans' Administration and to the Census, which is clearly identified in our Constitution as an obligation, now calling it ``emergency'' spending. 
   What we are observing, I think, is some sleight-of-hand work. I hate to use that term, but that is what I see, ``cooking the books,'' making sure we take whatever forecasts suit the situation the best. 
   There is no way to do what we want to do, what we are obliged to do, if we are going to give away $500 billion in tax cuts. There are better ways to deal with our financial or fiscal condition. Alan Greenspan confirms that. 
   I hope this Senate will respond to the American people's desire. Get rid of the mortgage, pay down the debt, and then talk about tax cuts that are targeted specifically to modest-income people.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from the class of 1982. You are looking at the entire class here, Senator BINGAMAN and me. The Senator and I are the remainder of the class of 1982. We thought we were a small class then, but we have gotten smaller and we have hung on tenaciously. 
   One of the things we agree on is the need to provide the kinds of services to our country that we are pledged to, not only morally but by law, by laws established over a period of many years, including such services as our commitments to the veterans who fought to keep this country free, for the schoolchildren who need to get a start in life and get on with their own opportunities. 
   What we see today in the discussion we have just had, frankly, comes as a surprise to me, a surprise because I serve on the Budget Committee as the senior Democrat. I looked at the figures. We worked together to try to establish a plausible base, a parameter within which to work. But what I have heard is we just discovered gold. We found $500 billion just laying around. No one else knew it, but it was found. 
   Since arithmetic is a relatively pure science and everything has to add up, one scratches one's head and says: How did we find roughly $500 billion more? The distinguished chairman, a very wise Member of the Senate, an outstanding expert on the budget, found $500 billion that could be used to support the tax cut that is proposed at some $790 billion. Then there are interest costs on that. 
   What I come up with, what the numbers say, is that we wind up with a budget surplus of $32 billion--$32 billion. That is at the end of 10 years--$32 billion. The elderly, the baby boomers who are going to be retiring at that time, ought to rest 
   easy because they have $32 billion that is going to go into helping Social Security stay a little more solvent--$32 billion that can be used for other purposes.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. The baseline that was originally proposed by CBO was to have the caps in place until the year 2002, 3 years hence. Then it was assumed by the presentations that we have seen and that are here on the chart, that now the baseline will decline by virtue of no inflation allowable for those years after it--none, zero.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. That is right. If you do that, you take over $400 billion out of reality, out of the need to provide programs--$419 billion below CBO's capped baseline. 
   If you want to play with a figment of imagination, you can imagine maybe it will be less than that. Maybe we will be able to cut out the programs for veterans and the other programs that are necessary, just cut them and play pretend.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my friend and colleague from Montana. 
   Mr. President, tomorrow I will be offering an amendment on behalf of myself and Senator FEINGOLD. This  amendment is very simple. It directs the Finance Committee to change the bill so that it does not raid Social Security surpluses in any year to pay for tax breaks. 
   The motion stands for a very simple proposition. Social Security surpluses should be used for Social Security, not for broad-scale tax breaks that primarily benefit special interests and wealthy individuals, not for tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the wealthy, not for anything that would make it more difficult for baby boomers and other Americans to enjoy a secure retirement. 
   This ought not to be a controversial proposition. After all, both parties have been arguing along the same lines for most of this year. Democrats created a lockbox to prevent Social Security surpluses from being used for other purposes and to protect Medicare, and the Republicans vowed to support that concept. But actually, the lockbox proposal that was introduced by the Republicans has a huge loophole and does nothing for Medicare. 
   Medicare is perhaps the most important program that exists in this country. Medicare is for the elderly. Medicare is the one program that people have to have standing by in case an illness strikes, which is an occurrence that is not infrequent when one reaches 65 or retirement age. Medicare can prevent a catastrophic illness, but also can prevent a catastrophic financial problem. So we support extending Medicare for as long as we possibly can, and the projection now is that though Medicare would be insolvent in 2015, we see an opportunity to extend it to 2027. 
   There did seem to be broad agreement from both parties that Social Security surpluses should not be touched for any other purpose, that they should be used only to reduce publicly held debt. I was surprised, to put it mildly, to discover that the Republican tax bill before us actually spends Social Security surpluses. Deny it they might--and one need not be a mathematician; the arithmetic is pretty simple to see--but, in fact, the bill before us spends Social Security surpluses in each of the second 5 years after the bill's enactment. It starts in 2005. 
   This chart explains the problems. Consider, for example, what happens beginning in 2005 under this legislation. The non-Social Security surplus that year will be $88.6 billion. But this bill, the way it is laid out, would cost $89.9 billion. In other words, this bill would use $1.3 billion in Social Security surpluses that very year, 2005, not a long way away. But the damage doesn't stop there. 
   This legislation would increase debt, and that would lead to higher interest costs. In 2005 alone, these additional interest costs would eat up another $10.9 billion of Social Security surpluses. So the raid on Social Security that year would equal $12.3 billion. This is after the promise that Social Security is sacred: Touch not a hair on that Social Security reserve that we are saving for the elderly, which we promised them would be theirs. When we finally have a chance to guarantee its solvency, that promise, frankly, was an empty promise. 
   Look at the numbers. If you consider both the direct revenue losses and the additional interest costs, this bill would raid Social Security surpluses in each of the second 5 years after enactment. We are talking about 10 years from now. The raid in 2006 would take $5.7 billion. That would increase to $10.2 billion in 2007, to $24 billion in 2008, and $23.4 billion in the year 2009. 
   This is inconsistent with the Republicans' own lockbox. It would violate a principle that is meant to protect all Americans who are depending on Social Security for their retirement. These are people who spend their lives working hard, playing by the rules, contributing their FICA taxes to the Social Security trust fund. In fact, millions of seniors depend on Social Security just to make ends meet, no luxury included there. Many of these people have high medical expenses. It is a natural phenomenon. Thank goodness we are living longer, but in that living illnesses do occur. Some have trouble getting around; they are physically impaired. Many are really struggling. It is Social Security that keeps them out of poverty. For these people, saving Social Security is not just an abstract principle, a slogan; it is critical to their very existence. 
   That is important to remember. It is important to remember that the number of Social Security beneficiaries will grow by 37 percent between now and 2015. By 2014, Social Security taxes will no longer be sufficient to cover monthly expenses. So we need to prepare. At a minimum, that means not using Social Security surpluses for anything else. 
   I know how my friends on the Republican side will react to this. When confronted with these numbers, they will have to admit that this bill spends Social Security surpluses. But that is not really a problem, they will say, because years and years down the road Congress will somehow or other cut programs such as education and the environment to make up the difference. 
   That is an empty promise, an empty lockbox, it is completely unenforceable, and it has zero credibility. Consider how deep these cuts would have to be. Let's assume the Republican Congress funds defense programs only at the levels proposed by President Clinton. After 10 years, domestic needs--everything from education, to environmental protection, to the FBI--would have to be cut by roughly 40 percent. Is that credible? A 40-percent cut in student aid? A 40-percent cut in health research? A 40-percent cut in veterans' programs? That always gets to me because the promises made when they are recruiting, when people sign up, are that we will make sure you have medical care through the rest of your life--except they cut the funding. 
   There may be a few Republicans who would support cuts such as that. But there is no way cuts that size would ever win a majority. It would be foolish to assume otherwise. 
   My motion is simple. It tells the Finance Committee to go back and fix this bill so that it doesn't use Social Security surpluses in any year, bring it back to the Senate within 3 days, and then let's consider it. I don't think it is asking much. It is not going to hurt anybody if the Senate waits another 3 days before resuming work on this bill. But lots of people will be hurt if the Senate abandons its principles and uses Social Security surpluses for tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the wealthy and special interests. That would be a serious mistake. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this motion when it is in front of you. Let's fix this bill and protect Social Security surpluses. Let's keep the promise we made to the baby boomers, those who will be retiring, that Social Security will be extended as far as we are physically able to do so. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Montana. Perhaps I will use less time than that. 
   Mr. President, I have listened carefully to the debate. I heard comments that I would describe as scornful, derisive, challenging everybody else's honesty. 
   I know one thing. When we are challenging someone else's honesty, it is a good idea to do it in front of a mirror. That way, one gets to see what perhaps one might be saying, and understanding where one is going, so that when one reviews the argument being made for or against a particular point of view, if they want to talk in terms of dishonesty and in terms of scorn and in terms of derision about what is being said, it invites the same kind of commentary--which gets us nowhere. 
   It doesn't improve the debate. It doesn't make it clearer to the American people. It doesn't establish a framework for really thinking the problem through. 
   Mr. President, I am the senior Democrat on the Budget Committee. And I want to suggest that my colleagues take a look at an article in the Wall Street Journal, entitled ``GOP Uses Two Sets of Books.'' The article explains that the GOP is using two sets of books--one from the Office of Management and Budget, the other from the Congressional Budget Office. And, by taking the best of each, it's trying to hide the fact that, and I quote, ``lawmakers are poised again to raid the very same Social Security funds they have promised to lock away.'' 
   Mr. President, I don't accuse our friends on the other side of the aisle of deliberate untruthfulness. But I hope the American people will be able to understand what is really going on. 
   Mr. President, when it comes to this tax bill, there is no doubt where I stand. I stand for the majority of the American public. The people who are concerned with making a living and providing for their children. The people who are working hard to help their parents and grandparents. The people in families where two people are working, and who are having a hard time meeting their obligations. When mom has to work and dad has to work and they are either on different shifts or the same shifts, it means one of the parents is not home to be with the children at times when that might provide the kind of encouragement and sustenance for development. There is a price to pay for it. 
   There is physical fatigue. My mother was a widow at age 36. She worked hard. I was old enough to be in the Army. My sister was only 12 when my father died. But there was exhaustion. It was hard to take care of all of the responsibilities. 
   When I look at tax cuts, I ask, which Americans need them? The guy making $800,000 a year? I don't think he needs a $23,000 tax cut. But that's what he'd get under this bill. And that's money that we could be using to pay off our national debt. 
   Mr. President, most Americans, if given the opportunity, would love to pay off their loans and their debts. Their mortgages. Their car loans. Well, that's what we want our nation to do. 
   But the Republicans, instead, want to use the money to provide massive tax breaks for wealthy individuals and special interests. Oil interests, mineral interests, many others. Instead of paying off our debts and leaving our children free from that obligation, the Republican bill would give that money to these special interests. 
   As you can tell, Mr. President, I object strongly to the Republican tax bill. This legislation raids surpluses that are needed for Social Security, that sacred covenant we have with people who have my color hair that says we want to care of them. It is a commitment we made, a promise we made, as we took the money from their paycheck. 
   I want to protect Social Security. My conscience calls for it. I have to make sure those who are paying Social Security are going to get the benefits they expected when it comes to retirement time. 
   Medicare? There are few programs in this country that have the value to people like Medicare, which says that when you reach that age when sickness, when physical problems are not a surprise, you will get the medical care you need. Those are essential, basic things--Social Security solvency, Medicare. These are for people when they are most vulnerable, in their older age. We have made a commitment that we are going to take care of them. Our friends on the Republican side say no, tax breaks; that is more important. 
   By the way, all of this is more show business than plain business. It is designed to let the American public think they want to be generous and they want to return the money, and we are sinners because we say we are going to help pay off the debt that your kids, Mr. and Mrs. America, won't have to worry about. 
   They say: Who knows better how to spend the money? Is it those bad guys in Washington--bad guys and women; that is the way we are today--those bad people in Washington who want to just take your money? I heard someone say ``take it and spend it,'' take it and spend it, like that is the principal motive for responsible people serving here. I wouldn't accuse them of that, and I don't think they ought to accuse us of that silly nonsense. Take your money and spend it? That is not what anybody wants to do. 
   We want to do the right thing. They want to do the right thing. They just haven't learned how yet. 
   Mr. President, the cost of the tax breaks under their bill would increase dramatically just when the baby boomers begin to retire. The bill would force drastic cuts in education, environmental protection, other priorities. It could lead to a return of higher interest rates. And it is fundamentally unfair.  
   Mr. President, Democrats strongly support tax cuts for middle-class Americans, ordinary people who are working hard to keep things together. We have proposed almost $300 billion worth of tax cuts. Our cuts were targeted to the middle class, the people who needed them most. But we couldn't get the cooperation of our friends on the other side. We won't take funds needed for Social Security and Medicare like the Republican bill does. They are willing to take it out of this Social Security trust fund, which I will demonstrate later. 
   Neither Social Security nor Medicare has enough financing to support the baby boomers in their retirement. We need to extend the solvency of both programs. We need to pay off our debt, which now forces taxpayers to pay $225 billion a year in wasted interest payments. I guess they don't want to stop that. They don't want to stop that. They would rather try to dole it out principally to people at the top of the income ladder. They don't want to reduce that debt. 
   President Clinton has proposed to reserve all Social Security surpluses for debt reduction as well as another $325 billion for Medicare. The Republicans openly oppose reserving non-Social Security surpluses for Medicare, but they claim their bill reserves all Social Security surpluses for Social Security. The claim is untrue. 
   The bill before us would raid Social Security surpluses in 5 of the next 10 years. This chart shows the numbers. 
   Here we are, 2005; that is practically around the corner. What does it say? Red. Everybody knows what red ink means. Minus $12 billion. That is out of the Social Security trust fund. We have no place to get it. So instead of protecting Social Security, we are raiding Social Security because of the tax cut they want to give to the fat cats. 
   Consider what will happen in 2005. The non-Social Security surplus that year will be $88.6 billion. But this bill would cost $89.9 billion. The bill therefore would directly create Social Security surpluses of $1.3 billion in that year. However, the real raid on Social Security would be much deeper. This legislation would increase debt and lead to higher interest costs. In 2005 alone, these additional interest costs would eat up another $10.9 billion of Social Security surpluses. So the total raid on Social Security would be over $12 billion in 2005. 
   If you consider both the direct revenue losses and the additional interest costs, this bill would raid the Social Security surplus in each of the second 5 years after enactment. 
   Mr. President, I think I know what the Republicans would say about this. They will promise that even if this bill does spend Social Security surpluses, many years from now, Congress will somehow make huge cuts in programs, such as education and the environment, to offset these costs. Unfortunately, it is an empty promise that is completely unenforceable. No credibility. 
   Consider the depth of the cuts that would be required. If you assume the Republican Congress funds defense programs at the levels presently proposed by President Clinton, by the end of the 10 year period, domestic needs, everything from education and environmental protection, to the FBI, would have to be cut roughly 40 percent. Is that credible? A 40-percent cut in student aid? A 40-percent cut in health research? A 40-percent cut in veterans' programs? 
   That is not going to happen. But that is the pretense under which we are operating. 
   The Republicans are saying we have to reduce and cut programs. But the American people need to understand what that would mean. Head Start--375,000 preschool children would be denied services that help them come to school ready to learn. The FBI--that is a favorite of all of ours because they do very important work--would have to cut 6,300 agents in order to accommodate this. VA medical care--a promise that was made to veterans, and to me when I enlisted in the Army--they would treat 1.4 million fewer patients. Superfund--the wonderful program that helps clean up toxic waste sites in our society--no funding would be provided for any new cleanups, due to begin in 2009. Are summer jobs important? I think so. But 270,000 young people would lose jobs and training opportunities. The list goes on. 
   Look how the tax breaks in this bill explode in cost. In the first year, they cost $4.2 billion. By the last year, they cost almost $200 billion. In the following 10 years, these costs explode even more. All of this will be happening when the baby boomers start retiring. 
   In other words, the Republican plan doesn't just raid the Social Security trust fund; it also would undermine the Government's revenue base and dramatically increase the chances that Social Security benefits will be cut. 
   Similarly, this bill proposes a very real threat to Medicare. The Medicare trust fund is now scheduled to go bankrupt by 2015. President Clinton has proposed a comprehensive reform plan that would extend solvency through 2027, for a dozen years or more. He wants to provide a new prescription drug benefit for older Americans. That is going to come from the surpluses that we enjoy, as long as we don't give them away. 
   What does this legislation do for Medicare? Zero. There is not a penny to extend the program's solvency, and not one penny for prescription drugs. 
   Another problem with the bill is that it is fundamentally 
   unfair. It is loaded up with various special interest provisions. Meanwhile, ordinary Americans are left with a few crumbs. 
   If we look at this chart, the top 1 percent of the income earners, earning $837,000, get a $23,344 cut. If you are in the bottom 60 percent, earning below $38,000, you get $141. That is less than 50 cents a day. I hope those people making $38,000 don't go out and blow that 50 cents a day. 
   Another problem with this bill, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice, the top 1 percent of the taxpayers, those with incomes over $300,000--and the average, as we saw, is $837,000--will get those juicy tax breaks that we see here, while the bottom 60 percent will get that $141. 
   That is not fair. Beyond the threat to Social Security, Medicare, education, and other priorities, and beyond its fundamental unfairness, this bill also poses a significant risk to our economy. 
   It would be one thing to call for huge tax cuts if our Nation were in the middle of a recession. Sometimes you need a boost, a stimulus, but today our economy is very strong. In this kind of an environment, a large fiscal stimulus is dangerous. 
   The Federal Reserve just tightened monetary policy, forcing up interest rates to preempt inflation. Chairman Greenspan suggested last week the Fed may raise interest rates again to preserve price stability. A huge tax cut in these conditions would be a serious mistake. It could force up interest rates, which could drag down the investment that is driving our economy. As Chairman Greenspan testified, ``The timing is not right.'' 
   Mr. President, we are doing no favors for middle-class families if we give them a tax break worth less than 50 cents a day and then force them to pay higher interest rates on their mortgages and their car payments. 
   Mr. President, before I close, I want to take a minute to respond to an analysis released last week by the Congressional Budget Office. That analysis supposedly shows that the GOP budget plan reduces debt more than the President's. But the analysis is highly misleading, largely because it is based on questionable assumptions. 
   For example, the analysis assumes the Congress will abide by this year's spending cap, even though the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, a distinguished Senator, Senator STEVENS from Alaska, says there is no way he can pass the bills without more money. It then assumes that Congress will abide by the caps in 2001 and 2002, which are both lower than this year's. 
   Then, to top it off, CBO assumes Congress will cut even further in real terms in each of the following 7 years. Mr. and Mrs. Public, don't you believe that. Congress is not going to make cuts like that in veterans' medical care. We are not going to permit Head Start to be decimated. We are not going to cut out programs that people depend on for their very lives. 
   Mr. President, people really need many of these programs. Most don't like to depend on government if they can avoid it. My father at the height of the depression was most ashamed of  the fact that he had to go to work for WPA, the public works program. He demanded dignity. He demanded it almost more than his pride would permit. He worked for a government program, and he was ashamed to tell anybody. People like him do not want government programs. I had my GI bill for my education. I took it because I thought that in the final analysis not only would it help me, but it would help me to be a better citizen, to make a contribution to my country. 
   The Congressional Budget Office is assuming we will not abide by the spending caps. They are assuming we are actually going to cut almost $200 billion below it. That is not credible. 
   CBO's analysis also contains a variety of questionable statements. For example, it ignores the extra $14 billion in tax breaks that were added to the $778 billion originally assumed in the budget resolution. It also ignores the Budget Committee's directive to CBO that it use different scorekeeping estimates when it scores appropriations bills. 
   Those mandates for special, ``directed scoring'' will allow the Appropriations Committee to spend more, and will reduce the surplus by at least $18 billion. Yet CBO doesn't even mention this in its analysis. 
   Mr. President, there are other inaccuracies and distortions in the CBO analysis. But together they undermine the credibility of last week's analysis. And, unfortunately, they've raised many questions on this side of the aisle about CBO's fairness and objectivity. 
   Mr. President, CBO is supposed to be objective and fair to both sides. They are just supposed to look at the numbers. That is all. 
   Mr. President, let me close by just recapping the main problems with the Republican tax bill. 
   It raids Social Security surpluses in several years. 
   It leaves nothing for Medicare. 
   Its costs explode in the future, just when the baby boomers will be retiring. 
   It would force extreme cuts in education, health care, crime fighting, and other priorities. 
   Its tax breaks are unfair, and give huge benefits to special interests and the wealthiest Americans. 
   And it's fiscally irresponsible, risking higher interest rates and a return to the days of red ink and large deficits. 
   In sum, Mr. President, this is extreme legislation. It may appeal to the far right wing of the Republican Party. But by posing such a direct threat to Social Security and Medicare, it's inconsistent with the values of mainstream American families. 
   That is why this President is determined to veto it the minute it reaches his desk, and he should. 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill and to support the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Montana. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate a man who was a good friend and an extraordinary political mentor. I will miss the opportunity to consult with him on matters important to governing. His contribution to me was a valuable one and it is deep in my thought and functioning as a U.S. Senator. He was a superb role model for public service and I followed his judgement often. I am honored to offer this tribute to former New Jersey Assembly Speaker Alan Karcher, his indomitable spirit, his unshakeable conviction, his widespread talents, his love for politics in the widest sense, and his devotion to the people of New Jersey. 
   Alan's death on July 27 at too young an age, was not totally unexpected--he had been battling cancer for several years--but the reality of it shocks all of us who knew him. And there are a lot of us who fought in the trenches of New Jersey politics alongside him, as well as those who fought in opposition. Alan used his considerable wit, intellect and spirit to master New Jersey politics, and all of us respected him as the consummate politician. Alan was political in the most classical sense of that word, with all of its ties to the Greek concepts of the body politic, the people and citizenship, and he was political in the most modern sense of the word--sagacious, prudent, shrewd, and artful. 
   Alan saw elected office as public service and an honored and honorable family tradition. Both his father, Joseph Karcher, and a great-uncle, John Quaid, also served in the New Jersey Assembly. When Alan followed them in 1974, he honed the practice of legislating to a fine art, serving as both Assembly Majority Leader and as Speaker during his sixteen-year career. He was a master of strategy in the service of the principal of the common good. He was articulate, passionate, and so often right, that more times than not he was able to convince both natural allies and skeptics alike. 
   Alan was a fiercely proud Democrat who believed wholeheartedly that ``government'' and ``the people'' were virtually synonymous concepts. He knew how to keep his ``eye on the prize,'' and he understood that ``the prize'' was responsive, responsible government. Alan did nothing by halves and when he believed in something it was with total engagement. His interests and his talents spanned an extraordinary range. This most political of men was also a sensitive and accomplished musician, a cellist and an opera-lover who could sing Italian arias perhaps not as well as Pavarotti, but certainly as energetically. He was also, of course, a compelling lawyer nationally known for his insight into Constitutional issues and a respected author who examined controversial matters with perception and conviction. 
   He has left a splendid legacy for us and for those he loved most, his wife Peggy, children Timothy, Elizabeth and Ellen, and his five grandchildren, who have his mark and his stature as enduring memories. We will miss him, but not his spirit, for that will continue to guide us. We will miss him, but not his idealism, for that will continue to inspire us. We will miss him, but not his passion, for that will continue to make us strive.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to offer an amendment to provide the Justice Department $25 million in fiscal year 2001 to develop and begin to implement a media campaign to discourage children from engaging in underage alcohol consumption. 
   We already have an ad campaign on national television that espouses the evils of drug use. But that campaign does not include alcohol. And when I tried to amend that ad campaign in the Treasury-Postal bill last month to include alcohol, some Senators said that they did not want to dilute the anti-drug message. But they did say that they would support a separate anti-underage drinking campaign. 
   I offer this amendment on behalf of myself and Senators HARKIN and DORGAN, who the last time I offered a similar amendment voted against it, but now has agreed that it is the right thing to do. 
   Right now, by running anti-drugs ads without also running anti-underage drinking ads, we are sending the wrong message to Ameria's children. It is the equivalent of telling kids: ``say 'no' to drugs. But this Bud's for you!'' 
   Mr. President, consuming alcohol is illegal in all 50 States if you are under the age of 21, and among America's youth, underage alcohol consumption is just as big a problem as drug use. 
   The facts are daunting. If we look at this chart, we see that alcohol kills six times more children ages 12 to 20 than all the other ilegal drugs combined. It was a surprise to me, as I suspect it is a surprise to millions of other Americans as well. 
   Let me point out some more facts. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the average age at which children start drinking is 13. 
   What's even worse, Mr. President, is that research shows that children who drink at age 13 have a 47-percent chance of becoming alcohol-dependent. 
   But if they waited until they were 21 to drink, they would have only a 10-percent chance of becoming dependent. 
   In all, Mr. President, there are nearly 4 million young people in this country who suffer from alcohol dependence, and they account for one-fifth of all alcohol-dependent Americans. 
   Not only is alcohol consumption widespread among children under the age of 21, but it is a ``gateway drug.'' And too often, it leads to the use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. 
   The drug czar, Geneal McCaffrey, had some things to say about this. He said, ``The most dangerous drug in America today is still alcohol.'' 
   But for one reason or another, we don't get that message through. 
   He goes on to say that alcohol is ``the biggest drug abuse problem for adolescents, and it's linked to the use of other, illegal drugs.'' 
   Mr. President, statistics support what General McCaffrey has been saying. According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, youth who drink alcohol are 7.5 times more likely to use any illegal drug and 50 times more likely to use cocaine, than young people who never drink alcohol. 
   General McCaffrey is not alone in his belief that attacking underage drinking is a key component of the war on drugs. Surgeon General Davis Satcher recently wrote a letter to General McCaffrey expressing his support for ``a powerful media campaign that will effectively deglamourize underage drinking.'' 
   Surgeon General Satcher went on to say that he has established a Staff Working Group ``to create an effective campaign to curtail the incidence of underage and binge drinking.'' 
   Finally, the Surgeon General  
   It is time to more effectively address the drug that children and teens tell us is their great concern and the drug we know is most likely to result in their injury or death.  
   If experts like General McCaffrey and Surgeon General Satcher agree that alcohol is a ``gateway drug,'' then it is clear that a well-planned ad campaign that targets underage drinking would increase the effectiveness of our war against drugs. 
   My amendment provides the Justice Department with $25 million in fiscal year 2001 to develop and begin to implement a media campaign to discourage  children under the age of 21 from drinking. The amendment allows plenty of time to conduct the necessary research and develop and test sample radio and television ads in order to launch an effective media campaign. Ad messages would be consistent with the antidrug messages in the drug czar's media campaign. There would also be funds to begin buying media time. 
   The Justice Department will coordinate the campaign with representatives of the Centers for Disease Control, the Surgeon General's office, and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. With the help of these health institutions, the Justice Department also would put together a detailed 5-year funding plan for the campaign and its media ``buys'' to help Congress in the appropriations process. 
   Editorials have been written across this country supporting the need for an anti-underage drinking media campaign. Editorials have appeared in the Washington Post, New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, and Los Angeles Times. The concept of an anti-underage drinking media campaign is further supported by more than 80 organizations, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 
   I am proud to have been the author some years ago, in 1984, that made 21 the drinking age in all 50 States. With the help of the National Transportation Safety Board, we have saved the lives of approximately 15,000 young people in the 15 years since the law has been in place. It was a real boon to those families who worried about their children drinking and the problems that result. 
   In 1995, Senator BYRD led the charge on zero tolerance for underage alcohol consumption by writing a law that says if you are under age 21, .02 blood alcohol level is legally drunk. So, as in the past, we need to continue to send a strong message to America's youth that neither underage alcohol consumption nor drug use is acceptable. And the only successful path to winning the war on drugs is the one paved by preventing underage drinking. 
   We must not accept underage drinking as a so-called rite of passage. It often is. It is a passage directly to illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin. It is a passage to a life of alcohol dependency. 
   The bottom line is this: This is a simple up-or-down vote on whether you want to do something to prevent teen alcohol addiction. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that we can get a handle on that drug which is acknowledged to be the most dangerous among all drugs. And the fact that alcohol kills six times more children ages 12 to 20 than all other illegal drugs combined proves that. 
   I hope we get a positive vote on this. I understand this vote will be stacked with a vote of the Senator from Wyoming, is that correct?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for permitting me to offer this amendment. 
   But this is not a precedent-setting amendment. We have done substantial forward funding in those programs that need it. And it will take a year to organize this program. 
   This is the time to get this program started by making certain that the message is clear, that it is out there. It says: Listen, kids, don't start drinking. It could lead you down a terrible path. It could create more dependence on alcohol, more introduction to other drugs. That is a poor way to give a child a sendoff.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes to talk about the events that have weighed so heavily on all of us. Whether one knows Senator KENNEDY well or casually through contact in the Senate, one cannot but have respect and admiration for the contribution the Kennedy family has made to our public well-being for so many years. That is why I am sure others share the same feeling of grief as I do, and others who know the Kennedy family well, at the loss of John F. Kennedy, Jr. 
   When the news came--and I was on my way to Martha's Vineyard--that the young Mr. Kennedy's airplane was missing, we all, I am sure, had the same reaction--let's pray that it is not true, that there is some information that will come out that will prove to be worry-unfounded. Unfortunately, our worst fears were realized. This day, apparently, the discovery has been made that confirms the death of John F. Kennedy, Jr., 38 years of age. 
   One of the remarkable things we saw in this young man was the way he treated his position in life, coming from a famous family, with all of the celebrity status one could imagine, from a family that has seen tragedy after tragedy after tragedy. 
   I had an opportunity, a year ago Christmas week, to sit with Michael Kennedy and his young sons on the morning of the day he perished on the ski slopes below. We actually skied together for a while in the morning. I visited with his brother that night to see if I could be of any help to the family in managing the affairs they had to put in order. It was very sad. 
   When John F. Kennedy, Jr.'s life was just really beginning to flourish, it is hard to understand what it was that took this young man so full of life. The imagery of John F. Kennedy, Jr., was the same imagery that we had, in a way, of John F. Kennedy, Sr., President of the United States--attractive, intelligent, concerned about the well-being of our country, trying always to lift the opportunity and the spirits of those who in America depended so much on government and individual leadership. John F. Kennedy, Jr., evoked the same imagery--of this attractive young man, of this bright, intelligent, caring person, eschewing the spotlight whenever he could, trying to become part of the society in which we all live. 
   His early death will prevent what all of us believe was so much talent and so much future. Any of us who have worked with TED KENNEDY--and I have now for 16 years--only gains respect the longer we know Senator KENNEDY. His accomplishments are legendary, but his commitment to people--rich, poor, those who have needed help--is without reservation. We have seen an energized Senator KENNEDY over at his desk, stating the causes and cases he is concerned about. And to see them, the whole Kennedy family, put into the grief can only be imagined by those who have their family intact without the trail of misfortune that has followed the Kennedy family. 
   So I just came in, for the RECORD, to make some comments to register my feelings, as I know so many others have, of grief for the families of John F. Kennedy, Jr., his wife, and his sister-in-law, the Kennedys and the Bessettes. 
   We hope his life will inspire us to give whatever we can by way of service to our country, to recognize the advantages we have as citizens of the United States, not to be discouraged by this untimely tragedy but, rather, to be motivated to try to do better. 
   Mr. President, I hope we will reserve appropriate time, collectively, to acknowledge our share of feelings for the Kennedy family and the grief they are going through. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit an important resolution expressing the sense of the Congress that a commemorative postage stamp should be issued in honor of the U.S.S. New Jersey, an Iowa class battleship, and all those who served aboard her. 
   From the time of its launch on December 7, 1942, the U.S.S. New Jersey provided crucial support to numerous naval missions throughout the world. It is the most decorated warship in U.S. naval history, having earned battle stars, citations, medals, and ribbons from World War II, the Korean conflict, and the Vietnam era. Furthermore, the U.S.S. New Jersey was the first U.S. battleship to enter and operate in the Persian Gulf. 
   The New Jersey was decommissioned in 1991, and in the fiscal year 1999 Defense authorization bill, I authorized a provision to mandate that the Navy donate the U.S.S. New Jersey to a nonprofit entity that will relocate the ship in the state of New Jersey. Now, after the overwhelming support and continuous struggle of various groups and individuals in the state, as well as bipartisan efforts from New Jersey's state and federal legislators, the battleship is scheduled to return to New Jersey this fall. For this, I would like to extend my thanks to the residents of New Jersey who have donated countless hours in volunteer time, as well as to the Battleship New Jersey Foundation whose efforts were a driving force in the success of this endeavor. 
   Now that the U.S.S. New Jersey is coming home, it is time to honor this great ship with a commemorative stamp.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
   As stated by our colleague and friend from the State of Michigan, we are kind of looking at the same thing again. He likened it to ``Groundhog Day.'' I would say it is ``deja vu all over again.'' That was said by a great philosopher in New Jersey, Yogi Berra. 
   What are we talking about? What we are discussing is whether or not the people on this side of the aisle and the people up there and the people out there will have a right to have their views included in this debate. 
   It is pretty simple. We are talking about a lockbox. A lockbox is a place where you can preserve treasure, where you can preserve family records, jewelry, et cetera. But I never heard of a lockbox where they put in one article of value and leave out the rest. 
   What we are hearing is that we are going to protect Social Security's surpluses, but we are not going to do anything, according to the majority, to extend the solvency of Social Security. We are not going to do anything to include Medicare's solvency. People do not get into these programs until they are 65 years old. At that time, do you want to have to worry about whether or not health insurance is going to be available? Do you want to worry whether that retirement fund is going to be there for your children who are now hard at work trying to take care of their needs while they also prepare for their retirement? The Republicans are saying: Leave it to us; we will figure out a way to take care of it some day off in Wonderland. 
   The fact of the matter is, yes, we want to engage in an honest debate about this. It is not just let us have our vote. Let them have their vote means that under the proposal they have offered, this side gets no votes and the people we represent across this country get no opinion expressed. Look at the polls and see what they think about who is going to do the best job to protect Social Security and Medicare. They are going to say the Democrats are the people who worry most about it. 
   We are beginning to look at an examination of process, a process that a lot of people do not understand, even some in this body, but certainly across the country people do not understand it: Cloture motions. 
   Amendments, allow us to discuss them. Pure and simple, that is the way the American people want us to talk to them. Will they allow us, the Democrats, to register our view of how this Social Security so-called lockbox is going to look? Does it do the job the American people want? Or are we using terminology that has a certain ring to it that has no value? 
   That is the question. I say to my friend from Michigan, let us have some amendments so that we do not have to, up or down, just take what the Republicans have offered. Let us debate it. It is a big enough proposal, I think. 
   Yes, it has reared its ugly head several times. The fact of the matter is, we have not yet gotten to see the whole body there. We do not understand all the ramifications. At least the public does not understand them. 
   Give us a chance to have some amendments. They are saying: No, the first thing we are going to do is move on to the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft proposal. 
   We do not want to do it that way. We are going to do our darndest to protect the American people. We are going to insist we have a lockbox that includes solvency for Medicare extended by 20 years, extend Social Security by 30 years or 40 years, and try during that period of time to work it out so it is extended for 75 years. 
   That is what our mission ought to be--look ahead and not simply try to shut things down and offer as a juicy incentive a tax cut that is best for the wealthiest in this country. 
   It is $1 trillion for the cost of the House Republican tax cut. Out of that, they take $55 billion away from Social Security to help it along. They take $964 billion of the surplus to help that tax cut along. The American people are more interested in putting food on the table, providing for their education, and protecting their parents' health care in the future than they are about that kind of tax cut. 
   We want to give a tax cut, too. Everybody loves tax cuts. The difference is, we love them for the majority of the people where it counts. We love them because we want people to receive adequate child care, and we want to know they can take care of the elderly when medical services are necessary. It is not just tax cuts for tax cuts. No, tax cuts for political purposes is what we are looking at--tax cuts for the wealthy. 
   This economy is boiling. You cannot get help to do this. You cannot get help to do that. You want to buy a house. The housing market is exploding. If you want to go into fancy items such as boats and airplanes, you have to wait 3 years to get delivery on them. I do not feel sorry for a guy who has to wait 3 years for a new airplane. The fact of the matter is, that is where that money will go with a tax cut, and not into the homes of people who worked all their lives to save a few bucks and provide for their retirement, as well as for their medical care needs. 
   That is what this debate is about, and I hope that our colleagues will stick together on this side and insist that we have a chance to offer people's amendments. That is what we are discussing. We are not discussing anything else. There is no trickery. Let us express a view that maybe, if people listen to it, they will consider it and, if not, then we have the votes. They are the majority. They are going to get their way; we know that, but I do not think that is a good way to serve the public. 
   Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from Michigan, shall we switch sides?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are debating a proposition that I think probably lends some confusion to the recognition of what it is we are attempting to do. One can call it a lockbox, a safe deposit box; call it what you will. I say we want a lockbox, too, but we want a lockbox that is without holes, without rust, without a broken lock on it. We want a lockbox that is secure, that holds our valuables, and that no one can get their hands on, and that is the Social Security lockbox that cannot be used. 
   Our friends over there say they want to keep it from being a pot for people to reach into when they want to spend money. The fact of the matter is that they create a condition as a result of the structure of their bill, their proposal, that says that if the economy turns sour, in fact, perhaps this country could be put into default, unless Social Security is used, because of overarching criteria, then that is what is going to happen. Social Security will be that safe deposit box that is now open for other purposes in Government. 
   I hear the plea for letting the debate get started. But we have been waiting to hear from the majority leader--our leader and the majority leader; that is where these discussions take place--that he has a commitment that we can offer amendments. 
   We have a commitment from the Senator from Pennsylvania. He said he had no objection to our having amendments. But we haven't heard that from the top. 
   That is what we are asking for; that is what I tried to do with a unanimous consent agreement. 
   I said: OK. Let's talk about a dozen amendments that our two leaders can agree upon. Let's talk about that. Let's put that aside, and then we can end the debate. But they do not want to do that. 
   The majority has the upper hand. That is life in the Senate. They are not going to let us get our amendments up because--even though they say, yes, you will have all the amendments you want--the fact is there is a system here. Everybody in this Chamber knows there is a system. It is called the amendment tree. Once you fill it up with first-degree amendments followed by second-degree amendments, the majority leader always has the privilege of initial recognition, and you shut down the amendment possibilities. 
   Let's stop fooling each other. Let's stop trying to fool the people out there in the countryside. Do they want Medicare included as a security measure, as a safe deposit measure, as a lockbox measure? Ask them. Let's have a vote on that. Let's have it straight up or down. Do you want Medicare? 
   I heard a statement made today that, no, the Republicans don't want Medicare included. Let the public hear that. Let the public hear that the one measure for protecting health may not be of concern to them. It is fine with me. I just want to make sure the record is clear that people understand what we are saying. 
   Look at this. The Republican House committee proposes a tax cut of $1.19 trillion. In order to accomplish that, they are going to have to take $55 billion from the Social Security surplus and $964 billion from the onbudget surplus. 
   We are using arcane language to try to pull the wool over the people's eyes. 
   Say it straight. They on that side of the line don't want Medicare included. We want Medicare included on this side of the line. We want to lock up Social Security, and we all agree a lockbox is a desirable thing, a place where those funds are going to be protected. We are saying you can't touch the Social Security surplus. 
   Remember this: In 10 years, forecasts being as they are, we expect to have almost a $1 trillion surplus in non-Social Security funds. That is pretty astounding. Imagine, we could be out of public debt in 2015, barely 15 years from now--not only the public debt but anything. It would be an unheard of condition in terms of a major government around the world. The fact of the matter is it would be certainly a benchmark that people never thought would arrive. 
   We are trying to do it. We are saying we support a modest tax cut for those who really need it--a targeted tax cut for child care, savings accounts, and health care for the elderly. But friends over here want to use it to spread the tax cut around for all of the benefit. It would go largely to the wealthiest in the country. 
   I once again ask if we can get an agreement. It can be done away from the microphones or it can be done in front of the microphones. Give us the assurance that we can have amendments and not be barred by second-degree amendments and not barred by other parliamentary procedures. We would be happy to consider a different position, but we are not going to do it knowing full well that once we step over the line we are in a trap that is going to silence our voices in terms of any modifications. We are talking about just the motion to proceed. Just let us get started. 
   The fact of the matter is this amendment would be a substitute for an underlying bill. It would be the bill itself. We have to be on guard for the public  interest. That is where we are going to stand. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against cloture until we understand fully what this debate is about for the benefit of the public. 
   It has been suggested that we are filibustering it. We just had a major bill go through this Chamber yesterday, and we were allowed a limited number of amendments. In 3 days, we had 11 amendments that were considered. That was it. That was the most we could negotiate, instead of as it used to be with an open process. If it took a long time, it took a long time. 
   I remember working through the night until 6 in the morning. We don't do that anymore. We shut down nice and early so we are not too tired at the end of the day. 
   But I say the time is the property of the public. They let us use it. We ought to use it fully instead of shutting down the debate and shutting down the opportunity for the American people to understand what is really taking place. 
   It is tough. It is tough because the route that is being used is kind of inside-the-beltway stuff. 
   How much time remains on both sides?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I don't know why it is not clear, but we have said and we mean that Social Security funds, surpluses, are sacrosanct. They are untouchable. 
   The Medicare solvency we want to create comes out of the non-Social Security budget surplus. We have talked about this 60 times. Apparently the message has not gotten through. We want to do it. We want to deal with it. 
   By the admission of some on that side, Medicare isn't part of the thinking in this. If it is not part of the thinking now, I wonder when it will be. 
   There is also an opportunity, if I may suggest with a degree of temerity, that Social Security funds can be used in the name of Social Security reform. That is kind of a catch-all. It says if we can't get it one way, we will get it another way. We face the specter of a huge tax cut that is being proposed. It is not much different here from on the House side. We are talking about something close to $800 billion. 
   We understand each other very clearly. The question is, Does the public understand why we are? We want to save Social Security, and we want to save Medicare. We want to increase the solvency of Medicare, and we are committed to a reform of both programs. During that period, it is said by the President that we will extend the life of both of these programs even longer than the 50-some years for Social Security and the 20 years for Medicare. 
   That is where we are, my friends. 
   If we are ready to conclude the debate, I am prepared to yield back our time--if we are prepared.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the overwhelming recommendation by the House Republicans says use Social Security funds if necessary. 
   But there is an issue beyond that. It is quite apparent, if you use $792 billion for tax cuts, it reduces the possibility  that you can pay down the debt. That is where we would like to go. We want to get rid of this constant threat of higher interest rates. We want to be able to be free to take care of the needs we have to operate our society, our country. 
   There is no confusion about where we are. We want to protect Social Security. We want to protect Medicare out of non-Social Security surpluses. That is where we are. One ought not confuse it with discussions about other things: A, Do you want to protect Medicare? B, How? That is the question. That is what we would like to have answered. 
   I hope my colleagues will stick together and say we want to have an open debate, we want to continue to discuss the issues, and not to be shut down on this pretense that this cloture vote will take care of the problems. 
   The majority leader is on the floor. We all have great respect for him. We would love to be able to be assured of amendments. I know our leader has been interested in a discussion of that and is awaiting the majority leader's response. If we knew that, perhaps we could be reacting differently.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Captive Exotic Animal Protection Act, which would prohibit the barbaric and unsporting practice of ``canned hunts,'' or caged kills. I am pleased to be joined by my cosponsors Senators BOXER, DURBIN, FEINGOLD, FEINSTEIN, KENNEDY, KERRY, KOHL, MOYNIHAN, MURRAY, SCHUMER, and TORRICELLI. 
   A typical canned hunt operation collects surplus animals from wild animal parks, circuses, and even petting zoos, and then sells the right to brutally kill these animals to so-called ``hunters.'' In reality, no hunting, tracking or shooting skills are required. For a price, any ``hunter'' is guaranteed a kill of the exotic animal of his choice--one located by a guide and blocked from escape. A wild boar ``kill'' may sell for $250, a pygmy goat for $400, while a rare Arabian Ibex may fetch up to $5000. The actual ``hunt'' of these tame animals occurs within a fenced enclosure, leaving the animal virtually no chance for escape. Fed and cared for by humans, these animals often have lost their instinctual impulse to flee from the so-called hunters who ``stalk'' them. 
   The actual killing methods employed by these hunters only compound the cruelty of slaughtering these often trusting animals. In order to preserve the animal as a ``trophy,'' hunters will fire multiple shots into non-vital organs, condemning the animal to a slow and painful death. 
   Canned hunts are condemned by pro-animal and pro-hunting groups alike for being cruel and unethical. Many real hunters believe that canned hunts are unethical and make a mockery of their sport. For example, the Boone and Crockett Club, a hunting organization founded by Teddy Roosevelt, has called canned hunts ``unfair'' and ``unsportsmanlike.'' Bill Burton, the  former outdoors writer for the Baltimore Sun and a hunter, testifying in support of this legislation, stated, ``[t]here is a common belief that the hunting of creatures which have no reasonable avenue to escape is not up to traditional standards. Shooting game in confinement is not within these standards.'' 
   In addition to being unethical, these canned hunts present a serious health and safety problem for livestock and native wildlife. Accidental escapes of animals from exotic game ranches are not uncommon, posing a very real threat to nearby livestock and indigenous wildlife. John Talbott, acting director of the Wyoming Department of Fish and Game, has stated that, ``[t]uberculosis and other disease documented amount game ranch animals in surrounding states,'' pose ``an extremely serious threat to Wyoming's native big game.'' In recognition of this threat, Wyoming itself has banned canned hunting facilities, as have the States of California, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey, North Carolina, Rhode Island, and Wisconsin. Unfortunately, the remaining States lack legislation to outlaw canned hunts, and because interstate commerce in exotic animals is common, federal legislation is essential to control these cruel practices. 
   My bill is similar to legislation I introduced in the 105th Congress, S. 995. The legislation I am introducing today will specifically target only canned hunt facilities, and will not affect any animal industries, such as cattle ranchers, rodeos, livestock shows, petting zoos, horse and dog racing, or wildlife hunting. Furthermore, this bill will not apply to large hunting ranches, such as those over 1,000 acres, which give the hunted animal a greater opportunity to escape. This bill merely seeks to ban the transport and trade of non-native, exotic animals for the purpose of staged trophy hunts. 
   The idea of a defenseless animal meeting a violent end as the target of a canned hunt is, at the very least, distasteful to many of us. In an era when many of us are seeking to curb violence in our culture, canned hunts are certainly one form of gratuitous brutality that does not belong in our society. 
   I urge my colleagues who want to understand the cruelty involved in a canned hunt to visit my office and view a videotape of an actual canned hunt. You will witness a defenseless Corsican ram, cornered near a fence, being shot over and over again with arrows, clearly experiencing an agonizing death, only to be dealt a final blow by a firearm after needless suffering. 
   Please join me in support of this legislation which will help to put an end to this needless suffering.

<DOCNO>106-lautenberg-nj-2-19990701</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I yield myself such time as is necessary to make some remarks. 
   Mr. President, I say thank you to the distinguished Senator from North Dakota because he kind of hit the nail on the head. Let's get on with this debate. That is the question. And whether or not we disguise it in terms of votes to the public at large--and cloture votes and things of that nature may seem rather arcane to the public--the main thing is to get on with the discussion. 
   I am supporting the cloture vote on the motion to proceed to S. 557, which is the legislation to reform the budget rules governing emergency spending. I am going to support cloture on the motion to move ahead with this--we call it a motion to proceed--to get on with the debate, not only because I support the underlying legislation, which amends the rules governing emergency spending but, more importantly, because like most, if not all, Democrats, I strongly support the establishment of a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. It is time for a real debate to occur on a lockbox. And I look forward to that debate. 
   Democrats have long argued that protecting Social Security and Medicare should be Congress' top priority. We believe that strongly. We simply must prepare our country for the impending retirement of the baby boomers. We ought to do it now, particularly since we are going through this incredible prosperity, a prosperity never before seen in this country. 
   To help achieve that goal, Senator CONRAD and I proposed 
   our own version of a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. It is a lockbox that reserves the surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare--reserves them; you cannot touch them--without creating the threat of what is now proposed, which could be a Government-wide default.  Our lockbox has much stricter enforcement than the weak one that was approved by the House of Representatives. 
   Early this week, President Clinton also proposed to establish a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. His proposal not only would prevent Congress from spending Social Security surpluses in any year, but it would extend the solvency of the trust fund to the year 2053. 
   Although all of the details of the President's plan have not been worked out yet, I strongly support his general approach. I am hopeful it can win with bipartisan support. We would like to see it that way. 
   The distinguished Senator from Michigan, Senator ABRAHAM, and Senator DOMENICI have proposed a different version of a lockbox which has been offered as an amendment to the previous bill S. 557. Unfortunately, their lockbox is seriously openable. In fact, as Treasury Secretary Rubin has written, instead of protecting Social Security benefits, their lockbox actually would threaten benefits. That is because it could trigger a Government-wide default based on factors beyond Congress' control. 
   Such a default would make it impossible to pay Social Security benefits. They can call it what they will--lockbox, cash drawer, whatever--but it will still impair the possibility, at some point, to pay the Social Security benefits. The issue before the Senate today isn't whether we are for or against the Abraham-Domenici lockbox. It is not whether we are for or against the Democratic lockbox. The issue is whether we should proceed to a debate about lockbox legislation at all. I believe we should. It should be an open debate. Senators should have the right to offer amendments, but we should go ahead and get that debate underway. 
   In the past, the majority has tried to stifle that debate and to push through their own version of a lockbox without giving the Democrats and the American people an opportunity to present and to consider amendments. We Democrats have rightly resisted that. We cannot be gagged, and we will not be locked out of the legislative process, especially on an issue as important as protecting Social Security. 
   Having said that, nobody should doubt the commitment of Senate Democrats to support a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. I take a moment here to identify what a lockbox is to represent: a place you can't invade for any other reason except to make sure that Social Security is there for the longest period of time available for those who are paying into this system, the money to pay those benefits is going to be there. 
   Another major concern of the American public, the elderly public particularly, is Medicare. Will it run out of funds before the 50-year-old is there to have his or her health care protected? That is what we are debating. We ought not to be talking about process. We ought to be talking about what are the promises that we are trying to fulfill. 
   One is that Social Security will be there when you get there and you want it and you need it. Two is that Medicare is there to help protect the health of an aging population. 
   I expect there is going to be a very strong vote on this side of the aisle in support of moving to proceed to that debate. Unfortunately, what we have heard is that the majority will then file cloture on the bill itself. Another explanation. Cloture means to shut down the debate, not permit the Democrats to add amendments, not to permit the American public to hear the full discussion. That is the issue--continuing to block our ability to offer any open, new ideas to their original proposal. 
   Well, if that is true, it is outrageous. It is the kind of political game that has been played on this floor on this issue from day 1. Apparently the majority isn't as anxious to get a Social Security lockbox as they pretend to be. They just want to force the Democrats to cast votes against cloture, against continuing the debate, against permitting the debate. 
   Well, Democrats have to oppose cloture, if we are being blocked from offering amendments. That doesn't mean we are being obstructive. It doesn't mean we are filibustering the bill. We just have to protect our rights and the citizens' rights as we see them. 
   What the Republicans want to do is force us to cast these cloture votes and then claim that we are filibustering the lockbox. It is wrong, and they are aware of it. They want to shut us out of the debate. We represent a significant part of the American public. Whether they voted for us or they didn't, we represent them. 
   This isn't just playing politics. It is unfair, and it is especially unbecoming of a party that is in the majority and purportedly running Government. They should be spending their time getting legislation passed, not just forcing Democrats to walk the line, to cast votes that they can later misrepresent for political gain. 
   President Clinton has reached out his hand with a proposal that obviously lays the groundwork for a bipartisan deal. He is known to include Republicans in discussions about things. I serve on the Budget Committee. I am the senior Democrat. This is the third President with whom I have served. I have never seen a President more anxious to discuss his ideas on legislation with the other side than President Clinton. 
   He said he is willing to compromise on tax cuts. He said he wants to work with the Congress. What is the response from the majority? Partisan politics. You have to ask why. Do they really think it makes any difference whether there are five cloture votes instead of four? It is a mischaracterization. Who is trying to kid whom? This goes beyond petty. It really is unfair and pathetic. 
   I hope we are going to stop these political games. Then let us sit down on a bipartisan basis and do the work of the people. Let us develop a real lockbox that makes sense to both of us, a consensus view, and one that really protects Social Security and Medicare. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
   Mr. President, we are going through an exercise about what is being characterized by the Democrats and what is being characterized by the Republicans as an imperfect lockbox situation--a lockbox recommendation. 
   I want to try to get this debate on this subject itself instead of the process. The fact of the matter is that if we try to define what constitutes a lockbox--we heard the Senator from North Dakota earlier talking about his effort to identify a lockbox going back to 1982 or 1983, in that period. Lockbox terminology was used way before it was discussed on this floor. It is a common expression in terms of banking and financial programs. 
   What we are talking about, very simply, is whether or not we put enough money away to say to the American public, when it is your time to retire--talking to those who now are, let's 
   say, in their twenties, maybe in their teens--Social Security will be there for you when it is your time to use that benefit. 
   That is the discussion that goes on. 
   The other program--Medicare, which is directly linked to the Social Security program--health care for the elderly, for seniors, is the biggest worry among our population. People identify it as their concern about being locked out of health care--not knowing what conditions might arise that will absorb all of their savings, all of their resources. With the good science that has been developed over the years, we have had far better health than we thought we might have, looking back some years. 
   I know that when I was in the Army during World War II, I never dreamed that at this stage of my life I would be hard at work trying to do the things that I do, and feeling pretty good about it. I am glad to know there is a program out there for those who aren't physically able to deal with life's daily pressures, and when they run into medical problems, health care is going to be there. That is the way it ought to be. 
   With all of that, and all of the criticism of President Clinton, the fact is that he is the leader in the country who saw us stop the hemorrhaging of incredibly increasing debt that was falling upon not just the present generation but future generations. 
   I used to hear the cries: We are saddling our children and our grandchildren with debt. Now we want to pay it off. They say: Well, paying off debt, what does it mean? It means an awful lot. The fact of the matter is that it provides the kind of things that families try to provide; and that is security for the future--reserves--so that when you have something you either need or want, you have some means to do it. 
   That is what we are talking about here. We want to preserve, and we want to increase, the solvency of Medicare to make sure it is there for a longer period of time. We want to extend Medicare to 2025 and have Social Security retirement benefits available until 2053, with a pledge from the White House and from this President to try to reform the process to extend it even further. That is what we are discussing. 
   Despite the cries and the pleas--``to tell the truth,'' is what I heard. I don't usually use that kind of terminology, because not telling the truth suggests some kind of a character flaw. The truth in many times is as observed by the person speaking. But the real judgment comes from the others who hear it. The truth of the matter is that we are trying our darndest--each side of the aisle--in this particular construction of how they see us, we being able to provide the kind of security that our people want. We on this side of the aisle think it ought to be done by not only preserving all of the Social Security surpluses but by paying down the debt and increasing reserves available to put into that Social Security trust fund to extend it slightly even further. That is what we want to do. 
   All of the gimmicks that are used, all of the ploys that the majority has used characteristically to try to stop the Democrats from offering amendments, from making this debate available to the public--that is the way it goes. We have never seen the kind of a period where so many cloture votes are ordered at the same time that a bill is sent up to the desk to be considered. Almost immediately, in so many cases, it is followed by a cloture vote before there is any debate. The cries of a filibuster are hollow cries, because no filibuster has had a chance to get underway. There hasn't been any chance to talk at all. Shut it down. Use the cloture vote technique. 
   The public shouldn't perhaps be deceived by what they hear about how anxious the Republicans are to get on  with the work of the people when they refuse to allow reasonable debate on the subject. 
   There are ways to do it: Fill up the amendment tree, that stops it; invoke cloture, that stops it; or put in quorum calls, or have majority votes on things that stop the process. 
   The question is simply, Do we want to extend Social Security solvency? I think that answer has to be yes. Do we want to extend the Medicare solvency? I think that answer has to be yes. 
   Let the American people decide. When do they decide? They decide in November 2000 whether or not they prefer one method or the other. We ought to be plain spoken about what it is we are trying to do and not shut off the debate and not say that the Democrats could have offered amendments. They couldn't have, not at that time. They could have in due time--after everything was signed, sealed, and delivered. It is a backhanded way of operating. 
   I hope we will move on to the debate of the lockbox legislation. Let the public hear it. Take the time necessary to have a full airing. Let either side amend it and get on with serving the people's needs. 
   How much time remains on both sides?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. This amendment is being offered on behalf of myself, Senator BYRD, Senator HUTCHISON, Senator HOLLINGS, Senator JOHNSON, and Senator HARKIN. This amendment would require the drug czar's office to include messages in his current media campaign to discourage children from engaging in underage alcohol consumption. 
   Running ads on national TV espousing the evil of drug use without even mentioning alcohol sends the wrong message to America's children. It is the equivalent of telling kids, ``Say `no' to drugs, but this Bud's for you.'' 
   The fact is, consuming alcohol is illegal in all 50 States if you are under the age of 21. Among America's youth, underage alcohol consumption is just as big of a problem as drug use. 
   The facts are revealing. For those who are not aware of the danger, alcohol kills six times more children ages 12-20 than all other illegal drugs combined. It was a surprise to me, and I suspect it is a surprise to millions of other Americans. 
   Underage alcohol consumption and its devastating effects on children paint a daunting picture. According to the Department of Health and Human Services, the average age at which children start drinking is 13. Even worse, the research shows that children who drink at the age of 13 have a 47-percent chance of becoming alcohol-dependent; if they wait until they are 21 to begin drinking, they have only a 10-percent chance of becoming dependent. 
   In all, there are nearly 4 million young people in this country who suffer from alcohol dependence. They account for one-fifth of all alcohol-dependent Americans. 
   The bottom line is that we dare not turn a blind eye when an opportunity comes along to address this problem. The drug czar's media campaign is that opportunity. 
   Drug czar Gen. Barry McCaffrey has said:  
   [T]he most dangerous drug in America today is still alcohol.  
   Gen. McCaffrey has also said:  
   [Alcohol is] the biggest drug abuse problem for adolescents, and it's linked to the use of other, illegal drugs.  
   Statistics support what General McCaffrey has been saying. According to the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, young people who drink alcohol are 7.5 times more likely to use any illegal drug and 50 times more likely to use cocaine than young people who never drink alcohol. In other words, alcohol is a gateway drug. Too often it leads to the use of marijuana, cocaine, and heroin by children. Since that is true, including ads addressing underage alcohol consumption in the media campaign would benefit the campaign and increase its overall effectiveness. 
   In advocating for this amendment, our voices are not alone. Surgeon General David Satcher recently wrote a letter to General McCaffrey:  
   I want to recommend that you include advertisements addressing underage drinking in the paid portion of ONDCP's media campaign.  
   Surgeon General Satcher also stated:  
   It is time to more effectively address the drug that children and teens tell us is their greatest concern and the drug we know is most likely to result in their injury or death.  
   In addition to support from the Surgeon General, we have bipartisan support in the House. This same amendment was already added to the House version of the Treasury-Postal appropriations bill by Congresswoman ROYBAL-ALLARD from California and Congressman WOLF from Virginia. 
   Editorials have also been written across this country supporting our position. Editorials have appeared in the Washington Post, the New York Times, Christian Science Monitor, and the Los Angeles Times, among other newspapers. 
   This effort on behalf of our children is further supported by more than 80 organizations, including Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Public Health Association, the Center for Science in the Public Interest, and the Crime Prevention Council. 
   The Senate has not been silent on the issue of underage drinking in the past, and we should not stand mute now. We have made clear on at least three occasions that it is the law of the land to prohibit the use of alcohol by those under the age of 21. 
   I am proud to have been the author of the 1984 law that made 21 the drinking age in all 50 States. As a matter of fact, I had an argument with a couple of my children who were less than 21 at the time. We had a long discussion. They said it might cut into their fun, their proms. 
   But I looked at the statistics and saw how many lives we could save. In the almost 16 years that law has been on the books, we have saved 15,000 kids from dying on the highways. 
   Later, in 1995, Senator BYRD led the charge on ``zero tolerance'' for underage alcohol consumption by writing the law that says if you are under 21, a .02 blood-alcohol level is legally drunk. 
   Our amendment is not prescriptive. It would not tell the drug czar which types of alcohol ads or precisely how many alcohol ads would be run. But it would require the drug czar to include the underage alcohol consumption message in its media campaign. And it would give General McCaffrey the authority to do so, authority he has claimed he currently lacks. 
   We want to send a strong message to America's youth that neither underage alcohol consumption nor drug use is acceptable. We do not want to say there is a preference of one over the  other. We do not want to do that by being silent on alcohol. 
   Mr. President, the only successful path to winning the war on drugs is the one paved by preventing underage drinking. If we cannot muster the political will to tell our children that underage drinking is wrong, we will never win the war on drugs. 
   We must not accept underage drinking as a so-called rite of passage because it is a passage directly to illegal drugs such as marijuana, cocaine, and heroin; and it is a passage to a life of alcohol dependency. 
   What we have heard from colleagues who are not supporting us is that drugs are illegal. But so is drinking under the age of 21. 
   Tobacco is a legal product, but we have worked hard to try to stop young people from starting to smoke because we know eventually it often leads to respiratory failure, lung cancer, and other diseases, as well as premature death. 
   So I hope our colleagues will support this amendment. It is time to make young people aware of the facts. Underage drinking is not acceptable. It leads to addiction, and nothing is more painful to a parent than to see an addicted child. 
   We ought not to be deterred by any arguments that suggest that adding alcohol to the media campaign might detract from the message about drugs. What is the difference? Addiction is addiction is addiction. We do not want to lose our kids. We do not want them to lose control, and we do not want them to lose their lives. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I require to respond to my friend from Colorado. 
   He talks, as he said, with experience, having seen alcohol addiction and the devastation it inflicts. But I want to respond specifically to the question the Senator from Colorado raises about dilution of message. We think that when a campaign is directed toward young people and it says ``Say no to drugs,'' the omission of alcohol sends the wrong message. That's like saying, ``Drugs are bad for you, but alcohol is not so bad.'' 
   So when we look at the statistics, and we see alcohol kills six times as many young people ages 12 to 20 than all of the illegal drugs combined, that tells us that the media campaign cannot deliver a thorough message unless it includes alcohol. Without including alcohol, the media campaign is a mere wink at underage drinking. 
   The drug czar is going to have $1 billion, we hope, over the next 5 years to deliver a message. Mr. President, $1 billion is a lot of money. So if the media campaign says ``Say no to drugs,'' and it also says ``Say no to alcohol,'' I see nothing wrong with that. And if there are ads portraying the horrific things that illegal drugs can do to kids, there should be ads portraying the same horrific things that alcohol can do to kids. 
   With the budget surpluses we have, we will keep on looking for additional funding for this campaign. One of the things that touches everybody in this Chamber, regardless of party, is interest in children, interest in protecting them from violence, interest in protecting them from disease, and interest in protecting them from addiction. So I think it is quite appropriate we combine the message on addiction to include all of the products that would be addictive, including alcohol. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   When you see the devastation of alcohol, you do not understand why it is a different class addiction than that which is drugs. It is easier to get into. It is less stigmatic. People do not say: Oh, look, he's an alcoholic.  
   A friend of mine has a granddaughter, 14 years old--14 years old--who started sniffing glue, drank alcohol. Now it is drugs. She is in an institution. It is the most heartbreaking thing one can imagine.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think that we can move to conclude this debate. I will take just a couple of minutes. Unless there are further Members who want to speak, I will then yield back the time. 
   This is one of those debates that I really do not enjoy because the friends who are opposing this are not people who are against what we want to do. They are not against eliminating underage drinking--not at all. What we are arguing about is somewhat about process. 
   Frankly, though, we are on the same side of the issue. But I see them as having an argument that I can't buy, and I don't think the American people will buy. We are saying let's preserve as much of the $1 billion that we have to fight drugs through the media campaign, plus all of the other money spent on fighting drugs, even though we are not doing it quite successfully. 
   But we ought to be looking more critically at how we deal with the drug problem. We are building more jails. We are penalizing those in institutions and jails, or in other facilities of incarceration, who are not drug addicts. We are spending billions of dollars. And we don't put alcoholics in jail. We don't punish them. We don't stigmatize them the same way we do drug users. 
   But I point out that alcohol kills six times more children ages 12 to 20 than all other illegal drugs combined. 
   What does that say? Does that say that the children who die from alcohol are worth less to us as a society than those who die from illegal drugs? I don't think that is the message that we want to convey. 
   There is a $1 billion anti-drug media campaign. That $1 billion, in light of this surplus, could grow. But because the drug czar does not even have the authority, he cannot issue messages about underage drinking. There is something wrong with that. Why can't an ad that shows a picture of a degenerated adult brain from drug use say that also happens from alcohol? 
   In many cases, we see violence from alcohol that does not always kill. But it enrages people and causes fights. Alcohol is the product largely responsible for spousal abuse and internal family fights. Alcohol does it every time. 
   We have 4 million alcoholics between the ages of 13 and 20--4 million. That is a lot of young people. Yet, we are not waging the same war against alcohol as we are against drugs. 
   By the way, in the message that we heard from the distinguished senior Senator from Kentucky, he mentioned outstanding citizens, Jim Burke and Mario Cuomo, as people who are on the other side. But that doesn't mean that they are right in this fight. I disagree with them and have great respect for both of them. I know them personally. 
   The fact of the matter is, when we don't mention that alcohol is a scourge, as are illegal drugs, then it is assumed to be by young people something not so bad. We know it is terrible: Six times more fatal to young people than all of the illegal drugs combined. 
   What keeps the message from getting out there? I don't know that there is anybody lobbying for illegal drugs. But I know that there are people lobbying to keep this anti-alcohol message away from children. When I see the Budweiser lizards talking on television, it is a pretty attractive picture. But it is not a lot different from Joe Camel attracting kids to smoking. Young people laugh. They like those commercials. I know it goes right from the television into young people's minds. 
   Those commercials make people think, ``Beer is cool.'' But it is not cool when it is a 13-, 14-, or 15-year-old kid. As they say, a child who starts drinking at age 13 has a 47-percent chance of becoming an alcoholic. Those who wait  until age 21 have only a 10-percent chance. 
   Why don't we respond to this epidemic? We can talk about programs that can make a difference, but we are not. But we are spending $1 billion on an anti-drug campaign. Yes, there has been a cutback, but I see that being restored. If those funds grow, the drug czar can't add alcohol to the campaign, because he doesn't have the authority. This amendment gives him the authority. It doesn't tell him how to do it. It says tell young people out there, you hurt your brain, you hurt your family, you hurt your society, and you hurt yourself if you use alcohol. 
   The law is age 21. I wrote that law against terrific opposition in 1984. It was a Republican President. President Reagan was President, and Elizabeth Dole was the then-Secretary of Transportation. We worked together to get it done because they saw alcohol as a scourge. 
   I hope we are not put off by the argument that you can't do two things at the same time: ``No to drugs'' on one side of the screen; ``no to alcohol'' on the other side of the screen. I don't think that hurts anybody, and it could help somebody. That is the issue. 
   I hate to disagree with some of my friends who have taken the other side. I know they feel the problem deeply. I think they have chosen to dismiss an opportunity that I think is the only one that exists for us. We will not have an anti-alcohol program. Can you see trying to get that through this place with all of the friends of the alcohol industry? There is not a chance. 
   This is the time to do it. We ought to step up and vote the right way. Give the drug czar an opportunity to say no to alcohol, as well as to drugs.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, New York state legislature exempted New York state residents from paying the New York City commuter tax. But out-of-state residents--including people who live in New Jersey--are not exempt. They're supposed to keep paying the tax. 
   Commuting between states is an inescapable reality of modern life. As our population grows, the physical boundaries that used to divide one city from another are breaking down. 
   More and more everyday, our country is becoming a collection of regions. And that's especially true on the east coast, where urban populations are already closer together than they are anywhere else.  
   Should we punish people for this? Is it fair to single people out for harsher tax treatment just because they live in one state and work in another? Of course not. It's economic discrimination. And even worse, it's unconstitutional. 
   It's especially unfair in the case of New Jersey residents who work in New York City. Those people work hard. And their work brings real, tangible benefits to New York--benefits that translate into a stronger economy for New York City and the rest of the state. 
   New York needs those commuters. But that fact seems to escape the state's lawmakers. Their message to New Jersey residents is this--``You're second-class citizens. You don't live on our side of the state line, so you don't count.'' 
   In 1996 alone, nearly 240,000 New Jersey residents paid $75 million in commuter taxes to New York. I'm sure they didn't like paying it, but at least in 1996 the tax was applied with a sense of fair play. Not anymore. Those commuters are plenty mad. And who can blame them? 
   Commuting to work is a necessity for millions of people. Often, it's an economic necessity. Or a desire to be close to family members. 
   When you tax people just for driving across state lines to work, you're essentially telling them they shouldn't have a choice about where they live. 
   That is wrong, Mr. President. I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. The Senator is aware, I am sure, that I had the privilege of authoring the domestic violence prohibition for guns to be available to those who had been convicted of misdemeanors, in marital and home disputes. Over 13,000 gun permits have been denied under the law that I authored at the end of 1996, which kept those people from being able to buy guns. I don't know if the Senator is aware of the extent of that number, but it is 13,000. 
   The fact of the matter is that, in conjunction with that, we know that roughly 150,000 times a year a gun is put to a woman's head in front of her children, or in the privacy of a discussion between the two of them, and the threat is made: I will blow your head off. 
   Is the Senator aware of the fact that there are forces at play here that refuse to permit us to have sensible gun violence control? I didn't say gun control; I said gun violence control.

   What will it take, in the Senator's mind, to finally say to the American public that we get your message? We understand that you want to protect your children. And while people have the right to bear arms, people have the right to bear children and send them to school hoping and believing that they are going to get home safely. When, I ask the Senator, does he think that message will get through these, I will call them ``hollow halls,'' so that people will believe that they can send their children or their loved ones to the workplace or to school or to the streets without being gunned down by someone who shouldn't have a gun?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I would like to thank Senator MCCONNELL and Senator LEAHY for including my amendment No. 1146 in the managers' package. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment to ensure U.S. aid does not go to countries or regions or communities in the former Yugoslavia which continue to harbor indicted war criminals. 
   This amendment would improve language we adopted last year with a clearer provision covering all of the former Yugoslavia. 
   Mr. President, we have seen terrible atrocities committed in Croatia, in Bosnia, and most recently in Kosovo. 
   The International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia has publicly indicted 89 persons for war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide. There are almost certainly more indictments which remain sealed. Ongoing investigations in Bosnia and now in Kosovo will surely lead to more indictments. 
   However, the justice of the War Crimes Tribunal relies on the governments of countries in the region to apprehend indicted war criminals and transfer them to The Hague to stand trial. 
   Because the Republika Srpska authorities failed to fulfill their responsibilities, United States and other NATO armed forces in the United Nations-authorized peacekeeping force in Bosnia have arrested 7 war criminals. However, 36 publicly indicted war criminals remain at large. 
   Mr. President, our aid programs provide important leverage to motivate governments in the former Yugoslavia to stop harboring war criminals and start arresting them. 
   United States policy linking aid to cooperation with the war crimes tribunal is clear. 
   Indeed, a few years ago, Secretary Albright said the following in her remarks at the Tribunal:  
   ......The United States has made full cooperation with the War Crimes Tribunal, especially the transfer of indictees to The Hague, a prerequisite for U.S. assistance, our support for assistance by others, and our backing for membership in international institutions.  
   Unfortunately, the administration has resisted putting this policy into practice. Indeed, Secretary Albright has issued broad waivers of the provision included in the fiscal year 1998 and 1999 appropriations bills. The United States now provides aid to the city of Prijedor which hosts no fewer than 8 indicted war criminals. 
   Just this month Secretary Albright signed another waiver to provide $10 million in budget support to the Republika Srpska Government--the very Government which includes the Bosnian Serb police force which should be carrying out arrest warrants and is not. 
   Mr. President, ever more atrocities committed by Serbian police and paramilitary forces in Kosovo are coming to light: executions, torture, rape, burning of homes, expulsions on a massive scale. 
   We must now send a strong signal that we are determined to see the perpetrators of these crimes face justice. We must end our support for so-called moderates in Republika Srpska until and unless they fulfill their obligations to arrest war criminals and cooperate with the War Crimes Tribunal. 
   The Amendment I am offering today clearly states the policy of the United States ``to use bilateral and multilateral assistance to promote peace and respect for internationally recognized human rights by encouraging countries, entities, and communities in the territory of the former Yugoslavia,'' among other things ``by apprehending publicly indicted war criminals and transferring custody of those individuals to the Tribunal to stand trial.'' 
   The amendment sets out mechanisms to ensure that U.S. and multilateral aid will go to areas like the Bosnian Federation, where no war criminals remain at large, while prohibiting aid to authorities and areas that harbor war criminals. 
   Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to join me in this effort to ensure that the perpetrators of horrible crimes in Croatia, Bosnia, and Kosovo will ultimately face justice. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to Sister Jane Francis Brady, who is retiring after 30 years at St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey. For 27 of those years, Sister Jane served as the hospital's President and Chief Executive Officer. This not only is a well-deserved public tribute, but also a very personal tribute. Paterson is my hometown, and St. Joseph's Hospital has been an institution both literally and figuratively for generations of Paterson families, including my own. To thousands of people in New Jersey and the region, she is ``Sister Jane'' and the hospital is ``St. Joe's.'' They are a union that has put quality and hope into so many lives. 
   For many people in the Paterson area, Sister Jane has been the soul, the spirit and the face of healthcare. I have been privileged to work with her on a number of projects that have expanded St. Joe's to meet the continually growing needs of the surrounding community. Under Sister Jane's stewardship, St. Joseph's Hospital has become a focus of wellness care and training--the source for preventive, primary and emergency health services, and for more general education and counseling. 
   Sister Jane's curriculum vitae is stellar. She has held the highest advisory positions on healthcare, serving as Vice-Chair of the New Jersey Commission on Legal and Ethical Problems in the Delivery of Health Care; on New Jersey's Health Care Administration Board; on the SEEDCO Board of Trustees of New York; on the Leadership Task Force on Health Policy Reform of the Catholic Health Association of the United States; and on the Board of Trustees of the Catholic Health Association of the U.S. 
   She has been recognized for her contributions by numerous organizations, receiving, among others, the Paterson Community Service Award; the Citation of Merit from the NJ Association of Nonprofit Homes for the Aging; the Paterson Community Support Fund Humanitarian Award; ``Woman of the Year'' awards from the American Legion, the Paterson Boys and Girls Club, the NJ State Organization of Cystic Fibrosis, the American Cancer Society, and Passaic County Community College; the Felician College Founders Day Award; the Paterson Historic Preservation Commission's Heritage Award; and the Palestinian Heritage Foundation Humanitarian Award. 
   Sister Jane's retirement presents a huge challenge. We have the legacy of her intellect and passion; we have the solid foundation of her three decades of guidance; we have her enduring vision; but we will need an extraordinary talent to fill the void she leaves. 
   The best tribute we can give, the tribute we owe to Sister Jane, is the promise and commitment to find the best way to give the best healthcare to the most people. That was what she did. That was her gift of faith and strength.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to designate the Lower Delaware River as a National Wild and Scenic River. I am pleased to be joined by Senators TORRICELLI and SANTORUM in sponsoring this legislation. 
   Under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, designation as a Wild and Scenic River is reserved for free flowing rivers with at least one ``outstandingly remarkable'' resource value such as exceptional scenery, recreational opportunities, fisheries and wildlife, historic site, or cultural resources. Mr. President, the Lower Delaware River has several ``outstandingly remarkable'' resources of national significance and will make a fine addition to the National Wild and Scenic River System. 
   Henry Hudson called the Delaware River ``one of the best, finest, and pleasantest rivers of the world.'' The river begins in the Catskill Mountains and flows south some 300 miles through forested mountains, farmlands, historic towns, suburban and urban communities, industrial complexes and extensive wetlands as it nears the Atlantic Ocean. Although it is one of the largest rivers in the densely populated Northeast, the river retains much of its natural beauty. Woodlands still cover many of the river's islands, the coast's steeply sloping hills and cliffs, and much of its floodplain along both sides of the river. Threatened and endangered species, such as bald eagles and peregrine falcons, are found in forests within the river's watershed and rare fish species like striped bass, shortnose sturgeon and Atlantic sturgeon are found in its waters. 
   The Lower Delaware is the natural boundary between New Jersey and Pennsylvania and this magnificent part of the river flows through rolling hills, broad valleys, and cliffs carved and shaped by the river's floods. On these cliffs are a startling variety of plant life. Cactus are found on the cliff shelves on the south-facing New Jersey side of the river, while shelves on the north-facing Pennsylvania side support arctic-alpine plants. The Nature Conservancy has identified over forty ``critical habitats'' along the river corridor. 
   The Lower Delaware is also rich in cultural history. The river corridor contains 29 national historic districts and eight national historic landmarks. On Christmas Day in 1776, George Washington crossed the Lower Delaware with his rag-tag Continental Army at present-day Washington Crossing State Park, New Jersey, on his way to a victory over the British and their Hessian mercenaries near Trenton, New Jersey. Villages founded at 18th and 19th century crossroads are located on both sides of the Lower Delaware. Historic canals such as the Delaware and Raritan Canal and the Delaware Canal still parallel portions of the river, and their surviving towpaths provide hiking and bicycling opportunities. 
   The Delaware Valley hosts a population of more than 5 million people and the river is within close proximity to major population centers. This proximity provides recreational opportunities for thousands of individuals who use the Lower Delaware for canoeing, kayaking, tubing, birdwatching and fishing. 
   In 1978, both the Upper Delaware and the Middle Delaware River portions were designated as Wild and Scenic Rivers. Upon the designation of the Lower Delaware, the entire length of the Delaware River from Trenton north, with the exception of a few short sections, would have national designation as a Wild and Scenic River, while the portion of the river from Trenton south is already included in the National Estuary Program. Designation of the Lower Delaware would make the Delaware River the only river system in the eastern United States to have this distinctive status. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, I just wanted to note that designation of a river as Wild and Scenic does not mean that private lands will suddenly be open to public access. Nor does it mean that existing uses of private property will be restricted. Designated rivers do receive permanent protection from federally licensed or assisted dams and other water resource projects that would have direct and adverse effects on the river's free-flowing condition or ``outstandingly remarkable'' resources. A major factor in determining suitability for designation as a Wild and Scenic River is whether or not there is strong support for designation among the localities that border the river. In fact, the Department of the Interior will support designation of a river as Wild and Scenic only if the localities that adjoin the eligible river pass resolutions in support of designation of  their individual segments as Wild and Scenic. 
   Although designation has received overwhelming support from the great majority of the localities along the river, a handful of localities in Pennsylvania and New Jersey did not pass the necessary resolutions supporting the designation of their river segments as Wild and Scenic. Therefore, although the river segments adjoining these townships are eligible for designation in the future, the legislation that I propose would not designate these river segments as Wild and Scenic River segments under the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act. 
   Organizations that support designation of this part of the Lower Delaware River as Wild and Scenic include: The Heritage Conservancy, American Rivers, the Delaware River Greenway Partnership, Central Bucks Chamber of Commerce, Lehigh Valley Planning Commission, Tinicum Conservancy, Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Delaware River Mill Society and the Delaware and Raritan Canal Commission. Many individuals have worked hard to ensure that designation of this portion of the river becomes a reality including William Sharp of the National Park Service, the members of the Lower Delaware River Wild and Scenic Management Committee and the Lower Delaware Advisory Committee including New Jersey residents Richard Albert, Jim Amon, Maya Vanrossum, Thomas Dallessio, Linda Mead, Christian R. Nielson, Tisha Petrushka, Joseph M. Pylka, Chris Robert, William Rockafellow, Jean Shaddow, Robert Stokes, Caroline Armstrong, Ron Tindall, Celeste Tracy, Pamela Vinicombe, Lori Hixon, Kenneth G. Zinis, Dan Longhi, Patricia McIlvaine, and John Brunner. 
   I invite my colleagues to join me in support of this legislation to recognize the recreational, scenic and cultural resources of national significance that the Lower Delaware River has to offer both to the citizens of New Jersey and the nation.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the ladies of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated Beta Alpha Omega Chapter, commemorating 65 years of service to the people of Newark. 
   Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority Incorporated was founded in 1908 at Howard University by 16 dynamic women. It is the oldest and largest Greek-letter sorority established by and for African-American women. Today, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority is an international network of professional women, with over 150,000 members and 900 chapters located in the United States, West Africa, Bahamas, the Virgin Islands, and Europe. 
   The ladies of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority have dedicated themselves to the spirit behind their motto ``service to all mankind.'' After 91 years of service to the community, they continue to send college-trained women into the world to improve the social and economic conditions throughout the Unites States and abroad. 
   Beta Alpha Omega became an affiliate chapter in January of 1934 and now holds the honor of being New Jersey's oldest affiliate chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority. The women of the Beta Alpha Omega Chapter have contributed immeasurably to the city of Newark and its surrounding areas. In 1998 alone, the chapter awarded $15,000 in scholarships to graduating seniors from high schools in Newark and Irvington; co-sponsored the Kwanza Celebration at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center; sponsored continuous voter registration events and provided ``Share Baskets'' for the needy at Thanksgiving. 
   The theme for the chapter over the next four years will be ``Blazing New Trails'' in the 21st century. This initiative will focus the chapter's community efforts on improving programs in the arts, education, health and economic empowerment, as well as in strengthening the African-American family. 
   The women of Beta Alpha Omega have faithfully served the people of Newark and its surrounding areas for over six decades. Their ability to respond to the challenges of our society is demonstrated through their active service in outreach programs. Moreover, these women represent an integral part of American history. As stated by the sorority's historian, Marjorie Parker: ``History is of small worth unless its gifts nourish the seeds from which tomorrow's great achievements blossom.'' The women of Beta Alpha Omega are the seed of hope for the next generation of African-American women.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as you know, this will be my last term in the Senate. My 17 years here have been exciting and challenging. And I'd like to think my work here has made a real difference in giving Americans a healthier, safer country. 
   But I have not done it alone. I had a lot of help from a very dedicated staff. And one staffer in particular deserves special recognition for her outstanding leadership and her commitment to the causes that have defined my career in the Senate. 
   That staffer is Eve Lubalin, my chief of staff, who recently announced her retirement after 17 years with my office. 
   Eve joined my staff as legislative director in 1983, when I was just getting to know my way around the Senate. From the start, she impressed me with her intelligence, her vision and her wit. She never lost sight of the goals that I set, and she never failed to deliver 100 percent of her talent and her energy to accomplish those goals. 
   In 1986, I promoted her to chief of staff. She has been our team leader ever since. And somehow, even with all the hours she has put in on the job, and there were countless hours, she has managed to maintain a full healthy relationship with her husband, Jim, and their daughter, Kendra. And I know she looks forward to spending more time with them during the years ahead. 
   Eve's high standards made her a star in the academic world even before she came to work for me. In 1966, she graduated summa cum laude from Syracuse University. From there, she went on to obtain a master's degree from the University of Virginia and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Johns Hopkins. She later worked in several key staff positions for Senator Birch Bayh from Indiana. After her tenure in Senator Bayh's office, she also worked as an advocate for the city of New York on legislative issues. 
   When she arrived in my office, Eve made my priorities her priorities. And we scored some significant victories together. The laws I authored raising the national drinking age to 21, banning smoking on domestic airplane flights, cleaning up the environment--these were battles we fought together. I could not have asked for a more loyal comrade-in-arms than Eve Lubalin. 
   Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing Eve the very best as she moves on from the Senate. And I want Eve to always remember how much I and everyone connected with my office appreciates her contributions. She is a model public servant, a spectacular leader and person. I wish her a happy and rewarding retirement.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I listened carefully to my friend and colleague from Michigan. I am inclined to agree with him on a couple of things; that is, that people really want their Social Security protected. That is what they are thinking about. That is what they are looking at. 
   I rise now to oppose the motion to invoke cloture on the House-passed Social Security bill lockbox legislation, because it doesn't protect Social Security as it is commonly believed. 
   I want the public to know that this isn't an internal debate about some arcane process. We are talking about whether or not Social Security is going to be stronger as a result of this tactical approach to preparing perhaps for a nice tax cut in the future. 
   When we talk about the filibuster, sometimes the public doesn't quite understand. A filibuster can be an appropriate delay. If I think something is wrong, if someone on the other side of the aisle thinks something is wrong, they have a right to defend their point of view standing on this floor for as long as they have the energy and the time is available. So cloture isn't a simple thing. It is designed to cut off other people's opinion. It is designed to give the majority a chance to roll over the minority and perhaps what the public really wants. 
   I want to say right from the beginning that I strongly support enactment of a Social Security lockbox. In fact, we want to pass a lockbox that not only protects Social Security, but for many people, while they worry about Social Security, Medicare, which is high on their list of concerns because Social Security will be there but Medicare, conceivably if it is not 
   protected and made more solvent, may not be there. 
   Ask anybody what their primary concerns are once they get past their Medicare family needs, and they will tell you that it is health care. There is a crying need for reliability in health care systems across this country. People are worried that they will lose out in one place and not be able to get it in another place. They are worried about having a condition where that is ruled out for them--a long-term disease. 
   Medicare has to be protected as well. We want a lockbox that has an impenetrable lock, not one that includes all kinds of loopholes that will leave these  programs largely unprotected. That is the thing we have to keep in mind; that is, what is the ultimate outcome? 
   The bill before us now is an improvement over the version that we considered yesterday. But unlike that legislation, the one that was considered yesterday, the House-passed bill, does not pose a risk of Government default. So there is a slight measure of more security there. Therefore, it doesn't pose the same kind of threat to Social Security benefits. However, the House-passed bill still desperately needs improvement. Most importantly, the bill's lack of protection for Medicare is a primary part. 
   In addition, the bill lacks an adequate enforcement mechanism. It relies solely on 60-vote points of order. 
   Again, I don't like to get into process discussions when the public has a chance to evaluate. Why should there be 60 votes necessary to change it? In almost every other situation we rely on the majority to take care of it with 51 votes. It doesn't back up these 60-vote points of order, across-the-board spending cuts should Congress raid these surpluses in the future. 
   In addition, the legislation before us includes a troubling loophole that would allow Congress to raid surpluses by simply designating legislation as ``Social Security reform'' or ``Medicare reform.'' But it is not what you really get when you look at the title of these programs, because under Social Security reform it is conceivable that some could favor a major tax cut for wealthy people, and say: Listen. They are going to be paying more into the fund as a result of earning more as a result of a more buoyant economy. They could say that is Social Security reform. But, aha, really what we want to do is give a good fat tax cut to people who do not need it. 
   There is no definition of what constitutes Social Security or Medicare reform. We want to do that. But this obscure definition permits hanky-panky all over the place. 
   This could allow Congress to raid surpluses for new privatization schemes, no matter how risky, or even tax cuts--big tax cuts. 
   Democrats want to strengthen this bill to make it better. But we are being denied an opportunity in the process by the majority. 
   They are saying that 45 Democrats representing any number of States, any number of people--if we just take the States of California and New York, we have a significant part of the population in this country. 
   However, the majority is saying: We will not let you offer any amendments; we have decided we have the majority, and we are locking you out. That is the real lockbox. 
   It is not right. That is not the proper way to operate. It is not the way the Senate is supposed to function--not permit the offering of amendments? What are they afraid of? Let the public hear the debate. Let the public look at the amendments. Maybe we will help them pass a bill we also can agree to. Right now, they are afraid to let the public in. The public doesn't have a right to know, as far as they are concerned. 
   For too long now, the majority has engaged in a concerted effort to deny rights to Democratic Senators. They have repeatedly tried to eliminate our rights. The once rare tactic of filling up the amendment tree--again, another arcane term that blocks out any other amendments--has now become standard operating procedure. 
   The majority thinks they have a right to dictate how many and which amendments. They are asking to see our amendments before we can offer them. That is unheard of in the process as structured in the Senate. 
   Compounding matters, cloture is no longer being used as a tool to end debate. It is being used as a tool to prevent debate. The majority leader, in his technical right, has filed a cloture motion on this bill before either side even has an opportunity to make an opening statement. That, too, is unheard of. We used to have debate, and one side or the other would finally say: Listen, they are delaying; they are filibustering, and we want to shut off debate. 
   Now what happens, as soon as the bill is filed, a cloture motion is filed that says the minority or those who are in opposition will not even have a right to speak. 
   The majority is even going further in limiting the period known as morning business, when we can talk about things that are on our agenda. Eliminate that right? 
   I hope the American public will understand what this mission is; that is, not to give the public what they want but to give them what the Republicans want. 
   This effort to restrict minority rights is not appropriate. It is not the way the Senate is supposed to operate. We Democrats are not going to put up with it much longer. There is no reason this Senate cannot approve a Social Security and Medicare lockbox and do it very soon. We are willing to work toward a unanimous consent agreement to limit amendments. Debate on these amendments should not take very long. 
   However, we cannot accept being entirely locked out of the legislative process. We will not tolerate being denied an opportunity to make this Social Security lockbox truly a lockbox, a safe deposit box, one that can't be opened casually, that protects both Social Security and Medicare in a meaningful way. 
   The majority understands, if they continue to function this way, we will not get a Social Security and Medicare lockbox enacted into law. It is as simple as that. Perhaps they don't want to live under this lockbox but would like to talk about it, hoping they do not have to pass the test of reality. Maybe they just want an issue to talk 
   about. That is why they are following procedures guaranteed to produce gridlock and not results. I hope that is not true. 
   I look at actions. I see them speaking louder than words. There is every indication the Republican leadership is not trying seriously to produce a bill that can win bipartisan support. 
   I call on my colleagues to oppose cloture, to oppose cutting off debate. I urge my colleagues in the majority to change their mind, rethink it, talk to this side about it, allow this bill to be considered privately or openly, with a full opportunity for debate and for amendments. 
   How much time do I have remaining?

What are they talking about when they say you can offer amendments, when they closed it? They know very well. This chicanery should not get past the public, I will tell you that. 
   Why should we not spend a little time? Filibuster? We have a half-hour available. I want the American public to know they think that is enough time to discuss Social Security and Medicare. That is what the public has to know. Not cut off the filibuster--what kind of filibuster is this? That is not even an pinkie-size filibuster.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. In the final minutes of the debate, I hope we can clear the air so that everybody understands what we are talking about. 
   There are these kinds of random accusations about demagoguing this issue, et cetera. We are not demagoguing the issue. It is very simple. We ought to be able to discuss it on the floor of the Senate without having the amendment tree filled up so you can't offer amendments, without having cloture offered the minute the bill is introduced, so that there is a lame suggestion there is a filibuster going on when there is no time, 1 hour equally divided--that is a filibuster? That is not a man-size filibuster at all. We have had filibusters that have taken 20 hours. So that is not a filibuster. It is all an excuse to lock out other opinion, controverting what is being presented to us. 
   Yesterday our good friend from Michigan said that we refused to let that bill go forward, that the Secretary of the Treasury said that we could go into default. That is what he said. We hear these descriptions that are ignored on the other side. We heard our friend from Illinois say that Social Security has these meaningless instruments to protect the trust fund. Meaningless? All they have is the full faith and credit of the United States. If any of you have any money, it says on there ``full faith and credit,'' consider it meaningless, even if you have a lot of it. 
   This is a nonsense kind of discussion. What they are saying is there is nothing to increase Social Security's solvency being offered. Whatever surplus there is in Social Security stays with Social Security. We agree with that. 
   We want to take the non-Social Security surplus and use 40 percent of that to preserve Medicare. That is what we want to do. Our friends do not want to let us do that. They do not want to have the debate, and they do not want the American public to have their Medicare protected. 
   That is not where they are; they are at protecting it for tax cuts or other uses they find appropriate, not for what the American people want. 
   I assume that we are out of time, Mr. President?

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to two very close friends, Henry and Marilyn Taub in honor of the June 15, 1999 dedication of the Henry and Marilyn Taub Science and Technology Center Faculty of Computer Science. This state-of-the-art facility, located at the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, Israel, will be one of the largest computer science facilities in the world. It is only the most recent example of the Taubs' contributions to education. They have had a long history of philanthropic activity. 
   As Henry Taub's long-time business associate, I witnessed the Taubs' extraordinary commitment to the Technion. They established both the Taub Loan Fund, which aids faculty members in the Electrical Engineering and Computer Science Faculties, as well as the Henry Taub Prize for excellence in research. And their support helped the Institute establish the Morris and Sylvia Taub Computer Center. These outstanding contributions to Israel's top technology institution are but one example of the Taubs' commitment to Israel's strength and independence through science and learning. 
   They have helped students keep pace with technological advances in this century and have helped make Technion one of the leading technology centers for the next century. 
   It has been one of my life's most rewarding experiences to have worked with Henry and his brother Joseph. We shared successes together but more significantly, a commitment to a strengthened Israel and world wide Jewish community. 
   I am honored by my friendship with Henry and Marilyn Taub. The course of my life was heavily influenced by my association with the Taubs and I am grateful for the example that Henry provided for all of us who know him. 
   His activities serve as an outstanding model of how to respond to success available, to those who will work for it, in this blessed America. 
   I ask my colleagues to join me in paying tribute to this thoughtful, selfless couple for the excellent work they have done to improve life in America and Israel.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I have a piece of legislation which I rise to introduce. This legislation is designed to protect a segment of our population that can't protect itself. I am talking about pets--dogs, cats, and others that travel by air. I want to put this into perspective. Over 70 million households in America have pets--70 million. So it affects a significant portion of our population. Pets become family members and they become a source of significant affection and attachment. In some cases, they are the vision for those who are sightless. They establish precious relationships. 
   Over the last 5 years, there have been over 2,500 documented instances of dogs and cats experiencing severe injury in air travel, and 108 cats and dogs have died just as a result of exposure to excessive temperatures. 
   Pets aren't baggage. They are part of a family, in many instances, and they ought to be treated that way when they accompany their masters when they fly. Over 500,000 pets a year are transported by air across this country. News reports have detailed stories of pets being left out on hot days, sitting on tarmacs while flights were delayed, or stuffed into cargo holds with little or no airflow, causing them to injure themselves in the desperation to escape this entrapment and very difficult environment. 
   Some pets have actually had heavy baggage placed directly on top of their carriers. It is unacceptable. We can and must prevent these inhumane practices. 
   So today I am introducing The Safe Air Travel for Animals Act. This bill responds to the tragic stories we have heard involving the death or injury of many beloved pets while traveling by airplane. 
   The legislation has three goals. First, it ensures that airlines are held accountable for mistreatment of our pets, to ensure that animals are not treated like a set of golf clubs or other baggage. This legislation will put airlines on a tight leash. 
   Second, the bill provides consumers with the right to know if an airline has a record of mistreatment or accidents with pets. 
   Third, the bill addresses the problems of the aircraft themselves, making sure that the cargo hold is as safe as it possibly can be for animal travel. 
   Airlines need to be held accountable for the harm they permit to happen to  our pets. Right now, airlines are only liable to owners for up to $1,250 for losing, injuring, or killing a pet. 
   That is no different from what they would be liable for if they lost your suitcase. Under my bill, that limit for liability will be double. 
   Now, anyone who owns a pet knows how expensive veterinary bills can be. If an animal is injured or dies as a result of flying, my bill would require the airlines to pay for the costs of veterinary care. 
   Mr. President, my bill also provides consumers with the right to know about the conditions they face when they transport their animals by plane. My bill requires airlines to immediately report any incidents involving loss, injury or death of animals. 
   Most importantly, the bill puts this information into the hands of the flying public. Pet owners should know which airlines are doing a good job, and which need to do better. Just as consumers favor airlines with solid, on-time records, they will also favor the airlines that have a good safety record with our pets. And, an airline that does a good job will want this information in the hands of consumers. 
   Finally, the bill addresses the problem of the aircraft themselves. The airline industry is undergoing a retrofitting process, as required by the FAA, of all ``class D'' cargo holds, to prevent fires. 
   These are special holds that have the facility to turn off the oxygen in the event of smoke or fire. But that also means that that is an execution for the pets that are in those holds. 
   I believe that the industry should use this opportunity to see what improvements can be made to allow for better oxygen flow and temperature control to protect our pets. 
   Mr. President, we must do more to prevent unnecessary deaths caused by lack of oxygen flow or exposure to heat. 
   With this bill, travelers will feel more secure about using air travel to transport their pets. 
   I hope that my colleagues will join me in support of this legislation.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the mark of a truly great person may be identified by their generosity, and generosity is the reason I rise today. I would like to honor Mrs. Maxine Whitney, a long-time Fairbanks, AK resident, businesswoman and philanthropist, for her multi-million dollar contribution of Native Alaskan artwork to the Prince William Sound Community College in Valdez, AK. 
   For the past 50 years in Alaska, Mrs. Whitney and her husband, Jesse, have traveled extensively in rural Alaska to gain a deeper understanding and appreciation of Native people and cultures. During their travels, Maxine amassed what is reportedly the world's largest private collection of Native Alaskan art and artifacts. 
   Maxine's hobby of collecting Native Alaskan art soon became a much larger commitment when she purchased a small private museum in Fairbanks to house her treasures. For nearly 20 years, Maxine's Eskimo Museum showcased Native Alaskan history and the important contribution Native culture has had on the formation of Alaskan society. Mrs. Whitney maintained the museum from 1969 until the late 1980s. 
   Maxine's dedication to the arts is apparent from her recent donation of her extensive collection of Native Alaska art to Prince William Sound Community College, part of the University of Alaska education system. The collection, known as the Jesse & Maxine Whitney Collection, is the nucleus of the college's Alaska Cultural Center. This multi-million dollar donation will provide a means for all visitors to the center to learn about past and present Native Alaskan cultures as well as the history of Alaska. 
   Mrs. Whitney's dedication to keeping the Native Alaskan history alive should be celebrated. Her generous gift will enhance the knowledge and appreciation of Native cultures. It is people like Maxine Whitney, a patron of the arts and education, who enrich our lives with their gracious gifts. 
   In donating the Whitney Collection, Maxine has provided a world-renowned educational gem for all who visit the collection ..... she has provided a unique legacy for all Alaskans, and for all Americans. Thank you Maxine Whitney.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, page 95 of the report accompanying S. 1122 contains language that encourages the Army to include Rock Island Arsenal in all aspects of the development, design and production of the Lightweight 155mm Towed Howitzer Program. This directive is problematic for many reasons. If followed, it would undermine industrial competition and conflict with the fair and competitive process that has occurred to date. It would preclude further competition for the 155mm Towed Howitzer and all future towed artillery programs. And the report language would potentially contradict several statutes, including the Army Industrial Facilities Act, the Working Capital Funds Act, and the Arsenal Act. 
   The contract for this program has already been awarded on a competitive basis. Vickers Shipbuilding and Engineering LTD developed the original design and owns background intellectual property in the current Lightweight 155mm system. Attempting now to direct the work to Rock Island would potentially detract from work done at Picatinny Arsenal in my home state of New Jersey, as well as potentially create all sorts of legal fights. While Rock Island should be encouraged to compete for a subcontract, all future awards should be made on a ``best-value'' basis. Any legislative micromanagement that compromises the competitive bidding process is inconsistent with legal and economic prudence. I urge such ill-advised acquisition guidance to be dropped when the Senate convenes with the House to conference this bill.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it was on December 21, 1988, over 10 years ago, that Pan Am flight 103 was blown out of the sky over Lockerbie, Scotland killing 270 people, including 189 American citizens. Two Libyan intelligence agents have been indicted for planting the bomb in this deliberate terrorist attack. 
   Over the past decade, I have watched with respect and admiration as the victims' families have courageously pieced together their shattered lives. While these families have tried to move on, the agony of losing their loved ones will never disappear. Neither they nor we as a nation will find closure until those responsible for the bombing are prosecuted and Libya rejects terrorism in word and in deed. 
   I therefore rise today to join with my friend and colleague from Massachusetts in offering an amendment expressing the sense of Congress that sanctions against Libya should not be lifted. 
   Last month, Senator KENNEDY and other colleagues joined me in writing to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to support her decision to keep U.S. sanctions in place at the U.N. until Libya demonstrates it has rejected terrorism. 
   We also called for the United States to pursue an investigation to identify all those responsible for the Pan Am 103 bombing, including those who ordered, organized, and financed this terrible crime. Libya and other terrorist nations must know that the U.S. will not allow criminal acts against its citizens to go unpunished. We will use all available means to ensure justice prevails.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, the amendment Senator KENNEDY and I offer sends a message to Tripoli that the United States will do everything in its power to ensure continuing sanctions against Libya until it complies with international demands and renounces terrorism as state policy. 
   Since the 1988 bombing, three United Nations Security Council resolutions--Numbers 731, 748 and 883--have demanded that Libya cease all support for terrorism, turn over the bombing suspects, cooperate with the investigation and trial, and address the issue of appropriate compensation. 
   To date, Tripoli has only fulfilled one of the four conditions--turning the two bombing suspects over to Scottish authorities to stand trial at a specially-constituted court in the Netherlands. We have seen no indication that the Libyans intend to fulfill the other requirements. 
   In early July, the U.N. Secretary General will report to the Security Council on Libya's compliance with the conditions set by the international community. Once he submits that report, members of the Security Council may well introduce a resolution to lift sanctions against Libya, which until now have only been suspended. 
   Mr. President, Libya must not be allowed to gain relief from sanctions through half-measures. This Amendment therefore calls on President Clinton to use all diplomatic means necessary, including the use of the U.S. veto, to prevent sanctions from being lifted until Tripoli fulfills all the conditions set out in the resolutions. 
   I would urge my colleagues to join us in support of this amendment, to speak with one voice to say that sanctions against Libya should not be lifted until and unless Libya forever renounces terrorism and fulfills the other conditions set out in U.N. resolutions. 
   As Americans, we must take action to ensure such horrors never happen again. We must punish the guilty and continue to exert pressure until Libya resolves to become an accepted member of the world community. This amendment is one step in the right direction to make sure that happens. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I would like to call up my amendment regarding property conveyance at Nike Battery Base 80 Family Housing Site in East Hanover Township, New Jersey. This provision would convey roughly 14 acres to the Township of East Hanover for the development of low and moderate income housing, senior housing, and parkland. Using this land for these purposes is consistent with the 1994 Base Closure and Community Redevelopment Homeless Assistance Act. The Township needs this land to fulfill its obligation to provide such housing under New Jersey state law. I understand a similar provision exists in the bill reported from the House Armed Service Committee. In the interest of expediting the Senate's consideration of this bill, I am willing to withdraw my amendment contingent upon a commitment from the managers of the bill that they will give the House position full consideration in conference.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999. This legislation is designed to give the public the Right to Know about contaminants in their drinking water that are unregulated, but still may present a threat to their health. 
   Mr. President, when we passed the Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996, I praised the bill because I believed it would enhance both the quality of our drinking water and America's confidence in its safety. While the bill did not require that states perform every measure necessary to protect public health, it provided tremendous flexibility and discretion to allow the states to do so. 
   I was especially hopeful that in my state--the most densely-populated state in the country, a state with an unfortunate legacy of industrial pollution, a state in which newspaper articles describing threats to drinking water seem to appear every few days--that our state agencies would exercise their discretion to be more protective of public health than the minimum required under our 1996 bill. 
   Mr. President, I am sad to say I have been disappointed. I am sad to say that in my state, and probably in some of my colleagues' as well, the state agency has clung too closely to the bare minimum requirements. A good example of this is in the ``Source Water Assessment Plan,'' proposed by the state of New Jersey last November, as required by the 1996 law. 
   Under the law, the state is required to perform Source Water Assessments to identify geographic areas that are sources of public drinking water, assess the water systems' susceptibility to contamination, and inform the public of the results. The state's Source Water Assessment Plan describes the program for carrying out the assessments. 
   An aggressive Source Water Assessment program is essential if a state is going to achieve the goals we had for the 1996 Safe Drinking Water Act. Source Water Assessment is the keystone of the program by which the state will prevent--not just remediate and treat, but prevent--contamination of our drinking water resources. Source Water Assessment also underpins what I believe will be the most far-reaching provisions of the law--those giving the public the Right to Know about potential threats to its drinking water. 
   Mr. Chairman, there are serious deficiencies in my state's proposed Source Water Assessment Plan. These are deficiencies that I fear may characterize other states' plans as well. 
   First, under the proposed plan, the state will not identify and evaluate the threat presented by contaminants unless they are among the 80 or so specifically regulated under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Under its proposed plan, the state might ignore even contaminants known to be leaching into drinking water from toxic waste sites. For example, the chemical being studied as a possible cause of childhood cancer at Toms River, New Jersey would not be evaluated under the state's plan. Radium 224, recently discovered in drinking water across my state, might not be evaluated under the state's plan until specifically regulated. With gaps like that in our information, what do I tell the families when they want to know what is in their drinking water? 
   In addition, under its proposed plan, the state would not consult the public in identifying and evaluating threats to drinking water. This exclusion would almost certainly result in exclusion of the detailed information known to the watershed groups and other community groups which exist across New Jersey and across the country. Also, the state's plan to disclose the assessments are vague and imply that only summary data would be made available to the public. The public must have complete and easy access to assessments for the Right to Know component of the drinking water program to be effective. 
   The Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999 will address these deficiencies by amending the Safe Drinking Water Act to improve Source Water Assessments and Consumer Confidence Reports. First, under my bill, when the state performs Source Water Assessments, it will assess the threat posed, not just by regulated contaminants, but by certain unregulated contaminants believed by EPA and U.S. Geological Survey to cause health problems, and contaminants known to be released from local pollution sites, such as Superfund sites, other waste sites, and factories. The bill will also require the state to identify potential contamination of groundwater, even outside the immediate area of the well, perform the assessments with full involvement from the public, and update the assessments every five years. 
   Second, the Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999 will make several improvements to the ``Consumer Confidence Reports'' required under the 1996 law to notify the public of water contamination. The bill will require monitoring and public notification, not only of regulated contaminants, but of significant unregulated contaminants identified through the Source Water Assessments, and of sources of contamination. The bill will not require local water purveyors to monitor for every conceivable contaminant--only those identified by the state as posing a threat and having been released by a potentially significant source. In addition, the bill will require notification of new or sharply-increased contamination within 30 days. The bill will also require reporting not just to ``customers,'' but to ``consumers,'' such as apartment-dwellers, who do not receive water company bills. Finally, the bill will require that consumers be provided information on how they can protect themselves from contamination in their drinking water. 
   Third, the bill will require that testing for the presence of radium 224 take place within 48 hours of sampling the  drinking water, so that public water supplies can have an accurate assessment of this rapidly-decaying radioactive contaminant. 
   Mr. President, the public has the Right-to-Know about the full range of contaminants they might find in their tap water. The Drinking Water Right-To-Know Act of 1999 will guarantee them that right. I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation. 
   Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be printed into the RECORD.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Superfund Litigation Reduction and Brownfield Cleanup Act along with Senators DASCHLE, BAUCUS, and LINCOLN. This bill will strengthen and improve the current Superfund program by cleaning up urban and rural brownfields and removing small, innocent parties from unnecessary superfund litigation. 
   Unlike the alternative Superfund proposal offered by the Republicans on Environment and Public Works Committee, this bill continues what is best about the Superfund program and makes the minor adjustments necessary to make it cost effective. 
   Mr. President, way back in the 103rd Congress, the critics of Superfund raised a number of issues. They asserted that the program was too slow, that not enough cleanups were taking place, that there was too much litigation. 
   At the time, we were seeking solutions which would make the program faster, streamline cleanups, treat parties more fairly and get the little guys out earlier, all while keeping those responsible for the problem also responsible for cleaning it up. This was all within the general goals of achieving more cleanups and therefore providing better protection of human health and the environment. 
   I am proud of those proposals, and many of us still on the Environment and Public Works Committee, including Chairman CHAFEE, who voted for that bill way back in the 103rd Congress should also be proud. Many of those proposals, although never enacted into law, were adopted administratively by EPA and radically altered the Superfund Program as we know it. 
   Others have been tested and been improved upon. In general, the thrust of this bill has resulted in many of the achievements of the current program. 
   According to a report issued by the General Accounting Office, by the end of this fiscal year all cleanup remedies will have been selected for 95 percent of nonfederal NPL sites (1,109 of 1,169 sites). 
   In addition, approximately 990 NPL sites have final cleanup plans approved, approximately 5,600 emergency removal actions have been taken at hazardous waste sites to stabilize dangerous situations and to reduce the threat to human health and the environment. 
   More than 30,900 sites have been removed from the Superfund inventory of  potential waste sites, to help promote the economic redevelopment of these properties. 
   During this same time, EPA has worked to improve the fairness and efficiency of the enforcement program, even while keeping up the participation of potentially responsible parties in cleaning up their sites. 
   EPA has negotiated more than 400 deminimis settlements with over 18,000 small parties, which gave protection for these parties against expensive contribution suits brought by other private parties. Sixty six percent of these have been in the last four years alone. 
   Since fiscal year 1996, EPA has offered ``orphan share'' compensation of over $145 million at 72 sites to responsible parties who were willing to step up and negotiate settlements of their cases. EPA is now offering this at every single settlement, to reward settlors and reduce litigation, both with the government, and with other private parties. 
   These are just a few highlights of the improvements made in the program, many drawn from our earlier legislative proposals. Other improvements, such as instituting the targeted review of complex and high-cost cleanups, prior to remedy selection, have reduced the cost of cleanups without delaying the pace of cleanups. 
   EPA's administrative reforms have significantly improved the program, by speeding up cleanups and reducing senseless litigation, and making the program fairer, faster and more efficient overall. 
   But despite the fact that this is a program that has finally really hit its stride, we are now faced with proposals from the majority which could undercut the progress in the program, and which are premised on a goal of closing down the program rather than a goal of cleaning up the sites. Indeed, the very title of their bill, the Superfund Program Completion Act, reflects this intent. 
   I am deeply troubled by many of the provisions in the Republican bill, which would have the effect of ramping the program down without regard to the amount of site work left to be done. This bill provides for lowered funding levels, a cap on the NPL, waivers of the federal safety net, and some broad liability exemptions. 
   At the same time, it creates a number of new, expensive obligations which would further reduce the amount of money available for cleanup. It also shifts the costs of the program to the taxpayers and would not include an extension of the Superfund tax. 
   In short, while I am encouraged by the fact that the Republican bill drops some troubling provisions from prior bills, it introduces a whole set of new issues that are cause for great concern. 
   I think it is very clear that what we need here is a better Superfund program, not a retreat from tackling our environmental problems. 
   We need a bill that continues to accelerate the pace of cleanups, keeps cleanups protective, reduces litigation and transaction costs, is affordable and does not shift costs to the American taxpayer. 
   That is why I am introducing the Superfund Litigation Reduction and Brownfield Cleanup Act of 1999. I believe that this bill, is in some areas very close to the provisions supported by my Republican colleagues, but differs in some critical areas. 
   It would protect cleanups, reduce litigation and not shift costs to the American taxpayer. 
   I hope that these are goals we can agree on. And I urge my colleagues to not throw the Superfund baby out with the bathwater. 
   I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen the Superfund program in the 21st century not dismantle it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I, first of all, want to say to my colleagues on the other side--to Senator  SMITH, to Senator JEFFORDS, to Senator GREGG, to Senator HATCH--I really do appreciate the fact that they are trying to arrive at a consensus. I think what was said in the earlier presentation was that it is a bipartisan agreement. I wonder whether parents in Littleton, CO, care whether it is bipartisan or not, or whether it is a compromise or not. What they want to make sure of is that it never happens again, as it did this morning in Georgia. 
   It is a pity we are discussing whether or not there is too much regulation, or whether or not the law enforcement people are hard at work. I want them to look at the statistics. We will talk about that in just a minute. That is not the issue. The issue is, do you want to save lives, or do you want to save the NRA? Do you want to permit them to continue to oppose all sensible legislation? 
   There are people sitting here, I am sure, who have children at home and they don't want to worry about them when they go to school. That is the issue. What are we talking about here? Eighty-nine percent of the American people say they want the gun loopholes closed--finally shut. What do you think the percentage might be out of Georgia today, or out of Colorado, or out of Pearl, MS; or Paducah, KY; or Springfield? What do you think the percentage of those families are? I will bet you it is 100 percent. 
   We know one thing. It was admitted by the distinguished Senator from Idaho, or at least suggested--not admitted. He said 40 percent of the people who buy guns at gun shows do so without any identification at all. ``Buyers anonymous.'' Buy your gun. Don't tell anybody who you are. Forty percent, by my calculation. It is around 800,000 guns a year. Maybe I am wrong by 100,000 or 150,000. Over 5 million handguns are sold in this country each and every year. 
   Mr. President, I want us to stand up to the American people and say we care more about your kids; we care more about your family; we care more about violence in this country than we do about whether or not this one gets credit, or whether it looks like we are imposing an extra burden. 
   I want to talk about the burdens for just a moment and talk about Federal gun prosecutions. The distinguished Members on that side will say they are down. I would tell you this: Twenty-five percent more criminals are sent to prison for State and Federal weapons offenses than in 1992. That is because we work more closely with our partners in State and local law enforcement. 
   Look at the result. Stop looking at the process. Look at where we want to come out. Overall violence and property crimes are down by 20 percent. The murder rate is down 28 percent--the lowest level in 30 years. We have accomplished something. Do you know why? Because we are asking questions about guns. Yes. There are things wrong in our culture. There certainly are. But I look at our culture, and I look at other nations which are well developed. We have 35,000 Americans killed each year with firearms compared to 15 in Japan--15 people--30 in Great Britain. Just take the murder side of that--homicides, almost 14,000; suicides, 18,000. That happens, I guess, in other countries. But I am sure it doesn't happen to the same extent with guns. 
   When we hear our friends decrying this extension of time that is needed to get your mitts on a gun, why should we slow down the process? Somebody wants a gun. They give it to them. That is what they are saying. 
   I will tell you something. If they read the law carefully--the Lautenberg law--then they would see that the law limiting enforcement to 24 hours for gun show background checks is only if--72 hours; forgive me--only if there is some detection in the first minutes that something is wrong. If there is nothing wrong, you can have a gun in 5 minutes. Is that quick enough? Is a day quick enough? I think it is quick enough for the American people. Ask those in Littleton and ask them in other places how quickly the guns ought to be available. 
   No, Mr. President, we are missing the boat. We are arguing about process while we are exposing more and more of our kids to accessibility to guns. It is not right. The Lautenberg amendment closes the loopholes once and for all. 
   Again, I commend Senators SMITH and JEFFORDS for closing the pawnshop loophole, but they don't close all of the loopholes. There is still limited liability for gun sellers. There are still people who are going to be able to buy guns without registering them. They are not registering without going through a background check. They are not insisting that everybody go through a background check, and they are not insisting that 24 hours be extended to 72 for normal purchases. 
   I think what we ought to do is say once and for all--I hope my colleagues will respond--to the American people, enough of the debate about the process. The process is fair. 
   We are not talking about increasing taxes. 
   We are not talking about increasing the bureaucracy. 
   I would like to mention one thing--that even as our friends talk about more enforcement being the difference, the fact is that when we tried to hire 280 new ATF agents, requesting over $10 million to hire those people, and over 40 new Federal prosecutors as well, the NRA has never supported backing its tough talk with real money for State, local and Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest and prosecute. They like to talk about it here. But they don't want to pay for it. 
   It is time to face up to reality. One is we are going to probably pass the Smith-Jeffords amendment with an overwhelming vote. That is OK, because it starts the process. But it doesn't complete the process. The process will be complete when the Lautenberg amendment is passed, and I hope we have enough courage in this room to stand up and say, ``Yes, I vote for the Lautenberg amendment.''

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, very simply, we have just made a decision to close a couple of the loopholes that existed before on gun show sales, and I commend the Senators who offered the amendment. But we are still left with significant numbers of people who do not have to have a background check, and that is not the way we want to do it. We want to close all the loopholes. 
   They have insisted we remove the 72-hour window for investigation of backgrounds, and that is only triggered if there is something that discredits the individual. Otherwise, it is 24 hours or less. If there is nothing on the person's record, the sale goes through. 
   It is hard to imagine why we cannot take enough time to investigate the prospective buyer sufficiently to make sure we are protecting our people. 
   That is the issue, and I hope our friends on the Republican side who voted with us last time will continue to vote with us. We could have won this several times if we had support from the Republican side of the aisle. I hope they will demonstrate to the American people that there is concern about limiting access to guns as the citizens of the country want us to do.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support this supplemental emergency appropriations bill. It is far from perfect, and I have serious reservations about some provisions. At the same time, the legislation would provide vitally important funding for our operations in Kosovo, as well as several other important provisions. So, on balance, I have concluded that the bill deserves my support. 
   Mr. President, of the $15 billion in new spending this bill contains, $12 billion is to support our important mission in Kosovo, to punish Slobodan Milosevic for his brutal policy of ethnic cleansing, compel a political settlement, and facilitate the return of the Kosovar Albanian refugees to their homeland. The tragedy in Kosovo represents a turning point for NATO, European security, and American leadership in the 21st century. I am glad that Congress has shown its support for the President with the funding contained in this bill for the military operation and the humanitarian assistance. 
   The bill also contains funds to ensure that the International Criminal Tribunal for former Yugoslavia can effectively investigate and prosecute the perpetrators of the atrocities committed in Kosovo and those in Belgrade who ordered them to carry out this campaign of terror. They must be brought to justice. 
   I am also glad that after a long delay we have provided the necessary assistance for Central American countries to recover from the devastation imposed last fall by Hurricanes Mitch and Georges. 
   Mr. President, this bill also contains a provision that helps family members of the victims of the terrible Pan Am 103 bombing to attend the trial of the charged criminals before the Scottish court in the Netherlands. As you know, Mr. President, many New Jersey natives were on that flight. These families have waited too long for justice to be brought, and I am glad that they will be able to see it rendered firsthand. 
   The bill also provides $100 million for Jordan, to help support its role in advancing the Middle East peace process. The region stands at a critical juncture after the death of King Hussein and the election of Ehud Barak as Israeli Prime Minister. I am glad we provided this down-payment for Jordan. Now we must follow through on our commitment for Israel and the Palestinian Authority per the Wye River Memorandum the U.S. helped broker. 
   Mr. President, despite these positive elements, the bill before us has many flaws. 
   It contains more than $6 billion in unrequested defense spending, far in excess of what it will take to prosecute the air war against Milosevic. It stretches the definition of what constitutes an ``emergency'' to such an extent that it mocks the notion of fiscal discipline. 
   This year's concurrent resolution on the budget established five explicit criteria to guide the use of the emergency designation, which allows funding beyond the discretionary caps. These criteria relate to whether an item is (i) necessary, essential, or vital (not merely useful or beneficial); (ii) sudden, quickly coming into being, and not building up over time; (iii) an urgent, pressing, and compelling need requiring immediate action; (iv) unforeseen, unpredictable, and unanticipated; and (v) not permanent, temporary in nature. 
   Unfortunately, it is difficult to see how some of this defense spending constitutes an emergency. For example, while increasing military compensation may be a laudable goal, it hardly represents an emergency under these criteria. 
   I also am disturbed by the apparent disparate treatment of offsets. As my colleagues know, under the Budget Act, funding for emergency spending does not count against the discretionary caps and therefore does not have to be offset. For some reason, however, the Majority feels that offsets are necessary--but for only for the agriculture and humanitarian emergencies, not the military portion. This double standard defies logic. If something is an emergency, no offsets should be required. If it is not an emergency, then we should not use the emergency designation and we should pay for it with spending reductions. 
   However, of all the problems with this bill, I am most disappointed in the provisions related to the recent multi-state tobacco settlement. These provisions waive the Federal government's right to recoup its share of recovered tobacco Medicaid costs without any guarantees that State governments will spend even a penny of these settlement funds on tobacco control programs. 
   Mr. President, these provisions--stuck into this large emergency supplemental appropriations bill--hand the tobacco industry a big victory. The tobacco lobby wanted to avoid an effective, nationwide anti-youth smoking effort. And unfortunately, it looks like their wish was granted. 
   Mr. President, some have characterized this recoupment of Federal Medicaid dollars as a Federal ``money grab'' of State dollars. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
   It is without question that a large portion of the state settlements with the tobacco industry represents a recovery of Federal funds. I should know, because I have been working with the state attorneys general on these cases since they were filed. 
   In fact, I introduced the first ``Tobacco Medicaid Waiver'' bill back in 1996. At that time, I was joined by Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore and Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey at the introduction of a bill that would allow States to keep part of the Federal share of Medicaid. At the time, there were only ten states suing, and my bill was aimed at urging more States to bring claims. 
   Mr. President, back then, none of these pioneering state officials ever said that the Federal Government had no right to Medicaid recoupment. It is a preposterous argument. The states sued under the Federal Medicaid statute--they knew that then and they know that now. 
   Mr. President, there is no question under current law that a portion of these settlements are Federal funds. It is also important to note that the tobacco settlement signed by the States blocks the Federal government from seeking reimbursement for Federal Medicaid costs caused by tobacco company misconduct in the future. So, in other words, the States waived our rights too. 
   Let me be clear: I think we should ultimately give this money back to the States--but we must have guarantees that a portion of this tobacco recoupment will be used to reduce youth smoking, assist children and promote public health. 
   Mr. President, the provisions stuck into this bill are bad policy and primarily benefit one party: the tobacco industry. The losers will be America's children. Because of this provision, more young people will begin to smoke. And many of them, ultimately, will die as a result.  
   Mr. President, that's not right. And I hope Congress will reconsider this decision in the future. 
   Still, Mr. President, this conference report does contain several other important provisions, including funding for our operations in Kosovo. So, while I do so with some reluctance, I will support it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, what I want to do is to see if we can present a compromise position that takes care of some of the problems which still exist after we passed the 
   Craig-Hatch amendment, which differs from my original language to an extent that I think makes it more palatable to our friends on the other side. I would be happy to discuss those as I go through my presentation on the amendment. It is obvious that we want to do what we can. 
   While the Senator from Utah was occupied, I did say that I have never known him to obstruct for the purpose of obstruction but, rather, to effect change. I think it is fair to say there is a significant amount of interest on the Republican side in the changes we have made to try to limit the definition of gun shows, to try to make certain we have not increased the bureaucratic or the regulatory requirements such that substantially more paperwork is involved. We are not attempting to keep  files open on people for whom there is no discredited information, changes of that nature. 
   Mr. President, I hope the Senator from Utah and other Members of the Senate will look at what we have and give us a chance to have a review of it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, in response to the Senator from Utah, there is no intent to offer anything that hasn't been discussed or anything that is a radical change that further limits the activities of legitimate transactions at a gun show. 
   This amendment which I send up now has been joined in its origination by Senator BOB KERREY from Nebraska. He has signed on as a cosponsor. His input has been truly valuable in crafting a workable proposal. He comes from a largely rural State where guns are a significant part of the State's culture. I really appreciate his strong support of my amendment. 
   This amendment is offered in a bipartisan fashion to finally close the gun show loophole. I think it is time for us to come to an agreement on the gun show debate. It is very much in the minds of the public. There was a poll just done, an ABC-Washington Post poll, which said, in response to the question, Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows? the support level was 89 percent. So it does not leave a lot of room for doubt. 
   Last week the Senate did cast two votes on different gun show proposals. My amendment was defeated by a slim majority of 51 votes. Obviously, we had Republican support. There were several absences, primarily from the Democratic side, people were called away, some for emergencies and illness. 
   And after our amendment was defeated, a couple of days later, the Hatch-Craig amendment was offered, and it passed by only one vote, with five Senators not voting; there were a total of 95 votes cast. The result was 48-47. So we are obviously in the same ballpark when it comes to thinking about what ought to happen. People are very wary and upset by the fact that guns can be purchased without any identification of the buyer. I call it ``buyers anonymous.'' The public is in obvious distress about the way things have been done in the past. 
   We are not going to interrupt the process whereby people who are not felons and are of sound mind can buy a gun. We are not looking to interrupt the process of the interested purchaser in buying a gun. But we know that, just as with other transactions--vehicles, for instance--there is a recognition of who is buying a vehicle. The same thing ought to be true when we talk about guns. 
   So that is what brings us to the position we are in. I asked several Senators who were leaning to my position to make any suggestions as to how we could improve the amendment that I originally offered. This new version that we have sent to the desk reflects the suggestions of both Republicans and Democrats. First, the definition of ``gun show'' is modified. I have actually taken language from the Hatch-Craig amendment and included it. I point that out because I want to try to effect a consensus, and that is why we have included this language from the Hatch-Craig amendment in this revised version. 
   Now, my new language clarifies that we are only talking about events where firearms are exhibited and offered for sale. We are not talking about transactions between individuals or neighbors. 
   The second change that we have made would clarify what qualifies as a firearm sale or transaction. When drafting my original amendment, in order to prevent people from circumventing the background check by completing a sale outside the gun show that actually began in the show, but is completed, for instance, in the parking lot, we wanted to close that loophole. So while the original amendment defined ``firearms transaction'' fairly broadly to cover any transaction that started in a gun show but was completed outside, we wanted to define that a little more openly so some disagreement that occurred would perhaps have a chance to note the changes that were made and would encourage them to join in with us and pass this legislation. Some of my colleagues have suggested the original language was too broad, so I have narrowed it to ensure that legitimate gun sellers are not subject to penalties. 
   Additionally, during the course of the debate, some of my opponents have suggested that my amendment would lead to a national registry of gun owners. My amendment had nothing remotely resembling a national registry. It simply required gun sales to go through an existing national instant criminal background check system. 
   The problem is that some who oppose any kind of gun owner identification as a new purchaser have always opposed the criminal background check system. They argue that it is the first step toward a national registry of firearm owners. They raise the specter of a national registry because they want to scare people away from reasonable, commonsense gun proposals. 
   Well, we are going to make certain that doesn't happen, because I believe there is no basis for that argument. I have made a modification to try to deal with that issue once and for 
   all. 
   My amendment would change the Brady law to prevent the Federal Government from keeping any records on qualified purchasers--in other words, law-abiding citizens who are allowed to buy a gun--for more than 90 days. After 90 days, they have to scrap it if it has no value. The person is not discredited in any way, has no criminal record, has no problem with violence, has not been noted for violent behavior, has not had any serious mental disorder, and we are satisfied to have those records expunged after 90 days because there is no value to them, for one thing, and, secondly, it seems to suggest that what we want to have is, again, a registry on everybody. That is not the case. 
   Mr. President, law-abiding citizens don't have anything to worry about. After 90 days, they can be absolutely sure that there will be no Government record of their gun transactions whatsoever. 
   Finally, Senator KERREY, Senator SCHUMER, Senator BOXER, Senator KENNEDY, and I worked to streamline the requirements for gun show promoters. My revised amendment eliminates all unnecessary paperwork and bureaucratic redtape that was purportedly contained in the original Lautenberg amendment. The reason I say ``purportedly,'' is because that is the way some  of our colleagues on the other side interpret it. Well, I want to make sure that the record is clear and, thus, we were truly circumspect in the way we asked for this data to be presented and for this amendment to be offered. 
   I thank colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have helped me work on these issues. This is a compromise from my original position, but my mission is to accomplish the goal, and the goal very simply is to satisfy the American people. It is not just curiosity; it is fear; it is concern; it is their belief that anybody who buys a gun ought not to be anonymous in that purchase, especially when we know that so many of those transactions have occurred at gun shows. So that is the purpose of this change. We need this amendment to close the gun show loopholes once and for all. 
   Now, although the Hatch-Craig amendment may have generated a well-intentioned effort to address the gun show loophole, it did create additional problems. If we leave the language in this bill as it presently is with the Hatch-Craig amendment, our gun laws are actually going to be weaker. I know that is not the intention of the authors, nor is it the desire of the American people.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have a strong feeling that we can pass this. It would take many minds to change to make that happen. My colleagues on the Republican side--I want to say I have had lots of private conversations with them--also want to see the loophole closed. While the Hatch-Craig amendment passed, it was the intent of those who supported it, and I am sure it closed the loophole. However, it is technically still open to loopholes through which lots of problems could emerge. 
   As a consequence, I am hopeful that we will get strong support on this amendment. The American public strongly support it--89 percent, I point out. That is an enormous number. 
   What I am hoping is that finally the voices of the parents, those who are concerned who have seen violence in their schools, who have seen violence in their streets, are heard. If we can, without harm to those who want to observe a legitimate request, continue to do that, I am hopeful that we are going to be able to alert some of those who oppose it to the fact that we have taken great pains to satisfy their needs in the revised Lautenberg-Kerrey amendment. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment. Let's close the gun show loophole once and for all. 
   I yield the floor.

   I ask--we have several amendments, on both sides--what would the regular order be, Mr. Leader? As I understand it, the Parliamentarian can answer that. There was no Smith-Jeffords in there. We have an order, and it would be nice to not suddenly suggest that perhaps 60 votes would do it. And then we could hear--

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to say to our fairly new colleague from New York that he could not have picked an issue upon which he could get more solid agreement. One does not have to be a Democrat or an easterner or have any special connection to respect and to so greatly appreciate the contributions made by Senator DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN. 
   He had this capacity--I know, since we served together on the Environment Committee--not unlike, in many ways, the senior Senator from West Virginia, and that was to bring their respective knowledge to a discussion or debate or to a hearing, that--I speak for myself--would make me sit up and take notice. I felt transported from this white-haired, wizened old face to a college student again and remembered how much I enjoyed some of the classes I attended where we had a professor, an instructor who conveyed the message in an interesting form, not just the statistics or the parameters of the particular discussion. 
   So it is with PAT MOYNIHAN. Any of us who have spent any time with PAT have always been amazed at the abundance of knowledge he has, whether we were talking about the New York State canal system or whether we were talking about the highway system or the developments in the Indian Ocean or you name the subject. No matter how impromptu or how unexpected the discussion, PAT MOYNIHAN always has the capacity to discuss the subject intelligently and deeply. 
   Any tribute that we give to this man is not fair compensation for that which he has given this country and has given this body. His abundance of gifts to us are so profound that many years from now they will still be talking about those of greatness who graced this Chamber and PAT MOYNIHAN will be one of those without a doubt. 
   I am pleased to call him my friend. I hope since we live in such close proximity, our representation of New York and New Jersey, that there will be tributes and testimonies to his contribution. He is a self-effacing fellow. He does not like to hear a bunch of compliments, but we are not going to let him get away with that now. 
   I commend my colleague, the junior Senator from New York, for his wisdom and his thought in bringing this to us.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Russell Berrie and Dr. Robert A. Scott, two of New Jersey's leaders in business and education, on the occasion of their third annual ``Making A Difference Awards'' program. 
   Mr. President, Russ and Robert have made tremendous philanthropic and humanitarian contributions to my state of New Jersey. In 1997, they joined together through the Russell Berrie Foundation to create the ``Making A Difference Awards,'' which honor unsung heroes of New Jersey for acts of unusual heroism, extraordinary community service or lifetime achievement. 
   Much like the award recipients, Russ Berrie has devoted a lifetime to helping others. Thirty-six years ago, he founded RUSS Berrie and Company, Incorporated, which develops and distributes more than 6,000 gift products to retailers worldwide. Its diverse range of products include stuffed animals, baby gifts, picture frames, candles, figurines, and home decor gifts. Russ' company, headquartered in Oakland, NJ, grosses annual sales of $270 million and has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1984. 
   Recently, Fortune Magazine named Russ one of its ``Forty Most Generous Americans,'' and Russ has been recognized by many organizations for his strong commitment to education, health care and interreligious affairs. Russ' Foundation promotes his values, passions, and ideas through investment in innovative ideas and by supporting individuals who make a meaningful difference in the lives of others. 
   Robert also has made a positive impact on the world around him. He currently is the president of Ramapo College, New Jersey's leading liberal arts school, serving over 5,000 undergraduate and graduate students from over 20 states and 50 nations. Thanks to Robert, the college has named its soon-to-open center for performing and visual arts after Russ and his wife, Angelica. What an honor! 
   Mr. President, I am pleased today to honor my good friends Russ and Robert for their work in honoring the unsung heroes of New Jersey. We are indebted to them for their service. I am happy to join them in honoring this year's three winners of the ``Making A Difference Award''--Beverly Turner, of Irvington, who lives with muscular dystrophy, for devoting her time caring to children with special needs. James C. Joiner, founder of the Rescuing Inner Sity Kids (RISK), for dedicating his time, skill, and spirit to working with inner-city children to instill in them the desire to better themselves and the people around them. Finally, Frederick ``Freddie'' Hoffman, of River Edge, for dedicating the last ten years of his life to raising money for the Leukemia Foundation. I also would like to recognize the 14 finalists: Douglas A. Berrian, Mr. and Mrs. William Clutter, Sister June Favata, Kathleen Garcia, Adam and Blair Hornstine, Sylvia Jackson, Jeff Macaulay, Jim McCloskey, Eddie Mulrow, Thomas O'Leary, Barry Lee Petty, Michael Ricciardone, Richard J. Ward, and Dr. and Mrs. Robert Zufall. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate all of the honorees for unselfishly giving of themselves. They have proven to their family, to their friends, and to their communities that this honor is well-deserved.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a great friend, Joe Taub, in celebration of his 70th birthday on May 19th. Joe is a tremendously hard worker and a world-class philanthropist, and I'm proud to say he's been my friend for almost 50 years. 
   Joe came from humble beginnings in Paterson, NJ to join me in founding Automatic Data Processing in 1949. Today, the company employs over 30,000 people in the U.S. and Europe. Even after leaving ADP in 1971, Joe continued to lead an active business life, starting his own company and becoming owner of the New Jersey Nets basketball team. Along the way, Joe donated his time to several charities and with his wife, Arlene, established the Taub-Gorelick Laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center to aid breast cancer victims. 
   Joe has always worked to improve the world around him. To help keep inner city kids off the streets, he financed several scholarships and started the Taub-Doby Basketball League. And he contributed to the redevelopment of Paterson by giving the city a museum documenting its history. 
   Mr. President, Joe isn't remarkable just for his business achievements and philanthropy. He's also been a loving, devoted husband for 45 years and has done a wonderful job as a father and grandfather. 
   I would like to extend my heartfelt best wishes to a long-time friend and former business partner in honor of his 70th birthday. Joe, on behalf of myself and all those whose lives you have touched, we wish you the best.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose the Hatch-Craig loophole amendment. I am calling it that deliberately. Unfortunately, this amendment goes exactly in the wrong direction. Instead of closing the gun show loophole, it creates several new loopholes that will help criminals get even more guns. 
   We look here on this chart at a licensed dealer: Background check? Voluntarily. Special license: They don't even have to ask whether or not there is any evidence that this individual shouldn't have any permit for a gun. 
   The first choice was my amendment to really close the gun show loopholes, and that is what the public wants. We see it all the time. We heard it all over TV, and last night on a show called ``Extra,'' they showed how penetrable the rules are in a gun show where a 15-year-old and 17-year-old were able to buy guns under the table. I hope they will respond here today to the American people, 87 percent of whom said close the gun show loopholes. I hope we will do that and have the courage to stand up to the NRA.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
   What we see here--and I apologize if we have exhausted the patience of the Senator from Utah, but we have been in this situation before where patience runs out. I heard the Senator from Utah, who is one of the most concerned people about children and family that I know. But he said: This isn't about guns; it is not all guns. I agree. It is about life. It is about saving people's lives. But we do not focus on that. The argument against the Lautenberg amendment, as originally presented, was: It is bureaucratic and we ought to do more law enforcement. 
   If we are going to do more law enforcement, I assume that means bigger government, I assume that means spending more money for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms personnel. Unfortunately, what we see is this persistent backpedaling, trying to make it up. Aha, the public caught us. They caught us with a mistake, with another error that protects those who want to avoid having background checks, so we had better fix it. 
   They worked like the devil to keep people from voting for the original Lautenberg amendment, which said: Close all the loopholes in the gun shows that permit people to buy guns without background checks. 
   I refer, just for 1 more minute, to the poll which says 87 percent of the people in the country say that all people who buy guns at the gun shows should have background checks. 
   Sixty percent of Americans blame the tragedy in Littleton in significant measure on the availability of guns. That is what we are talking about. 
   As mistakes were made in the presentation on the other side, nevertheless, before I leave the subject, six Republicans voted on the Lautenberg amendment positively, but now we see the errors creep in. 
   First, the statement was made that only 2 percent of the guns bought at gun shows were bought without background checks. Then there was a realization. The distinguished Senator from Idaho said, no, he was wrong. It was 40 percent. It is close--2 percent, 40 percent. How many guns is that? It is a lot when there are 4,000 gun shows a year. 
   Then we had another presentation yesterday that said we are closing the loopholes. Well, we have attempted to close one of the loopholes, but every time they get caught with an error or a decision not to close another loophole, they come back again, because it gets exposed on television. It gets exposed in the newspapers. 
   Last night, there was a program on ABC called ``Extra,'' and they showed a film, a camera secreted in a hidden spot, of a 15-year-old girl and a 17-year-old boy buying guns. He said, I am 17; she said, I am 15. They were able to buy those guns. 
   Why can't we shut it down once and for all? 
   I have a letter here. The Senator from Utah said there was no response from the administration. It is addressed to Senator LOTT. It was sent by Secretary Rubin and Attorney General Reno. It says:  
   This amendment would seriously impede the effectiveness of the national instant criminal background check system. It would reduce from 3 business days to just 24 hours the period of time that law enforcement has to ensure that firearms sold at gun shows are not being sold to felons and other prohibited persons.  
   There is flaw after flaw, and the Senator from Utah said that is why we are here; we are fixing them. 
   We will never fix it that way. Anyone who knows Senate procedure knows that you fix the flaws in the committee or you fix the flaws in a private discussion on the floor. You don't suddenly throw up an amendment and say, I ask unanimous consent to modify my amendment. If you are caught with your hand in the cookie jar, then, by goodness, step back and say, OK, let's find out what we did wrong. Let's find out if we can agree on closing all the loopholes. 
   This may be an exhausting procedure, but it is more exhausting for  those people who are threatened by the casual presence of guns all over. We don't need to add to that quantity by not requiring background checks. We close one loophole, but there are others. There is the pawnshop loophole. There is the one that says all records have to be destroyed after 24 hours. What kind of a database do we have that we can refer to?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Utah for his consummate interest in issues that matter, even though at times we differ. He did request a courtesy that I would like to have yielded to, except for the fact that we have allowed some on that side to be protected while not enabling this Senator to be able to obtain the same protection. I am bound, at 3:30, for Albania, Macedonia, Hungary, and Bulgaria. 
   I plan to visit with our people in Aviano, Italy, and Brussels headquarters and be back here Monday night. This is not intended to be a world endurance record. That is not why I am doing this. I am doing it because I have had a deep interest in what takes place there and am shocked by the horror of the deeds that the Serbian Government is perpetrating on these people. 
   I have had a chance to meet some of the refugees at Fort Dix. I was there last week with the First Lady to greet the first of the refugees who arrived in America. I did serve in World War II--not in this area, but I was in Europe during the war. The horrors we are witnessing are too much for a civilized world to bear. 
   I salute the leadership of the President, the courage and the commitment of our troops who are there for long hours each and every day working to the best of their ability, which ability is very good. 
   There have been mistakes made, and that happens in a wartime environment. Mistakes are made because we are trying to make sure our casualties are few. 
   That is where I am going, and I will not be here then on Monday to bring up this amendment. I would have offered the amendment without debate. 
   The fact of the matter is that everyone is pretty much aware of what my amendment is. It helps to further close the loopholes, which I know the Senator from Utah wanted to do. I do not think the amendment we voted on this morning does it. It does not close the loopholes. That is my judgment, and I am prepared to defend that judgment. 
   I want to correct it. I want to see all the loopholes closed, and so do the vast majority of Americans. Eighty-seven percent, as a matter of fact, in a national poll said they want the loopholes at the gun shows closed. 
   I take a second seat to no one in wanting to get a juvenile justice bill in place. I want to see if we can help our young people avoid the violence that seems to permeate our society. But the fact of the matter is that each of us in this parliamentary structure that we operate under is entitled to offer amendments. 
   I had hoped I would have been able to, as they say in the vernacular here, lay it down, put it at the desk and have it saved for debate at a later time. The Senator from Utah tried very hard to be cooperative, as he always does with me--we have a good relationship, and I respect that enormously--to say: All right, we can have some time. We will arrange not a lot of time on Tuesday for a discussion and a vote. 
   The inability to offer that amendment is decidedly a disadvantage, though it will be offered by one of my colleagues. I had hoped, since I authored it in the first place, to send it up. That may be a red flag to some over there, but the fact of the matter is that I know the Senator from Utah does not disagree with me in principle; in approach perhaps, in principle certainly not.  
   I ask once again if it is possible just to send it up. It does need unanimous consent. I will not force any objections. I take the liberty of asking the distinguished manager whether it is possible just to send it up and lay it down.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you. Because what happened is we had an extensive delivery by the distinguished Senator from Idaho. And if we are now going to divide up the time, it is a little out of balance. So I say this to the Senator from Utah, that if we agree to give up 10 minutes now, and reserve, perhaps, 15 for our side, just to get a little bit of balance in here, and we are going to continue the debate----

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator from Vermont, and I thank the Chair. 
   If the audience here or out there is mystified, I wouldn't be surprised, because I think we, too, are mystified. We are buried under a volume of language and words, and we are not addressing the point. 
   The point is whether or not we are willing to say, if guns are sold, there has to be a measure of identification of the buyer. That is the question. Ask the parents in Littleton, CO, what they think. Should we have identified everybody who walks into a gun show? Describe the gun show as you will, we will talk about that in a minute. Should everybody who buys a gun at a gun show be identified? I think yes. 
   The shallow arguments about, we have 40,000 laws on the books and therefore why do we need one more--well, you tell me what happened when Terry Nichols and Timothy McVeigh were out at a gun show selling guns to raise money for their terrorist operation. What is the point? 
   Obviously, the laws that we have do not cover all of the situations. I say this. I just heard the distinguished Senator from Maine say it, I have heard the Senator from Idaho say it and others. There is no blanket accusation here that says everybody who goes to a gun show is a felon, an anarchist, a crook, a thug--not at all. But we want to protect those families who do go to gun shows with an earnest interest in seeing what is around and maybe buying a hunting rifle or what have you. Why should they be ashamed? Why should anybody be ashamed or unwilling to leave their name behind when they take this lethal weapon and stick it in their pocket? That is the problem. No matter how much language is thrown out here, we 
   ought to try to cut through it and see what the mission is. 
   The mission is to try to protect the NRA, not to protect the people of our country, the innocents who send their kids to school every day of the week and now pray that the children come back not only learned but safe and sound. That is the message we are trying to get across here. 
   We hear this obfuscational language: Well, if they had this and they had that and they didn't have measles and they had some other condition, then it is all right. 
   Stop with the loopholes. I offered an amendment yesterday which was clear and concise, which said that everybody who buys a gun ought to be identified and that those dealers who are unlicensed dealers, call them what you will, who can sell guns out of the trunk of their car in any quantity they want, to anybody they want, without getting so much as a name, except the cash on the barrelhead, walk away, someone buys 10 guns, there is not an ounce of suspicion raised about that. 
   We heard the Senator from Idaho yesterday say, well, a measly 2 percent, that is all, 2 percent of the guns sold in these gun shows, only 2 percent, are unlicensed. Then he was gentleman enough and sincere enough to say, I made a mistake; it wasn't 2 percent; it is 40 percent. Forty percent. Two percent. That is a significant difference. 
   So he said he realized only too late that 40 percent of the people who bought guns at gun shows bought them from unlicensed dealers--or 40 percent of the guns sold, forgive me, were from unlicensed dealers. 
   Well, that is pretty significant. That is a lot of guns floating out there that nobody has any record of, unless someone volunteers to leave their name. I do not see a lot of volunteers coming up throwing their photo ID on the counter and saying, hey, give me a dozen guns, will you. You don't see that happening. 
   We ought to clear the air, clear the language here, tell the American people, as they were told yesterday--I want everybody within earshot to remember this--yesterday there were 47 of us who voted to close a loophole. There were 51 people who voted to leave it open, to make sure that those who want to buy a gun without identifying themselves could still have the liberty to do so. 
   We hear all kinds of specious arguments--another bureaucratic imposition on free citizens in this country. We have laws in this country. We are a country of laws. It says so in our Constitution. If you have laws, you have to have a structure. You have to have an orderly process by which those laws are developed and enforced. Our job here is to develop them. 
   So what is wrong with having people enforce laws that we think otherwise might bring harm and injury to innocent people? I do not want my grandchildren going to school with other kids who might be able to get their hands on a gun because a father or a relative left the gun unattended. I think it is terrible. I think they ought to be responsible for the actions that that child who takes the gun brings upon his or her classmates or friends. 
   So we ought to clean up the language here so the American people know what we are talking about. Some of us are for closing the loophole and some of us are for leaving it open. 
   The vote yesterday was quite a revelation. It should have been for the American public. Yesterday 51 percent of the 
   people in this room said: Do not close the loophole. Do not take away the rights of someone who wants to be unidentified, anonymous, buying guns out there. Permit them to do it, because otherwise it is an infraction of their rights. If a neighbor wants to sell a gun to a neighbor, why shouldn't he be able to do it without having to go through the trouble of identifying him? 
   Try to give your neighbor your car and not take note of the transfer. If that neighbor has that car and it still has your name on it, you are responsible for it, whatever it is that happens. 
   We see immediately now in the presentation today some apologies. The apology is not for the American people. The apology is to those who might be inconvenienced because they have to identify themselves when they buy a  gun. We ought not to be apologizing to them. We ought to apologize to every parent, to every family, to everyone who might be injured by a gun that is bought, 40 percent of those guns that come out of gun shows without any identification. That is what we are talking about. We are clearly divided on the issue. 
   Now what has happened, there is kind of a fail-safe that has developed, because yesterday not only brought the picture into focus, but it also said to the American people, who are enraged by what is happening in these schools, enraged, pained--87 percent of the people in this country said close the loophole. But in this Senate, 51 percent said: No, don't close the loophole; we want to protect the rights of those who would buy guns as if it was in the dark of night. 
   So today we see an attempt at a legislative redress for the error that was made yesterday that was caught by the newspapers. It was caught by television. It was caught by the public at large, who are indignant. We hear it couched in flowery phrases--I didn't know there was that exception, or I didn't know there was this exception--when they heard from their constituents and the constituents were angry and mortified by the fact that their representative voted to keep open the loophole. 
   So now we are trying to figure out what it is exactly that is being proposed. If we are cynical and suspicious, we should be, because yesterday the vote was one way and today it suddenly dawns on them that maybe people who buy guns ought to really leave their name behind, regardless of whether the dealer is a federally licensed dealer or just someone who throws up a table and pays a $10 fee at a gun show. We are talking about the definition of ``gun show'' and the definition of ``dealer.'' Nonsense. We ought to talk about the lives that we can save, about the children that we can protect. I hope that the debate is going to get into that area before this discussion is over. 
   I hope that we look carefully at what is being proposed and study it because it came up all of a sudden--suddenly, to have an agreement that, OK, some people ought to have their names identified with their purchase but not for others. 
   Mr. President, I yield back my time with the understanding that we are going to be discussing this after the votes we are going to take.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a fairly complicated change, as I see it, from the original Lautenberg amendment. But certainly it has to be considered, in all due respect to the Senator from Utah. I know how hard he worked and how serious he is about it. We have great respect and friendship. But I wonder, because we are not able to reach an immediate time agreement, whether or not we could put it aside so that we can discuss our differences and see if we can come any closer together to try to resolve it. I, too, like everyone else, wish to see this bill moved, but I think we have not had enough time to really debate it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I heard the distinguished Senator from Utah say that the loopholes have been closed in what was initially the Lautenberg amendment request to close the loopholes and now the redesign of the Craig-Hatch response. It says that they closed the loopholes, that they have taken care of the problem. 
   I submit the problems are not taken care of. Maybe it is viewed by those who would like to just get this out of the way that the problems have been dealt with. 
   What were the problems initially? Mr. President, the problem was simply around whether or not there were loopholes through which lots of determinations would be made as to who is the purchaser of a gun. 
   The Senator from Idaho has said his revised amendment is going to close the gun show loophole. But it won't. And I think what we are seeing this evening is a response to what happened yesterday after the public had the chance to see the result of the vote count. It was 51 to 47 against closing the loopholes that derive from gun shows. We had a strong debate. There were six Republicans who joined in with all but two Democrats to say close the loopholes. We don't want people to be able to buy guns. We don't want people to be able to be induced by a so-called dealer at a gun show. 
   Over 4,000 gun shows a year are held, by the way. We don't want a dealer selling guns, someone selling guns who doesn't ask for your name, doesn't have to ask for your name, doesn't have to ask for your address, doesn't have to talk about anything that identifies this buyer. We are talking about buyers anonymous. That is what we are talking about--gun buyers anonymous. That is a pretty horrible specter to contemplate--gun buyers anonymous. 
   Mr. President, I want to make sure everyone understands what is happening here. 
   Yesterday, we had a vote that was defeated on an amendment that I wrote, a vote of 51-47. The 47 votes included all but two Democrats and did include six Republicans. 
   The fact of the matter is, when all was said and done, not enough was done because we lost the opportunity to close a loophole that applies especially to gun shows. 
   Let me take a moment to describe what a gun show is for those who don't know. It is fairly popular across this country. The President, in an address he made a couple of weeks ago, talked about how as a child he would go to gun shows. It was a family event. People would go to see what was being offered. They were curious. 
   I want to remove any suggestion, innuendo, or insinuation that says that gun shows are the gathering place for the degenerates, the thugs, the criminals. That is not suggested at all. 
   There are over 4,000 gun shows a year across this country. That is pretty significant. That is 80 a week, on average. There are lots of legitimate hunters, sports persons, et cetera, who go to these shows. 
   There is, however, an enormous loophole that should scare the life out of everybody in this country. That is the anonymous buyer, the buyer who can go in, step up to an exhibitor's table and say: I want to buy some guns. 
   The person on the other side of the table says: How many? 
   Give me 25. What do you have? Some nice sporting models, small ones with a comfortable pistol grip, those that we can trigger off a lot of shells? Because I like to do some target shooting. 
   The seller doesn't have to say: Who are you? All he has to say is: These 25 guns will cost you $2,500. The man says: OK, here are 25 fresh, hundred dollar bills, take these. 
   They shake hands. The guy gathers up his 25 guns and off he goes, we know not where. We don't know who he is; we don't know what town he comes from; we don't know whether he just got out of a mental institution or, worse, a prison. 
   We do not know anything about this man. Why in the world would there be resistance to closing that loophole? I do not understand it, I must tell you. 
   I come from New Jersey. Maybe we do have different cultural views about how life functions. We do not have much room for hunting and we do not have as many hunters as in our great wide open Western States. But all of us--whether from the East, West, North, South--respect life. I never saw a family whose principal interest was not the safety of their children, the education of their children, the caring for those children. Yet they are willing, in this house of the people, the U.S. Senate, to say: Listen, one thing you have to do is you have to protect citizens' rights to buy guns. Why do we need more bureaucratic interference with that process? 
   I don't understand, says one. Another says: Why should you have to wait a couple of days to get a gun? If you want to buy a gun, you ought to be able to buy it like a postage stamp--go to the store and buy it and get out of here. 
   Frankly, I think that is the wrong way to go. I am smart enough to know we are not about to propose legislation to take away everybody's gun. There is a serious debate about how guns should be managed. I think it is an earnest debate that ought to be carried on here. But to simply dismiss it because they say it is a bureaucratic intrusion, it is yet another law? I remind everybody that America, this country of ours, is a nation of laws. That is what makes this society as great as it is. When you have laws, you have to have law enforcers, whether it is police, whether it is drug agents, whether it is the FBI, whether it is the Army; we enforce our laws. To deny that is something that ought to be done because we want to protect the anonymous buyer who walks up and says, ``Give me a couple of guns, here is the money'' and not think about protecting the well-being of the children is not to look at Littleton, CO. 
   By the way, that is not a phenomenon that just existed there --Pearl, MS; West Paducah, KY; Oregon; Illinois. It has been throughout our society. School violence--we all tremble at the thought that our children are in a classroom where other kids have a gun, where other students are bent on violence, where they may be deranged, on drugs, psychotic. We all worry about that. I saw one of the parents from Columbine High School who said: This gun-toting society of ours is out of control. The worst thing is the accessibility of guns. 
   We get into a perennial argument here about whether or not it is the gun or the person who does the killing. It is not just criminals, unfortunately, who do the killing--until sometimes they become criminals for the first time--an enraged husband; a mentally deranged person, young, old, who suddenly, in a fitful moment, takes out a gun and commits his or her first crime with the murder of another person. 
   So what are we talking about? Frankly, I think at times we are talking gibberish, because the American public will not understand it. In a recent poll, 87 percent said it is necessary to close the loophole of anonymous buying at gun shows. That is what we are talking about. We failed to agree to that yesterday. Honestly, it was a very sorry defeat for us. Not for me personally--the fact that I authored the law. I authored the law with people's faces in mind, with an understanding about how much I love my children, four of  them, and my six grandchildren. Heaven forbid anything ever happens to them. 
   I know there is not a parent who can hear me who does not feel the same way about his or her children. There is no asset more valuable than our children--money, jewelry, houses--nothing means anything when it comes to our children. 
   Why do we insist that the buyer, the anonymous buyer of a gun, has to have protected his right or her right to be free from this bureaucratic society, this great country that everybody loves? Everybody wants to move to America, but we call it the great bureaucracy at times, instead of the great democracy. It is foul language, as far as I am concerned. 
   So we are offered a substitute. It is a substitute produced by two distinguished Senators, one from Utah and one from Idaho, who say they are going to close the loophole. But it does not. It does not require a background check for all gun sales at gun shows. Some licensees, Federal licensees, on a special form, do not require a background check. The provision for people who are not licensed would enable them to sell guns without, again, going through a background check. 
   There is another loophole. There is a category now called ``special licensees,'' that the Hatch-Craig amendment would create--a new bureaucracy, by the way, strangely enough. They are willing to concede a bureaucracy that would issue these special licenses is OK. But other bureaucracies are dangerous, dangerous to your individual rights. They would not have to conduct background checks. He did not change his original position, which makes background checks voluntary for special licensees. So, if you want to sell a gun and you are a special licensee, you can do it if you feel like it. But you do not do it unless you feel like it. You do not have to go through that nonsense--background check. It could take 10 minutes for a background check. Who wants to waste 10 minutes when you have a hot deal and you have other people there? 
   What happens at the gun shows, as I understand it--and I have never been, but this is as I hear it--is that there are often discounts by these unlicensed dealers who have acquired their guns--who knows how in many cases. They could say: We are special collectors. It has been established some of these collections are from criminals. Special collector? Hey, we will give you a cheap deal on these guns. Where a legitimate licensed dealer has a price, it is out there, it is public. They do have some expenses in maintaining their license--not a lot, but the unlicensed dealer: Here, I'll give you a real discount. Come here young man. You want to buy some nice guns? 
   It ought not be that way. These loopholes are still available. 
   It would not cover a flea market where there are tables with 100 or 200 or even more guns. It would not cover a gun show that had 10 exhibitors or fewer. Ten exhibitors could sell 500 guns, but they would not be covered. That is, if you will forgive me, a nonsensical hurdle. A couple of people could get together and say: You know what, let's put up one table. I have some of these to sell, she has some of those to sell, he has some of these to sell, and we will sell at one table, and that gets rid of two others, and we can reduce ourselves to 10 tables. Then we do not have to worry about those bureaucrats who want our names. Who are they? Imagine, those guys want our names, while we buy these lethal weapons. 
   Then there is another category. It says that if firearm exhibitors are not more than 20 percent of all exhibitors, they are exempt as well. So you have to have more than 20 percent of the materials being exhibited--it could be sporting materials, could be lifeboats, could be all kinds of things, skis, you name it--but if the firearms people do not have more than 20 percent, they do not have to do anything to get these people registered who are buying these guns. 
   It creates other loopholes. Even though prohibited persons are five times more likely to pawn their guns at a pawnshop than other citizens, this proposal from that side, those who say they are closing the loopholes, would say that anyone who has a claim ticket--whether they borrowed the money, they borrowed $200 for the gun--if they have the claim ticket, even if they do not show up for 60 days, if they pay the interest, they say the pawnshop dealer/owner has to just give them their gun without any questions--no questions asked. 
   This bird may have been in jail for 60 days, but they are not allowed to ask: Where have you been for the last 60 or 90 days? 
   Oh, no, that is a bureaucratic imposition; we do not want that. Another loophole. I do not, frankly, understand that. 
   Why are we protecting those who might be criminals who want to redeem their guns when the ordinary citizen who goes to buy a gun from a legitimate licensed dealer has to identify himself and undergo a background check? 
   There have been so many suggestions that the people who man this agency, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, are some kind of ogres, they are out to rob you of your independence, rob you of your thought. That is not true. They are there because we want them there to enforce the law. 
   The right to own a gun is one that is often debated, but so far I have not seen anything that confirms the fact that every citizen has a right to bear arms. We are not considering that question now, but the Court has ruled many times since 1939 that in order to have a well-regulated militia, the citizenry shall have the right to bear arms. That is quite a qualification. 
   In addition to the pawnshop loophole, there is another loophole, and that is, now suddenly federally licensed gun dealers who may be in the State of Massachusetts or the State of New Jersey or the State of Illinois--you name it--now can only sell firearms at a gun show in the same State as that specified on the dealer's license. The Craig amendment will give dealers an out-of-State license. It will broaden the geography of where that license can be used to all across the country without any checking. Without any further discussion, that license now is a lot broader than what was intended. 
   That is not closing a loophole to me; It is creating another one. It will make it harder for law enforcement people to crack down on shady dealers, and we do have some. 
   Years ago, there were more gun dealers than there were gas stations in this country. Not too many years ago, there were over 250,000; now it is slightly over 100,000. What we did was change the fee for licensed gun dealers from $30 for 3 years--$30 for 3 years, $10 a year and you never were checked or asked any questions--to $200 for 3 years, and that includes some kind of a check and some kind of a test you must pass in order to get that license. While we have reduced the number of dealers, the Craig amendment will open it up. 
   Everyone knows what the NRA response is going to be. That is the National Rifle Association. Their views were represented amply on the floor of the Senate. They say gun laws do not work; otherwise we would not have the kinds of killings that we do. 
   I do not think it is the gun law. I think it is the accessibility of guns. But I do point out that the number of murders by guns have reduced somewhat, not significantly enough, but they have been reduced. This country of ours, this wonderful democracy in which we live, sees 35,000 people a year die from handguns--35,000; 13,000 of them are murdered. Thirteen kids die every day from handguns, 4,000 a year. In 20 years, over 75,000 children will have died from gunshots. We have 18,000 suicides. We have 3,000 accidents from guns--guns, guns, guns, guns, guns, and people are dying from them. 
   Yet, I hear this cry through this place: Protect the liberty of the gun owner. I want to hear them say one time: My God, we are sorry about what happened in Littleton, CO. Our hearts bleed for them. When we look at the families, when we look at the children who lost their schoolmates, when we look at 
   those who were so frightened, we have to ask: What kind of protection are they entitled to? I think they are entitled to a lot of protection, but we continue here with loophole heaven. 
   I thought that Littleton would shock some of our friends into the realization that the public is sick and tired of it. They do not want it, and I do not understand why it is that the NRA insists that this is an encroachment on their  freedom just to say: Put your name down if you want to buy a gun. If you want to buy a car, you better put your name down or you are not going to buy the car. 
   Yet, that rage, that sense of grief, that sense of anguish has not yet reached this place. Mr. President, 87 percent of the people in America in a poll said they want these loopholes closed. We lost that vote yesterday, and now they come back with this wolf in sheep's clothing wanting to pretend that the loopholes are closed. But they are not. 
   I hope we will be able to get some control of gun violence in our society. There are a couple of ways we can do it: make parents responsible for what their kids do. If you give your child who is underage a car and he or she goes out and kills somebody, do you know who is responsible? It is the parent. Why then shouldn't a parent be responsible when a child takes a gun and kills his brother or his sister or his friend accidentally? We ought to get ahold of these things. This is an opportunity to show good faith to the American people, but we failed to take advantage of that opportunity to close it down. This will not take away their guns, except those we know do not qualify. 
   We hear complaints about the Brady bill. The Brady bill stopped over 250,000 unfit persons from fulfilling their desire to buy a gun--250,000. That is a lot to me. 
   I see my friend and colleague from Illinois is on the floor. If he wants to make some remarks, I will be happy to yield 10 minutes to the Senator.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I am managing the time on our side. I yield myself such time as remains for my response to what we have heard. 
   Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the speeches. If I may say, the rhetoric that was used here--decrying the Federal Government's efforts to curb crime, incriminating crime fighting within the jurisdiction of the Federal Government, and saying that we are not doing our job--it is outrageous to listen to, I must tell you, because these things are concoctions. There are few people who I have more respect for in this place than the distinguished Senator from Utah, but that does not mean that I do not think he is wrong in some of the things he has just said. I am responding with admiration and respect. 
   When we look at the ATF investigations, I hold here the report that is ``Gun Shows,'' issued January 1999, by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, Department of Justice, Department of the Treasury. It says: Together ATF investigations paint a disturbing picture of gun shows as a venue for criminal activity and a source of firearms used in crimes. Felons, although prohibited from acquiring firearms, have been able to purchase firearms at gun shows. In fact, felons buying or selling firearms were involved in more than 46 percent of the investigations involving gun shows. Firearms involved in the 314 reviewed investigations numbered more than 54,000. A large number of these firearms were sold or purchased at gun shows. 
   What I hear here is concern about protecting average citizens from inconvenience. What a terrible thing. Why should they have this big brother looking over their shoulder? Why 
   should we have speed limits? Why should we have laws against drugs? Why should we have laws against alcohol? Because this is a nation of laws. That is what we are about. That is what makes this society so distinctive. Instead, I haven't heard the pleas for the parents of those kids who have been killed by guns purchased, wherever they are. I haven't heard that. What I have heard is a nagging little complaint about, oh, what a pity, the infringement of the person who wants to go buy a gun who needs it in a hurry, sticks it in his pocket, walks out of the place without identifying himself. 
   Yes, the Hatch-Craig amendment does close some of the avenues for gun purchase, but it does not close them all, because if you are a special licensed purveyor, you don't have to do any checking at all. That is what the amendment says. Perhaps it is careless, perhaps it is deliberate, but it does not protect against that. 
   Then I hear a challenge to the President and his complaints about gun shows. He doesn't say that. He talks about gun shows with a degree of respect, but he says there are problems that have developed as a result of excesses available through gun shows. 
   I think we have to look at what is happening. Federal gun prosecutions: Overall violent and property crimes are down more than 20 percent each; the murder rate is down 28 percent, the lowest level in 30 years; homicides, robberies, and aggravated assaults committed with guns are down by an average of 27 percent. And yet, when we go ahead and talk about what we have to do to protect our citizens, we hear, get more enforcement out there, get more of a bureaucracy. 
   But when it comes to providing the money for ATF agents and Federal prosecutors, we have a heck of a time trying to get it. Despite the rhetoric, the NRA has never supported backing its tough talk with real money for State, local, and Federal law enforcement agencies to investigate, arrest, and prosecute gun criminals. 
   Well, the reason for the decline in prosecutions is that we work more now with State and local agencies than we ever did before. Overall, the rate of convictions and incarcerations has grown pretty steadily. 
   We are looking at what I will call straw men, reasons to find ways of not inconveniencing the gun buyer. Heaven forbid the gun buyer should have to obey the same laws that other people have to when they want to buy an automobile or buy liquor or what have you. There are regulations, and so it should be. That doesn't take away anybody's right to buy a drink or buy a car. You just have to fess up to it. If you want to buy a gun, in my view, you have to be able to say: This is my name; this is where I live; this is what I want to do. 
   If the audience was not obscured through a television camera or not away from the folks in front of you but, rather, were the parents and the families of the kids in Littleton, they would find that Americans blame the Littleton incident in significant measure on the availability of guns. They do not say there is too little prosecution. They don't say that the gun laws are cumbersome. What they say is there are too darned many guns in our society. 
   How much are each to blame for Littleton? Percentage responding, a great deal: availability of guns, 60 percent; parents, 51 percent; nearly all Americans support many gun control measures, particularly those aimed at kids; require 
   background checks on explosives and gun show buyers, national poll, 87 percent. 
   In here we have 51 percent who went the other way just yesterday and today want to, in my view, set up a smokescreen, pretend we closed all the loopholes. There is nothing malicious in it. They just happen to be wrong in the approach, because if they looked at their own amendment they would see there are loopholes--whether they are requiring Federal agencies to get rid of records so they are not kept for too long a time, leaving the pawnshop opening that we just heard about for someone who is away. I just spoke to the Senator from Idaho. I said: What would happen if the claimant, to retrieve a gun that is in a pawnshop, comes back 4 months later? Are they required to say anything about where they have been during this period? 
   No. No, there is no requirement. The Senator from Idaho said there is no requirement. The guy could have been in jail for 90 days. But the fact is that he has come back. He has paid his interest. He has paid his $50 to retrieve his gun. Give him his gun back. Don't ask any questions. 
   I ask you, is that bordering on the absurd? I think so. 
   We, again, hear these lame arguments about why we couldn't adopt the Lautenberg amendment as it was originally. And today, shame has filled this place, embarrassment has filled this place, because calls have come in and newspapers have editorialized and said what is the matter with the Senate--87 percent of the people out there think that gun shows are a source of too many weapons. 
   But not here. Here we worry about not the victim, not the parent, not the brother, the sister, or the child. No, we worry about the inconvenience or the big bureaucracy that may be created to  make it inconvenient or slow down the pace of gun acquisition. 
   Are there too few guns in this society? I ask anybody, too few guns? I doubt it. Something like over 200 million guns, that is enough to go around pretty well. 
   They blame our culture. We heard a story the other day from the Senator from Michigan who said that in Windsor, Canada, just across the river, they see the same television, are exposed to the same cultural elements, prefer the same music, everything else, yet they have so far fewer crimes with guns--about 30 or 40 times more in Detroit than they have in Windsor. It has to do with the availability of guns, nothing more and nothing less. 
   We ought to face up to it and not find different excuses for why it is that the gun wasn't involved. It is not the gun's fault, no; it is the trigger person's fault. But that trigger person would have had a heck of a time knifing the 13 or 15 people in the Columbine High School in the situation they were in. It was easy, however, with their weapons, with their explosives. It is time to face up to it. 
   I wish we would pay the same attention to the victims: 35,000 victims in a year of handgun death, 
   13,000 of murder, in rough numbers, 18,000 of suicides, 3,000 of accidents. When you compare us to the other societies with whom we associate and work, there is just no comparison. We are looking at societies that have less than 100 deaths a year from guns--the UK, Japan, and others. It just doesn't happen there. Why? These are similar people with the same kinds of problems we have. They have mixed societies and they have problems adjusting to conditions. But they don't have the guns laying around in every nook and cranny. 
   So I hope that the American people will watch what happens here and see who voted against the Lautenberg amendment yesterday because there are a couple loopholes that have been covered and yet many opened. I hope when we vote tomorrow, the public will be watching because the answers will have to be given to them.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Idaho, and I look forward to the discussion that will ensue, because we are going to decide, with serious debate, whether or not we are going to close this gun show loophole which, as demonstrated in this chart, shatters the image of the Brady bill that has been responsible for obstructing gun purchases 250,000 times in the years it has been in business. 
   Some of my colleagues are well aware of criminals who have used gun shows to purchase guns to kill, maim and destroy the lives of others. 
   I am going to talk about specific examples. Most of my colleagues also know that there are thousands of gun shows across the country each year. Last year, over 4,400 gun shows were advertised in the Gun Show Calendar, a trade publication. 
   Ordinarily, these shows are held in public arenas, civic centers, et cetera. The gun seller rents a table--it could be a card table or any kind of a table--from a gun show promoter to display material for a fee ranging from $5 to $50. The number of tables at shows vary from as few as 50 to as many as 2,000. 
   Fortunately, most of the people who participate in gun shows are law-abiding citizens. Many families look forward to a Saturday or a Sunday spent at a gun show. But these families are not aware that they may be in the presence of dangerous criminals who use gun shows as cash-and-carry convenience stores. 
   I mentioned before there are many criminals who use gun shows as a place to shore up their weaponry to commit mayhem. In 1993, Gian Ferri, a mentally disturbed man with a grudge against lawyers, used a TEC-DC9 to kill eight people and wound six others in a San Francisco law office. He walked in there and started shooting. He bought the gun at a gun show. 
   In 1987, Robert Mire escaped from a Florida prison and got his weapons at a gun show to launch a lengthy robbery spree. Mire then took his own life when confronted by law enforcement at a Tampa gun show in 1991. 
   Perhaps the most notorious criminals associated with gun shows are Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols. They used gun shows to raise money for the Oklahoma City bombing episode that took place in 1995. 
   In fact, a recent study by the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Justice reveals that thousands of firearms from gun shows wind up in the hands of criminals. This may be just the tip of the iceberg. Because many vendors are not required to keep records of their sales, there is no way to precisely know how many firearms from gun shows wind up in the hands of criminals or the mentally unstable and children. 
   The threat that gun shows pose for our children became clear with the terrible tragedy in Littleton, CO. Although all of the facts are not in yet, it appears that a female associate of the killers, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, purchased some of the guns that were used in the attack at a gun show. Regrettably, it has become clear to our youth that gun shows provide easy access to weapons. 
   How did we get to this point? The problem is a loophole in Federal gun laws. The Brady law requires that federally licensed gun dealers complete a background check and keep certain records when they sell a firearm, whether at a gun store or at a gun show. But many individuals can sell firearms without a license, and they are not required to conduct a background check. 
   Since between 25 and 50 percent of the gun sellers at gun shows are not licensed, tens of thousands of firearms are sold at these events with no background checks or recordkeeping. You can just walk into a gun show, put down your cash, and walk away with a shotgun, a semiautomatic handgun, or any other deadly weapon you can get your hands on. Of course, you can also sell a deadly weapon. If you have stolen a gun or are involved in a gun trafficking scheme, gun shows provide an easy opportunity to distribute firearms. 
   While the gun show loophole helps criminals further their deadly schemes, it also places federally licensed firearms dealers--people who bought a license through the Federal Government and have been checked out--at a competitive disadvantage when it comes to the gun shows, because these guys can just sell it from their table, they can sell it from the back of their car, and they can sell as many as they want. They do not care who they sell it to, and they do not even have to ask the person's first name. Just give me the cash. I don't know if they use credit cards. Give me the cash and here are the guns you want. 
   When federally licensed firearms dealers participate in a gun show, they have to comply with a background check and recordkeeping requirements of the Brady law. It is so simple but so appropriate. 
   But an unlicensed seller at the next table can make unlimited sales to any person who comes up with the cash without any requirements. 
   The ease of these sales drains significant business from the law-abiding gun store owners and other licensees and penalizes them for following the law. So there are a good many reasons to close the gun show loophole, and there is no excuse not to. We have to act, and act now, to help make our communities safer. 
   The amendment I am proposing would take several simple steps to prevent illegal activity at gun shows. First, I point out that this amendment is very clearly designed for gun shows, the places where these unlicensed dealers sell to anybody they want. Gun shows are defined as an event where two or more people are selling 50 or more firearms. So this amendment does not cover someone who is selling their favorite gun to a friend or a club member or a neighbor. 
   The key provision would require that all gun sales go through a federally licensed firearms dealer. So if the person who is unlicensed wants to sell a gun to somebody over here, he then has to include a federally licensed firearms dealer in the process. The federally licensed firearms dealer then would be responsible for conducting a Brady check on the purchaser. This ensures that the prohibited purchasers--criminals, the insane, and children--cannot buy guns. This will not burden the vast majority of collectors or hunters or sportsmen who want to buy firearms.  
   Of course, a gun sale may take a few more minutes, but why not? This minor inconvenience is a small cost to pay. And if you do not believe that, ask the 61 percent of the American people who think that the accessibility of firearms had a large measure of responsibility in the killings that took place at Columbine High School. This minor inconvenience is a small cost to pay when weighed against the need to keep guns out of the wrong hands. 
   My amendment would also take other steps to help the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms investigate gun crimes and to help law enforcement prosecute criminals. 
   Taken together, these provisions will prevent criminals from abusing gun shows to buy deadly weapons. For many Americans, as we note, these commonsense steps seem so obvious. They are probably wondering why we have not addressed this problem sooner. Frankly, I do, too. Well, I don't wonder, because there is an influence around here and around the House of Representatives that always intervenes when we try to get commonsense legislation in place. 
   We are not taking away guns from people who have a legitimate right to buy them. But we are saying that gun violence is an unacceptable condition in our country. 
   In the last 20 years, over 70,000 children have lost their lives--70,000 families stricken with grief--because of the availability of a gun, obviously, we think, in the hands of the wrong person. 
   I do not want to point any fingers or try to assess blame, but this is not the time for partisan politics. This is not the time for organizations, such as the NRA, that stand in the way of any sensible, commonsense legislation every time we bring it up--87 percent of the people in a poll just conducted said they want the gun show loophole closed. Why do we have to fight to make it happen? 
   Everybody--every one in this Chamber--ought to stand up and salute it and say, yes, we want to save the lives of our kids who are going to school. Do they have the right to bear arms? That is a question, but we know people have a right to bear children. And we think they have a right to see these children live safely and that when they go to school, they do not have to worry as much about whether they are going to be injured or perhaps even killed than whether they do their homework. 
   Our country has seen too much violence. Every year in this country over 4,000 children lose their lives to guns. Every day, 13 kids, on average, are gunned down by a gun, either in their own hand or someone else's. Too many parents have seen their children injured or killed. Too many families have been torn apart by grief and anguish as a result of the absence in their lives of a child they brought to this world. 
   So, please, let us work together to pass this measure. I plead with my colleagues: Step up to the plate and be people of honor, people of concern. Let's try to prevent future tragedies. Let's make it harder for young people and criminals to gain access to guns. 
   I think we are reaching a consensus on this issue. We are going to find out in a few minutes. There is a broad range of bipartisan support for closing the gun show loophole. Also, there is a broad spectrum of organizations that support this amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I have also received support, surprisingly--and I say, hooray--from some in the gun industry. The American Shooting Sports Council, which represents the interests of gun manufacturers, and the National Shooting Sports Foundation have both endorsed my legislation. They say, ``Support the amendment that is proposed closing the gun show loophole.'' 
   The National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers, the trade association for gun dealers, has endorsed this legislation. I would like to read part of their letter:  
   While it is uncommon for our organization to endorse legislation that would place any new regulations upon the sale of guns, we view the case of gun shows as an exception. 
   As your legislation creates no new requirements or regulations that don't already exist for law-abiding gun owners, we find it a reasonable and necessary change to existing laws and fully endorse the gun shows accountability act.  
   It is a letter that they sent to me. 
   There are prominent Republican politicians--this isn't exclusively a Democratic matter--who support closing the gun show loophole, for instance, Texas Governor George W. Bush, a prominent name in national politics, as well as the Governor of one of the largest States in this country. Congressman HENRY HYDE, a distinguished, respectable Congressman--he has always been a supporter of gun ownership--supports eliminating the gun show loophole. 
   The amendment is also supported by Jim and Sarah Brady's Handgun Control, Incorporated, and the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence, which represents a number of health, religious and civil rights organizations. 
   When Sarah Brady, George W. Bush, HENRY HYDE, gun manufacturers and gun dealers get behind closing a loophole, I think everybody here ought to listen, and we ought to close it. We ought to close that loophole, because what happens in that loophole is children fall through it, and lives, way too early, are permanently maimed as a result. 
   All you have to do is remember a picture of the boy jumping out of the window at Columbine High and see what has happened to him. He is damaged, severely damaged. It looks as if those damages are going to last all of his life, impairing his speech, his ability to walk, and so forth. 
   Americans are tired of it. They are tired of losing those lives to gun violence. Again, I do not understand why the opposition is trying to say, no, let's leave the loophole there. Let's make sure that we don't inhibit those purchases of guns by anybody who just wants to buy them. 
   I do not understand it. I am sure the American people, whether they are here or watching television and seeing what is going on, don't want to have that loophole continue to exist. 
   Every year we lose 34,000 Americans to gunfire. It is the number of deaths that we would expect to see in a war. In Vietnam, a terrible, terrible period in American history, we lost 58,000 people in the 11 years of that war. Here we see more than half of that number lost every year. When will the public's rage finally reach into this place and say we have had enough? Instead, there is a war going on in our communities. We have to stop this senseless slaughter. 
   Every day, 13 young lives end prematurely. The hopes and the dreams of 13 children, their families, their friends are destroyed. 
   I urge my colleagues to take this step with all of us holding together in the battle against gun violence. Let those who want to oppose this legislation think about what they would say to a neighbor or a friend or someone in their community who lost a child: Well, he had the right to bear arms, or guns don't kill, people kill. 
   They always blame it on the criminal. But for a lot of people, the first time they commit a crime is when they pull the trigger on that weapon. 
   I hope we are going to pass this amendment, make it harder for criminals and children to get guns. We might not stop all the shootings, but we may stop some. I hope that the American people will notice everybody who votes for and against this amendment or what they try to do to water it down, to leave a glaring loophole sitting there. 
   Mr. President, how much time do I have?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I listened with interest and felt like the famous philosopher from New Jersey, Yogi Berra, who said, ``This is deja vu all over again,'' because the Senator from Idaho and I have sharply disagreed on what constitutes freedom. 
   I think there is a freedom that overrides all the others--the freedom to live, the freedom to send your children to school and not worry about whether or not they are going to get shot and permanently injured or worse yet, killed. 
   The Senator from Idaho points out the fact that there is only a small percentage--he corrected that; he is an honest man. He corrected the percentage he ascribed to gun show purchases away from licensed dealers. A small percentage he said. What are we talking about? What percentage did it take to kill 13 kids in Littleton, CO? It could have been done with 1 percent or less. Four weapons, all of which had a history of gun show traveling. 
   Four weapons killed those children. Ask those families whether they want tighter control or whether they are  worried about the menace that the Senator from Idaho presented. The menace, he says, is a bigger bureaucracy. How about the menace of losing your child? Where does that stand in the list of things? No, it is important that the Federal Government doesn't intervene; we ought to get rid of the Federal Government. Maybe we do not need any laws. 
   He said only a small percentage are violators. Yes, we have in our country over 100 million cars on the road, but we have laws against drunk driving; we have laws against reckless driving; we have laws against speeding. Why? Because even though a car is a nice convenience, it can be a lethal weapon if it is mishandled. 
   What is wrong with saying we ought to take some time, we ought to make records? I do not understand this sham attempt to obscure reality. 
   He said we don't want to interfere; we will let private citizens--let a private citizen go to an FBI file and say: Listen, I want to look up this guy, and tell me what you will. 
   A private citizen going to the FBI to find out what kind of history this person has, whether they have mental disease or mental illness or whether or not they have ever been in jail, in private records? But, no, we can't trivialize the gun show business. We are not trivializing it. We say if you want to buy a gun at a gun show, then let a licensed Federal dealer offer a check. 
   The Senator from Idaho and I had a disagreement a few years ago about whether or not spousal abusers ought to be deprived of their right to own a gun. Beat up your wife as many times as you want, but you still should have your gun. We won that one. It took a heck of a fight to win it, and they are still trying to upset it, but the court upheld our right to say no to a spousal abuser, you don't have a right to own a gun if you are going to abuse your family. Mr. President, 150,000 times a year a woman has a gun put to her head with the threat: I am going to kill you. And the children are watching. What kind of trauma is that?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, my amendment is pretty simple. It does nothing more than close a loophole--that exists at gun shows--from the Brady law. The loophole allows criminals, children, and other prohibited persons to purchase guns at gun shows without a background check, without giving them a name, without giving them an address. Just take it away. Pay your money and take your gun. 
   Some people may be surprised to hear you can walk into a show, put your money on the table, walk away with a shotgun, semiautomatic, handgun or any other deadly weapon that you want to get your hands on. It is an unacceptable condition. We have to insist that all gun purchases at gun shows go through the background checks that a gun store has to have or that any federally licensed gun dealer will have to have. 
   Law-abiding citizens have nothing to fear from this amendment. They can buy a gun to the limits already established. All they have to do is consent to an instant background check which takes only minutes. This won't inconvenience. It will save lives and reduce injuries. 
   This isn't a time for partisan politics. Our country has seen too much gun violence. If we reflect a little bit, see what happened in Colorado. Understand that at Columbine High School those guns traveled their way through gun shows to get into the hands they did. Too many parents have seen their children killed. Too many families have been torn with grief as they understand what has happened to a child--unbelievably, in a school. 
   Let us work together. I plead with my colleagues, let us pass this measure. Who does it hurt? It doesn't hurt anybody 
   and it may save someone. Let's make it harder for young people and criminals to gain access to guns. 
   I think we are reaching a consensus on this issue. There is a broad range of bipartisan support for closing the gun show loophole. An extraordinary alliance supports closing the gun loophole, including gun dealers, law enforcement, Republicans, Democrats, the Bradys.  
   I hope we can come together, pass this amendment, and show the American people that Democrats and Republicans alike, the gun industry, law enforcement and handgun control, can put partisan politics aside and pass this commonsense legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am announcing new legislation that will go even further in taking drunk drivers off the road. This legislation means three strikes and, then, you lose your license. 
   This would set nation-wide standards for license revocation for drunk drivers. Currently, states have a patchwork of laws that range from a fifteen day suspension to a ten year revocation for a third offense. This bill would require that all states adopt at least the following for each level of conviction, otherwise they would face a 10 percent cut in their highway funds. 
   For the first offense, this bill calls for a six-month license revocation, $500 fine, and assessment of alcohol abuse. If a person's blood alcohol content (BAC) is .16 or greater, his or her punishment includes a ceiling of .05 BAC for the next five years, impoundment/immobilization of his car for 30 days, an ignition interlock for 180 days, and 10 days in jail or 60 hours of community service. 
   For the second offense, the repeat offender receives a one year license revocation, a ceiling of .05 BAC for the next five years, impoundment/immobilization of his or her car for 60 days, ignition interlock for a year, 10 days jail or 60 hours of community service, and an assessment of alcohol abuse. 
   And, finally, for the third offense, the repeat offender will lose his driver's license permanently. 
   With a tough license-revocation law, we can save hundreds of lives each year. This is the next logical step in the fight against drunk driving. It will build on what we started in 1984, when Democrats and Republicans joined together to increase the drinking age to 21. Back then, the liquor lobby issued all kinds of dire warnings that the industry would not survive that legislation. But of course, the industry did survive. And more than 10,000 drunk-driving deaths were prevented. 
   We need this legislation. Remember, drunk-driving deaths are not ``accidents.'' They are the result of somebody's irresponsible and criminally reckless behavior.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, the Concealed Firearms Prohibition Act, that would help make our communities safer. 
   Across the country, citizens are looking for ways to stop gun violence. They see their families torn apart, their friends lost forever, and their communities shattered. And they wonder what has gone wrong in a nation where more than 30,000 people are killed by gunfire each year. 
   One area of growing concern is concealed weapons. Recently, the NRA tried to push a measure that would have allowed more concealed weapons in Missouri. They spent about $4 million trying to pass their referendum. But the voters responded with a resounding ``no.'' They do not want more people secretly carrying weapons in their schoolyards, malls, stadiums and other public places. 
   Regrettably, there are still too many politicians who will not listen to the people. They insist on marching in lockstep with the NRA. They actually want to escalate the arms race on our streets. They try to suggest that if more people are carrying guns, our neighborhoods will be safer. That position simply defies common sense. The answer to gun violence is not a new version of the Wild West, with everyone carrying a gun on his or her hip, taking the law into their own hands. 
   Every day people get into arguments over everything from traffic accidents to domestic disputes. Maybe these arguments lead to yelling, or even fisticuffs. But if people are carrying guns, those conflicts are much more likely to end in a shooting, and death. And since some States allow individuals to carry concealed weapons with little or no training in the operation of firearms, there is a greater chance that incompetent or careless handgun users will accidentally injure or kill innocent bystanders. 
   More concealed weapons on our streets will also make the jobs of law enforcement officers more dangerous and difficult. But you do not need to take my word for this, Mr. President. Just ask the men and women in law enforcement. In fact, the Police Executive Research Forum did just that. In their 1996 survey, they found that 92 percent of their membership opposed legislation allowing private citizens to carry concealed weapons. 
   Mr. President, although the regulation of concealed weapons has been left to States, it is time for Congress to step in to protect the public. All Americans have a right to be free from the dangers posed by the carrying of concealed handguns, regardless of their State of residence. And Americans should be able to travel across State lines for business, to visit their families, or for any other purpose, without having to worry about concealed weapons. 
   Besides the strong Federal interest in ensuring the safety of our citizens, there are other reasons why this area requires Congressional intervention. Beyond the lives lost and ruined, crimes committed with handguns impose a substantial burden on interstate commerce and lead to a reduction in productivity and profitability for businesses around the Nation. Moreover, to ensure its coverage under the Constitution's commerce clause, my bill applies only to handguns that have been transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or that have parts or components that have been transported in interstate or foreign commerce. This clearly distinguishes the legislation from the gun-free school zone statute that was struck down in the Supreme Court's Lopez case. 
   Mr. President, the bottom line is that more guns equal more death. This legislation will help in our struggle to reduce the number of guns on our streets, and help prevent our society from becoming even more violent and dangerous.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today as a cosponsor of the pending resolution authorizing the use of ``all necessary force and other means'' to address the crisis in Kosovo. I know our vote will be a procedural one, and that the Senate may well vote to table the resolution. 
   I would therefore urge my colleagues to demonstrate their support for the resolution by joining the distinguished senior Senator from Arizona, Senator MCCAIN, and the Ranking Member of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator BIDEN, and others who have cosponsored this legislation. 
   I am heartened by this bipartisan support for President Clinton's leadership of NATO efforts to stop the killing in Kosovo and allow ethnic Albanians to return and rebuild their homes under the protection of a NATO-led peacekeeping force. 
   Mr. President, we are not debating whether our values and interests merit the engagement of our armed forces. 
   President Bush first issued the so-called Christmas warning in 1992, threatening the use of force if Yugoslav forces moved against Kosovo. President Clinton renewed that pledge soon after taking the oath of office for the first time. Unlike our colleagues in the other body, the Senate clearly voted to authorize the President to conduct air operations and missile strikes against Yugoslavia. 
   Why did we do so? Why does the fate of ethnic Albanians in a province of what remains of Yugoslavia matter to the American people? 
   Because fundamental United States interests and values are at stake. 
   The first is the credibility of the United States as a moral leader in establishing rules of civilized behavior among countries, to take a stand against mass killings and mass rapes and mass expulsions of innocent civilians wherever they occur. 
   The second is the promise of developed nations banding together to enforce these standards of conduct, as members of NATO are doing through joint military action against Belgrade. 
   At the fiftieth anniversary Summit, the leaders of nineteen democracies strengthened the Euro-Atlantic partnership so we can more often act--particularly in Europe--in concert with allies who generally share our interests and values and who have the capability to undertake fully integrated military operations alongside U.S. armed forces. 
   Those nineteen heads of state and government were joined by the leaders of many other nations in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council expressing solidarity to address the threat to European security from the Milosevic regime in Belgrade. 
   Third is the credibility of United States threatening the use of force when appropriate. 
   We have followed through on declarations made by President Bush and President Clinton. Now we must prevail. Otherwise, our leadership around the world will not be taken seriously, and we may find our interests threatened more in the future. 
   Fourth, we must stop conflicts early, before a small but intense fire becomes a widespread conflagration. 
   We must help neighboring states, particularly Albania and Macedonia and Montenegro, confront the challenge of helping hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians driven out of their native Kosovo. We have already seen the pressure which Belgrade has brought to bear by flooding these countries with refugees. 
   One cannot fully predict what will happen if we do not prevail, stopping these crimes against humanity, this genocide in the Balkans, rather than permitting this abhorrent behavior to become an ordinary means of controlling events. 
   Finally, I would remind my colleagues, Mr. President, that Milosevic and his police and military forces are killing people and raping women and driving families from their homes based on their ethnicity--they are committing unacceptable acts. We have an obligation and a responsibility to act to stop genocide. 
   We cannot stand by and allow these massacres to continue and claim to stand for what is right in this world? 
   Mr. President, the United States Senate has already decided that our national interests and values justify the engagement of our armed forces. NATO air power has struck targets in Yugoslavia for more than a month now. 
   There are signs Belgrade's will to resist may be faltering. Therefore, we should not be showing weakness, because civilized values will certainly be under assault. 
   We must have history reflect that such appalling behavior will trigger sharp rebuff by democratic, life-respecting nations. 
   Milosevic cannot seriously question the military superiority of NATO. Despite some losses, we have managed to sustain a serious air campaign with relative impunity. We have overwhelming force on our side. 
   Milosevic is instead pinning his hopes on NATO lacking the unity and political will to use the necessary force to prevail. 
   The time has come to disabuse him of these delusions. This resolution will tell Milosevic that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to halt and reverse his campaign of terror against the people of Kosovo. 
   Let me address some of the questions raised by my colleagues who may not support the pending legislation: Does this Resolution mean the United States and our NATO allies will fight their way into Kosovo on the ground? Should we not give air power more time to be effective? Why not negotiate an end to the conflict? 
   The resolution would authorize the President ``to use all necessary force and other means, in concert with United States allies.......'' That would authorize use of resources if the President determines this is necessary. The President has asked us to be patient, to give air power time to achieve Belgrade's acceptance of NATO conditions. 
   While I am reluctant to wait while the killing and the rapes and the expulsions continue, as a practical matter it will take some time--perhaps months--to plan and mount a ground campaign. NATO Secretary General Solana has rightly decided to update plans for the use of ground forces to liberate Kosovo and escort more than a million displaced Kosovars back to their homes. 
   By signaling our readiness to commit ground forces if necessary, we can actually improve prospects for Belgrade's capitulation. In any case, the United States should participate in an international force to maintain stability and protect the civilian population of Kosovo, though our European partners will appropriately take the lead in such an effort. 
   Negotiations are taking place. Former Russian Prime Minister Victor Chernomyrdin, United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan, and others are trying to mediate a solution. This is all well and good, so long as these mediators understand that we will not negotiate away the principles NATO has set out as conditions for an end to the bombing. 
   We all appreciate Reverend Jesse Jackson's courageous intervention to secure the release of the three American soldiers captured on the Yugoslav/Macedonian border. However, we cannot accept the ostensibly humane act of their release as a license for Milosevic's forces to continue the mayhem, rape, and killing they are committing even as we speak.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, our cause is just. Our objectives are reasonable. President Clinton has thus far insisted that Kosovo be granted substantial autonomy within the borders of Yugoslavia. 
   We should be prepared to do whatever is necessary to prevail, to stop the killing and the rapes and the expulsions, to reverse ethnic cleansing. 
   We must stand up for what is right. I hope my colleagues will agree and will join me in supporting this legislation. 
   Mr. President, I plan to vote against the motion to table the Resolution. I believe the Senate has the right and the responsibility to clearly address this issue. 
   And I hope that this Senate, given the opportunity to vote on the Resolution, will rise to the occasion and clearly authorize the President to do what it takes, together with our NATO allies, to prevail over the Milosevic regime, to stop the killing in Kosovo and help bring peace and stability to a troubled region of Europe. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise to support walling off all Social Security surpluses and in strong opposition to the pending Social Security lockbox. 
   I stand in opposition to the Social Security lockbox proposal that is in front of us because I believe this legislation is a lockbox in name only. In reality, instead of protecting Social Security benefits, I believe it would actually threaten them, and I think the threat is a serious one. It could cause a Government default and trigger worldwide economic instability. 
   Before I review the problem with the Social Security lockbox, I will take a minute to talk about saving Social Security and my continuing hope that we can address this issue in the near future. 
   I am fairly optimistic, Mr. President, but I have heard a lot of gloomy comments about the prospects for legislation to protect and preserve Social Security for the future. I hope we do not give up on this. 
   I do not want to be critical in any way of any of my colleagues. I know many are concerned that this issue is just too hot to handle politically, but I do not see it that way. In fact, I think we have a unique opportunity this year to really prepare our country for the future, and it is an opportunity we should seize. 
   President Clinton has made Social Security reform a top priority. He is in his second term and is eager to take on this politically difficult task and can lend us the leadership it requires. We are now in pretty good financial shape. We are projecting budget surpluses for years to come. And with the economy going so strong, our Nation is ready to accept some of the hard choices that will be necessary to get the job done. 
   If we cannot solve the Social Security problem now, I would ask, When can we? This is the time to act, and we need to do it soon before we get too close to the next year's Presidential election. And we need to do it on a bipartisan basis. Frankly, that is the only way it can be done--through direct negotiations between the congressional leadership of both parties in both Houses and the White House. 
   One thing should be clear to everyone, and that is that the Social Security lockbox amendment before us does not represent Social Security reform. It does nothing to prepare our country for the financial pressures which will be created when the baby boomers retire. It does not extend Social Security solvency by even a single day. I just hope it will not be used as an excuse to avoid dealing with Social Security in a real and meaningful way. 
   I have reviewed this before, but I want to again recount for my colleagues the three serious problems I see with this legislation. 
   First, it directly threatens Social Security benefits. Treasury Secretary Rubin has explained in a letter that under this proposal an unexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social Security checks, as well as Medicare, veterans', and other benefits. 
   Additionally, the amendment contains a huge loophole that would allow Social Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than direct Social Security benefits. Anything the Congress labels as ``Social Security reform'' would be exempt from the lockbox. So this could include privatization plans that might be risky, tax cuts, or who knows what. 
   I know some of my colleagues dispute my interpretation of this provision. But I would simply point to the broad language of the legislation itself. It effectively exempts from the lockbox any legislation which includes a provision designating itself as Social Security reform. So if Congress passes a big tax cut, even if it provides significant benefit to wealthy retirees, we can just claim that this represents Social Security reform, and all the costs of the legislation will be exempt from the lockbox. Some of the bill's cosponsors may say that is not their intent. But that is what the bill says. 
   I would like to be able to offer an amendment to correct this problem. The majority, however, has prohibited us from offering any amendments whatsoever. So we have had little opportunity to do anything but point out the loophole. 
   Mr. President, the second major problem with the pending bill is that it does absolutely nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows Congress to squander funds needed for Medicare on tax breaks which go largely to the wealthier among us. 
   Senator CONRAD and I have developed a different lockbox to protect both Social Security and Medicare. Our bill, S. 862, would reserve all of the Social Security surpluses exclusively for Social Security, and 40 percent of the non-Social Security surpluses for Medicare. We would like an opportunity to offer that lockbox amendment to this bill, but again the majority is blocking all of these amendments. 
   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the Republicans' so-called lockbox threatens a potential Government default. In the short term this could undermine our Nation's credit standing and increase interest costs. Ultimately, it could block benefit payments and lead to a worldwide economic crisis. That is why the Treasury Secretary, Robert Rubin, has said he would recommend that the President veto the bill if it ever reaches his desk. 
   Mr. President, the lockbox Senator CONRAD and I have developed avoids the risk of default, while protecting both Social Security and Medicare. Our lockbox would not establish a new debt limit. It would use supermajority points of order and across-the-board cuts to guarantee enforcement. I think it is a far better, more responsible approach. 
   So I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this legislation. Let's establish a Social Security lockbox. In fact, let's establish a Social Security and Medicare lockbox. Let's make it a real, responsible lockbox, not one that actually, in its implementation, could threaten Social Security benefits, risking a worldwide financial crisis. And then, Mr. President, let's sit down with the White House and negotiate a compromise which will truly protect Social Security and Medicare for the long term. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, with all due respect and friendship for my colleague, the chairman of the Committee on the Budget, we both would like to get to the same place. I am sure he has never heard me use terms like ``embezzlement.'' I don't do that kind of stuff. Frankly, I do not like that terminology. I don't care from where it comes. 
   But what we see here is what I would call a couple of escape hatches in the legislation that worry the devil out of us. That is, perhaps in the interest of Social Security reform or retirement security, we are locking ourselves into a position where we would be unable to respond to changes in the economy. That is not where we ought to be. 
   This economy is too important in the whole world scheme of things. It is too important in terms of those who are very dependent, totally dependent, in some cases, on the benefits derived from Social Security, veterans' benefits, Medicare. That is all they have in many cases. With the threat of creating a debt limit, and I think artificially creating a new debt limit, I think we could immediately be damaging the possibility that these benefits might be offered. 
   That is where we differ. I always enjoy my work with the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, except when he wins, which we does so often. But other than that, we ought to be able to sit down and reason out some of these things. 
   I hope this vote, by discouraging cloture, will give us some impetus to sit down and try to work the problems out. 
   I yield back the remainder of my time.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, throughout my career in the Senate I have made the fight against crime one of my top legislative priorities. Consequently, it gives me great pleasure to recognize the career and accomplishments of one of New Jersey's most distinguished public servants, Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly of the Newark Police Department. 
   For years, the City of Newark has faced many challenges. But I am proud to say today Newark is now a city on the rise. There are many people to thank and recognize for the rebirth of New Jersey's largest city. Today, I would like to thank Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly in particular. Chief O'Reilly has devoted more than four decades of his life to serving the city of Newark as a police officer. His service to the city began on December 10, 1956, when he joined the Police Department. He started as a patrol officer and rose through the ranks to Detective, Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Inspector, Deputy Chief, Chief-of-Staff and finally Police Chief. 
   Tonight, April 29, 1999, Chief Thomas C. O'Reilly will be honored by the city of Newark and I am happy to join the many voices who will thank him for his career on the front lines of law enforcement. We are indebted to him for his service. Those who follow him as Police Chief have a spendid model of leadership to follow. Chief Thomas O'Reilly's level of commitment and dedication to the safety of Newark's residents represents our nation's finest traditions of community service.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Like all the Democrats, I strongly support the purported goal of this amendment to secure the future funding of Social Security. I, like some of the other speakers on our side, believe this legislation is seriously flawed. We cannot rely on this plan to protect Social Security. 
   This lockbox, by any other name, could be called a leaky sieve. First, the amendment poses a direct threat to Social Security beneficiaries. Treasury Secretary Rubin has explained that under the proposal, an unexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social Security checks, as well as Medicare, veterans, and other benefits. 
   Additionally, the amendment changes a huge loophole, a minefield that would allow Social Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than Social Security benefits. It is described as Social Security ``reform'' that would be exempt from the lockbox. That tells us beware, be on your guard, because it says something along the way might permit us, in the interest of reform, to divert funds that should be directed exclusively to Social Security. Things suggested could be risky privatization plans, tax cuts--who knows what? 
   The second problem with the amendment is that it does absolutely nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows Congress to use what might be necessary funds for Medicare on tax breaks for wealthy individuals. I had hoped to be able to offer an amendment to establish a lockbox, one that is truly locked, one that is truly secure, to protect both Social Security and Medicare. That lockbox proposal would reserve all of Social Security surpluses exclusively for Social Security, and 40 percent of the non-Social Security surpluses for Medicare. Unfortunately, the majority is unwilling to even give us an opportunity to offer an amendment. They are not willing to subject it to the wishes of the Senate. Why? Is there something they are afraid of? 
   Finally, and perhaps most importantly, this amendment could present us with a Government default in the long term. In the short term, it could undermine our Nation's credit standing and increase interest costs. Ultimately, blocked benefit payments could lead to a world economic crisis. Our Nation has never defaulted on an obligation that is backed by the full faith and credit of our country. Yet, according to the Treasury Secretary, Bob Rubin, who is very respected, the 
   creditworthiness of the United States could be subject to very serious risks if this legislation were enacted, and that is why he would recommend the President veto the bill if it ever reached his desk. 
   We Democrats have a proposal, a lockbox that protects both Social Security and Medicare, and our lockbox would not require a new debt limit, and it would not risk a default. It would use supermajority points of order and across-the-board cuts to guarantee enforcement. That is a better, more responsible approach. Unfortunately, the majority is not going to give us an opportunity to present our plan to the Senate. I do not think it is right. I wish we could have a reversal of the majority opinion or the majority view on that. 
   Social Security lockbox legislation is a new proposal. It has not gone through a committee. It has not been subjected to hearings. In fact, it was not even introduced until a couple of days ago, and it resulted from a conference in the privacy of a single room. Yet the majority is using parliamentary tricks to prevent us from offering any amendments to improve the bill. It is not the right way to do business, especially given the high stakes involved both for Social Security and for our entire country. So I am going to ask my colleagues to oppose cloture on this legislation. Let us continue this debate. Let us find out what really is in this proposal. Let us make it a real lockbox, not one that could be threatening Social Security benefits and does not do  anything for Medicare and risks our national credit. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, along with Senator CONRAD, I am introducing legislation, the Social Security and Medicare Lock Box Act, to reserve budget surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare. 
   Mr. President, this bill is an alternative to the Abraham-Domenici-Ashcroft lock box legislation now before the Senate. There are several differences between the two versions. But I want to highlight this, most importantly: the Republican proposal claims to protect Social Security, but it doesn't even pretend to protect Medicare. This bill would reserve surpluses for both Social Security and Medicare. And the main question for the Senate is whether we care enough about Medicare to provide it with a real lock box. 
   Mr. President, as I explained earlier, the Republican lock box has three major flaws. 
   First, it fails to protect Social Security, and actually threatens benefits. 
   Second, it reserves nothing for Medicare. 
   And, third, it could result in a government default, which could trigger a world-wide economic catastrophe. 
   Our plan corrects each of these problems in a responsible way that will work. It provides an ironclad guarantee that 100 percent of the Social Security surplus will be saved for Social Security. It reserves 40 percent of the non-Social Security, on-budget surplus for Medicare. And, the lock box is enforced not by a risky new limit on public debt, but though the same budget procedures that produced the first budget surplus in 30 years. 
   With respect to Social Security, Mr. President, our lock box would create a new point of order against a budget resolution that spends the Social Security surplus. This provision is also in the Republican amendment. But our point of order requires a supermajority to waive while theirs can be waived by a simple majority vote. 
   The Republican amendment also contains a trap door that would allow Social Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than Social Security benefits, such as risky new privatization schemes. Our proposal includes no such trap door. To the contrary, its enforcement procedures would remain in effect until legislation is enacted certifying that Social Security's life has been extended for the long-term. 
   In addition to protecting Social Security, Mr. President, our lock box extends similar protections to the Medicare program. The proposal creates supermajority points of order against a budget resolution or any subsequent legislation that fails to reserve roughly 40 percent of the on-budget surplus for Medicare over the next 15 years. 
   Mr. President, the Medicare Trust Fund is now expected to be bankrupt by 2015. We should move quickly to reform and modernize the program. But it's also clear that we'll need additional resources when the baby boom generation starts to retire. Even with reforms that substantially reduce costs, the revenues coming to the Medicare Trust Fund will not support this larger number of beneficiaries. Nor will they provide the resources needed to modernize the program or provide a prescription drug benefit. 
   In case anyone has any doubt about that, consider the so-called Breaux-Thomas plan that was considered by the bipartisan Medicare Commission. 
   By their own calculation, that plan would save $100 billion over ten years and extends the Trust Fund for only 3 additional years. In the scheme of things, that's not very long. But even this meager extension of the Trust Fund relies on several controversial proposals, including raising the age of eligibility for Medicare, establishing unlimited home health copayments, and completely eliminating the Direct Medicare Education program from Medicare. 
   The bottom line, Mr. President, is that we need more resources for Medicare. And our amendment would give us an opportunity to provide them. 
   Under our proposal, in the short term, the Medicare reserve would be used to reduce the debt. Over the next ten years, our proposal would reduce debt held by the public by $30 billion more than the Republican plan. By reducing debt held by the public, our lockbox would dramatically reduce the government's interest costs. And that would free up resources to allow the government to meet its existing commitments to Medicare. By contrast,  under the Republican plan, every penny of the non-Social Security surplus is consumed. That would increase interest costs and almost guarantee further cuts in benefits in the future. 
   Mr. President, not only does our lockbox do more to protect Medicare and reduce debt, it also has a stronger lock and more responsible enforcement procedure for both Social Security and Medicare. 
   As I've explained, Mr. President, the Republican amendment includes a reckless new scheme that relies on the threat of a default to enforce its provisions. That not only could permanently damage our credit standing, it could force the government to stop issuing Social Security checks. 
   We have a better idea, Mr. President. As I said earlier, we have a 60-vote point of order against including Social Security in the budget totals, as well as a 60-vote point of order against using any of the Medicare reserve. Then, even if Congress tries to spend that money, our lockbox blocks it through automatic across-the-board cuts, rather than creating a crisis. 
   Mr. President, this is the best way to ensure fiscal restraint. Not by causing a crisis after money has already been committed. But by using the tools of the budget process to block those commitments in the first place. That's why our legislation would enforce the lock box through the tried and true mechanisms of the pay-go rules and across-the-board cuts. 
   If Congress attempts to spend part of the Social Security surplus or Medicare reserve, the sequester rules of the Balanced Budget Act would make automatic spending cuts in order to keep the reserve intact. This is far better than triggering a debt crisis, and threatening a government default, as the Republican amendment proposes. 
   To sum up, Mr. President, the Republican amendment claims to protect Social Security, but it really threatens Social Security benefits. Ours is a real lockbox that protects both Social Security and Medicare. It's a more responsible alternative that avoids the risk of default. And it would reduce debt by more than the underlying amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, our mission this morning is to discuss the environment, and to celebrate the birth of Earth Day, which takes place tomorrow. I will use my time for that purpose. 
   But I want to take just a minute, because I, like everyone else in this country, am heartbroken by what we saw take place yesterday. In my conversation with the Senator from Colorado, I expressed my sympathies. But I want to point out something. Those children were killed by deranged young people of their own class. But they used guns, and they used weapons that are, frankly, I think out of control in our society. This isn't just happening in Colorado. It is a terrible happening in Colorado. But look at the other days. It happened in Utah. It has happened in Arkansas, Mississippi, Kentucky, Oregon, and Illinois. Just search your mind and you can find almost every State having had a problem. It is a plague in our society. It is a blight across our country. 
   There is a bit of a paradox as we talk about Earth Day and the positive aspects of what Earth Day can mean so that children can bathe in the waters, fish in the streams, play on the Earth, and breathe the air--all positive things looking toward an improvement in their health--just under the shadow of the murderous rampage that took place yesterday.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues to discuss the Democratic environmental agenda on the eve of Earth Day. 
   We have an ambitious agenda to protect open spaces, reduce sprawl and relieve congestion. 
   While Congressional Democrats have an excellent agenda for the future, we also have a proud history of accomplishment since the first Earth Day in 1970. Our nation's major environmental laws were written and passed under Democratic leadership. 
   Democrats passed the first Clean Water Act. Democrats wrote the first Superfund law. Democrats authored the Clean Air Act. 
   And the Clinton Administration has an impressive record of enforcing these laws. The EPA has an outstanding record of cleaning up toxic waste sites under the Superfund program. 
   For example, by the end of this Fiscal Year, September 30, 95 percent of all Superfund sites will have remedies selected and cleanups beginning or underway. 
   Overall, the Clinton Administration has cleaned up more Superfund sites in the past two years than in the first 12 years of program. 
   Administrator Browner has also had success protecting our nation's drinking water, reducing smog so that children breathe healthier air, and cleaning up our lakes and rivers for swimming and fishing. 
   Mr. President, today, I would specifically like to talk about my brownfields bill and its promise to reduce sprawl and protect our environment. 
   My common sense brownfields bill, S. 20, will help accomplish all of these goals. 
   My bill will help turn a contaminated, abandoned parcel of land into a new school, an new business or a new playing field. And the benefits will multiply from there. Cleaning up brownfields protects open spaces by keeping commercial development inside our cities, where it creates jobs and can lower property taxes. 
   With more reuse and redevelopment in our cities, there will be less pressure to develop farmland and parkland outside our cities. 
   How do we make this happen? By making grant money available for States and cities to start the redevelopment of brownfields, and using their own zoning codes and no Federal regulations with that so that they can make sure people who are interested in buying and developing these sites aren't sued for the contamination that was never their fault. 
   Brownfields need not be a blight on our communities but an opportunity for smart growth. 
   Mr. President, fortunately, brown- –fields is not a partisan issue. In fact, many Republican Senators have supported the thrust of my legislation. This means, on this Earth Day, we have a chance to do something that will protect our environment and open spaces, and leave a better world for our children and grandchildren. 
   We should not miss the opportunity to do so. 
   Mr. President, we have pending before us the reauthorization of Superfund. It is now 2 years since the Superfund bill expired, and we still continue to operate. But we don't derive any of the revenues that were supposed to be part of the bill. We can't get a Superfund bill that is decent that doesn't protect the polluters, which is what Superfund was all about. It says, let the responsible parties pay for their damage. It has worked pretty well. 
   I was at a site in New Jersey that was the No. 1 Superfund site in the country. A company there agreed, finally, to pay $100 million toward the restoration of this site. I was there on Saturday to commemorate this new development. It was a spectacular day. I was there with the Little League. They even let me throw out the first pitch. That is the only first pitch I have thrown out. I haven't been invited by the Yankees, or otherwise. But to be able to throw out a pitch to the Little League, to see a softball field next to that, a hardball, a regular baseball field next to that, a soccer field next to that, all developed out of what was a horrible toxic waste site. The lake is clean. Before, there were signs for the children to avoid getting too near the lake because there was poisonous material in there. No fish could live--nothing. 
   When he celebrated the cleanup of that lake 2 years ago, the mayor of Pitman, NJ, a fellow named Bruce Ware, stood next to me, and, he said, ``I am going to fulfill a promise that I made years ago that if this lake ever got  cleaned up I am going in it.'' With that, he turned, fully dressed, with his tie and his jacket and his suit, and he jumped in the lake. He was so ecstatic about the fact that this community was going to be rid of this blighted parcel of land--about 100 acres, a big piece of land. 
   It is fantastic. I believe it will result in not only more revenues for the community but also a lifting of the spirit in that community. 
   That is what we ought to be doing. We ought not tinker with Superfund, to reduce it, to emasculate it such that it has no power and no strength. 
   I hope we are going to be able to do that in the next few days. I hope the American people will insist that as we attempt to clean up our land and avoid the sprawl that we are living with that we will pay attention to what we have as a society in terms of an obligation to future generations. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Chair for the opportunity to have the floor. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, as we continue to debate the so-called Social Security lock box legislation, let me again emphasize that we Democrats strongly support the purported goal of protecting Social Security surpluses. But many of us also feel that this legislation would be a serious mistake, for three reasons. 
   First, it does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows Congress to squander funds needed for Medicare on tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   Second, it threatens Social Security. Under the amendment, an unexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social Security checks. 
   Also, the amendment contains a loophole that would allow Social Security contributions to be diverted for purposes other than Social Security benefits, such as risky new privatization schemes or tax breaks. 
   And, third, the amendment threatens a government default. This could undermine our nation's credit standing, increase interest costs, block benefit and other payments, and ultimately lead to a world-wide economic crisis. 
   For all these reasons, as I explained in more depth yesterday, I believe the pending amendment is seriously flawed. 
   Today I want to talk a little more about some of the practical problems involved with the amendment, and why the last minute changes proposed by its sponsors fail to adequately address these problems. 
   Mr. President, the amendment before us would establish limits on public debt that were constructed based on the Congressional Budget Office's projections for the next ten years. Under the proposal, those limits would be locked into law, and could be changed only for a few very narrow reasons, such as wars or emergencies. 
   But it's important for our colleagues to understand that CBO's projections are highly uncertain. And it doesn't make sense to create inflexible and legally-binding debt limits based on those projections. 
   Consider what happened to CBO's budget estimates last year. On March 6, CBO revised its earlier estimate and said that we would have a fiscal year 1998 surplus of $8 billion. That was March 6. Two months later, on May 6, that $8 billion estimate mushroomed to a new estimate of $43 to $63 billion. 
   So, in just two months, CBO's surplus projection changed by up to $55 billion. And, I would note, even the upper range of the May estimate turned out to be too low. The actual surplus was about $70 billion. 
   Keep in mind that these projections were for a figure five to seven months in the future. Now we're being asked to rely on projections of up to ten years. And if we're wrong, what's the result? A government default and a world wide economic crisis. 
   Mr. President, you don't have to be a critic of CBO to question the accuracy of their estimates. CBO itself devoted an entire chapter of its Economic and Budget Outlook to uncertainties in budget projections. 
   CBO compared the actual surpluses for 1988 through 1998 with the first projection of the surplus it produced five years before the start of the fiscal year. Excluding the effects of legislation, the remaining errors averaged about 13 percent of actual outlays. 
   According to CBO, a deviation of 13 percent of projected outlays in 2004 would produce an increase or decrease in the surplus of about $250 billion. In 2009, a 13 percent error would produce a swing of about $300 billion, In fact, since the errors made ten years in advance are probably larger than the errors in estimates made five years ahead--which, again, is where the 13 percent figure came from--the deviation in 2009 is likely to produce an even larger swing. 
   It is simply dangerous to establish a rigid 10-year plan based on such speculative projections. The whole approach is fundamentally flawed. 
   Our Republican colleagues have added two provisions to their legislation that they argue would provide a sufficient cushion to prevent an unintended default. But these provisions won't solve the problem. 
   The new proposal would delay the implementation of each year's new debt limit by seven months, to kick in on May 1 of each one- or two-year period rather than on October 1. The sponsors argue that this would make the new limit effective at a time when the Treasury tends to be flush with cash. This, they say, would ensure that the new, lower limit would not immediately trigger a default. 
   Unfortunately, this change is like plugging a small hole on the Titanic. And it won't prevent disaster. 
   First, it can only work if the CBO projections on which the debt limits are based prove accurate. And, as I've already discussed, we know they won't be.  
   But even if by some miracle the estimates are right, that still may not take care of the problem. 
   Let's take, for example, a year in which there is a recession. Now, my friends on the other side of the aisle will point out that they have provided an exception for recessions. But that exception won't work very well. 
   Mr. President, we're not very good at predicting recessions. And, typically, by the time we know we're in one, we've actually been in it for a while. 
   The recession exception in the amendment only kicks in after we have two quarters of low economic growth. But a slowdown could easily begin in one quarter, but late enough to keep growth for that quarter above the threshold for the exception. We then might have two quarters of low growth followed a few weeks later by the release of the official data triggering the exception. 
   By that time, we would be eight or nine months into a recession. We would have had months of lower tax revenues and higher outlays for unemployment compensation and other programs. And, together, those changes already could have pushed us over the new debt limit and into default. 
   Mr. President, a recession exception does no good if it is declared a few months after we've gone into default. We cannot take default back and say an exception should have been in place. 
   It already would have happened. And Americans would have to pay for it through higher interest rates on their mortgages, car loans, and credit cards. Businesses would have to pay for it through higher borrowing costs. And taxpayers would have to pay for it because investors will demand higher interest rates on Treasury bonds. 
   This would be an economic disaster for our country. And it would create an international economic crisis of unknown dimensions. 
   Mr. President, under the Republican lock box, I'm afraid the question is not ``will this happen?'' The question is ``when will it happen?'' 
   That more than anything is why this proposal is so irresponsible. It's why Secretary Rubin is recommending a veto. And it's why it's so important that senators be allowed to offer amendments to improve it. 
   Mr. President, this proposal was finalized only yesterday afternoon. And when they presented it, the sponsors themselves expressed openness to further tinkering. Unfortunately, there will be no opportunity to make any improvements unless we reject cloture tomorrow. 
   So I would urge all my colleagues to oppose cloture. This proposal is seriously flawed. If we're serious about protecting Social Security, let's take the time to do it right. 
   Mr. CRAIG addressed the Chair.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President, for recognizing me. 
   Mr. President, I support the underlying bill to reform the rules governing emergency spending that has been reported out of the Committee on Governmental Affairs. Two amendments to that bill have now been offered, a first-degree amendment and a second-degree amendment, which blocks further amendments. The pending amendments are proposing to establish what is being called a Social Security lockbox. 
   Unfortunately, this lockbox is not secure. And it actually could undermine Social Security. 
   We Democrats have a far better alternative. Ours is a true lockbox. And it protects both Social Security and Medicare in a much more responsible way. 
   Before I comment further on the lockbox proposals, I want to review the underlying bill before us, which would make significant improvements in the treatment of emergency spending. 
   Emergency spending is not casual spending. It is so important that it is exempt from budget rules. And that is as it ought to be, because it involves responding to things like floods, earthquakes and volcanoes. 
   We can all identify parts of the country--the floods in the Midwest, the volcano in the State of Washington, and the terrible earthquake damage in California. Those are emergencies. They are immediate threats to American public health and safety, and Congress often has to act promptly to avoid the loss of life and property. 
   Unfortunately, the emergency exception has been abused. Last year, Congress stretched the rules past the breaking point in the omnibus appropriations bill, which included many items of questionable emergency designation, especially those for military spending. These were declared emergencies when, in fact, we were not looking at Kosovo and these items were not needed to respond to an imminent threat. 
   Mr. President, Congress has been able to abuse the emergency designation in part because the rules have been totally open-ended. 
   To address the problem, the Governmental Affairs bill proposes a new definition of ``emergencies'' and a point of order to help prevent conference committees from inserting unjustifiable new emergency spending. It is a good bill. And I commend Senator THOMPSON and Senator LIEBERMAN for their leadership. 
   Mr. President, while we were considering the budget resolution, the Senate approved an amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, that was based on this legislation. Yet the conferees on the budget resolution ignored the Senate's position. Instead, the conferees constructed a 60-vote point of order that now applies to all emergency spending--but with a huge loophole. Military spending was completely exempted, whether it was for new weapons systems or whatever. 
   Mr. President, Heaven knows that all of us want to support our military, and want to make sure that what we are doing in Kosovo is fully supported. I, for one, hope that we will do whatever we can to bring this wave of atrocities to a halt. So I am not complaining about military spending. 
   But, Mr. President, I thought that what the conferees on the budget resolution did was wrong. It was an abuse of the conference process since neither Senate nor House had approved anything like this. They just came up with it on their own.  
   I also thought it was bad policy. 
   Mr. President, there is no reason to allow 41 Senators to overrule 59 Senators who want to provide emergency spending for a flood, tornado, hurricane, or earthquake. And there is no reason to create a higher hurdle for a legitimate disaster than for a new weapons system. 
   I am afraid, Mr. President, that a 60 vote point of order against emergency designations is itself subject to abuse. One can conceive of all kinds of mischief to punish a particular senator or state for political reasons. And we should not to allow that kind of abuse. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, the amendment before us would leave this problematic approach from the budget resolution in place. Even worse, it would write it into law. I think that would be a serious mistake. 
   Now, Mr. President, I want to turn to the proposal to establish what proponents call a lockbox. 
   I strongly support the purported goal of this amendment; that is, to secure the future funding of Social Security. But I have three major problems with this proposal. 
   First, it does nothing to protect Medicare. Instead, it allows Congress to divert funds needed for Medicare in order to provide tax breaks for the wealthy. 
   Second, it threatens Social Security. Under the amendment, an unexpected economic downturn could block the issuance of Social Security checks. This would deal a serious blow to so many of our elderly who are dependent on Social Security. 
   Also, the amendment contains a booby trap that would allow Social Security contributions to be invaded for purposes other than Social Security benefits, like a risky new privatization scheme. 
   And third, the amendment could create a Government default --a U.S. Government default. It could undermine our Nation's credit standing, increase interest costs, and ultimately lead to a worldwide economic crisis. 
   I want to explain each of these in turn. The Medicare trust fund is now expected to be bankrupt by 2015--only 16 years away. We ought to move quickly to reform and modernize the program. But it is also clear that we will need additional resources. That is why most Democrats believe it is critical to save some of the surplus for Medicare. 
   Our Republican friends say they agree about the importance of saving some of the surplus for Social Security. But when it comes to saving for Medicare, they are not willing to reserve a single penny. Instead, they want to use funding that is needed for Medicare to provide any other things they favor, including tax breaks which are largely for the wealthy. 
   We Democrats think that is a mistake. And that is why I have developed a lockbox that would reserve funding for Medicare as well as Social Security. And I hope to have an opportunity to offer that proposal with Senator CONRAD of North Dakota. 
   Beyond its failure, Mr. President, to protect Medicare, the second major problem with the pending amendment is that it fails to protect Social Security. Actually, in some ways it threatens Social Security benefits. 
   First, it threatens to block the issuance of Social Security checks if the economy slows, or if the Congress fails to act responsibly. If the limit on public debt is exceeded, even by the smallest of margins, the Government could not issue more Social Security checks, and checks already issued could not be honored. 
   The Republicans say they protected Social Security benefits by providing that such benefits would be given--and I quote-- ``priority.'' But this language will be of no use if the debt limit has been exceeded. 
   In that situation, no new checks could be issued. And that applies not only to Social Security checks, but unemployment compensation, Medicare payments and all other Government payments as well. 
   The lockbox amendment also includes a huge loophole. I call it a mine field. And it could allow Social Security funds to be used for a wide variety of purposes, anything that Congress labels as Social Security reform. 
   Mr. President, these are code words. They say we are going to lock the door, but we are going to leave it open just a crack or two--something people wouldn't do in their safe deposit box, something they wouldn't do in their homes. We want to leave a couple of catch phrases in here like ``retirement security,'' like ``reform,'' and so that we do not really guarantee that Social Security surpluses are going to be reserved for Social Security beneficiaries. 
   We had a vote here, 98 to nothing. We said that all Social Security surpluses should be reserved for Social Security recipients. 98 to nothing. But it didn't take long for the conferees on the budget resolution--those from the majority party--we weren't included--to put that vote in the trash basket. They included vague language that would allow Social Security surpluses to be used for, and I quote, ``retirement security.'' 
   Similarly, the language of this amendment includes an escape hatch that will allow Congress to divert Social Security surpluses for anything that Congress labels as Social Security reform. 
   I heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee say earlier today that much of our surpluses ought to be reserved to give tax cuts to the people. It is not a bad idea. We like tax cuts, targeted tax cuts. But the leading Republican tax proposal, S. 3, would give those in the top one percent, with average incomes of $800,000 a year, a $20,000 tax cut. Meanwhile, some poor guy who works for a living, and his wife, or maybe a single parent who is working out there and making $38,000 a year, is going to get 99 bucks. That is what the Republican leadership has proposed. 
   So I would say to that $800,000 wage earner: Sorry, buddy, we are not going to give you the $20,000 that you could use to put a downpayment on a yacht or whatever else you want to do. 
   My conscience doesn't bother me at all when I say that tax cuts ought to be reserved for people who need proper day care for their children or need to help an elderly parent who has special medical problems. 
   Mr. President, when the Social Security trust fund goes bankrupt in 2034, it will be able to pay only about 70 percent of the promised benefits. Diverting payroll taxes for other uses, as this amendment allows, could make matters much worse. The date of insolvency could be moved up and arrive earlier. And instead of being able to pay only 70 percent of promised benefits, we would be able to pay even less. 
   The issue here is not whether to establish private savings accounts, as many have suggested. President Clinton has recommended one form of such accounts, his USA accounts. Others have similar ideas. 
   But when Social Security already is 30 percent short of being able to provide promised benefits to baby boomers, we can't afford to invade its funds for other uses. If we want to establish private accounts, we can use other funds. We shouldn't permit even deeper cuts in guaranteed benefits. 
   It also is important to understand that this amendment would do nothing to extend the life of Social Security trust funds. That is not just my opinion, it is a fact. 
   To back that up, I have a letter from Mr. Harry Ballantyne, chief actuary of the Social Security Administration. As Mr. Ballantyne writes, the adoption of this proposal would have no significant effect on the long-term solvency of the program--none.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, it is critical that Congress act promptly to extend the solvency of Social Security. President Clinton has presented two related proposals that would extend Social Security's life through 2059. Some of my colleagues don't like those proposals. That is fair. But if they do not like his ideas, they should propose some of their own. So far, they haven't done it. And no one should be fooled into believing that this lockbox proposal is an answer. 
   Finally, the most serious problem with this proposal is that it threatens to lead to a Government default. In the short term, that could damage our Nation's credit standing and increase interest costs.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, we are coming to ``H'' hour here. That is not happy hour, as far as I am concerned. I can think of other words that start with an H--like horrific, horrendous, horrible, hurtful--but I won't use that vocabulary. I will just infer it. 
   The occupant of the Chair has been in government for some time, and I am sure he has seen it from a different perspective. We see good people sincerely believing in what they are doing at odds with one another, in such contrasting views that it is hard to reconcile the difference of what is and what isn't the reality. This is no suggestion of prevarication or fabrication. I am not talking about that. I know there is genuine belief. 
   I differ sharply with my friends and colleagues on the other side regarding this budget. Few people have I more respect for than the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. Boy, we have some scraps. They are really good ones. The fact of the matter is, he is a bright guy. He understands a budget as few here do. He is one of the few Senators who has to teach his staff what it is all about. That is intended to be a joke. 
   The rest of us do it differently. I hope the public doesn't take that too seriously, Mr. President. 
   The fact of the matter is Senator DOMENICI very well knows ``budgeteering,'' but I think in this case it is fair to say there is an error in the approach. I think the policy as proposed by the budget conference report is fiscally dangerous. I think if we go the way it appears that we will go, we could be approaching in the not-too-distant future a shutdown of the Government. Everybody who has been around for any length of time remembers how painful the last shutdown was: People were not getting Social Security checks, veterans' benefits were not being paid, services people count on for their everyday existence were just unavailable. Other matters that seemed to be routine, such as entrances to national parks, families planning for a year to visit one of our national parks and finding out they were closed. Became important. Airplanes, trains, buses, cars--all that planning, gone. 
   I predict we are going to be playing Russian roulette to see who pulls the trigger on whether or not we have a Government shutdown because this budget ``ain't for real,'' to use the language, when we look at what happens as a result of the intent to give a tax cut across the board--a lot of it to wealthy people--and we know that some time ago Senator DOMENICI said we were taking people's word for what the intention is without seeing it clearly spelled out. 
   Few people have as much authority around here as the distinguished Senator of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH. He was speaking to Reuters and he said he was very much in favor of using bigger than expected budget surpluses to fund an across-the-board income tax of 10 percent or more. That is what Reuters 
   reported:  
   ``I don't think it is too big,'' the Delaware Republican said of the 10 percent income tax cut. ``If anything, I would like to have it bigger.''  
   That is a pretty good indicator of where we are going. We are not protecting Social Security in the way that we proposed here on the floor of the Senate 2 days ago. We had a vote. I offered the amendment. I said no Social Security surplus shall be used for anything other than Social Security, pure and simple. 
   The language is very direct. Mr. President, 98 people voted for it. We had zero opposition, 98-0. It went to conference with the House. For those who don't understand the arcane process here, the House and the Senate get together and have a conference to decide on what the various legislative programs will be, we agree between us on a conference report, and that is what we are voting on today. 
   As it happens, there is a Republican majority in the Senate. There is a Republican majority in the House. As was noted, we, the Democrats, do not participate. That is the game. It is understood. Next year, when we are in the majority, I expect to be more forgiving and perhaps we will even invite one of the Republicans to the conference meeting. 
   But the fact is, the product that came out is one that is a Republican delivery. Make no mistake about it. And the consequence of that is the bill we have in front of us with huge tax breaks for wealthy people. If you make $800,000, you will get a $20,000 tax break. If you make $800,000, you get $20,000 worth of extra spending money. That can buy, perhaps, a nice little boat or a downpayment on a summer home or something of that nature. But the person who makes $38,000: $99, that is what he or she is going to get in terms of a tax break, $99. Don't spend it all in one night, friends, because it is supposed to last for a whole year. That is a tax cut: $99. 
   So when we look at it, it is obvious that we are not dealing with the needs of the average working person, the hard-working person, a family making $38,000. We have heard the distinguished Senator from Texas talk about a person working in her office who, with his spouse, put together an income of $50,000. That is not a lot of money today. Those are the kinds of folks to whom we have to be sensitive, to target tax cuts for them and make sure the woman who wants to work can get some decent child care and get some credit on her taxes for it. If you have an elderly parent who needs long-term care, get a tax credit for that; a  tax credit for education; those are the kinds 
   of tax credits or tax breaks I think we ought to be giving. That is what the Democrats are proposing. 
   One of the things we are doing is proposing a tax cut that, in the course of 10 years, will be three-quarters of a trillion dollars--$750 billion in round terms. The consequence of that, the result of that, is going to be that we will not have sufficient funds to pay for Government services. We will not have enough funds to pay for full staff for the FBI. We will not have enough funds to pay for full staffing of drug enforcement agents. We will not have enough funds to include 800,000 low-income women, infants, and children in programs for nutrition assistance. 
   We are not talking about extra money to take a trip to Europe; we are talking about food. Mr. President, 800,000 of those people are going to lose assistance from the Government. The number of students in work/study programs decreases by 12,000 people. Head Start is designed to take children who come from poverty-ridden homes to start to learn--Head Start. It is preschool. It is before they get to kindergarten or first grade. We are going to take away services for 100,000 children. For those who need energy assistance, 600,000 low-income families could lose that energy assistance. 
   The FBI, the cut to the FBI could result in the reduction of 2,700 FBI agents. Mr. President, 73,000 summer jobs lost. And the list goes on: More than 2,200 air traffic controller positions would be cut. I am very active in air transportation matters and very concerned about where we go. Y2K, will we have the right kind of personnel to handle the shift? Here we are, getting a budget in front of us. It is there in print for everybody to see. It is designed by the majority. We are saying that more than 2,200 air traffic controller positions would be cut and $255 million. 
   The IRS customer service: Today everybody is probably as angry at the IRS as can be, but when they see what it is we are paying for, we are paying for a country designed to give everybody opportunity. We are doing better at it. Jobs are more available, there is low unemployment, our national health is better than it has ever been. That is what you pay your taxes for. You do not pay it for some idle bureaucrat sitting in a chair. We pay for services. Do we get 100 cents on a dollar? Probably not. I ran a big corporation and it was a successful corporation. We didn't get 100 cents' worth of value on every dollar that we spent, but that's life. 
   Mr. President, we now are preparing ourselves to vote for a budget that I think is shameful, that could be called a sham. Again, there is no accusation here of dishonesty or skullduggery. What it is is a misinterpretation of what things are about. It is playing dice with our national economy. It says if you give tax cuts, it is going to generate something else and it will be good for us. Baloney. 
   What happened under President Reagan's regime, when we gave tax cuts? I will tell you what we got for it. Some of the biggest debt this country ever had, and it grew by leaps and bounds. When President Clinton took over, there was a $290 billion deficit in front of us, and this year we are looking at a surplus of about $100 billion. Things have changed materially in the 7 years that have passed. 
   So I am hoping we will get a vote that reflects what is best for the American people, and that would be to deny acceptance of this budget report that is in front of us. I hope we will perhaps be able to convince some of our Republican friends to come over, take another look at the budget and see what we can do to improve the situation, because right now we are headed for a potential fiscal disaster just when things are really going good. 
   I want to say something in response to an earlier argument I heard from the other side when it was said there is going to be more money put into Social Security than the Democrats are proposing. It is not true, because hidden in there is some arcane language that says ``retirement security.'' They want to put the money away that can be used for retirement security--not Social Security. They are both two words but they have different significance. One is a Government program established for people who are dependent on the Government for their retirement and their pension. The other could be Heaven knows what. 
   So I caution everybody, as we prepare to vote, which is imminent, that the American public ought to be looking very closely at what it is we are going to do. I hope they will respond as they see it, to those Senators who are casting a vote at this moment. I hope the vote will wind up with a majority saying no. 
   Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will help our nation deal with the problem of racial profiling during traffic stops. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators FEINGOLD, KENNEDY, and TORRICELLI. 
   Across the country, too many motorists fear that they will be stopped by law enforcement for nothing more than the color of their skin. The offense of ``D.W.B.'' or ``Driving While Black'' is well known to minorities, and the fact that this term has entered the common vocabulary demonstrates the pervasiveness of the problem. 
   In my home state and other states along the Interstate-95 corridor, there have been many serious and credible allegations of racial profiling. For example, statistics recently released by the state of New Jersey, reveal that 73 percent of motorists arrested on the New Jersey turnpike in early 1997 were minorities. Similarly, a court-ordered study in Maryland found that more than 70 percent of drivers stopped on Interstate-95 were African American though they made up only 17.5 percent of drivers. 
   Not surprisingly, the practice of racial profiling has led to litigation. In the case of State versus Soto, a state court judge ruled that troopers were engaging in racial profiling on the southernmost segment of the New Jersey Turnpike. That decision spurred the United States Department of Justice to begin a ``pattern and practice'' investigation, in December 1996, to determine whether the New Jersey State Police had violated the constitutional rights of minority motorists. The Department of Justice is also investigating police agencies in Eastpointe, Michigan, and Orange County, Florida. Additionally, a number of individuals and organizations have filed private lawsuits seeking to end the inappropriate use of racial profiling. 
   While litigation may bring about limited reforms, it is clear that Congress must develop a nationwide approach. The legislation I am introducing today will help define the scope of the problem, increase police awareness, and suggest whether additional steps are necessary. It would require that the Attorney General collect data on traffic stops and report the results to Congress. Because better relations between police and citizens will help ease racial tensions, the measure will also authorize grants to law enforcement agencies for the development of better training programs and policing strategies. 
   In recent decades, we have made great progress in strengthening the civil rights of all Americans. Many dedicated law enforcement officials have contributed greatly to this effort by applying the law fairly and working to strengthen the bonds of trust in the communities they serve. To their credit, some police agencies have spoken out against the practice of racial profiling. In New Jersey, the State Troopers Fraternal Association, the State Troopers Non-Commissioned Officers Association, and the State Troopers Superior Officers Association have stated that ``anyone out there using racial profiling or in any way misusing or abusing their position, must be identified and properly dealt with.'' But we cannot allow the actions of some police officials to undermine these achievements, and we should work to ensure that minority motorists are no longer subjected to unwarranted traffic stops.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to respond to the analysis just given us by our good friend and colleague, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, Senator DOMENICI. One thing about Senator DOMENICI, he is always direct. He always calls it like he sees it. And therein lie, perhaps, some differences. 
   The expression, ``beauty is in the eyes of the beholder,'' is one that fits well, I think, because I see it quite differently than Senator DOMENICI. As we begin consideration of the conference report, for the benefit of those who do not know how we work here, the conference report is that report on the budget that has been agreed to by the House of Representatives, their Budget Committee people, and the Senate Budget Committee people. So I have to say at the outset that it is quite obvious that it is the majority's report we are looking at. Even though there are 45 Democrat Senators here, the fact is, with rare exception, all of the Democrats voted in opposition to the initial Budget Committee report and my view here is that we are probably going to see at least something as strong in opposition to the report that has now been agreed upon by the House representatives on the budget and the Senate representatives. 
   Look at this. Here we have a budget resolution, one that says this is the way we ought to be spending our money. Mr. President, I remind those who are in earshot, this is a toothless tiger. It does have the force of a Senate-House conference committee agreeing that is what we ought to be spending, but it is without law to support it, and it is now an instruction to the various committees that have the jurisdiction to set up the spending as recommended by the Budget Committee. 
   But what a time this is. The economy has never been stronger. I have been around a long time--thank goodness, for my kids and me--but we have never seen an economy like this. Unemployment is low, inflation is almost unheard of, the stock market is booming, people are able to invest in housing and education and plan their future and vacations. Our fiscal house is in order. We are now running surpluses, having come a long way from 1992 when President Clinton took over, when we were  running annual deficits in the high $200 billion. Now we are running surpluses. So we have done something good. I commend my colleague, the chairman of the Budget Committee, for the hard work that he did--that we did bilaterally, with the President of the United States--to get a balanced budget in place. That, I think, has had a large effect on how it is we got to this current period of prosperity. But at the same time we face serious long-term challenges. Most importantly, the baby boomers' retirement is going to put tremendous pressure on Social Security and on Medicare in the years ahead. 
   The key question facing Congress is whether we will meet those challenges and prepare for the future at this time or whether we are going to yield to short-term temptation at the expense of the longevity of these programs. Democrats are committed to focusing on the future. Our top priority is to save Medicare and Social Security for the long term by reducing our debt, keeping our debt in control, and increasing national savings. 
   We also want to provide targeted tax relief for those who need it most and that is the middle-class families, those who work hard for a living, those who are dependent totally on wages and salary for their living. We want to invest in education and other priorities that will enhance the lives of those who are 
   not yet university age but who are looking forward to having a job and career that gives them a decent lifestyle. 
   The Republicans, our friends on the other side of the aisle, have a different view. Their plan as embodied in this conference report focuses on huge tax breaks, largely for the wealthy. I want to give an example of what it is I am talking about because so often our Republican friends get irritated when we say ``focused on the wealthy.'' But if you are in the top 1 percent of the income earners--that is starting at $300,000 but averaging $850,000 a year--if you are one of the lucky ones, one of the skilled ones, or one of those who inherited wealth, and your income is $800,000 a year, you get a $20,000 tax break in this budget that is proposed before us. 
   On the other hand, if you work hard and you go to work every day and you worry about how to educate your kids and you worry about how to pay your mortgage and you earn $38,000 a year, you get $100--oh, $99, I am sorry; it is not even $100--a $99 tax break. Somehow or other that doesn't seem right to me: $800,000 on the one hand gets a $20,000 tax break and on the other hand, if you make $38,000, slightly over $700 a week to support your family, you get $99 and you can spend it in any way you want, the $99; buy a yacht, buy a vacation--whatever you want to do with the $99. So it does not seem right to me. 
   These tax breaks on top of the unfair balance between those who are the wealthy and those who work hard for a living would cost the taxpayer enormous sums in the future. It would absorb funding that is needed to save Medicare. And that, when you get right down to it, is really the main issue this conference report presents to the Senate. 
   Question: Should we provide huge tax cuts, many of which will benefit the wealthy? Or should we use that money to save Medicare? 
   Of course, there is a lot more to the conference report before us, so I will take a little time now to explain why I strongly oppose and intend to vote against the acceptance of this conference report. There are four primary reasons. 
   First, it does not do anything to increase Medicare's life. In other words, in 2015 Medicare is ready for bankruptcy, if things go as they are. 
   I have suggested that we ought not use funds needed for Medicare for tax cuts that are primarily for the wealthy. 
   Secondly, it threatens Social Security because it fails to extend Social Security's life, but it allows the use of surpluses generated by those who currently pay about 13 percent of wages; that is the worker and the company, for purposes other than Social Security. 
   Thirdly, it is fiscally dangerous. I used to run a big corporation, and I will tell you that this is not the way to plan the long-term future. It proposes tax cuts that do not cost much in the beginning, as the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee said, but he said it is going to cost over $700 billion. In 10 years, over $750 billion will be used to provide that tax break. 
   Fourthly, it proposes extreme and unrealistic cuts in essential programs that are necessary for the well-being of all our citizens. It would devastate public services on which so many depend. Moreover, Congress will be unable to pass the bills that provide the funding that these programs need, and it could lead eventually to a repeat of a terrible experience that we had a few years ago--a Government shutdown. These are the kinds of programs that would be affected. 
   Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is now expected to become bankrupt in 2015. It is critical that we address this problem and do it now. There is no doubt that we have to modernize and reform Medicare to make it function more efficiently, but whatever reform process we pass, we still need more resources--more money, to put it bluntly. In an attempt to find an overall solution, President Clinton proposed allocating 15 percent of projected budget surpluses, that is, the unified budget, for surpluses for Medicare. This would extend the life of the Medicare trust fund for another 12 years. Our Republican colleagues deride this proposal. They say it amounts to adding meaningless IOUs to Medicare, but they are wrong. 
   First, the President's proposal would reduce the debt that the public holds in bonds and investment in Government securities, which would significantly reduce interest costs in the future, which would help us actually pay for Medicare with the real dollars saved. 
   Unfortunately, the Republican budget resolution we have in front of us totally rejects the President's proposal to extend Medicare solvency. Instead of directly using these surpluses for Medicare, it uses almost all of that money for tax cuts. The document we have in front of us--that was prepared exclusively by Republicans, I remind you--does not specify how we are going to provide those tax cuts. They will be drafted later in the Finance Committee. However, based on the comments of the chairman of the Finance Committee, it is fair to assume that most of the total benefits will flow to the wealthiest Americans. Mr. President, these GOP tax breaks would come at the direct expense of Medicare. It is wrong. 
   Under the Republican plan, not one penny of projected surpluses is guaranteed for Medicare--not one cent. The resolution claims to reserve about $90 billion for unspecified uses over 10 years and suggests that maybe we can take some of that $90 billion for Medicare. However, that is far less than the $350 billion the President wants to put into Medicare over a 10-year period. And none of this $90 billion is actually reserved for Medicare. 
   In any case, there is nothing left for the Medicare program after these funds are used up for unexpected emergencies. For example, emergency spending now averages $9 billion a year. That is emergency spending for natural disasters or some other disaster--fire, whatever you have--in a community that is needed each and every year. It is reasonable to assume that future emergencies will consume all of this so-called reserve. 
   Mr. President, the Republicans' refusal to provide additional resources for Medicare would have a direct impact on the millions of Americans who will depend on Medicare for their health needs in the future. The resolution almost certainly would mean higher health care costs, higher copayments--that means for the beneficiary. If you have an incident or a matter that can be reimbursed by Medicare, you will have a higher copayment, you will have higher deductibles, lower quality health care services, and probably fewer hospitals, all because the Republicans insist on providing these huge tax breaks. 
   Beyond Medicare, the second major problem with the Republican resolution is that it poses a direct threat to Social Security. 
   Just yesterday, I offered a motion to instruct the conferees, those from the House and those from the Senate--but particularly it applied to the Senate because that is where we give our directions--that they ensure that all Social Security surplus is used only to extend the life of Social Security. It was  not a close vote. The motion was adopted by a 98-0 vote. Ninety-eight Senators said, yes, this is the right kind of attitude we want to see. Ninety-eight out of 100 Senators said, yes, we want to use all of our Social Security surpluses to extend the life of Social Security. 
   But within just a few hours of that vote--the vote took place here, then it went to conference over there in the House, and the conferees, the group that was sitting around the table, our Republican friends, approved a provision that would allow Social Security surpluses to be used for other purposes. I find it astounding and, frankly, it is outrageous that 98 Senators stood up and voted aye, yes, we want all Social Security surpluses to be spent on Social Security, and it went in the wastebasket within a few hours. Quite incredible. 
   The conference report establishes, as we heard, a lockbox that supposedly protects Social Security surpluses. But it does not do that. It establishes a largely meaningless 50-vote point of order against future budget resolutions but has a huge loophole for any legislation that ``enhances retirement security.'' 
   We do not know what the definition of ``retirement security'' is. What does it mean to enhance retirement security? It does not say ``Social Security.'' This is a word game we play here. We say one thing, but it has a different meaning when we say it over here. Just a change of a word or two: ``Retirement security'' versus ``Social Security.'' Presumably this retirement security plan could mean a wide range of purposes. 
   Mr. President, it is unacceptable, it is outrageous, it deserves to be condemned in the strongest possible terms. Social Security surpluses should not be used for ``retirement security'' or anything that we do not understand clearly. Sure, it should not be used for tax cuts. They should not be used for risky new schemes and programs. They should be used to pay Social Security benefits, period. 
   The third problem with the conference report is that it is fiscally irresponsible. The resolution calls only for small tax cuts in the first year or two. 
   We heard the chairman of the Budget Committee say so. But the cost of these tax cuts explode in the future. 
   Over the first 5 years, the total tax cuts that we would have would cost $142 billion, but over the second 5 years that cost increases to $636 billion, about 4 1/2 times as high as the first 5 years. And that is another way of getting at things. It is kind of a little bit sleight of hand, I would say. That is to say, ``Oh, we can give these tax breaks, give these tax cuts, and it's not going to cost anything.'' No, not while most of us are still Members of this Senate. But 10 years hence, when we add up the scorecard, we will have spent almost three-quarters of a trillion dollars for tax cuts. 
   Mr. President, the final problem with the Republican plan is that it forces extreme cuts in programs for Americans here at home. Tax cuts, on one hand, cost something for the ordinary Americans on the other hand. 
   I want to point out something. We Democrats are not opposed to tax cuts that are targeted, that means something for middle-class people, that means something for hard-working people who have to watch if not their pennies, at least their nickels. That is the way we want to do our tax cuts. We want to encourage savings, we want to encourage child care, we want it so people can have child care in case they do want to work. We want to make sure there are funds there for long-term health care for an elderly person. That is the kind of tax cut that we seek, not this broad, across-the-board tax cut that will give these $800,000 wage-earners a $20,000 tax cut. So we will be losing, as a result of that--programs that are here called nondefense discretionary programs--about 7 1/2 percent in the first year. But the real cut in most programs would be much deeper. 
   Keep in mind, the Republican leadership has said they will increase or maintain funding for a handful of favored programs like new courthouses, the transportation bill for the next half dozen years--we call it TEA-21--the census, the National Institutes of Health, and some crime and education programs. That leaves other unprotected programs facing cuts of about 11 percent. 
   I want to point out what we are talking about. This is not just an amorphous discussion about arithmetic. When we say 11 percent, we are talking about everything from environmental protection to the National Parks and the FAA. The FAA is responsible for the maintenance of our aviation fleet and working hard to keep up with the new technologies and the needs as aviation expands its marketplace. 
   The Coast Guard. My gosh, everyone knows the Coast Guard is one of the most important branches of service that we have in this country. They do everything. They do drug interdiction. They maintain waterways. They are out there picking up illegal immigrants who are trying to float their way to the American coast. They are on pollution patrol. They watch it all. You want to cut that down? I do not think so. Eleven percent--that would be devastating. 
   I heard our Senators from States that border Central America about the inadequacy of the number of Border Patrol members that they have. This would take a big slice out of that so that we could no longer do even the protection of our borders as efficiently as we do now. 
   We would be losing lots of FBI agents, NASA would be hurt, our space program, job training, head Start, the program that 
   gives kids who come from a disadvantaged background a little bit of a head start. 
   So what would it mean in real terms? Here are a few examples based on the administration's estimates: 2,700 FBI agents would be lost; 1,350 Border Patrol agents; 780 drug enforcement agents would be lost; 90,000 fewer dislocated workers would receive training for new jobs, job search assistance, and support services; 34,000 low-income children would lose child care assistance--what a devastating thing that would be to lots of families--over 1.2 million low-income women, infants and children--we call it the WIC Program--would lose nutrition assistance each month. 
   How can we face our conscience? 
   FAA operations would be cut by almost $700 million. It would lead to travel delays, weakened security, lack of critical modernization technologies. The Superfund Program that cleans up these toxic waste sites left by our industrial past--unusable ground--that raise potential dangers to those who live nearby; we would lose 21 opportunities to clean up Superfund toxic waste sites, needlessly jeopardizing public health. 
   Up to 100,000 children would lose the opportunity to benefit from Head Start; 73,000 training and summer job opportunities for young people would be lost. 
   Mr. President, these types of cuts clearly are unacceptable. They are not what the American people want. 
   Unfortunately, under this resolution the problem gets dramatically worse in later years. By 2004, these nondefense cuts--again, defense, on one hand, nondefense on the other. Defense is a very favored account in this place, and I support a strong defense. And, boy, if we ever doubted our need to fund it, we see now that we have to do it. But we do not have to give them all of the new resources that we have. 
   By 2004, the nondefense program cuts grow to 27 percent. There isn't a Senator here, who, when faced with reality, is going to vote for those kinds of cuts. But they put their heads in the sand. They are not looking at what the longer consequences of this budget resolution are going to be. And it does not even include any effects of inflation. 
   Mr. President, you really have to wonder whether our Republican friends are serious about cutting domestic programs by 27 percent. It is hard to believe, especially when they are not giving us any details about where those cuts would come from. Some Republicans have argued that these cuts are required because of the discretionary spending caps which remain in effect through 2002. But that is not true. ``Spending caps,'' again, is part of the vernacular here. Those are the levels of spending that we agreed we would adhere to until 2002. But we are now in surplus. We are out of debt because of the good fiscal policies that we have had here. That occurred because Democrats and Republicans and the President worked together.  
   Much of the problem for domestic programs is created because the conference report increases military spending significantly over last year's level. Since all discretionary spending is now under one cap, that extra money must come directly from the other programs that we talked about. 
   Cutting domestic programs by 27 percent in 2004 is not realistic. It is an extreme decision. When it comes time for cutting specific programs, Congress sure will not likely follow through. 
   In other words, this budget resolution is a roadmap to gridlock. If we can't pass the appropriations bills, the funding bills, we face the prospect of a horrible nightmare that we once experienced here, and that is a Government shutdown. 
   Why, then, are we considering a budget resolution that even some Republicans admit can't be enacted into law? The answer is simple. Republicans are desperate to claim that they are for tax cuts. And they see that as the ``Holy Grail.'' That is what they say Americans want. I tell you, I see it differently. I see an America where someone comes from a home that is not wealthy, sometimes widowed. I had the experience personally. My mother was widowed at age 36. My father died when he was 43. There was not a chance at all that I was going to be able to get an education or progress in life. But, fortunately, I served in the military--World War II--and I was able to get my education under the GI bill. 
   It is an incredible thing that we offer when we propose to young people that they have a chance to get a job and to progress and to live a life that is better than their parents in most cases. Here we are saying, well, tax cuts will take care of it all. No. Tax cuts won't take care of it all. Some tax cuts will help, but some tax cuts are just giveaways to wealthy people. The result is that we can create stresses in our society that make living uncomfortable. 
   Right now we see violent crime going down in the most unlikely places. Why? Because we have more police on the streets? Yes. Because we put more criminals in jail? Yes. Because the judges are tougher? Yes. But it is also because people see a way to make a living legitimately and they do not turn to criminality. It is because there are education programs and there are job opportunities that have been created. That is the difference. 
   In one case you have a stable society. Those of us--and I include myself, having had a successful business career--who can afford to pay for the privilege of living in this country ought to step up and pay for it and not be looking for tax cuts but be looking for harmony and stability in our society. That is what it is all about. 
   Here we have the tax cut proposal, the Republican tax cut proposal. They think it is politically going to keep up their majorities here. It is not going to happen, because we do not have a clue on how to pay for them. And as long as we don't know how to pay for them, we can only expect the worst. 
   Mr. President, we are left with a budget that can be described a little bit as show business, fantasy, a budget that almost everybody knows isn't worth the paper on which it is written. 
   I have to say that some of the other provisions in the conference report as well are highly problematic. The conference report establishes a new process, a 60-vote point of order against all emergency spending except for defense. 
   Now I pose a situation. Take a volcano in the State of Washington or an earthquake in the State of California or the floods that hit Missouri or the droughts that hit other States or the storms that hit the Northeast or the Southeast. If we say, well, these are emergency conditions, it disturbs the community, it destroys their economic viability; we want that to be taken care of by programs that we have in the Federal Government. Now we are saying, well, it is not enough to have 51 votes. Let's make sure you have to have 60 votes so that 41 votes can stop any program they want. 
   Let's suppose that there is a political problem existing in a campaign for President or Senator, and one party is in power here. They know that State X, Y or Z has a stronger possible voting block than the other party; 41 Senators can get up and stop it cold. Emergency spending is emergency spending. We ought to leave it to a majority of the Senate to decide that, not require 60 votes. 
   It flies directly in the face of the Senate-passed resolution. That is the way we did it. We left it 50 votes. So not only do I strongly disagree with it as a matter of policy, but I think it is an abuse of the conference process. 
   If 59 Senators think that we need to pass emergency assistance to help those ravaged by a flood or earthquake, we can't let 41 Senators block it. 
   Why should we be buying new weapons with a higher priority than saving the lives of Americans who are suffering from a 
   natural disaster? We know there have been abuses of the emergency designation, but the Governmental Affairs Committee developed a reasonable approach to cutting down on those abuses. They established a new definition and a new process for extracting new emergency items that were added at the last minute in conference reports. The Senate approved that approach, and the House didn't have anything about this in their resolution. 
   Yet, when they got together in conference, the conferees on their own decided that they would delineate a new and entirely different approach. It is not right. That is not the way the system is supposed to work. We talk about majority rule. 
   I am also concerned that the conference report rejected yesterday's Senate vote in support of the Dodd child care amendment. It was supported, in part, by our Republican friends, but the amendment that was carried through this body called for $12.5 billion in new funding for child care on top of any new related tax cuts. Instead, what the conferees did is provide only $3 billion in child care funding. We had 66 votes for the proposal yesterday at $12.5 billion. Today, it is down to $3 billion. That is not what the 66 Senators voted for, and it is a sad commentary on our commitment to families in need. 
   Finally, I am also disturbed that the conference report includes a provision saying that any reestimate of our budget surplus can be used only for tax cuts. I think it is a mistake. I think it is wrong. Why should tax breaks for wealthy people be given a higher priority than education or Social Security or Medicare or defense or veterans' needs? 
   Mr. President, I do not think we should be spending any surpluses until we save Social Security and Medicare. And I certainly do not think that surpluses should be reserved only for tax cuts, especially when we know that many of those cuts are going to go to wealthy folks. 
   There are many serious problems with this conference report. Before I close, I want to quickly recount the four problems that are most fundamental. 
   First, it doesn't guarantee a single additional penny for Medicare, even though Medicare faces bankruptcy in the year 2015. Instead, it takes money needed for Medicare and uses it for tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy. 
   Second, it threatens Social Security. It doesn't extend Social Security's solvency by a single day, and it calls for using Social Security surpluses for purposes other than Social Security directly. 
   Third, it is fiscally dangerous. It calls for huge tax cuts, the costs of which explode in the future, just when the baby boomers will be retiring. 
   Finally, its cuts in domestic programs are extreme. If they were ever enacted, they would seriously disrupt important public services. 
   More likely, Congress will never approve them, and we will again be facing the disastrous threat of a Government shutdown. The people who voted for it, for the most part, know very well that this is not a budget that is going to survive. It is too bad that we are taking all of this time and expending all of this energy to produce this sleight-of-hand budget proposal that we see in front of us. 
   I am strongly opposed to this conference report, and I hope that it will be more than a party-line vote that votes against it. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   The motion is very simple. It instructs the conferees who are going to be reviewing the budget resolution to include in the conference report provisions that will reserve all Social Security surpluses for Social Security and for Social Security only--not other programs, including other retirement programs, as has been suggested, and not for tax cuts. 
   For years, Democrats have been arguing that our top fiscal priority should be to save Social Security first, and we feel very strongly about that. It is, after all, our party's creation that kicked off Social Security, and we have spent decades since then protecting the program from attack. 
   In our view, Social Security represents a sacred trust between the Government and the people. It is a trust that should not and must not be violated. 
   Nearly 44 million Americans now benefit from Social Security, and many of them depend heavily on the program for their survival. For 66 percent of the elderly, Social Security provides half their income. Without Social Security, the poverty rate among the elderly would be 48 percent; roughly 15 million more Americans would be living in poverty than do now. For single, divorced, or widowed elderly women, the poverty rate without Social Security would be 60 percent--60 percent for elderly women. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, under current projections, Social Security is adequately financed only until 2034. At that time, just when millions of baby boomers will be retired and struggling to get by, Social Security may be unable to pay the full benefits to which these Americans are entitled. 
   We need to act promptly to address this problem. President 
   Clinton has proposed policies which would extend Social Security significantly to the year 2059. Unfortunately, the majority has rejected those policies, and in their place nothing has been proposed. Thus, the budget resolution approved by the Senate included nothing to extend Social Security's solvency by even a single day. 
   Having said that, while the Senate resolution did nothing to actually help Social Security, it at least seemed to do no harm. The resolution was based on the premise that, at a minimum, Congress should not spend Social Security surpluses on anything else. That would not extend solvency at all, but at least it would not make matters worse. 
   Unfortunately, we now understand that the Republican leadership has backed off from even this modest commitment. Instead, they reportedly--and we have not really seen the details--have agreed to include in the final version of the budget resolution a provision that could pose a direct and serious threat to Social Security. 
   Although we have not seen any final language, this provision apparently calls for using Social Security not just for Social Security but for other programs as well. Apparently, the provision would allow Social Security taxes to be diverted to other things that have some connection to retirement security. That could be a catchword. It could mean a new privatized Medicare system. Perhaps it could include civil service or military retirement programs. More likely, I am afraid it could also mean tax cuts for the wealthy that are claimed to somehow affect retirement. 
   I was stunned when I heard about this provision, and I think it is remarkable that the Republican leadership would even consider using Social Security surpluses for anything other than Social Security. After all, how many times during the debate on the budget did we hear about the Republicans' commitment to preserving Social Security surpluses? That was supposed to be a centerpiece of their whole resolution. But now it appears that when the Republican leadership met behind closed doors, their commitment was overwhelmed with other concerns. 
   This reversal is especially stunning in light of Republican criticisms about double counting, and now the GOP seems to want to use Social Security surpluses for all sorts of other programs. That sounds like double counting to me, Mr. President. 
   After all, you cannot use a dollar twice. If you use it as a Social Security dollar for Medicaid or tax cuts, that is one less dollar available to pay Social Security benefits. 
   So we ought to stand up for a simple proposition; that is, to use Social Security surpluses for Social Security. That is the message of this motion to instruct. It is an effort to reverse yesterday's decision and to get the entire Senate on record in support of saving Social Security surpluses for Social Security, and exclusively for Social Security. 
   I know my friends on the other side of the aisle will establish some type of elaborate lockbox that will protect Social Security. But given the agreement that developed yesterday, it makes one wonder: What will Social Security surpluses be locked up for? Will they be locked up for tax cuts? For other retirement programs? For some new type of program that is given the label ``Social Security''? Or will they be locked up to pay guaranteed Social Security benefits, as they are supposed to be? 
   I think Social Security taxes should be used for Social Security benefits, not for other types of spending or tax cuts that somehow or other can be called retirement security. So I strongly urge the Republican leadership to reverse the decision that was reached last night. Social Security surpluses should be used for Social Security--and I drum the point home--and only Social Security, not other programs, not tax cuts. If we are serious about that principle, let's really make a commitment to it. Let's not endorse open-ended language like retirement security that could encourage future abuses. 
   I hope and urge that my colleagues will support this motion to instruct to reverse a commitment to language that permits an open-ended use of that money under the umbrella of ``retirement security.'' 
   I yield the floor.

   I remind my good friend from New Mexico that we are pleased to have his support, that the vagary that develops as a result of this new language ``retirement security'' is kind of a red flag. It tells us that there is something else. Knowing the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee as I do, when he says he is going to do this, I know that he is going to do it. I know when he goes to conference again that he is going to make sure that this is held. I am comforted by that notion, as are millions of Americans who are one day to get Social Security as part of their retirement program. 
   This is kind of a happy day. I hope that all of the Republicans will support this, as will the Senator from New Mexico, chairman of the Budget Committee. I do not see how they can resist. 
   With that, Mr. President, I ask the distinguished Senator from New Mexico whether he is ready to yield back time?

   It is not part of a scheme to go into conference and say, ``Sorry, we are dropping it.'' We don't want it dropped. I know that the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee doesn't really want it dropped. 
   We can differ about the approach, but all of us will make a single statement: If Social Security has a surplus, we want it there for the people who are going to retire when their time comes. It is as simple as that. 
   I am pleased to have the support of the chairman of the Budget Committee.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I am introducing today the Bottled Water Safety and Right-to-Know Act of 1999. This legislation is designed to ensure that bottled water safety standards protect public health, and to give consumers the right to know about contaminants in their bottled water. 
   Mr. President, I have been interested in bottled water for several years. Bottled water consumption has doubled in the U.S. since 1987, largely due to the public perception that bottled water is cleaner and safer than tap water. This is especially true in my state, where we hear so often about contamination of tap water. Unfortunately, bottled water today does not have to meet all the same safety standards met by tap water. Nor do consumers have the right to know about the contaminats found in bottled water. Let me discuss each of these issues in more detail. 
   There is an important disparity between contaminant standards for bottled water and those for tap water. Bottled water is regulated as a food by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, while tap water is regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Unfortunately, several contaminants are regulated less stringently in bottled water by the FDA than in tap water by the EPA. In particular, the FDA has no standard for phthalate, a probable human carcinogen which leaches out of some plastic bottles, no ban on fecal coliform of E. Coli, and weaker standards for several other contaminants. In addition, the infrastructure guaranteeing the safety of bottled water is far weaker than the regulatory programs the EPA and its state and local partners have established for tap water. 
   There is, in addition, a disparity in the transparency of information about the two types of water. Public water systems have long been required to monitor contaminant levels and allow no more than a maximum amount of contamination in their water. Facing only these regulatory requirements, however, water companies had little incentive to provide more than the minimum-required level of drinking water protection. The Safe Drinking Water Act Amendments of 1996 changed that by adding consumer Right-to-Know requirements to the existing regulatory programs. The purpose of the Right to Know requirements is to increase public understanding of drinking water threats, foster public demand for prevention of those threats, and thereby lead water companies and state and local agencies to go beyond the minimum requirements in preventing the threats. 
   Unfortunately, no equivalent Right to Know exists for bottled water. Customers have no way to know whether the bottled product--hundreds of times more expensive than what comes out of the tap--is the safer, cleaner product. In other words, Mr. President, bottled water is the snake oil of the 1990's--it is sold as a cleaner product purely on the basis of claims and perception, not facts. 
   The Bottled Water Safety and Right-to-Know Act of 1999 would correct these deficiencies, establishing contaminant standards and Right-to-Know requirements for bottled water at least as stringent as those placed on tap water. 
   First, the bill would give the FDA two years to make all standards for contaminants in bottled water as protective of public health as the tap water standards established by the EPA, the State of California, the World Health Organization, and the European Union. If the FDA failed to implement this requirement, the bill would transfer regulatory authority over bottled water to the EPA. 
   Second, the bill would require that bottled water companies list, on their products' labels, the concentration of any regulated contaminant found at levels high enough to cause adverse health effects, and of any other contaminants whose presence in tap water would be disclosed to the public under federal law. Bottled water without contamination would require no such contaminant labelling. In addition, labels would name the source of the water, the type of treatment applied, and whether the treatment meets the EPA's criteria of full protection of immuno-compromised individuals from Cryptosporidium and other microbial pathogens. 
   Finally, the bill would require bottled water companies to send the FDA information on the contaminants in the water, the source of the water, and type of treatment applied. The FDA would then make the reported information, information on the recent inspection and enforcement history of the relevant bottled water facilities, and other background information available to the public through the Internet and in paper form through a 1-800 number, both of which would be printed on bottle labels. 
   Mr. President, bottled water consumers have the right to bottled water that is as safe as tap water, and they have the right to know about the contaminants in their bottled water.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, I want to ask a couple of questions, if I may, because I'm struck by a paragraph on page 5, beginning with line 8:  
   This resolution does not adopt the President's proposal to reduce medicare spending by $19,400,000,00 over 10 years, nor does the resolution adopt the President's proposal to spend $10,000,000,000 of medicare program.....  
   That is followed by:  
   Congress will not transfer to the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund new IOUs that must be redeemed later by raising taxes on American workers, cutting benefits, or borrowing more from the public.  
   Would that preclude any use of surpluses if there were additional surpluses that arose? 
   How can you attribute a tax increase, or more borrowing, directly to this? This is out of the general revenues, and I am curious how the connection is made and whether or not a surplus would be able to be used.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. So we are specifically targeting raising taxes. Could this be competitive by using--and this is said with all due respect to the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee. If tax cuts are put into place, or attempted to be put into place, would the response be, then--and if we prohibit that by virtue of an agreement here and in the House, would that be considered raising taxes if we didn't cut taxes? Would that, in turn, be considered a tax increase? 
</TEXT>

<DOC>
<DOCNO>106-lautenberg-nj-3-19990325</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. So that it is possible that there could be a competitive environment where tax cuts are competing with our capacity to continue to fund Medicare. You know, we have a debate about these transfers and whether IOUs are really significant. If we transferred $1 billion in cash to the Medicare trust fund--the insurance trust fund, and they were to go out into the public marketplace and buy $1 billion worth of insurance bonds, or what have you, those IOUs would have established their value--that cash, rather, I am sorry, would have established its value. 
   Why wouldn't an IOU from the Federal Government, which is where so many companies and individuals put their money because 
   it is the full faith and credit of our Nation, thereby guaranteed by strength more there than anyplace else--why wouldn't those IOUs be considered the same as a cash transfer? It is true that they are going to come out of general revenues to be paid for, but it would also ensure that no pressure on the Appropriations Committee could say, all right, we are not going to be able to fund that, and then a later Congress says, OK, we are going to have to cut back on benefits by raising age or raising deductible, raising copays, or what have you. This at least ensures that that money will be there; those funds will be there off into the future; am I correct or not on that?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Thank you, Mr. President. 
   Mr. President, I was, obviously, very much interested--I will not say moved--by the discussion that I just heard on this amendment, because the drill is a familiar one. The drill is the people who earned it want it back; and, why not give it to them? Of course, we want to give it to them. But whether you give it to them in direct tax cuts or you shore up Social Security, you say that no matter when you retire, for the next 75 years, you will know that the retirement program is going to be there for you. Or you say, ``Well, we are going to take the Medicare fund, and we are going to increase its solvency from 2008 to 2020, 12 years more, during which time, or during this time, because we are looking at something 21 years away. We want to institute the reforms that are so often talked about so that health care can be provided in a reasonable fashion with longevity, with the solvency that is required. 
   I heard the distinguished Senator from Minnesota in our Budget Committee the other day presenting a poll in which he said 63 percent of the people--I think I have it accurately and fairly--polled wanted a tax cut. I read a newspaper story about that poll. Once the question was put as to whether you would rather have a tax cut, or pay down the debt, or make sure that Social Security is there for you, or make sure that Medicare is there when you need it, the numbers changed radically. The numbers that said pay down the debt, increase the longevity for Social Security, increase the longevity and solvency of Medicare, and, boy, they went the other way. 
   When I hear that the typical American family pays 40 percent in taxes--I  don't know what the income is for the typical American family, but I can tell you that almost 60 percent of the people are in the $38,000 or below income strata. They are not paying 40 percent taxes. Come on. Let's be reasonably direct and accurate about these things. 
   Look at what happened. If we use the GOP tax program as outlined by the distinguished Senator, the chairman of the Finance Committee, he says that if you are in the top 1 percent of the income, over $300,000 or more, an average of $800,000 a year, you get a $20,000 tax cut. But if you make $38,000, which is the bottom 60 percent of the people in this country, $38,000, you save $99. The guy on the top who gets a $20,000 refund could buy another car for that, or add a wing to his house. But the family that is earning $38,000 is not going to do a lot with 100 bucks--$99 to be precise. 
   I think we ought to be fairly clear when we have this debate. Yes, everyone is entitled to offer amendments they think are appropriate, but we ought not to color the facts such that we ignore the reality of what it is we are talking about. 
   Mr. President, I think that it is quite obvious that this gets back to the essential dispute between the parties with the Republicans wanting tax breaks primarily for the wealthy, ignoring the fact that they can improve the condition of 
   Medicare. 
   We on this side want to have as our principal programs: save Social Security; extend the life of Medicare; make sure there are targeted tax breaks so that families who have an elderly parent can take care of that parent and get a tax deduction, a tax break for that responsibility; or who needs day care for their children, and get a tax break so that mama can work. That is what we are talking about. We are talking about things that pertain to the average American. 
   I am one of the people lucky enough to be in the top 1 percent. I was in business before I was here. I will tell you something. I am so happy every time I have the ability to earn that kind of money to pay my taxes, because I belong to the best club in the whole world, the club called ``America,'' where everything is available to you. Opportunity should be--education should be--everything should be available for those who want to climb the ladder and who are clever enough to do it. 
   That is what I am paying for when I send in my tax bill. I don't think it is being squandered by a bunch of bureaucrats. Some, maybe. That happens in corporate life. I ran a big corporation. I can tell you. What I want is a secure country. I want a country where people feel good about themselves and aren't looking at the guys on top and saying they are getting all the breaks. That is not a stable society. The stable society says, I want a chance to educate my children, I want a chance to have a roof over my head, and I want a chance to have a job. That is what I want. I want to know that when I am of retirement age that Social Security is going to be there for me. And I am happy to pay my dues. That is what it is--dues. We are so lucky to be here. People are willing to die, and are fleeing in inner tubes across the straits near Cuba, near Florida, to get to this country, and risk death coming out of ships' holds and things such as that to get to this country. We are not talking about squandering money and throwing away the citizens' dollars. 
   I think we ought to defeat this amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I just heard, I think I will call it the chairman's lament, and that is here we have all this money and we can't give tax breaks. But I see the tax breaks as having a funny shape to them. They are big for the guy at the top and they are little for the people who need it most. But I would say this, that the only people who can add a new room to the house, get a child some special assistance with 
   education, prepare retirement, ensure health care is available are those who have some surplus. That is when you do the good things. And the good things to me are not to take care of the guys at the top, who would get another 20 grand, to use the expression, on top of the $800,000 they make. I don't think they need help. But the person who is making $38,000, a family of four, they are struggling. They are struggling. They are trying to find a way to take care of all the needs as the kids grow, and it is a difficult, difficult problem. 
   So I do not object to appropriate tax breaks. I don't object to tax breaks for long-term health care. I don't object to tax breaks for child care so that mom can go to work and help dad support the family, or vice versa. I don't object to any of those things. 
   So with that I think we have probably heard each other enough. Can we yield back all the time?

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts. 
   Mr. President, I support Senator KERRY's amendment to delay new tax cuts if projected surpluses do not materialize. Medicare has a compelling need for revenues in the future that should not be jeopardized by tax cuts, especially knowing that these costs for tax cuts would explode substantially in the outyears. 
   I want to mention for my colleagues some history. The fiscal year 1982 budget projected surpluses were just around the corner. We all know what happened to those projected surpluses after the massive 1982 tax cut. We have also seen in recent years how wrong both CBO and OMB estimates have been as the economy has consistently outperformed all projections. Projecting long-term budget results is really an art, not a science. 
   This budget resolution relies heavily on estimates of surpluses going so far out as to adjust them during the summer. If such short-term estimates are being taken into account, we also ought to take into account the long-term realities. If the surpluses do not materialize, the tax cuts they are based on should be delayed until the surpluses are there. 
   We just heard the distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee talk about tax cuts being permanently in law. We still do not fully understand why the commonly referred to ``revenue surprise'' has occurred, and we don't know honestly how long it is going to last. 
   My Republican colleagues often say, we are returning excess revenues to the taxpayers. I put it to them, if the tax revenues are not there in the future, should we drain away resources from Medicare to provide tax cuts? 
   Today we are phasing in tax cuts over long periods to obscure their revenue effects. If we implement tax breaks which create huge outyear revenue losses and the economy fails to perform as well as predicted, we could return to the world of deficits as far as the eye can see, just in time for the baby boomers to begin retiring. 
   Very simply, Mr. President, I think this is a sound amendment. It says, don't give it away unless you know very well that you are on target. 
   I think it is a reasonable position. I think it is fiscally sound. I hope that our colleagues will vote for the 
   Kerry amendment.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment because it will prohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending and instead will require that all new mandatory spending be offset with other mandatory cuts. It is a major change in law. If there is a mandatory expenditure, commonly called entitlement, the fact of the matter is that we ought not be changing it by restricting funding. We ought to change the law. Change the law and you have taken care of the problem. 
   But I don't think this is an appropriate way to do it. Programs like Social Security and Medicare could be affected, and I think it is an inappropriate way to do it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I support the amendment by the Senator from Illinois, and I point out that when we are talking about emergencies, we are talking about things like a volcanic eruption in the State of Washington, Mt. Saint Helens, or we are talking about an earthquake in California, or floods down the Mississippi, or storm damage in the Northeast. I don't know why it should take 60 votes to agree with maybe someone who has taken an unpopular political position earlier. I think we ought to let the majority rule. If we need changes in the emergency definition, I would certainly go along with that. Make sure that it is urgent. Make sure it is an emergency. But to suggest that simply because we don't have enough votes that the volcanic damage is worth cleaning up immediately, or some oil spill isn't worth dealing with immediately, frankly, I think is bad law. I think we ought to eliminate it from this budget resolution. 
   I hope that the vote on the amendment by the Senator from Illinois will prevail. 
   I yield the time. 
   I ask the Republican leader, is there another amendment to be discussed?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I reluctantly but strongly oppose the Crapo amendment. It would create a reserve fund, as I understand, to lock in any additional onbudget surplus in the outyears to be used only for tax breaks and debt reduction. 
   Mr. President, the Democrats welcome the opportunity to lock away a portion of the surplus for debt reduction. We have offered amendments that would do just that. But this amendment would limit the use of future surpluses to debt reduction or tax breaks exclusively--only. So I have to ask my friends on the other side of the aisle the following question. Why is it OK to set aside the surplus to create a new special interest tax loophole but not OK to use the surplus for an increase in military pay? Why is it OK to set aside  the surplus to give more tax breaks to the well off but not OK to use the surplus to hire more teachers and reduce class size? 
   Mr. President, this amendment is not about fiscal responsibility. It is not about saving Social Security or Medicare. But it is about setting aside the surplus to give tax breaks particularly to the wealthiest among us. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.

So I will say that now we want to shake the tree and see if we can drop some of those amendments that perhaps on reconsideration by the offeror, maybe there would be another time to achieve the goal he or she wants to attain. But I want to add this, Mr. President. I think it is an important observation. There could be as many as 50 votes. 
   Now, if we are exact on the enforcement of the time limit, which I would urge we agree to, that 10 minutes is 10 minutes, it is not 11, 12, 13, that means everybody has to pay attention. If we have a 10-minute vote and a 2-minute debate, that is 12 minutes. And if you have 50 of those, we are looking at 600 minutes.

This could be expedited substantially. We hope that any Senators who have an amendment review that which has already been discussed and accepted so that we are not being redundant. If it has been heard, I would ask colleagues to perhaps rethink whether or not they are going to offer their amendment.

It would prohibit using revenues to offset new mandatory spending and instead require all new spending to be offset with other mandatory cuts. It would give special protection to special interest tax loopholes at the expense of programs like Social Security or Medicare. 
   I understand the Senator said ``new programs.'' It would prevent us from using the onbudget surplus for prescription drugs, new benefits, or any new mandatory spending. The onbudget surplus could be used only for tax breaks. 
   Also, the amendment would prevent us from using the user fees, such as gas tax, to pay for new highways. If we are looking for a way to pay for a new benefit, why would we say that cutting Social Security is OK but closing a wasteful tax loophole is not? Why would we say that cutting Medicare is OK but eliminating a corporate tax subsidy is not? 
   I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, Mr. President, and I make the budget point of order. I think this is not germane.

We put our most difficult disagreements to the side at times. Senator DOMENICI invented a new index for debate. And the index that Senator DOMENICI has is a ``red'' neck. When it gets above your collar, that is when you have to sit back. 
   So we have no ``red'' necks in the Budget Committee. We have had a good time in getting it done. I thank all of my colleagues, particularly the members on my side, who worked so arduously. 
   I do want to say a word about the staff while the Senators are here. I thank Bill Hogan and his team; but I also want to make particular mention of the fact that Bruce King, our chief of staff, Sue Nelson, Lisa Konwinski, Amy Abraham, Claudia Arko, 
   Jim Esquea, Dan Katz, Marty Morris, Paul Saltman, Jeff Siegel, Mitch Warren, Ted Zegers, and Jon Rosenwasser--I thank all the staff. They worked very hard, on both sides, and they deserve our deep thanks and our appreciation. 
   With that, I surrender the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today as one of a bipartisan group of Senators introducing the Serbia Democratization Act of 1999. 
   We've been developing this legislation for some time, to address our long-term interest in fostering democracy and human rights in what remains of the former Yugoslavia. But this legislation sends an important message at a time when our Armed Forces are conducting air operations and missile strikes against the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, comprising Serbia and Montenegro. 
   The message this legislation sends to the people of Serbia and Montenegro is  this: We are determined to punish those leaders responsible for such horrific violence throughout the former Yugoslavia. But we are also ready to support the development of democracy and civil society to help the people of Serbia and Montenegro overcome the repression which they, too, have suffered under the Milosevic regime. 
   The measures outlined in this act will help free thought and free speech to survive in Serbia-Montenegro. This legislation will also give victims of Serbian attacks, particularly in Kosovo, a degree of comfort knowing the American people stand with them in their hour of need even as our aircraft fly overhead. 
   This legislation also puts Slobodan Milosevic on notice that the reign of terror he has unleashed against the people of the Balkans--including Serbs and others within Serbia--will soon be over. Along with democratization measures for Serbia-Montenegro, this act contains narrow sanctions to make it more difficult for Milosevic to sustain his corrupt regime and carry on his bloody war. 
   The years Milosevic has been in power have left the region devastated. Americans remember all too well his brutal handiwork in the war in Bosnia. The images of destroyed homes, ethnically cleansed villages, of decaying corpses in mass graves, are indelibly etched in all our minds. 
   Now, less than two years after the signing of the Dayton peace agreement which brought about the end of that war, Milosevic has unleashed a similarly brutal campaign against people within Serbia. Yugoslav tanks and soldiers are attempting to crush the Kosovar Albanians' resistance. Belgrade's brutal crackdown has left thousands dead, tens of thousands homeless, and hundreds of thousands displaced from their towns and villages. 
   The man known in the Balkans as the Butcher of Belgrade, does not reserve his repression for Croats, Bosniaks, or Albanians. In his quest to gain and hold power, he has not spared his capital of Belgrade. 
   For years now, Slobodan Milosevic has carried out a sustained campaign to destroy his country's democratic institutions and its people's freedoms. He is a communist thug, a relic of the bad old days of Central Europe. For years, he has run whole of the so-called Federal Republic of Yugoslavia from his position as head of the constituent Republic of Serbia, leaving the constitution of the former Yugoslavia in tatters. 
   The Milosevic regime has tried for years to prevent the development of independent media outlets to provide accurate news and other information to the people of Serbia and Montenegro. Journalists who have pursued stories unflattering to the regime have been threatened and beaten by police. Independent television stations and newspapers are being shut down through litigation under a draconian press law passed last fall. As the State Department's 1998 Human Rights Report notes, that law allows private citizens and organizations to bring suit against media outlets for publishing information 
   not deemed patriotic enough or considered to be ``against the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of the country.'' 
   The effects of this policy are chilling. The people of Serbia-Montenegro are getting a filtered message about the events in their country and around the world. They see and hear and read only the news their Government chooses to disseminate. 
   Since NATO announced the approval of air operations and missile strikes, Belgrade has cracked down further on the independent media. Radio B92, operated courageously by Veran Matic, was shut down at gunpoint. Instead of hearing what is really happening, instead of hearing our reasons for conducting air strikes, people in Belgrade hear the regime's propaganda on Government radio. 
   The university in Belgrade--one of the great institutes of higher learning in Central Europe--has been purged of professors who refuse to tow the party line. Students who have protested this action have been harassed. As a result, there are virtually no progressive professors or students left in several programs. 
   The economy, too, is in tatters. Unemployment and underemployment hovers at 60 percent, primarily because the government has been unwilling to carry out needed economic reforms. Privatization, the cornerstone of a market economy, remains at a standstill, allowing cronyism and corruption to flourish. 
   I would like to draw particular attention to a section of this law concerning the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. 
   As many of you know, for the past two years I have introduced legislation that bans U.S. aid to communities in the former Yugoslavia harboring war criminals. I introduced that legislation because it is my firm belief that democracy cannot come to a country, that a nation cannot begin to face the sins of its past, and that people cannot feel secure in their own communities, until individuals who persecuted others are brought to justice. 
   Milosevic has a deplorable record in cooperating with the Tribunal. He has continually scorned his obligations to the United Nations to turn over war criminals to the Tribunal for prosecution, citing constitutional constraints. Consequently, indicted war criminals--including Ratko Mladic, who is responsible for the massacre of hundreds of people during the Bosnian war, and the so-called Vukovar three who were indicted for the murder of 260 unarmed men during the 1991 attack on that Croatian city--reportedly live freely in Serbia. 
   He denied officials from the Tribunal access to Kosovo to investigate alleged crimes in the village of Racak, after 40 people were found dead, their mutilated bodies dumped in a ravine. Milosevic tried to claim that the victims--children, women and old men--were combatants and shot in a confrontation with Serbian police. To lend his story credence, Milosevic instead allowed a so-called independent forensic team from Belarus--itself caught in the Stalinist past--and a group of Finns to analyze the corpses. 
   Milosevic's tactic backfired. The forensic team found that the victims were unarmed civilians, executed in an organized massacre. Some of these Kosovars ``were forced to kneel before being sprayed with bullets,'' as the Washington Post reported it. 
   Those who master-minded and perpetrated the massacres in Racak must face justice. Our Congress has already made very clear our view that Slobodan Milosevic is a war criminal and should be indicted and tried by the International Tribunal. 
   Mr. President, United States policy toward Belgrade is and must be much more than the use of air strikes. The legislation before us today will help Secretary Albright's efforts to bring lasting peace, democracy and prosperity to Serbia and Montenegro, as well as to Kosovo and the rest of the Balkans, by helping democracy and freedom prevail over a brutal dictator.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today we begin our annual pilgrimage to establishing a budget for the next fiscal year. The first year of the new millennium is almost upon us, and we are moving at a fairly rapid pace to get this budget into place, as contrasted to some of the experiences we have had in the past. I commend our chairman, Senator DOMENICI, for his lending the urgency that he has to getting this job underway. 
   Lest it be misunderstood, Mr. President, that does not mean I agree with everything that we have come up with. But we are moving the ball, as they say, and we will have a chance to amend or debate the budget resolution as it passed the Budget Committee. 
   As we begin our work on a budget for a new century and a new era in our Nation's economic history, we do it with the knowledge and the satisfaction that at long last, America has put its fiscal house in order. 
   At the same time, we still face serious long-term questions. The key question facing Congress is whether we meet those challenges and prepare for the future, or whether we will yield to short-term temptation at tomorrow's expense. 
   Democrats are committed to focusing on the future. Our top priority is to save Medicare and save Social Security for the long term by reducing our debt and increasing national savings. We also want to provide targeted tax relief for those who need it most, and that is the average middle-class family in America. We want to invest in education and other priorities. 
   Our friends, the Republicans, have a different view. Their plan focuses on tax breaks, largely for the wealthy. These tax breaks, whose costs would increase dramatically in the future, would absorb resources that are needed to preserve and to save Medicare. 
   That, when you get right down to it, is really the main issue before the Senate: Should we provide tax cuts, many of which will benefit the wealthy, or use that money to save Medicare? It is as simple as that. 
   Of course, there is a lot more to the budget resolution before us, so let me take some time to explain why I, like every other Democratic member of the Budget Committee, strongly opposed this resolution. There are four primary reasons. 
   First, as I have suggested, it fails to guarantee a single extra dollar for Medicare. Instead, it diverts the funds needed for Medicare to pay for tax cuts that, again, benefit the wealthy fairly generously. 
   Second, it does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. In fact, it could block President Clinton's proposed transfer of surplus funds to help extend solvency. 
   Third, I think it is fiscally dangerous. The resolution proposes tax cuts that begin small but that explode in the 
   future. Some are around $13 billion in the first year the budget goes into place, up to $180 billion--$177 billion--expected in the tenth year, just when the baby boomers are beginning to retire. 
   And fourth, it proposes extreme and unrealistic cuts in domestic programs. These could devastate public services if  enacted. More likely, Congress, in my view, is going to be unable to pass appropriations bills, and we will face a crisis at the end of this year that could lead to a complete Government shutdown. 
   I want to address each of these problems in turn, Mr. President. 
   Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund is now expected to become insolvent in the year 2008. It is critical that we address this problem and we do it soon. We need to modernize and reform the program to make it function more efficiently, but it is clear that also we will need additional resources. 
   As part of an overall solution, President Clinton proposed allocating 15 percent of projected unified budget surpluses for Medicare. This would extend the solvency of the trust fund for another 12 years, to 2020. Unfortunately, the budget resolution rejects that proposal. Instead of using projected surpluses for Medicare, it uses almost all of them for tax cuts. The budget resolution does not specify the details of the tax cuts because they will be drafted later in the Finance Committee. However, the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator ROTH, has said recently that he wants to provide a 10-percent cut in tax rates. 
   Under that proposal, the top 1 percent of Americans with incomes over $300,000, and average incomes of more than $800,000, would get a tax cut of more than $20,000. And those in the bottom 60 percent, incomes under $38,000, would wind up with $99, less than 100 bucks. 
   Other major GOP proposals for tax cuts, which involve estate taxes and capital gains taxes, are similarly regressive and unfair. Giving away disproportionate tax breaks to the wealthy would be bad enough, but the GOP tax breaks would come at the direct expense of Medicare, and that is wrong. 
   Under the Republican plan, not one penny of projected surpluses is guaranteed for Medicare. The resolution does reserve about $100 billion for unspecified uses over 10 years. But that is far less than the $350 billion the President wants for Medicare over 10 years. More importantly, none of the $100 billion is actually reserved for Medicare. 
   In fact, the chairman indicated that this amount may be used for unexpected emergencies or contingencies, and those alone could easily use up all this money. Emergency spending averages $9 billion a year, more than the resolution's annual reserve for each of the next 5 years. Even over 10 years, we can expect to consume at least 90 percent of this projected reserve to respond to emergencies. 
   Mr. President, the Republican refusal to provide additional resources for Medicare would have a direct impact on the millions of Americans who will depend on Medicare for their health services in the future. The resolution almost certainly would mean higher health care costs, higher copayments for the individuals, their share of the bill, higher deductibles--that means it does not kick in until the levels of costs directly to the individual have risen--and potentially lower quality health care services, and probably fewer hospitals, all because the majority insists on providing huge tax breaks for wealthier Americans. 
   Beyond Medicare, the second major problem with the Republican resolution is that it does nothing to extend the solvency of the Social Security trust fund. Currently, Social Security is projected to become insolvent by the year 2032. President Clinton is determined to extend the solvency until 2075 and has proposed specific policies to get us to the year 
   2055, as certified by Social Security actuaries. 
   The Republicans have been critical of the President's proposals to invest some of the Social Security funds in the private market and to transfer debt held by the public to the trust fund. Unfortunately, they propose nothing to increase the resources available to Social Security. In fact, their resolution is specifically designed to block the President's proposed transfer of surplus funds for Social Security. 
   The bottom line, when it comes to Social Security, is clear. President Clinton's budget extends solvency through the year 2055. The Republican plan does not add a single day of security. 
   The third major problem with the resolution is that it is fiscally risky. The resolution calls only for small tax cuts in the first year or two. But the cost of those tax cuts explode in the future. And by 2009, as I said earlier, when the baby boomers will begin retiring, the tax cuts will drain the Treasury of more than $180 billion in that year. That is not fiscal responsibility. 
   The final problem with the Republican plan is that it includes extreme cuts in programs for Americans here at home. Total nondefense discretionary programs--to be absolutely clear, the discretionary programs include defense and nondefense--total nondefense discretionary programs would be cut in the first year from $266 billion in the current year, not including emergency spending, to $246 billion in the year 2000. 
   One does not have to be a mathematician to recognize that is a significant change--from $266 billion to $246 billion in 1 year. Arithmetically, it looks like a 7.5-percent cut--and that does not sound like a lot--but the real cut in most programs would be much deeper. And I assure you that 7.5-percent cut, at a minimum, is a very significant, painful exercise for those who are depending on some of our Government programs. And I am not talking about wasteful programs; I am talking about fundamental programs like WIC and border guards and FBI agents and DEA agents. 
   Keep in mind, the resolution claims to increase or maintain funding for a handful of favored programs, like new courthouses, TEA 21, our transportation program, for the next 6 years, the census, National Institutes of Health, and some crime and education programs. Those are the protected programs. 
   That leaves the other unprotected programs facing cuts of about 11 percent--everything from environmental protection to the national parks, the FAA, the Coast Guard, the Immigration and Naturalization Service Border Patrol, FBI, NASA, job training, and Head Start. These are successful and important programs. 
   When we say that these cuts are going to be 11 percent in the first year, that is being pretty conservative, because we are ignoring the fact that the cuts increase significantly in the future to 27 percent in the year 2004, a 27-percent cut for the American people. 
   Just to put the picture straight, imagine a 27-percent cut in wages, a 27-percent cut in spending power. It would be an awful tragedy for most families. 
   Second, the 11-percent figure that we talked about in the first year represents a cut from 1999 levels. To make it clear, our fiscal year ends September 30 for 1999; and on October 1 we 
   kick in with the budget for the year 2000. That does not anticipate any inflation impact. 
   Thirdly, there is another problem with the Republican budget. It significantly underestimates the outlays that would flow from its present levels of defense appropriations. If those outlays are estimated to be consistent with historical levels, the cuts in nondefense discretionary outlays would be as high as 21 percent in the first year. 
   I know that we are talking about a lot of different changes in the percentages. But it looks like the minimum could be 11 percent, and we could be looking at a figure as high as 27 percent in the nondefense discretionary programs. 
   Mr. President, I am going to give our Republican friends, the majority, the benefit of the doubt. I am going to, for the moment, not talk about the deeper cuts in the outyears. I am going to leave out, ignore, the effects of inflation. And I am not even going to consider this dramatic underestimate of defense outlays. I am going to start with this very conservative figure of 11 percent and consider what a cut of this magnitude would mean for domestic programs next year. Next year, again, starts October 1. 
   Here are a few examples, based on administration estimates: 
   That we would lose 2,700 FBI agents. I ask you, is this a time when it seems appropriate to be cutting back on FBI agents? When terrorism in this country is a real threat? When we are trying to stop crimes? We are adding crimes to the list of crimes that are going to be tried in Federal courts. So 2,700 FBI agents. 
   Thirteen hundred and fifty Border Patrol agents. We have heard from  many of our colleagues, Republican and Democrat, who live in border States and talk about the problems they have from California, through New Mexico, through Arizona, Texas, about those who illegally cross the border, pleading for more help, pleading for an opportunity to contain this illegal immigration flow. We are talking about reducing Border Patrol agents to the tune of 1,350? How do our friends who represent those border States feel about this? 
   Drug agents: 780 DEA drug enforcement agents would be lost. Now, if there is a more distracting problem in our society than drugs, I don't know what it is. The overrunning of our young people by drug influences is something that we can't tolerate, that we search for solutions to, at our wit's end. 
   One thing we know: While having enough drug enforcement agents alone doesn't solve the problem, take them away and we will see what happens to the flow of illegal drugs into this country. 
   Ninety thousand, two hundred fewer workers, dislocated as a result of industry shifts, plant closings, et cetera, would receive training, job search assistance, and support services--90,000 people would be left without the training necessary to move to different job situations if their job is lost. 
   Thirty-four thousand low-income children would be without child care assistance. 
   Over 1.2 million low-income women, infants, and children would lose nutrition assistance every month. That program is commonly known as the WIC Program. It is a very effective program. In a country like ours, with the bounty that we have from lots of natural resources, industry progress, people who are skillful, intelligent, who are hard working, lots of people making money--we talk today about the billionaire class as we used to hear 40 years ago about the millionaire class--and we want to permit 1.2 million low-income women, infants, and children who need the nutritional assistance that this program 
   offers to lose it? I will not stand by and let that happen. 
   FAA operations: Our aviation industry is booming. People cannot get seats in lots of situations. What do we worry about? We have lots of delays, we have concerns about safety and security and the lack of critical modernization technologies. FAA operations would be cut by almost $700 million. If we think the delays are bad now, hold on to your seat, because they are going to get worse. 
   Safety: We will focus on safety to make sure things are maintained, but we also want to protect ourselves against possible terrorist attacks, keeping people off the airplanes to make us more secure. 
   On the environment, roughly 21 Superfund toxic waste sites would not be cleaned up as a result of these cuts. They needlessly jeopardize public health. 
   Up to 100,000 children would lose the opportunity to benefit from Head Start. Head Start is an early preschool program that gives children who are typically from a disadvantaged situation a chance to understand the learning process, to get incentives to learn, to understand that learning is fun, that knowledge is beneficial. Take away that from 100,000 children? I don't know how we can do it. I don't know how, with a clear conscience, we can say, ``Go ahead, listen, too bad, take your chances.'' We know who pays the price. All of us pay the price. It is only a matter of when. It is much cheaper to give these kids a head start than to later deal with those who might turn to crime or drugs as a way to work their way up the social and economic ladder. 
   We would eliminate 73,000 training and summer job opportunities for young people. 
   As I earlier said, these are conservative figures, yet these types of cuts are clearly painful. In my view, they are dangerous. Unfortunately, under this resolution, the problem gets dramatically worse in later years. By the year 2004, the nondefense reductions grow to about 27 percent. Again, that doesn't include the effects of inflation nor any underestimation of defense outlays which loom large in front of us now. We have to wonder whether the Republicans are serious about cutting domestic programs by 27 percent. It is hard to believe, especially when there are virtually no details provided about where those cuts would fall. 
   Some Republicans have argued that these cuts are required because of the discretionary spending caps which remain in effect through the year 2002. That is not true. Much of the program for domestic programs is created because the resolution increases military spending by $18.2 billion over last year's level. Since all discretionary spending is now under a single cap--that is, defense and nondefense--that extra money must come directly from domestic programs. 
   President Clinton has also made it clear that we should increase funding for high-priority discretionary programs such as education and the military once we save Social Security. By contrast, the Republican plan establishes unrealistically low discretionary spending levels that would apply, regardless of whether we approve Social Security reform legislation. 
   Cutting domestic programs by 27 percent in 2004 is not realistic. When it comes to cutting specific programs, Congress almost certainly will not follow through. The votes won't be there to do it. 
   In other words, this budget resolution is a roadmap to gridlock. The results could be disastrous. If we can't pass appropriations bills, we face the prospect of yet another Government shutdown. Nobody wants that, of course, but it could happen. 
   Why, then, are we considering a budget resolution that even some Republicans admit can't be enacted into law? The answer is simple: They are desperate to claim that they are for tax cuts. They just don't have a clue on how to pay for them. They don't want to guarantee Medicare a single new dollar, but they are still not even close to identifying sufficient offsetting savings to pay for their tax cuts. 
   We are left with a budget that deals with fantasy, a budget that everybody knows isn't going to be worth the paper it is written on. In the end, there is only one way out. The majority party, the Republicans, have to get real. They can't continue to insist on huge tax cuts if they are not willing to pay for them. 
   So, in sum, Mr. President, let me quickly recount the four reasons why I oppose this budget. I do it with respect for the chairman. We worked hard together, but we just could not agree on what a budget would look like. 
   First, it doesn't guarantee a single additional penny for Medicare. Instead, it takes money needed for Medicare and uses it for tax cuts that will benefit the wealthy. 
   Second, it does nothing for Social Security. In fact, it doesn't extend Social Security's solvency by a single day. 
   Third, it is fiscally risky. It calls for huge tax cuts whose costs explode in the future, just when the baby boomers will be retiring. 
   Finally, its cuts in domestic programs are extreme. If they were ever enacted, they would seriously disrupt important and essential public services. But, more likely, Congress will never really approve them and we will again be facing a disastrous threat of a Government shutdown. 
   For all of these reasons, Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed by this budget resolution. I hope that we are going to be able to work together and make what I consider badly needed improvements. We have 35 hours in which to determine what the outcome of our budget discussions are going to be like, what the result is going to be. I hope that we will be able to strike a balance that can get us a budget that can pass both Houses, which can also be approved by the President. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I will take a couple of minutes with the agreement of the Senator from Minnesota just to respond, A, to say thank you to my dear friend and colleague for her complimentary remarks, but even more importantly than that--because flattery is nice, but effectiveness is even better--and the Senator from Maryland has been a known, strong advocate for the things that she believes in. 
   I greet Senator MIKULSKI each time I see her with the knowledge that she has enhanced our view of what life is really about by bringing a perspective that comes from the women's side that is so often left out. She knows also too well that she hits a familiar tone with me when she talks about Social Security, because my father died before my mother was 36 years old. She had nothing but bills and an obligation to my 12-year-old sister and an 18-year-old son who had already enlisted in the Army to support her. She did it by sheer dent of hard work and will. 
   If we had in that family, going back now--we are talking about 1943--the benefit of a Social Security Program, a check coming in that would kind of help relieve not only the fiscal financial obligations, but the anxiety that accompanies the worry about that, if we had Medicare or Medicaid in those days when my father died at the age of 43, a strapping handsome man--cancer overtook him, and he died leaving doctors bills. So we had not only enormous grief, but the obligation to pay off the doctor and hospital bills that were accumulated with no insurance program. 
   So when we talk about Social Security, we talk about women who are typically those left most often with the smallest share 
   of assets, because of the way we are structured. We need to make sure that Social Security is going to be there. We need to make sure that Medicare is going to be solvent for a number of years. Yes. We are not disagreeing with the need to reform and improve, if possible, but to make sure that it is equitably distributed. We need time. We need the assurance that the programs are going to be there. 
   I for one will jump on the reform-and-improve bandwagon as soon as we have a good vehicle to take us along. 
   So I thank the Senator from Maryland for her comments. 
   I see my friend also from California was so nice before to give me credit for some things I probably don't deserve. But, nevertheless, the credit is nice to get. 
   I thank both Senators.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank you, Mr. President. 
   I want to try to organize a point of view here that is substantially different than we have heard for the past while, and I say that with all due respect to my colleagues. And I mean that sincerely. 
   We have developed in the Budget Committee, I think, an operating mode that says that everybody, every member of that committee, is entitled to respect for their point of view, with adequate time to discuss it. I have served on that committee for many years, and I think it is perhaps the most amiable, the most cooperative operation of the Budget Committee that I have seen. I commend the chairman, Senator DOMENICI, for his effort. 
   We have struck an agreement, kind of informally, about it, but it has worked. And we disagree sharply on points of view. And sometimes, as Senator DOMENICI has said, our faces get red. But he was warned, he told me, that red faces do not win amendments or win points of view. So we kind of dropped the red-face approach, the swollen veins, that kind of thing. 
   But here I will venture a little bit into dangerous territory, because what we have heard so far is the accusation of double counting and talking about the structure, not the significance, not the meaning, not the value of the program, but whether or not this counts doubly when we credit Social Security or credit Medicare by giving them Government IOUs. The U.S. Government IOUs have the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
   I do not know where it is better, because I have met lots of people who have made lots of money. I was in the business world for years before I came to the Senate. I ran a big company, and a lot of the people I know who got surpluses, significant surpluses, invested them in Government bonds because they wanted to know that a certain part of their portfolios are protected by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
   So even though interest rates are lower than you might normally get, that is the reserve, the kitty, as we call it sometimes, that they can always count on, no matter what happens with the stock market. So I do not know why it is such a sin to say to the Medicare trust fund or the Social Security trust fund, ``Hey, invest your money in Government IOUs,'' because they are protected--first line--by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. 
   To me, it makes sense, because to have the money lie there, funds lie there fallow, without gathering interest or return on the funds, depreciates the amount of spending that can be offered to beneficiaries in the later years. 
   I don't understand some of the scorn with which Government IOUs are treated. It doesn't make sense to me. I know and meet rich folks who keep much of their money in the U.S. Government IOUs. 
   In order to make the argument, there are some negatives applied with reference to those who made money paying the biggest taxes. If we have a tax reduction of 10 percent, why shouldn't the people who make all that money get a commensurate reduction, an equal reduction? 
   I want to confirm something because there is a question raised about whether a 10-percent tax cut is really there by direction of the Budget Committee. It certainly is not, because the Budget Committee doesn't have the right to do that; the Finance Committee does. And the chairman of the Finance Committee, the distinguished Senator from Delaware, Mr. ROTH, told Reuters that he was very much in favor of using the bigger-than-expected budget surplus to fund across-the-board income tax of 10 percent or more. 
   He goes on to say, ``I don't think it's too big [the 10 percent income tax cut]; if anything, I would like to see it bigger.'' 
   That says something about someone of influence in the Republican Party and in this Senate. Again, he is a very distinguished Senator, long-serving Senator, and chairman of the Finance Committee. He is probably the most powerful Chair position that we have in the Senate. 
   He said it, 10 percent. 
   Now, back to where we were. Someone who earns an average of $800,000 a year, the top 1 percent of the income earners in the country, would get $20,000; and someone who earns $38,000 
   would get $99. The sarcastic or the sardonic tone that was used was if they made more, why shouldn't they get more? The difference is that when someone has earned $800,000, they don't need the $20,000 as much as the person who is making $38,000 or $39,000 needs some relief. Any family that has a $38,000-a-year income is not looking at luxury. They are not looking for a tax cut so they can buy a car or a boat. 
   I have heard it said that a rising tide lifts all boats. I know if you want to buy an expensive yacht, one that is over 100 feet long, the typical wait is 2 to 3 years. If someone has to wait 2 or 3 years to buy a yacht, I assure you that is quite a different position than someone who is making $700 or $800 a week supporting a family of four, trying to make sure that the kids can get an education, make sure there is a roof over their heads, and a decent homelife so they can enjoy some degree of the comforts of life. They can use the tax cuts. 
   Boy, I am for it 100 percent--targeted tax cuts to people who work hard and who need the money. I approve of the tax cuts that would support long-term care. I approve of the tax cuts that would support child care for modest-income people. Those are the kinds of tax cuts that distinguish this side of the aisle, the Democrats, from those on that side of the aisle. 
   I heard someone say something that struck me as being rather amusing--that the Democrats are the ones with the personal money. Some have it and some don't. That is true on both sides of the aisle. I am trying to think it through, but those I know who have worked hard to make their fortune earn respect for having done that, whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Some Members who didn't work hard but have money anyway are also decent people. It doesn't matter how much money you have; it is how much you have in your heart. 
   I come from a poor family, a family that hardly ever had a dinner together because we were always working in the store; one of us would be standing while the others were sitting and eating. 
   I have an understanding of what poverty or small incomes mean. I always thought that a good idea for incoming Senators and Congresspeople would be to spend a month or two in poverty, live in the kind of circumstances that we see in our cities and our rural communities. Live where you don't know what kind of food you will be able to give your children. Live where you don't know whether you will be dispossessed because you haven't paid the rent, and live where the best fun a child can have is to play ball in the street. We need a sprinkling of that in this place to bring an element of reality about what life is about and not talk about tax cuts for the rich in the same terms that we discuss tax cuts for hard-working people who need a little help with long-term care for a sick relative or an elderly parent. It is quite a different thing when we discuss things from that point of view. 
   The thing that matters most to modest-income people who have worked hard all their lives is to save Social Security. Turn the promise into reality, the promise that was made in 1935 when Social Security was conceived, the program that was conceived that said to people, work as hard as you can. Whether you work for a company and you lose your job along the way or you don't lose your job, Social Security is there for you. Full faith and credit of the U.S. Government will pay for it. 
   One of the worst afflictions we have in our society today, 
   one of the worries we have, is that people are afraid they will lose their health insurance. It was said by one of my colleagues before, over 40 million people in this country are without health insurance. It is a devastating thought--the prospect of someone getting sick and not being  able to maintain their health care coverage, watching not only their health go down the drain but their finances as well. 
   We have an obligation, I think, to make sure that every one of our citizens in this country has a chance at some kind of minimum health care, so they don't have to worry about going bankrupt if they run into an illness along the way.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this amendment stands for the proposition that before we spend a penny of any surplus we ought to work hard to save Social Security and Medicare. That is what our primary obligation ought to be. 
   This amendment would make it out of order to consider any new spending or revenue reductions before we have enacted legislation to ensure the long-term solvency of Social Security, and to extend the solvency of the Medicare hospital insurance trust fund by at least 12 years. 
   It has been said by our friends on the other side that we don't add a penny. Well, it is not so. We can disagree. I wouldn't call my friends on the other side dishonest if they disagree with me. I don't like it when we are called dishonest or deceptive or that the President of the United States is lying when he lays down a budget. 
   You can argue this thing from all sides of the discussion. Some think that OMB has a more reliable forecasting ability; some think CBO. We are obliged to respond to our needs by using CBO as a reference. The fact of the matter is, if there is a difference, it is not because someone is trying to cheat here or someone is being dishonest; it is a difference of view. Let the public hear it. Let the public listen to this debate. 
   As I look at things now, times are good today, but we still face tremendous long-term challenges. This is the time to deal with those challenges. We don't know how much of projected surpluses we will need. The Social Security trust fund is projected to become insolvent in 2032, and I don't hear many arguments about that. 
   At that point, revenues will only be sufficient to fund about three-quarters of the benefits that were initially promised. Mr. President, 2032 is not a long time in the scheme of things. It is long when you have as much white hair as I have, or as much as the chairman has, but it is only three decades away. Relatively small changes today can have a significant impact in the long run. If we wait too long, the changes necessary to establish long-term solvency may be too wrenching and too difficult to accomplish. 
   Meanwhile, Mr. President, Medicare's problems are even more urgent. The program's trust fund faces insolvency in 2008. That is not a long time away. We can't afford to wait much longer before we act to extend its life and to make those changes that would prolong the life of Medicare beyond even 2020, which we are trying to establish here. 
   This amendment simply asks the Senate to set its priorities straight. It says our first priority should be to save Social Security and Medicare. It says before we squander surpluses on new initiatives, on major tax cuts, let's do first things first and prepare for the future, because the retirement of millions of baby boomers and other younger Americans depends upon it. Once we have protected Social Security and Medicare, we can consider using any remaining surpluses for other purposes. 
   Mr. President, I want to be clear that this is not an anti-tax-cut amendment. Like the President, I strongly support targeted tax relief for middle-class families. I hope we are going to approve the child care and long-term tax credits that the President proposed, along with further tax cuts to promote savings. Nothing in this amendment would block those or any other tax cuts. The amendment simply says that before we use 
   any of the surpluses--and I have to take one moment to remind everybody about where we were and where we are. In 1992, when President Clinton won the election, we were $290 billion in annual debt. Despite the optimistic forecasts of some, nobody really who thought a lot about the budget a year or two ago would have thought they would be looking at a potential budget surplus of over $100 billion in this year--$100 billion. 
   So I want to give credit where it is due. I don't always agree with the President. I don't agree, necessarily, with some of the budget proposals that his budget laid out before us. We voted against it in the Budget Committee. But the fact of the matter is, yes, with the work of people like Senator DOMENICI and others on the Republican side, as well as those of us on the Democratic side, we worked together in 1997, as I think we had never done before--at least in my memory here--to get a balanced budget in front of us, to get our fiscal house in order. It was a tremendous accomplishment. It is reflected in the confidence that people have in our stock markets and in investments in the country. 
   Mr. President, we can pass all kinds of tax cuts, but we must remember that all of these things come in priority order. This amendment, again, says before we use our surpluses, we should save Social Security and Medicare. So Congress can still pass as many tax cuts as it wants, even before we address those long-term problems--we would just have to pay for them--just so we don't use up projected surpluses. That should help give us the incentives we need to get the job done. 
   I also point out, Mr. President, that this amendment applies not just to tax cuts but also to new spending. We should not go on any big spending binges, even for worthy causes, until we know we have saved Social Security and Medicare. That is done in a prospective manner. It is a point in time when we can say with a degree of confidence that this is going to take care of the elongation of the life of Medicare; this is going to take care of the solvency of the Social Security program until 2075. That is what we want to do. We want to know that those things are accomplished, and it doesn't matter whether the spending on top of that is pursued through direct appropriations or through the Tax Code. 
   So, Mr. President, this amendment says let's keep our focus on the future, let's keep our priorities straight, let's save Social Security and Medicare first--that we do that before we pass either new spending or tax cuts that use projected budget surpluses. I hope we can assemble a point of view that constitutes agreement in that direction, and that we will join together and  get enough votes from our friends on the other side of the aisle. I hope we can do it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. If the Senator will just give me about 2 minutes to respond to Senator DOMENICI. 
   I just say that though the quote from Senator BREAUX is that it is not an either/or proposition, the fact is that the Republican priority--and I will do the unheard of; I will hold up my own sign--that the Republican priority for the surplus has made it either/or. We have tax breaks for the 10-year period, over $800 billion, $831 billion, and Medicare, zero. So if we want to discuss what we are going to do for Medicare, I guess there is some thought that you can help it by giving it nothing, because that is what is planned. So if we are going to use the quote here, then I think we have to use it in the context of reality. 
   With that, since the Senator from Massachusetts had asked for the floor, Mr. President, I yield--how much time?

   The fact of the matter is that the reserve fund, this mythical reserve fund, that was going to be $132 billion has, by osmosis, shrunk to $101 billion and it is headed in the wrong direction. 
   If there is going to be any participation at all in establishing solvency for another 12 years for Medicare, we have to make our judgment based on where things stand, not the kind of things that are said in honest debate.

And Senator DOMENICI and I, as usual, have been working cooperatively. I just wonder whether the majority leader asked the freshman class over there whether they would stay all night.

We are not surprised by incomes that exceed $1 million, $5 million, $10 million--some of the top corporate executives in this country, some of the athletes, some of the people in entertainment. So if someone earned $10 million in a year and the tax rate was 39.6 percent for income tax, and if there was roughly a 4-percent decline in that, so that person then would have--if they earned $10 million, they would get $400,000 in tax relief?

   Mr. President, I rise in strong support of Senator CONRAD's lockbox amendment, which reserves approximately 45 percent of the non-Social Security budget surplus for Medicare over the next 10 years. 
   Mr. President, we have heard a lot about the Republican lock box here on the floor. But so far, it's been all conversation and no action and no amendment. Nothing was offered in Committee, except for a sense of the Senate that merely endorses current law. And we don't expect to see anything on the floor. 
   What we have before us is a budget that spends nearly every dollar of the projected $1 trillion surplus on tax cuts. And the numbers don't lie.

<TEXT>
   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I want to respond to the amendment which was offered by the Senator from Missouri, who had essentially presented President Clinton's budget recommendations to us. I want to make note of a couple of things. 
   While I support the direction of the President's budget, I am going to oppose this amendment, because I believe it isn't a serious attempt to enact the President's plan. Rather, I see it as a transparent political gimmick that has been reviewed in our committee and voted upon. Democrats, like Republicans, voted against the budget. That does not mean we are against the general theme or the thrust of the President's budget. There are things in the budget that we want to examine specifically. 
   Frankly, I think it is pretty obvious that it is designed to discredit the President's budget. It dismisses the contribution to Medicare that we have established in some of the amendments we tried to offer in the Budget Committee discussions on the budget resolution. 
   What I heard said was that if we are serious about reform, then we ought to get on with it. The fact that we are going to increase the longevity of Medicare from 2008 to 2020, a period of 12 years, is dismissed as casual, trite--``chaff'' was the word that was used--as not being serious. On the other hand, what I heard the Senator say is that he was looking at reform. He thought there was a good program that was proposed there, a proposal that would take higher deductibles, higher co-pays, perhaps reducing some of the hospital availability. 
   That sounded like what the Senator was proposing in terms 
   of his view of what we had to do with Medicare, that his reform was designed to, other than adding financial stability to it, to do these other things. 
   Well, maybe he wants to discuss the Medicare reform this evening, because it looks like, in its present condition, some of the changes in the program would be fairly painful to the Medicare beneficiaries. 
   One of the things I do not think I made clear in my remarks before, when I responded to the challenge to capitalists, one of the things that causes me to want to pay my share, whatever that fair share is, to support the programs that this country offers, like health care through Medicare, like a chance at an education, like a chance at a job, like a chance to bring children up in a safe environment--that is why we have our police program adding 100,000 policemen to the streets of our cities--like adding teachers, like reducing class size, I want to live in that  kind of a country. I want to live in the kind of a country that says people who are in the middle, people who are hard-working, people of modest income, people are not looking at this society and saying: Wow, it is really unfair; those guys, those people at the top, get everything, and we are left with the dregs. 
   Not so. That is why this country, despite its growth, its absorption of different cultures and ethnicities, is able to get on so relatively peacefully. Why? It is because people believe they have a chance at success. That is the way I want to do it. I want to make my contribution. It is made by way of taxes. It is made by way of other things that many of us do, whether it is philanthropic activity or otherwise. 
   I want to do it, because I want to do it for my children. I do not want them to live in a society where everybody is so angry that they want to take it out on my family and other families. We have enough of that violence on our streets and in our communities. I want to get rid of that. 
   You either pay or you hire security guards or you make sure your burglar alarm is on every minute of the day and night. That is the condition we have arrived at. 
   I see a lessening of that. I see a lessening, very frankly, of the racial distrust that exists. It is not perfect by a longshot. That is what I see as America. 
   I am happy to say that if you make $800,000, you pay and you don't get a $20,000 rebate. I want to trust this Government that those of us here have a share of running and say, OK, we will watch you; we will watch the way you spend the money and so forth. But I do not see the kinds of result that others talk about here at times, 
   throwing your money to the Government where they put it down the drain, where they squander it on things, where they just disregard the importance of the resource. I don't see it. 
   What I see is that this is a trick tactic. This presentation of the President's budget is designed to embarrass Democrats, and the majority is proposing an amendment that they intend to oppose. This is an amendment that is being offered that is going to be opposed by the offerer. That should make it clear enough that this is political hijinks and not a serious amendment. 
   We should not spend our time debating every dot and comma in the President's budget, because every one of us can find something to criticize in that budget. Republicans have the luxury of not presenting a budget that goes into the same level of detail as the President's budget. Their budget, the Republican budget, is a rough outline, and that is what we should be debating here--basic principles, broad outlines of the budget. I think it is clear that there is broad Democratic support for the framework in the President's budget. 
   The President wants to reserve 77 percent of projected surpluses to reduce debt, save for Social Security and Medicare, and I think that is the right approach for our future. But the BOND amendment is not asking us to support the general approach of the President's budget. It is asking us to support the entire budget, that presumably means that every single item in that budget is satisfactory. 
   Mr. President, if I can lift it, I want you to take a look at the President's budget. This is the size of the President's budget. It has 1,291 pages, and that is what we are being asked to approve tonight in this gimmicky amendment that we are looking at. 
   I think the public sees through this. Certainly Senators see through it, even some of those who are on the side of the proposers. I ask if any Senator wants to endorse every single number in this volume. I doubt it. 
   I turn to page 105 of the budget. It says that we should provide $400 million for the Dairy Recourse Loan Program. There might be some in here who like that program, but I bet you that the majority are not going to like it, and I am not sure we should be endorsing that specific kind of a figure here today. 
   There are literally thousands of other very specific numbers in this budget, and nobody here is fully familiar with it. Nobody is going to agree to all of these numbers and these conclusions. But that does not mean we are repudiating the general theme of the President's budget, and no one should be confused about that. 
   I am going to ask my Democratic colleagues to join me, and all those who want to make sense out of what we are doing here and want to be serious, to vote against this amendment because it is, again, designed, I think, to be hijinks, tricks, gimmicks. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. No objection. 
   Mr. President, I just say that I commend both the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Maryland for offering this. I think that it is appropriate that we, as we assert our military might into the world arena, try to establish the fact that we obey and want to see the rule of law observed, and yet we do not always pay our bills as we should. I think that is kind of a contrary action to be taking. So I know the chairman is going to agree with me. 
   As I see members of our committee, I say to Senator DOMENICI, I see people who are thoughtful and working hard, regardless of which side of the aisle. We can get argumentative at times, but I am proud to work with the members of the Budget Committee. I am particularly, obviously, impressed with the work that is done by my colleagues on my side, but that does not mean that I am not equally as impressed with what happens with colleagues on the other side. It is just that we disagree on some things. 
   So I wanted to make that statement. 
   Mr. Chairman?

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, if I might say to my colleague, I support the unanimous consent agreement. I want to point out to Senators who are interested in offering amendments that we are here as long as amendments are going to be offered. If there are none offered at the conclusion of the votes, then we are going to be prepared to close shop, as we say. As long as amendments are offered, we are here. If they are not, we are closing up. But there will not be time to drag out tomorrow. We are willing to work all night, if necessary. But we are going to conclude with 10 hours tomorrow, which would then be roughly 35 hours' worth of time spent. 
   With that, I assume, Mr. President, that the unanimous consent request was agreed to.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I think by the description the Senator just offered he tells you what he thinks. He is offering this amendment and saying vote no. What he wants the Democrats to do is to be tricked into moving on this. 
   Here is one part of it--1,291 pages. If anyone wants to vote for this without inspecting it, unless all of you have reviewed it in detail and have decided that whatever you are concerned about is taken care of in here. 
   This is not a sincere amendment being offered. What this is, I think, is political chicanery. I urge my opponents to vote against it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I take time from what would normally be the opposition. I want to take this  opportunity to say to the Senator from Ohio that we think that is pretty clear thinking. Paying down the debt--he is right. I heard his remarks. He recounts what we have heard from the economists, Greenspan included, about the most important way to get our fiscal house in order and that is to pay down the debt. If we keep going like things are projected, we could be through with public debt in about 15 years. 
   We would be, within 15 years, at the debt level in 1917. And no, I don't remember it; I have read about it. 
   But within a couple of years thereafter we could be out of public debt, which would be such a bonus for all of our succeeding generations, including our grandchildren. I congratulate the Senator. Is this his second grandchild? The second. One of mine, my 3-year-old grandchild, was watching television tonight and he said to his mother, ``Papa looks mad.'' And then he said, ``No, I think papa is happy.'' 
   Anyway, we do it for them. I think the amendment of the Senator is a very positive amendment and I hope it will get full support.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, earlier we considered an amendment that asked the Senate to endorse every line in the President's budget. 
   This amendment asks the Senate to endorse only the general principles of that budget and its proposals for using projected budget surpluses. 
   The President's budget calls for no net increase in spending and no net tax cut until we have acted to reform Social Security. It is vital that we make Social Security our top priority so that the program will still be strong when our children and grandchildren are ready to retire. 
   The amendment I have now proposed would address what many describe as the President's other budget, his framework for using projected budget surpluses once we have taken care of Social Security. 
   This amendment lays out the President's overall principles, which are designed to prepare our Nation for the next century. 
   The amendment says that Congress should reserve the entire off-budget surplus for Social Security and, over 15  years, allocate: 77 percent or $3.6 trillion of the total surplus for Social Security and Medicare; and 23 percent of the surplus, or $1 trillion, for investments in key domestic priorities, such as education, the environment, and law enforcement; investments in military readiness, and pro-savings tax cuts for working families. 
   The amendment also says that tax cuts or spending increases should not be enacted before the solvency of Social Security is assured and Medicare solvency is extended 12 years. 
   In addition, the amendment states that the 77 percent or $3.6 trillion of the total surplus for Social Security and Medicare should be used to reduce publicly held debt. That would provide great dividends for our economy. Reducing the future debt burden and future interest costs would essentially provide a tax cut for our children. 
   And, finally, the amendment says that any tax cuts should be targeted to provide tax relief to middle-income working families and should not provide disproportionate tax relief to people with the highest incomes. 
   Mr. President, this framework emphasizes saving for the future. It's fiscally responsible. It would help protect Social Security and Medicare. And it calls for tax relief and investments where they are most needed. 
   The amendment does not endorse every dot and comma of the President's budget. But it would endorse the overall priorities of that proposal. 
   I hope my colleagues will support it.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong support for President Clinton's decision to use United States Armed Forces, together with our NATO allies, to stop the killing in Kosovo and help bring peace and stability to a troubled region of Europe. 
   International intervention to stop the killing and atrocities in Kosovo is long overdue. The United States, as the world's sole remaining superpower, must lead that international effort. 
   Mr. President, I firmly believe NATO must follow through on threats of air strikes unless Milosevic immediately ends his assault on the people of Kosovo and accepts the Contact Group's interim agreement. If we do not, Milosevic will pursue his kind of peace in Kosovo--through ``ethnic cleansing.'' 
   Air strikes are a means to an end. I hope Belgrade will agree to sign the Contact Group's interim peace agreement, as the Albanian side has done, without further revisions. 
   President Clinton has decided and the Pentagon has planned to deploy about four thousand U.S. troops to participate in a NATO-led peacekeeping force to help implement the interim agreement, once it has been signed by both sides. I support this plan because I stand behind its goals. United States armed forces should participate in a peacekeeping force in Kosovo. 
   I support the President's determination that this must be a NATO-led force, with sufficient forces and appropriate rules of engagement to minimize the risk of casualties and maximize prospects for success. 
   U.S. participation is essential to the credibility of NATO's presence in Kosovo. 
   NATO's peacekeeping role is essential to the implementation of a peace agreement for Kosovo. And implementation of a peace agreement is essential to stop the killing--and end the atrocities in Kosovo--and allow people to return to their homes and rebuild their shattered lives. 
   But today we face a more immediate question: whether NATO should launch air strikes to stop the killing and end the atrocities in Kosovo. 
   In my view we must end Milosevic's reign of terror. 
   Some in this body have argued that these atrocities are an internal matter, that we should not get involved. 
   Others have said U.S. national security interests in Kosovo do not rise to a level that warrants military intervention. 
   I strongly disagree with those assertions. 
   Allow me, therefore, to remind my colleagues of the fundamental United States interests which are at stake here: 
   The first is U.S. credibility, going all the way back to the Christmas warning issued by President Bush and reaffirmed by President Clinton. 
   If we fail to act, our threats in other parts of the world will not be taken seriously, and we may find ourselves having to actually use force more often. 
   The second is the credibility, cohesion, and future of NATO. As the 50th anniversary Summit approaches, I believe we need to strengthen the Euro-Atlantic partnership. 
   Particularly when a crisis arises in Europe, we need to be able to act in concert with allies who generally share our interests and values and who have the capability to undertake fully integrated military operations alongside U.S. armed forces. 
   Third, we need to prevent this conflict from spreading. How can we expect Albania to stay out of the conflict as their kin are being slaughtered? What is to prevent citizens of Macedonia from joining up with different sides along ethnic lines? Would Bulgaria, and NATO allies Greece and Turkey, be drawn into a widening conflagration? 
   I don't claim to be able to fully predict what will happen if we do not act, but it seems to me we're better off stopping the conflict now than risking another world war sparked in the Balkans. 
   Finally, I would remind my colleagues that Milosevic and his police and military forces are killing people and driving them from their homes on the basis of their ethnicity--they are committing genocide. We have an obligation and a responsibility to act to stop genocide. 
   How can we stand by and allow these massacres to continue and claim to stand for what is right in this world? 
   The time has come to stop threatening and start making good on our threats. There is too much at stake. 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution condemning anti-Semitic statements by Russian political leaders and commending President Yeltsin and others for raising their voices against such hateful speech. 
   Anti-Semitism in Russia is not a new phenomenon. Throughout Russia's history, Jews have often been singled out for persecution during times of crisis. It happened in the seventeenth century, when a reign of terror was unleashed against Jews in Eastern and Central Europe, and it happened in the pogroms of World War I, when entire Jewish communities were annihilated. In short, when there's trouble in Russia, Jews are usually the first to be blamed. Anti-Semitic comments coming from high-ranking officials in Russia in recent months are particularly worrisome. They come at a time when Russia should be overcoming its troubled past and rejoining the world community by honoring freedom of religion, free speech and other human rights. 
   The anti-Semitic statements made by prominent Russian officials are well known by now: Last November, retired General Albert Makashov blamed the country's economic crisis on ``yids.'' In an open letter, Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist Party chief, voiced his belief of a Zionist conspiracy to seize power in Russia. Another top Communist lawmaker, Viktor Ilyukhin, accused Jews of waging ``genocide'' in the country. 
   Officials in the Russian government have criticized these statements. Yet not so long ago, Russian President Yeltsin went ahead with a summit with his counterpart, Belarus president Alexander Lukashenko, who himself blamed Jewish financiers and political reformers ``for the creation of the criminal economy.'' Alexander Lebed, a top contender for the presidential post in the 2000 elections, has also made negative remarks about several religious groups. 
   We in Congress have asked senior Administration officials to lodge our protests against the anti-Semitic comments made by Russian leaders. During her recent trip to Moscow, Secretary Albright did exactly that and received assurances that anti-Semitism has no place in Russia. The Administration will have another opportunity to voice our concern when Vice President GORE receives Russia's Prime Minister Primakov next week. 
   I will closely be watching events in Russia to ensure the government is in compliance with its international human rights commitments. There has been concern that the country's religion law, passed in 1997, cedes too much authority to local officials. The omnibus appropriations bill for 1999 directs a cutoff of Freedom Support Act aid to Russia unless the President determines and certifies that Moscow hasn't implemented statutes, regulations or executive orders that would discriminate against religious groups. That certification must be made by late April. I hope certification, as well as the International Religious Freedom Act, passed last year, will be strong incentives for Russian leaders to reverse a troubling anti-democratic trend. 
   As you know, in 1989 I authored legislation making it easier for Jews and members of other persecuted religious groups in the former Soviet Union to obtain refugee status in the United States. I introduced this law because I felt deeply that religious freedom was a basic human right, which was anathema under the Soviet system of government. Recent events in Russia convince me my legislation remains very necessary and I will be asking my colleagues to support an extension again this year. 
   During a trip to Poland last year, President Kwasniewski and Prime Minister Buzek reached out to the Jewish community to help bridge the gap between Poles and Jews. This is a difficult and long-term process, but at least leaders across the political spectrum are making a real effort to heal wounds and create a more welcome climate for Jews in Poland. I welcome President Yeltsin's rejections of anti-Semitism and I hope more members of the Duma will speak out in this manner. 
   I want also to pay tribute to Parliamentarian Galina Starovoitova, a steadfast supporter of human rights and democracy, who was shot dead last November in the entry way of her St. Petersburg apartment building. Ms. Starovoitova, a non-Jew, was a leading voice in condemning anti-Semitism in Russian society. Her courage will be sorely missed. 
   Congress understands Russia cannot be a great democracy until it makes progress in human rights, and doesn't revert to past practices. Russia's leaders must come to the same conclusion. We must all work together to reach a common goal--helping Russia integrate into the international community. 
   Mr. President, I urge all my colleagues to support this timely resolution.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in support of this resolution, of which I am an original cosponsor, opposing Palestinian statehood as a unilateral declaration. We need to send an unequivocal signal of the Senate's opposition to any unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood. 
   I know the players here very well. I knew Israeli Prime Minister Rabin. I considered him a close friend. I had a lot of contact with him over a period of more than 20 years. I got to know Chairman Arafat when he came to Washington, and I have seen him in Jericho. I have seen him here several times; I have seen him in New York. When they got together, shook hands, and signed the Declaration of Principles that was negotiated in Oslo, it was a tremendous historical moment. 
   The Oslo accords set in motion a process to end violence and bring peace to this troubled region. Despite obstacles and delays, Israel and the Palestinians have come a long way down the road to a better future. Last year, with the peace process stalled, President Clinton brought together Prime Minister Netanyahu and Chairman Arafat for intensive discussion on a plan that would achieve further progress in implementing the Oslo accord. With the help of a good friend to the United States, to Israel, and to the Palestinians--King Hussein of Jordan--President Clinton convinced the parties to sign the Wye River agreement. 
   Both Israel and the Palestinians implemented their commitments in the first phase of the Wye memorandum. Unfortunately, the process remains stalled there, though important cooperation between Israeli and Palestinian representatives continues. 
   President Clinton has rightly urged the parties to respect and implement the Wye memorandum, despite the pending election in Israel. Prospects for further implementation are good, in my view, even if this is not happening right now. 
   The point is that, on the whole, the Oslo framework is still intact. Final status negotiations to resolve the most challenging issues should begin within a matter of months. In that context, the resolution we are considering today makes a vital point. The Palestinians must not jeopardize the peace process by unilaterally declaring statehood, as Chairman Arafat and other Palestinian leaders have suggested. By adopting this resolution, we send an unequivocal message that, certainly as far as the Congress is concerned, the United States would not recognize a unilateral statehood declaration and would instead condemn it as a violation of the Oslo accords. 
   Mr. President, this resolution represents our strong commitment to a negotiated peace in the Middle East. I, on a personal basis, look forward to the fact that one day they will put aside violence there and they will get along. It is a necessity; this is not a matter of choice. I welcome the overwhelming support that is indicated for this message on the part of my colleagues, that no unilateral declaration of statehood will receive the support or the encouragement of the United States. 
   With that, I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Gun Industry Accountability Act of 1999 along with my colleagues, Senators DURBIN, SCHUMER, and REED of Rhode Island. This legislation is aimed at one purpose: to force the gun industry to market and manufacture their products in a safer and more responsible manner. 
   Mr. President, on Thursday, March 4th I was joined at the announcement of this bill by Mayor Bill Campbell of Atlanta and Mayor Alex Penelas of Miami-Dade County. They represent two of the now five jurisdictions that have filed claims against the gun industry on behalf of the taxpayers of their communities. They seek reimbursement for the massive costs of gun violence within their borders and ultimately, major changes in the way the gun industry sells its lethal products. 
   Mr. President, the gun industry has long placed profits above the safety of society. The industry ignores numerous, patented safety devices for guns--even things as simple as an indicator of whether a gun is loaded. The distributors of firearms also intentionally flood certain markets with guns, knowing that the excess weapons will make their way into a nearby illegal market. 
   The lawsuits by these courageous mayors will likely prove to be the most effective mechanism to get the Industry to alter their deadly practices. The reason is simple: it will bring the gun merchants into line by striking where they are most sensitive--the bottom line. 
   To aid this effort, the Gun Industry Accountability Act will strengthen the hand of the cities in court against the formidable firepower of the gun industry and its team of high-priced lawyers. It will help these mayors in their quest to get the industry to lay down its weapons, come to the table and finally agree to behave as responsible corporate citizens. 
   Mr. President, under current law, these cities filing claims against the gun industry are only able to recover the costs that their city or county has paid out due to gun violence. The Gun Industry Accountability Act will strengthen the mayors' hands by allowing them to recover both the city's costs for gun victims in their area as well as the Federal costs associated with these same victims. If a city eventually recovers Federal costs, either through a court judgment or settlement, then the city will be permitted to keep two thirds of the recovery and return the remaining one third to the Federal Government. 
   By increasing the likely reward for bringing a lawsuit against firearms manufacturers, this legislation will serve as an incentive for more cities, counties and States to join the fight to hold the gun industry accountable. When our legislation passes, it will force the industry to stare down the double barrel of local and federal liability in these suits. 
   Mr. President, the potential federal liability is substantial. The National Center for Injury Prevention and Control tells us that 80 percent of the economic costs of treating firearms injuries are paid for by taxpayers. 
   Federal taxpayers pick up the tab for disability payments through SSI, Veterans Administration, Unemployment, Medicare and other costs of treating victims of gun violence. 
   Mr. President, despite these enormous costs, the gun industry and its friends in the National Rifle Association will go to any length to avoid accountability. The NRA and its corporate members are seeking state and federal legislation to take away the rights of mayors to safeguard their citizens against unsafe products and irresponsible marketing practices. 
   Unfortunately, the NRA's drive against the legal rights of local communities has already succeeded in at least one state. In Georgia, the state legislature has already passed a bill at the NRA's request to retroactively block the City of Atlanta's suit. Mayor Campbell has already asked the court system to throw out the legislature's unconstitutional action. 
   The NRA's extremism has reached new heights in Florida. In that state legislature, a bill has been introduced that would not only block Miami-Dade's lawsuit, but also declare Mayor Penelas a felon! In the NRA's world, a public official should be imprisoned for acting to protect the safety of his or her constituents. 
   Mr. President, here in Congress there is already talk of Federal legislation to block cities, counties and States from asserting their rights in court. If such a bill is introduced it will prove that the era of Big Government is certainly not over. 
   Mr. President, I pledge that I will do all I can to make sure that bill will never pass the Senate. Senators DURBIN, SCHUMER, REED and I will work tirelessly against such an unconscionable proposal. 
   Congress should be helping these local communities make their streets safer--not block them from accomplishing that goal. 
   To that end, I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring the Gun Industry Accountability Act.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution designating July 2, 1999, and July 2, 2000, as National Literacy Day. 
   Mr. President, the United States has one of the most sophisticated education systems in the world. We have more students enrolling in school than ever before, and more people attending college than ever before. But there is a significant part of the population that has been left behind--the ever growing population of people who can't read. 
   Mr. President, approximately 44 million adult Americans are functionally illiterate. That means somewhere between 21 to 23% percent of the adult population read below the fifth grade level and are unable to perform basic functions you and I do every day. People reading at that level usually cannot locate an intersection on a street map or fill out a social security application form. Older people who can't read may  not be able to understand the instructions on a vial of prescription drugs, causing a potentially life-threatening situation. 
   Mr. President, it is not surprising that the inability to perform basic functions results in the inability of the illiterate population to fully participate in society. In fact, nearly half, or 43 percent, of the illiterate population lives in poverty. Other social problems associated with poverty are prevalent in the illiterate community, like the proclivity to commit crime, the need of welfare assistance, and the inability to get a job. 
   A majority of the prison population in this country is illiterate. A majority of people who receive food stamps is illiterate. People who are illiterate work less than half the amount of time in a an average year than a fully literate person, and they earn approximately a third of the income. That is, Mr. President, if they hold jobs at all. 
   Mr. President, the Federal government, as well as state and local municipalities, have shown a steadfast dedication to eradicating illiteracy through financial assistance. In 1998 alone, the major adult education and literacy programs were funded at $360 million. And millions more are spent on the state and local level, spent either by municipal government or donated by private sources. 
   Mr. President, my resolution designating July 2 as National Literacy Day is a nice complement to all the resources we spend on adult education and the effort to boost literacy rates. The more we do to identify illiteracy as a problem and the more we publicize what resources are available to citizens who want to learn how to read, the closer we are to winning the war against illiteracy. 
   Mr. President, for these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize March 8th as the annual celebration of International Women's Day in the State of New Jersey. 
   International Women's Day began in 1911, when over one million people from around the world gathered to honor women in the workplace and enhance women's rights universally. The many citizens from Austria, Denmark, Germany, Sweden and the United States attended rallies in their home countries and called for women to have the right to vote, the right to hold public office, for vocational training and to end discrimination against women in the workplace.  
   Mr. President, women's rights have come a long way since then. But we still have farther to go. 
   Mr. President, the purpose now of International Women's Day is to promote many causes important to women and girls, such as education, leadership development and ongoing human rights struggles. Supporters of this day would like to see economic justice for women, freedom from glass ceilings, violent workplace environments and sexual harassment, and the elimination of child labor in sweatshops. 
   In addition, Mr. President, a concurrent celebration of International Women's Day has blossomed in New Jersey. New Jersey, in fact, is the only state where International Women's Day is celebrated state-wide in classrooms and community centers everywhere. 
   In 1992, New Jersey's celebration was founded in Metuchen with the help of organizations like Women Helping Women, Citizens for Quality Education and the Metuchen Public Schools. Since then, the New Jersey state legislature, the White House and the United Nations have all recognized this celebration as important in the evolution of women's rights. The Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) of the U.S.A., one of the oldest and largest women's organizations in the world, has also become a vital sponsor of International Women's Day. 
   Mr. President, this year's celebration is entitled, ``Women Working for Health: Body, Mind, Spirit,'' focusing on women in the workplace. In classrooms across New Jersey, women from all walks of life, including veterinarians, pilots, judges, community leaders, and medical researchers, have been invited to discuss their personal and professional experiences with students at levels ranging from kindergarten to adult education programs. These priceless exchanges will provide young girls and women with mentors, role models and friends. 
   Mr. President, I am happy to join in the celebration of International Women's Day in New Jersey, and all that it does to foster the promotion of equal rights for women. I hope my colleagues will do the same.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure, and Health (BEACH) Act of 1999, legislation which would amend the Clean Water Act to require states to adopt water quality standards for coastal recreation waters and to notify the public of unhealthy conditions. I am pleased to be joined by Senator TORRICELLI, Senator BOXER, and Senator LIEBERMAN in sponsoring this legislation. 
   Mr. President, coastal tourism generates billions of dollars every year for local communities and beaches are the top vacation destination in the nation. A recent survey found that tourists spend over $100 billion in coastal portions of the twelve states that were studied. Travel and tourism to the beaches of the Jersey shore alone generates over $7 billion annually to local economies. 
   Unfortunately, the increased use of the coastal waters at our public beaches and coastal parks for swimming, wading, and surfing can cause increased risk to public health if these recreational waters are not properly managed. Water pollution and water-borne bacteria and viruses from overflowing sewage systems can cause a wide range of diseases, including gastroenteritis, dysentery, hepatitis, ear, nose, and throat problems, E. coli bacterial infections, and respiratory illness. Upon contracting one of these water-borne diseases, the affected individual often remains contagious even when out of the water and may pass the illness to others. The consequences of these swimming-associated illnesses can be especially severe for children, elderly people, and the infirm. In Maryland, the outbreak of the toxic Pfiesteria organism in several Chesapeake Bay tributaries prompted the state to close several rivers for public health reasons. Fishermen and swimmers who were exposed to Pfiesteria complained of short-term memory loss, dizziness, muscular aches, peripheral tingling, vomiting, and abdominal pain. 
   In a 1998 report on beach water quality, entitled Testing the Waters, the Natural Resources Defense Council reported over 5,199 closings or advisories of varying durations at U.S. beaches due to detected or anticipated unhealthy water quality in 1997. Many beaches closures and health advisories were a result of sewage spills and overflows. 
   The number of beach closings and advisories, while large, may represent only a small portion of the actual problem. This is because of an inconsistent approach among the states toward monitoring the water quality of public beaches and notifying the public of unhealthy conditions. In fact, as of 1999, only nine states have comprehensive monitoring programs and adequate public notification. Thirteen states have regular monitoring and public notification programs for a portion of their recreational beaches. Among the remaining coastal and Great Lakes  states, some lack any regular monitoring of beach water quality, while others have monitoring programs, but no programs to close beaches or notify the public. As a result, a high bacteria level can cause a beach closure in one state while, in another state, people may be allowed to swim in the water, despite the health risks. 
   Due in part to my urging, in 1997, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) established its Beaches Environmental Assessment, Closure and Health (BEACH) program to recommend appropriate monitoring criteria and public notification of beach water quality. While this program is a good start, the reality is that the majority of states have not adopted EPA-recommended criteria to protect swimmer's health, and the agency does not possess the authority to require states to adopt their recommended criteria. 
   Mr. President, my legislation would provide EPA the authority to require states to develop beach water quality monitoring and public notification programs that adequately and uniformly protect public health. The BEACH Act would require EPA to conduct studies for use in developing a more complete list of potential health risks associated with unhealthy beach water quality, develop more effective testing methods for detecting the presence of pathogens in coastal recreation waters, and revise its water quality criteria for pathogens in such waters. The legislation would also direct EPA to establish regulations requiring monitoring of water quality at public beaches to determine compliance with water quality and public safety criteria. The bill would require states to notify local governments and the public of current beach water quality. Where a state wishes to delegate its testing, monitoring, and notification requirements to local governments, EPA must issue delegation guidance to a state and the state must make resources available to the local government. Lastly, the BEACH Act would authorize $9 million dollars in grants to the States for the purposes of carrying out the requirements of this Act. 
   Mr. President, a day at the beach shouldn't be followed by a day at the doctor. I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation to ensure safe and healthy beaches for the citizens of New Jersey and the nation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce ``E-21''--the Education for the 21st Century Act. 
   The E-21 Act will help ensure that all middle school graduates attain basic computer literacy skills that will prepare them for high school and beyond, and ultimately, for the 21st Century workplace. The E-21 Act will also allow all school districts to obtain and utilize the latest high-quality educational software, free of charge. 
   Mr. President, the first piece of legislation I introduced in the Senate was to provide financial assistance to introduce computers into schools, to help students learn and expand their horizons. That was in 1983. Back then, it was the exceptional school that even had a computer. It was an unusual teacher or student who knew how to use one. 
   That legislation was enacted into law. Along with other resources, it helped bring computers into our schools as part of everyday learning. 
   Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I got my start in the computing business. Back then, computers filled large rooms and were so expensive that only the largest corporations could afford their own computing centers. Today, even more powerful computers sit on a desktop in millions of homes, schools and businesses across the nation. 
   Mr. President, we've made great strides toward introducing computers into schools, but too many of these computers are not being utilized to their potential due to lack of updated computer training for teachers. 
   Mr. President, a recent study by the Educational Testing Service confirmed that computers do increase student achievement and improve a school's learning climate. However--and this is critical--the study specified that to achieve those results, teachers must be appropriately trained and use effective educational software programs. Otherwise, these computers become mere furniture in a classroom. 
   To boost student achievement through computers and technology, my ``Education for the 21st Century Act'' will provide up to $30 million per year to train a team of teachers from every middle school in the nation in the most up-to-date computing technology. These Teacher Technology leaders could then share their training with the rest of the faculty in their schools, so all teachers are ready to pass these skills on to their students. 
   Mr. President, the E-21 Act will also create national educational software competitions, open to high school and college students, to work in partnership with university faculty and professional software developers. The best of these software packages would be available free-of-charge over the Internet through the Department of Education's web page. 
   Mr. President, I want to make clear to my colleagues that this emphasis on computer training is not at the expense of the fundamental, basic skills that underlie education: reading, writing and arithmetic. It's still important to master these traditional basics. But we should also add a ``new basic'' to the list--computer literacy. Americans will need those skills to compete in the 21st Century. 
   Mr. President, this proposal is part of President Clinton's FY 2000 Budget, and as Ranking Member of the Budget Committee and a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will work to see that it is funded for years to come. 
   Mr. President, as a businessman who got his start at the beginning of the computing age, I am proud to see the way our nation has led the world in computer technology. I want to make sure that we continue to lead--through the second computer century--the 21st Century. 
   I therefore ask my colleagues to support ``E-21''--the Education for the 21st Century Act.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I strongly support the goals of this legislation, to improve recruitment and retention rates. Those rates have sagged in the last year to 18 months, and we need to do something about that. After all, our nation's security depends on ensuring that the military is able to recruit and retain high quality personnel. 
   President Clinton agrees with that. He's proposing to increase the defense budget by $112 billion over 6 years, and he's allocated $35 billion to meet the challenges of recruitment and retirement. The President's budget provides an across-the-board pay raise of 4.4 percent, reforms the pay table to reward personnel for high performance, and modifies the current retirement system. 
   President Clinton is proposing these initiatives within a comprehensive and balanced plan that enhances troop readiness and increases the pace of our force's modernization. He also does it as part of a budget that reserves the surplus to shore up Social Security and Medicare, pays down the debt, and provides tax relief to average Americans.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation which will close the loophole in our gun laws which allows criminals to buy and sell firearms at gun shows. 
   Last year, there were more than 4,400 gun shows across America. While most of the citizens who participate in these gun shows are law-abiding, there is mounting evidence that criminals are using these events for more sinister purposes. 
   The problem is that current law allows unlicensed dealers to sell countless firearms without any background checks on the buyer or documentation of the sales. Criminals are aware of this loophole and exploit it. A study by the Illinois State Police showed at least 25 percent of illegally trafficked weapons came from gun shows. Militia members including Timothy McVeigh and Michael Fortier used gun shows to easily sell previously stolen guns and obtain a ready supply of firearms in undocumented transactions. 
   Additionally, the gun show loophole is unfair to law-abiding Federal Firearms Licensees. When they participate in a gun show, they must comply with all background checks and record-keeping, while an unlicensed dealer at the next table can make unlimited sales to any person without the same requirements. The ease of these sales drains significant business from law-abiding gun store owners and other licensees, and penalizes them for following the law. Recognizing this problem, the National Alliance of Stocking Gun Dealers recently endorsed tighter regulations of gun shows: ``[W]e want to make it clear that persons attending Gun Shows to skirt laws and acquire guns for criminal use are unwelcome patrons of these events and diminish their purpose and quality.'' 
   During the 105th Congress, I introduced the Gun Show Sunshine Act in an effort to address this issue. Subsequently, President Clinton directed the Attorney General to study gun show  firearm transactions and make recommendations to crack down on illegal sales. 
   The Administration's recently released report confirmed what other law enforcement officials have been saying: gun shows are becoming illegal arms bazaars, where criminals buy and sell deadly weapons with impunity. The report looked at 314 recent Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) investigations involving 54,000 firearms linked to gun shows. Nearly half of the investigations involved felons buying or selling firearms, and in more than one-third of the cases, the firearms in question were known to have been used in subsequent crimes. 
   Today, I am introducing legislation that proposes a simple approach to the gun show loophole--no background check, no gun, no exceptions. This measure incorporates the recommendations made by the Department of Justice and the Treasury Department and I appreciate the Administration's support. 
   This bill would take several steps designed to make it harder for criminals to buy and sell weapons at gun shows. It would require gun show promoters to register and notify ATF of all gun shows, maintain and report a list of vendors at the show, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge receipt of information about their legal obligations. Also, it would require that any firearms sales go through a Federal Firearms Licensee (FFL). The idea is that if an unlicensed person was selling a weapon, they would use a FFL at the gun show to complete the transaction. The FFL would be responsible for conducting a Brady check on the purchaser and maintaining records of the transactions. The FFL could charge a fee for the service. 
   In order to make it easier for law enforcement to bring criminals to justice, the bill would also require FFLs to submit information necessary to trace all firearms transferred at gun shows to ATF's National Tracing Center, including the manufacturer/improper, model, and serial number of the firearms. 
   These reasonable requirements will make our streets safer by making it harder for criminals to get guns. At the same time, these regulations will not unduly burden those law-abiding Americans who enjoy gun shows. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with me in this effort to close the gun show loophole. We must do more to prevent the easy access to firearms which fuels the gun violence across the country.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the work of an extraordinary woman from the state of New Jersey, Sister Jane Frances Brady. 
   Sister Jane, as she is widely known, has been a tireless advocate on behalf of the poor and uninsured. She has done this most visibly through her 26-year tenure as both president and chief executive officer of St. Joseph's Hospital and Medical Center in Paterson, New Jersey. 
   Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, Paterson is my home town and I am privileged to be able to call Sister Jane a good and longtime friend. Sister Jane has just recently stepped down from her position as president, and will leave her post as CEO of St. Joseph's by the summer. I know that she will be sorely missed there. 
   But Sister Jane is not leaving health care altogether. She will be the new executive vice president of Via Caritas Health System in Parsippany. 
   The combination of Sister Jane's tough administrative style and endless compassion has enhanced St. Joseph's facilities and reputation immensely. During her time there, the hospital has excelled in providing care for people living with HIV, newborns, bone marrow transplant candidates, patients needing open-heart surgery and trauma victims. 
   Mr. President, one of the most important things that Sister Jane has done through her work at St. Joseph's is to care for poor children. A huge part of fighting that battle is waging a campaign to provide health insurance coverage for those children. I would like to share with my colleagues a recent editorial in the Bergen Record about Sister Jane, and her fearless courage to fight for the right of the urban poor population to have access to adequate health care. 
   Mr. President, I congratulate Sister Jane on all her hard work at St. Joseph's, and wish her well in her new position at Via Caritas.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to friend and former colleague in Congress, Bernard Dwyer. Barney, as he was affectionately known, was a devoted public servant and respected New Jerseyan, having served 12 years in the House of Representatives. 
   Mr. President, you might not know how devoted he actually was, since he never delivered a speech on the floor of the House. But Barney was proud of that record. 
   He worked proudly, and tirelessly, behind the scenes in Congress as a member of the House Appropriations Committee to fund myriad projects for New Jersey and for the country. Only some of the examples of his hard work was his support of AMTRAK and New Jersey's transportation funding needs, his backing of an alcohol abuse program at Rutgers University, and his assistance in helping the Red Cross receive grants for AIDS education programs. Whether he was improving sidewalks, street lamps, public schools or community park paths, Barney approached his work with the same diligence and passion. 
   Mr. President, Barney began his career over forty years ago, serving as councilman and mayor in Edison, New Jersey. He then served as a state senator of New Jersey for six years, acting as both senate majority leader and as chairman of the Legislature's joint appropriations committee. 
   Before going into politics, Barney also served in World War II. He was the believed to be the only member of Congress to have survived the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. 
   Mr. President, Barney Dwyer stood out in New Jersey's political community as warm, compassionate, modest, even humble. He was an honorable statesman and a man of the highest integrity. And he will be sorely missed. 
   I would like to send my sincerest condolences to Barney's family.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Chief Justice, the Senate must now fulfill a weighty and solemn duty. For only the second time in the more than two hundred years since our founding fathers established the Constitution, we must vote on Articles of Impeachment against a President. 
   When considering this issue, which goes to our core constitutional responsibilities as Senators, each of us must come to a conclusion based on his or her conscience. Guided by the Constitution, we must bring all of our moral beliefs, our education, our careers, and our experiences as public servants to the question. And we must try to reach a decision that will serve the best interests of the nation for generations to come. 
   As I reflect on the impeachment proceedings, I think first of the range of emotions I have felt. From the moment I realized that the President had engaged in this shameful relationship, I have struggled with my thoughts. 
   I was angry, of course. I was ashamed for the President, a talented man--someone I consider a friend. How could he risk so much with his disgraceful behavior? 
   And I was saddened. I do not know how the President will reconcile himself to his family. I could imagine the embarrassment and the humiliation of the First Lady and his daughter Chelsea. I pitied them as they felt the searing glow of the public spotlight. 
   I am sure that colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, have empathized with similar emotions. 
   But now we must put those feelings aside. We have a very specific charge under the Constitution. That hallowed document delineates our duty. Under Article II, Section 4, we must determine whether the President has committed ``high Crimes or Misdemeanors'' requiring his removal from office. 
   In my view, our founding fathers meant to set a very high standard for impeachment. Clearly, the phrase ``high Crimes or Misdemeanors'' does not include all crimes. But what are the crimes that meet that standard? I find the words of George Mason to be compelling. He understood the phrase to mean ``great and dangerous offenses'' or ``attempts to subvert the Constitution.'' 
   When applying this standard, we must also consider the national interest. The founding fathers vested the impeachment power in the Senate, and not the judiciary, precisely because this body would be accountable to the people. 
   In the words of Alexander Hamilton, only the Senate would ``possess the degree of credit and authority'' required to act on the weighty issue of whether to remove a federal official. In my view, this means that we must look not just at the facts and the law, but we must also try to determine what is in the best interests of the nation. 
   But we should not read the polls, or some other temporary gauge of the public temperament. Instead, we must look back through history, and toward the future, to reach a decision that will reflect well on the Senate and the nation for generations to come. 
   In my view, this case does not involve efforts to subvert the Constitution, and the national interest will not be served by removing the President from office. 
   Before turning to the evidence, I want to express my concern with the way in which the Articles of Impeachment are written. 
   They do not specify which statements and actions by the President are unlawful. Instead, they make general allegations. With this approach, we cannot fulfill our duty to the American people. The American people must know specifically what Presidential conduct justifies overturning an election. 
   While the Articles could have been more clearly written, there is a more fundamental problem. There is simply insufficient evidence for a vote to convict. Whether you apply the standard of beyond a reasonable doubt, or even the lower standard of clear and convincing evidence, the House Managers have not proved their case. 
   With regard to Article I, the evidence does not support a charge of perjury. The President may have been uncooperative and evasive. He certainly was misleading. But he never committed perjury as that term is defined in the law. Consequently, the President should be acquitted on Article I. 
   There is also insufficient evidence to convict the President on Article II, which charges him with obstruction of justice. The main problem with this Article is that testimony from the principal witnesses do not support the allegations. Monica Lewinsky, Betty Currie, and Vernon Jordan testified that the President did not tamper with witnesses, conceal evidence, or take any other actions that would constitute obstruction of justice. All of the witnesses support the President's version of events. 
   I realize that some of you may view the evidence differently. But I think we must still consider whether this is an appropriate case for the Senate to use the awesome power of impeachment to overturn a national election. 
   I further ask you to consider the precedent we would set with a conviction of this President. We risk making the impeachment power another political weapon to be wielded in partisan battles. 
   Our founding fathers warned against this. In the Federalist Papers, Number 65, Alexander Hamilton noted that the prosecution of impeachable offenses would ``connect itself with the pre-existing factions.'' And that this would create ``the greatest danger, that the decision will be regulated more by the comparitive strength of parties than by the real demonstrations of innocence or guilt.'' 
   Prior to the present case, the House of Representatives had seriously considered Articles of Impeachment against only two Presidents--Andrew Johnson and Richard Nixon. In the more than two hundred years since the Constitution was established, the House set the impeachment machinery in motion in only two occasions. 
   Today, no one doubts that the serious abuses of our constitutional system by the Nixon Administration warranted impeachment proceedings. And the bipartisan approach of Congress solidified President Nixon's decision to resign. 
   But history has not been kind to those who pushed the impeachment of  President Johnson upon the nation. Scholars agree that the charges were baseless--a purely partisan campaign. Indeed, Chief Justice Rehnquist, who has presided so effectively in this case, wrote in his book on impeachment that if the Senate had convicted President Johnson ``a long shadow would have been cast over the independence'' of the presidency. 
   So for most of our history, the fears of our founding fathers have not been realized. Congress has not resorted to impeachment even when previous administrations faced far-ranging scandals--the Whiskey Ring scandal during the tenure of President Grant; the Teapot Dome scandal in the Harding administration. 
   And more recently allegations that Presidents Reagan and Bush were not truthful regarding the Iran-Contra scandal. 
   Historically, Congress has held its hand when circumstances might have warranted a pull of the impeachment lever. But contrast that history with the circumstances surrounding this case. 
   President Clinton was a defendant in a civil lawsuit. In determining whether that lawsuit should be allowed to go forward while the President was in office, the Supreme Court of the United States noted that the case involved ``unofficial conduct.'' That case was eventually dismissed, and the plaintiff reached a settlement with the President. 
   But with that lawsuit in place, the plaintiff's attorneys had license to probe into the President's personal life. The private lives of many people were paraded through the press. 
   And then the Independent Counsel joined the hunt. Although he was originally appointed to investigate a real estate transaction in Arkansas, and even though he eventually cleared the President of any wrongdoing in that matter and other reckless accusations, the Independent Counsel turned his attention to a private affair. 
   I think this background cautions against the use of the awesome and irrevocable power of impeachment. Think for a minute about how future partisans might proceed. We have a readily accessible legal system. Anyone with the filing fee can bring a lawsuit. And our laws provide great leeway in the discovery process. 
   If we take the wrong path now, we can expect to see future Presidents hauled into court. They will be questioned repeatedly, and it will not be hard for skilled attorneys to hurl charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. We cannot allow the Presidency to be weakened in this way. 
   Once again, we find the wisdom of our founding fathers providing guidance. 
   James Wilson, who participated in the Philadelphia Convention at which the Constitution was drafted, observed that the President is ``amenable to [the law] in his private character as a citizen, and in his public character by impeachment.'' 
   In other words, the legal system, our civil and criminal laws provide the proper venue for a President who has failed in his private character. 
   And in this case, the legal system can and will continue to address the President's personal transgressions. 
   The Paula Jones lawsuit has been settled. When he leaves office, the President could be subject to further prosecution. But there is simply no injury to our constitutional system, no aspect of what James Wilson called the President's public character, which must be remedied through a Senate conviction under the impeachment power. Of course, I understand the great pain inflicted by the President's private character. As I said earlier, his behavior was reprehensible. He has shamed himself, his family, and the nation. 
   And I understand the desire to punish the President for his conduct. But we must remember the many ways in which the President has already been punished. He has suffered enormous embarrassment and humiliation. Beyond that personal pain, he has also been subject to public condemnation. Every Member of Congress is on the record rebuking his behavior. 
   Of course, this may not satisfy some. They may want more punishment. But please remember--the purpose of the impeachment power is not to punish. Instead, impeachment serves to protect the nation from corrupt officials. 
   So, to render a proper verdict, we must put aside the powerful desire to punish. And I submit that to impeach the President in this case would be a terrible use of the impeachment power, lacking proportionality and perspective. 
   Now, we must step back from the partisan precipice. We must not weaken the Presidency for future generations. We must reject these Articles of Impeachment and help restore the balance of power between the branches of the government. 
   Let us put this matter behind, heal the wounds inflicted by partisanship, and rededicate ourselves to the challenges facing our nation.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will reduce the murder and mayhem on our streets by making it harder for criminals to run guns between states. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by Senators TORRICELLI, SCHUMER, FEINSTEIN, ROBB, SARBANES, KENNEDY, KERRY, and MIKULSKI. 
   Gun traffickers continue to supply an illegal gun market by buying large quantities of guns in states with lax gun laws and then reselling them on the streets--often in cities and states with strict gun laws. If these traffickers cannot legally buy a gun themselves, or if they do not want to have their name turn up if the gun is later found at a crime scene, they find others to make the purchases for them. The trafficker pays a straw purchaser, in money or drugs, to buy 25, 50 or more handguns at a time. The trafficker then resells the guns to those who otherwise could not buy them--such as convicted felons, drug addicts, or children. 
   The Stop Gun Trafficking Act would prohibit any person from purchasing, and any licensed dealer from selling to an individual, more than one handgun a month. This sensible limit on handgun purchases should substantially reduce gun running, while not creating an unreasonable obstacle to legitimate sportsmen and collectors. Under the law, individuals would still be able to purchase up to twelve handguns per year and hundreds of weapons during a lifetime. It is hard to imagine why anyone would need more handguns. 
   Last year, I introduced similar legislation. In order to make my colleagues more aware of the deadly problem of gun trafficking, I sponsored a forum on the issue. The testimony I heard at the forum has made me even more determined to pass this legislation and make it more difficult for gun traffickers to obtain and sell their deadly merchandise on our streets. 
   The witnesses at the forum included: Philadelphia Mayor Ed Rendell, who is also the chair of the Conference of Mayor's Task Force on Gun Violence; James and Sarah Brady; Captain R. Lewis Vass of the Virginia State Police, and Captain Thomas Bowers of the Maryland State Police. 
   We also heard from a panel of youth from right here in our nation's capital who live with gun violence every day in their communities. And what they had to say was terrifying. Guns were an everyday part of their lives. For these kids, D.C. does not stand for District of Columbia. It stands for Dodge City. 
   These young people told us that guns are easy to get in their neighborhoods and schools. They call it getting strapped. And if you do not get strapped you might not make it through the day, they said. 
   One young woman put it eloquently: ``It's not fair,'' she said. ``Other kids get to go to college. We get to go to funerals. These people who sell guns are the real predators. They feed off our pain.'' 
   We must shut these predators down. 
   And we can shut these predators down by passing this legislation. We know this approach works because three states--Virginia, Maryland, South Carolina--have passed one-gun-a month laws and the results have been dramatic. Gun-trafficking from these states has plunged. 
   At the forum, officers from the Virginia State Police testified that after Virginia passed its one-handgun-a-month limit in 1993, the number of crime guns traced back to Virginia from the Northeast dropped by nearly 40 percent. Prior to one-gun-a-month, Virginia had been among the leading suppliers of weapons to the so-called ``Iron Pipeline'' that feed the arms race on the streets of Northeastern cities. Furthermore, in 1995, the Virginia Crime Commission conducted a comprehensive study of the one-handgun-a-month limit to determine if the law had achieved its purpose. That study found, and I quote, ``Virginia's one-gun-a-month statute . . . has had its intended effect of reducing Virginia's status as a source state for gun trafficking.'' 
   Maryland and South Carolina witnessed similar results. In South Carolina, according to the same Crime Commission report: ``Prior to the passage of the one-gun-a-month law, South Carolina was a leading source state for guns traced to New York City, accounting for 39% of guns recovered in criminal investigations. Following the implementation of the law, South Carolina virtually dropped off of the statistical list of source states for firearms trafficked to the northeast.'' 
   Maryland--the most recent state to pass a limit on handgun purchases-- passed its law in 1996 and has already seen the benefits. According to testimony from the Maryland State Police: ``In 1991 Maryland was nationally ranked second in terms of suppliers of crime guns to the City of New York. By 1997, one year after the passage of Maryland's one gun a month law, Maryland moved out of the top ten suppliers of crime guns to New York City.'' 
   So limits on gun sales are working in some regions. But we need a national law to prevent criminals from simply moving their operations from state-to-state. 
   Poll after poll shows that Americans, including gun-owning Americans, want tougher controls on guns. A 1996 University of Chicago study found that 80 percent of those polled support legislation limiting handgun sales to one a month. 
   I urge my colleagues to listen to the American people: stop turning a blind eye to the daily destruction caused by guns in America. I urge my colleagues to have the will to do something to help the youth of America live without the sound of gunshots in their lives. I ask my colleagues to support this common sense approach to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to update my colleagues on the status of the Public School Modernization Act, which I introduced on January 19 as S. 223. The bill already has 15 cosponsors and I expect the list to continue to grow. 
   Mr. President, I was very pleased to see that the President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2000 will call for $25 billion in nationwide bond authority through the Public School Modernization Act. This is a higher total than first contemplated in my bill, S. 223, but I want to make it clear to my colleagues that my cosponsors and I will gladly update the numbers when my bill reaches the Senate floor as an amendment or a stand alone measure. 
   The President's FY 2000 Budget illustrates why the Public School Modernization Act is a great return on our Federal investment. The five year cost of this program will be $3.7 billion, but it will create nearly $25 billion in new bond authority for school districts all over the country. Of this authority, $22.4 billion will be through the School Modernization Bond Program and $2.4 billion will come through the Qualified Zone Academy Bond Program. In addition, $400 million of bond authority will go to Native American tribes or tribal organizations for BIA funded schools. 
   Mr. President, I urge the Senate to support this effort to invest in our children's future. I ask all of my collegues to join me in cosponsoring S. 223, the Public School Modernization Act of 1999.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on Monday morning just past, President Clinton submitted his annual budget to the Congress, but unlike prior submissions, this budget is much more than a plan for a single fiscal year; this is a long-term blueprint for the 21st century. It prepares for the impending retirement of the baby boomers. It ensures that younger Americans will enjoy the security of Social Security and Medicare. And it provides a $500 billion tax cut to promote savings by ordinary Americans. 
   Now, importantly, it achieves these goals while increasing national savings and dramatically reducing our public debt. 
   Mr. President, the Clinton budget is a historic one. It begins a new era in budget policymaking and promises to shape our Nation's future for years, for even decades, to come. 
   The Federal Government at long last has put its fiscal house in order. Last year was the first year since 1969 that we ran a budget surplus--a unified budget surplus, I point out. This year that surplus will be even larger. And many analysts see budget surpluses continuing for years to come. 
   Our Government is the smallest that it has been, on a relative basis, in a quarter century, and we have improved our fiscal condition for 7 years in a row--the best record in U.S. history. 
   Much of the credit for this success goes to President Clinton and the congressional Democrats, but I hasten to point out that much of the impetus that brought us to the point that we are came because we did this in a bipartisan fashion. And I speak as the ranking member of the Budget Committee. The President lent the considerable force of his office and his persuasion and worked with both Republicans and Democrats to get to this fairly enviable position to produce a balanced budget agreement. So there is plenty of credit to go around for an accomplishment that is well in place. I hope we can resume our work in similarly bipartisan and cooperative ways because there is so much left to be done. 
   In my view, President Clinton's budget submission provides an excellent roadmap for that work. The heart of the President's plan is its allocation of roughly 90 percent of projected budget surpluses to three key areas: Saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and cutting taxes to promote savings for ordinary Americans. 
   Social Security now is projected to be insolvent by 2032. The President's plan would preserve the program until  2055. The plan also would extend Medicare solvency from the year 2008 to 2020. 
   In addition, the budget includes a $500 billion tax cut to promote savings among ordinary Americans in new ``USA accounts.'' That is way more than a tax cut; it is a way to help all Americans invest in the private sector and share in the benefits of economic growth. 
   These priorities--saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, and cutting taxes for retirement--are all designed to increase savings, and that is essential. After all, while we have a unified surplus today, our public debt--that debt owed outside our Government--is still $3.7 trillion. That is the debt owed to the public. We will also face huge unfunded liabilities when the baby boomers begin to retire. 
   We need to prepare for that future, and that is why it is important that we pay off our debts, reduce interest costs, and increase private investment. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan testified that that is the best way to promote long-term economic growth. And it is the only way to ensure that when the baby boomers retire we will be able to meet our obligations. 
   Beyond devoting most of the budget surpluses for savings, President Clinton's budget also includes some important investments in our future. All are fully offset as required by budget rules and therefore protect the budget caps. 
   Perhaps most importantly, the budget makes a strong commitment to quality education. It would help modernize our schools, hire more teachers, reduce class size, and improve educational standards. 
   Together these initiatives would help ensure that Americans are equipped to compete in the global economy. Everyone is aware that this century, the 20th century, has been defined as the American century because of the progress that we made. After winning two World Wars and having engaged in other conflicts that ultimately produced peace, American leadership was at the helm of global economic growth. 
   The budget also calls for a variety of other targeted tax cuts such as new credits to help families support long-term care and child care. It increases our commitment to our men and women in the military. It was made clear in newspapers across the country in the last few days that we are having significant problems recruiting and retaining those people that we would like to have serve us in the military. So it reflects the President's commitment to strengthen that; possibly to encourage young people to spend some time in the military and to encourage those who have experience and longevity to continue to do the job that they are capable of and not be attracted simply by a momentary better opportunity in the private sector. 
   The budget also reflects the President's commitment to strengthening our communities by hiring more police officers, cleaning up our environment, and fighting sprawl. We cannot go into every detail of the budget here today, but overall I think this is an excellent proposal. It is bold, it is innovative, and it has the right priorities for our future. 
   Unfortunately, I have been disappointed that the response to the President's budget, like other things that happen in Congress, has so far been too partisan. Some Republicans have accused the President of returning to an era of big government. This claim is so preposterous it is difficult to take it seriously when we look at the amounts of moneys being spent on government and see that, relative to the GDP, it is at the lowest point that it has been since 1974. This budget, after all, would reserve almost 90 percent of the surpluses for debt reduction. It would be hard to get more fiscally responsible. 
   I respect the views of my Republican colleagues who have honest disagreements with the President. I hope we can work together on this budget issue. However, I do want to express my strong opposition to one element of the Republican's budget plan, and that is their proposal for cuts across the board in tax rates. 
   I want to emphasize that I strongly support tax relief for ordinary Americans. In particular, I support the $500-plus billion in tax cuts for savings that are included in the President's budget for ordinary Americans. Unfortunately, the Republican position is to spend much of the budget surplus for tax rate cuts that go disproportionately to Americans with the highest incomes. 
   According to one analysis, the Republican proposal would provide more than $20,000 for those in the top 1 percent of earners who have incomes of more than $800,000. Just look at the chart. It looks like a fairly ridiculous comparison, but the top 1 percent of those earning $833,000--those folks are in the top 1 percent; that is not the entire 1 percent--they would get a tax cut of $20,697, but the person who works hard and is included in the 60 percent of our American wage earners whose incomes are below $38,000 would get a $99 tax cut. Mr. President, $20,000 for the high-income wealthy people, $99 for the average American; it is not fair and I hope that it will be reconsidered by our friends on the Republican side. 
   Even worse, these tax breaks for the highest income Americans would come at the direct expense of Medicare. Medicare has become such an important program in our society, such a commitment, that it is valued by Americans across the board. We see its effects on the better health and the longevity that our citizens enjoy and the quality of life they experience in those longer lives in their later years. So it would be wrong to sacrifice some addition to the solvency of Medicare for a tax break across the board that gives someone earning over $800,000 in a single year a $20,000-plus tax break. 
   President Clinton's budget reflects the values and priorities of most Americans, and I hope that many of its proposals will enjoy bipartisan support. The American public loves it when we work in a bipartisan fashion, and I noted that when we got to the balanced budget agreement for fiscal year 1997. We had all kinds of comments--it is a pleasure not to see any bickering, not to see any sharp diatribes, not to see any acerbic discussions; it is a pleasure to see Senators working together on behalf of all Americans. 
   So this focus for this budget is on the future: saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare, providing tax cuts and promoting savings for ordinary Americans. Together these policies will help ensure a vibrant economy and a secure future for all Americans. So I hope my colleagues will support the President's approach. I look forward to doing what I can to work with them to address the serious fiscal issues facing our Nation and to prepare us for the 21st century, which I think can become the second American century. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to reauthorize the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route so that we can allow the National Park Service, together with its partners, to complete its work in bringing recognition to New Jersey's rich coastal history. I am pleased to be joined by Senator TORRICELLI in sponsoring this legislation. 
   The Coastal Heritage Trail Route was first authorized in 1988 through legislation sponsored by former Senator Bill Bradley and myself. This legislation authorized the Secretary of the Interior to design a vehicular route that would enable the public to enjoy the nationally significant natural and cultural sites along the New Jersey coastline. Thanks to the work of the National Park Service, the Coastal Heritage Trail Route will, at completion, have five theme trails to allow for the self-discovery of topics ranging from maritime history to wildlife migration. These five vehicular discovery trails will travel along the coast of New Jersey, through eight different counties, by way of the Garden State Parkway and State Highway 49. 
   The first theme trail completed is the Maritime History trail. The purpose of this trail is to explore the coastal trade, defense of the nation, and fishing and ship building industries. The second trail is the Coastal  Habitats trail. This trail enables visitors to learn about the special natural resources of the New Jersey coast and the plants, animals and especially birds that live there. The recently opened Wildlife Migrations trail, allows individuals to explore the special places that migrating species depend on along New Jersey's coast. A fourth trail is the Historic Settlements trail. When completed, this trail will bring the historic communities whose economies were based on local natural resources to life. The final tour, Relaxation and Inspiration, will depict how people have traditionally used their leisure time, at places such as religious retreats and historic boardwalks. 
   The project, which was originally conceived and designed to recognize the importance of New Jersey's coastal areas in our nation's history, has grown into a rich partnership between the federal government, state and local governments, and private individuals. This partnership demonstrates a commitment among many levels of government and the private sector to bringing history to life. 
   Mr. President, the New Jersey Coastal Heritage Trail Route is clearly one of the National Park Service's success stories. Legislation to renew authorization for the trail enacted in 1994 appropriately called upon the Park Service to match 50 percent of its federal funding with non-federal funds. I am pleased to report that the Service has gone well beyond that matching requirement. Since 1994, appropriations for the Trail Route totaled $1.8 million. During that same period, the Park Service has raised $2.8 million in matching funds. 
   However, the work is not yet finished. Even though the Park Service has been able to meet the funding requirements, at this time, only the first three trails have been completed. The Park Service plans call for completing the two remaining trails, and adding three new visitor centers and interpretive materials to aid school children as they learn about New Jersey's history. Our bill would make this possible by increasing the authorization level for the trail to $4 million, and extend the authorization to the Year 2004, which would give the Park Service the additional time it needs to complete the Trail Route. 
   The Coastal Heritage Trail Route brings national recognition and stature to many of New Jersey's special places, and helps to contribute to New Jersey's number two industry, tourism. Most importantly, the Trail Route provides residents and visitors with an opportunity to explore New Jersey's natural and cultural history and develop an appreciation for its importance. But what should happen if we don't reauthorize the funds for this program? Among other effects, New Jersey residents and visitors to our state will have lost valuable educational opportunities. Much of the $2 million in grants that the project has successfully generated will have been lost. And there would be a severe impact on tourism if the five themes are not fully developed. 
   Mr. President, I just wanted to take a moment to commend Senator MURKOWSKI, the Chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and Senator THOMAS, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Historic Preservation, and Recreation. They and the members of their staff worked hard in the last Congress to mark up this legislation and report it favorably to the full Senate. Although this bill was approved overwhelmingly by my colleagues in the Senate in the last Congress, the House of Representatives did not vote on this legislation prior to adjournment, and thus we must begin again. I have every confidence that this important legislation will pass both houses of Congress in a timely fashion during this session. Just today, the House Resources Committee reported out the House version of this bill, H.R. 171, introduced by Rep. FRANK A. LOBIONDO.  
   The completion of the Coastal Heritage Trail Route is an important priority for New Jersey. The trail system will provide a sense of history, not solely for the residents of New Jersey, but for its visitors as well. By repealing the sunset provision on the original act, and increasing the authorization, the National Park Service will be allowed to complete the project that deserves to be finished.

    Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that will help prevent the tragedies that occur when children gain access to firearms. 
   Each year, there are 10,000 injuries and deaths due to the accidental discharge or unauthorized use of a firearm. Many of these incidents involve children who have gained access to improperly stored guns. 
   Recently, a family in my home state of New Jersey suffered this type of tragedy. Akeen Williams, a 4-year-old boy for Lawnside, was visiting a relative with his 5-year-old sister, Gabrielle, and their 6-year-old brother, Phillip. Eventually, the children were put in a bedroom for an afternoon nap. But they found a gun stored in the room, and Akeen and Gabrielle began playing with it. The gun accidentally discharged, and Akeen was hit in the face by the ricocheting bullet. 
   Across the nation, similar stories have become all too common. Families in Jonesboro, Paducah, Pearl, Edinboro, and Springfield are still struggling to deal with the horrific shootings in their communities. We must find new ways to stop gun violence. 
   In many other areas the federal government has taken steps to protect consumer safety: cars are now sold with seat belts and airbags; drug containers have childproof caps; and lawn mowers have guards and automatic braking devices. It is hard to understand how anyone can oppose similar safety measures for deadly weapons. The time has come to hold firearm manufacturers to a higher standard of safety. 
   The bill I am introducing today will help prevent children from being killed or injured in firearm tragedies. My bill would require that all handguns be engineered so that they can only be fired by an authorized user. To give manufacturers time to comply, this requirement would not go into effect until 3 years after the bill is enacted. Additionally, to spur additional innovation and help lower the cost of the new handgun designs, my bill would also authorize the National Institute of Justice to provide grants for improvements in firearms safety. In order to prevent the unauthorized use of handguns and better protect children in the 3-year period before this regulation goes into effect, my bill would also require that, 90 days after enactment, all handguns be sold with a locking device and a warning concerning responsible firearm storage. 
   Despite what some members of the gun lobby may say, the technology to make handguns childproof exists today. Since 1976, more than 30 patents have been granted for various technologies that will prevent a handgun from being fired by anyone except the authorized user. For example, the SafTLok company in Florida manufactures a push-button combination lock that is incorporated into the grip of a handgun. If the buttons are not pushed in the proper sequence, the gun will not fire. These locks sell for $80 each, and the Boston police department recently announced that these locks will be standard equipment for its officers. 
   Similarly, the Fulton Arms company in Texas has developed a revolver that cannot be fired unless the user is wearing a magnetic ring. And Colt Manufacturing in Connecticut has designed a prototype handgun that emits a radio signal and cannot be fired unless the user is wearing a small transponder that returns a coded radio signal. 
   In addition to making children safer, these technologies will also help law enforcement. Data from the Federal Bureau of Investigation shows that about 16 percent of the officers killed in the line of duty, as many as 19 in a single year, are killed by a suspect armed with either the officer's firearm or that of another officer. Because of the potential to stop these ``take away'' shootings, the National Institute of Justice has funded studies of these technologies and supported development of the Colt prototype. However, in order to ensure that the police have the weapons they need to protect the public, law enforcement entities are exempt from the requirements in the bill. 
   None of the provisions in this legislation will burden the vast majority of firearm owners who are already storing their handguns safely and securely. Of course, Congress cannot legislate responsibility. But we can and should take steps to lessen the likelihood that guns will fall into the wrong hands and be used improperly. 
   I urge my colleagues to work with me to pass this measure and help make homes, school, and communities safer for our children.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today, along with Senators DASCHLE, BAUCUS, REID, BOXER, WYDEN, BREAUX, BRYAN, LEVIN, MURRAY, SCHUMER, TORRICELLI, MIKULSKI, DURBIN, LEAHY, ROCKEFELLER, SARBANES, KENNEDY, and LIEBERMAN, I am introducing the Brownfields and Environmental Cleanup Act of 1999. This legislation is designed to foster the cleanup of potentially thousands of toxic waste sites across the country. Just as importantly, this bill is about jobs, revenue and economic opportunity, because it will help turn abandoned industrial sites into engines of economic development. 
   Mr. President, I have been interested for a long time now in the issue of these abandoned, underutilized and contaminated industrial sites, commonly known as brownfields. Our Nation's great industrial tradition was the lifeblood of our Nation's economy. But this industrial tradition also entailed tremendous environmental costs. Sites were contaminated, and then when the manufacturers, the companies left, the legacy remained behind. Today, decaying industrial plants define the skyline and contaminate the land in many of our urban areas. Their rusting frames, like aging skyscrapers, are a silent reminder of those manufacturers that left, taking inner-city jobs and often inner-city hope with them. 
   However, ``brownfields'' as we have come to know them, can be found anywhere--in the inner cities, the suburbs and in rural areas. Any time that an industry leaves an area or a business goes out of business we face the specter of the unknown--they contaminate not only the aesthetics of the area but also the opportunity for jobs and for business investment. This bill provides the means to help investigate and facilitate funding for the cleanup of these areas, wherever they are found. 
   I continue to feel as I did when I introduced similar legislation in 1993, 1996, and again in 1997, that a brownfields cleanup program can spur significant economic development and create jobs. The nation's Mayors have estimated that they lose between $200 and $500 million a year in tax revenues from brownfields sitting idle, and that returning these sites to productive use could create some 236,000 new jobs. Each day that Congress fails to act on brownfields liability, it deprives our cities of unique redevelopment opportunities. This type of cleanup initiative makes good environmental sense and good business sense. 
   A pilot project in Cleveland resulted in $3.2 million in private investment, a $1 million increase on the local tax base, and more than 170 new jobs. In Elizabeth, NJ, a former municipal landfill is being turned into a major mall with 5,000 employees. 
   Mr. President, the potential for job creation across the country is enormous, and every revitalized brownfields may represent for someone a field of dreams, especially to an unemployed urban worker. 
   But this bill is not about jobs alone. Brownfield cleanup also means that dangerous contaminants are removed from our environment, and future generations are not left with unknown problems and unused properties. 
   On the other hand, the risks posed by many of these sites may be relatively low and others even nonexistent, because brownfields are often abandoned or underutilized industrial or commercial sites where expansion or redevelopment is complicated by just the perception of environmental contamination. But their full economic use is being stymied because there is no ready mechanism for getting them evaluated or, if necessary, cleaned up, even when the owner of the property is ready, willing and eager to do so. 
   In addition, prospective purchasers and developers are reluctant to get involved in transactions with these properties because of their concern, however minimal, they might potentially create environmental liability. 
   The challenge is to turn these abandoned properties into thriving businesses that can generate needed jobs and act as a catalyst for economic development. 
   My legislation would provide financial assistance in the form of grants to local and State governments to inventory and evaluate brownfields sites. This would enable interested parties to know what would be required to clean the site and what reuse would best suit the property. 
   My bill would also provide grants to State and local governments to establish and capitalize low-interest loan programs. These funds would be loaned to prospective purchasers, municipalities and others to facilitate voluntary cleanup actions where traditional lending mechanisms may not be available. The minimum seed money involved in the program would leverage substantial economic payoffs, as well as turning lands which may be of negative worth into assets for the future. 
   The bill also would limit the potential liability of innocent buyers of these properties, and it would set a standard to gauge when parties couldn't have reasonably known that the property was contaminated. It would also provide Superfund liability relief to persons who own property next door to a brownfields property, so long as the person did not cause the release and exercises appropriate care. 
   Mr. President, for several Congresses there has been bipartisan interest in addressing brownfields, both in the Senate and in the other body on the other side of the Capitol. I am hopeful we can move this legislation forward in a cooperative way with support of Members on both sides of the aisle. 
   I urge my colleagues to co-sponsor this legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help my constituent Vova Malofienko, and his parents, to live a healthy and productive life in the United States. 
   Tragically, Vova was a victim of the Chernobyl reactor explosion. He has battled Leukemia his whole life. Since his arrival in the United States for cancer treatment in 1992, he and his parents have sought to remain here because the air, food, and water in the Ukraine are still contaminated with radiation and are perilous to those like Vova who have a weakened immune system. Additionally, cancer treatment available in the Ukraine is not as sophisticated as medical care available in the United States. 
   Although Vova's cancer has gone into remission because of the excellent health care he has received, the seven other children who came to the United States with Vova were not as fortunate. They returned to the Ukraine and they died, one by one, because of inadequate cancer treatment. Not one child survived. 
   Because of his perilous medical condition, Vova and his family have done everything possible to remain in the United States. Since 1992, they have obtained a number of visa extensions, and I have helped them with their efforts. In March of 1997, the last time the Malofienkos' visas were expiring, I appealed to the INS and the family was given what I was told would be final one-year extension. 
   Across the country, people have rallied in support of Vova's cause. The Children of Chernobyl Relief Fund, national Ukrainian and religious organizations, and Vova's classmates at Millburn Middle School have all worked to help the Malofienkos. 
   During the last session of Congress, I introduced legislation to help Vova and his family. With the help of Senators ABRAHAM, HATCH, and DASCHLE, the Senate passed the bill unanimously. However, the House failed to pass it before the end of the last session. 
   I hope that my Senate colleagues will help move this legislation forward expeditiously. We must give Vova and his family a chance to live their lives in peace.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing the Safe and Sober Streets Act of 1999 with Senator DEWINE--a bill that will, if enacted into law, save 500-700 lives a year. The Safe and Sober Streets Act establishes a legal limit for drunken driving at .08 Blood Alcohol Content (BAC) in all 50 states. 
   Mr. President, Senator DEWINE and I offered this very bill last March as an amendment to the ISTEA reauthorization bill, now known as TEA-21, on behalf of the millions victims of drunk driving crashes. We were joined by 22 other cosponsors. I am proud to say that the Senate--this body--voted 62 to 32 to adopt this amendment. It was supported by one half of each caucus. 
   The Senate cast this strong vote because it knew that establishing .08 as the legal definition of drunken driving is responsible and will save lives. The Senate knew that this bill would encourage states to adopt .08 BAC laws. Without it, states will get bogged down in legislative gridlock and will not be able to pass their own .08 BAC laws. As a result, lives that could have been saved will have instead been lost. 
   Mr. President, the Senate spoke loud and clear when it voted to adopt .08. We voted to save lives. We voted to protect our families from the grief associated with losing a loved one to drunk driving. We resisted the pressure of a powerful special interest and voted against drunk driving. The President called on Congress to pass the bill and he would have signed it into law. 
   The problem came after the Senate's resounding vote. The special interests stepped up their pressure tactics to stop our .08 amendment. Despite commitments granted, the House Rules Committee denied a vote. Democracy was squelched in back-room politics. 
   Last May, Mr. President, the TEA-21 conference leaders--seven people--ignored the will of the Senate and the American people. The final TEA-21 bill dropped the .08 BAC provision and replaced it with a $500 million, six-year incentive grant program specifically for .08 BAC. The incentive grant program, as constructed in TEA-21, will not produce national .08 standard. 
   Mr. President, when it comes to an issue like the minimum drinking age, which I authored here in the Senate in 1984, or the Zero Tolerance for underage drinking and driving, authored by Senator BYRD in 1995 or .08 in 1998, there are only two things the federal government can do. We can encourage the states to act by giving them money or withholding it until they have acted. The former has never worked, but the latter already has. 
   Withholding federal resources, which has been tested and proven constitutionally sound, has worked. All 50 states have a minimum drinking age of 21. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration tell us that the 21 law has saved the lives of over 10,000 precious young Americans. South Carolina just became the 50th state to pass a Zero Tolerance statute. No state has ever lost federal highway dollars because of the federal government's efforts to insure that our nation's young people do not drink and drive. 
   The only consequence has been that lives have been saved. 
   Mr. President, under the bill that In am introducing today, all states would have three years in which to adopt .08 BAC as the DWI definition. After those three years, states would, as with the 21 drinking age and Zero Tolerance, face a withholding of five percent of their highway construction funds. Those who voted against the Safe and Sober Streets Act or prevented a vote in the other body said this was a choice between sanctions and incentives. It is not. This was, and is, a choice between what works and what does not. 
   Worse, the incentive grant program contained in TEA-21 is a classic case of how not to construct an incentive grant program. For example, most of the money goes to states that have already adopted .08 laws. Why provide incentive grants to states which have already acted? What incentive does a state need to pass .08 if it has already passed .08? Yet, that's what the $500 million incentive grant program does. 
   Mr. President, we have provided a fig leaf to cover our shame for failing to do what 70 percent of the American people expected us to do--to override the narrow special interest and act to protect public health and safety. 
   Mr. President, we know that .08 BAC is the right level for DWI. Adopting this level will simply bring the United States into the ranks of most other industrialized nations in setting reasonable drunk driving limits. Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, Austria and Switzerland have .08 BAC limits. France, Belgium, Finland and the Netherlands' limit is .05 BAC. Sweden's is .02 BAC. 
   Last year, supporters of our amendment included President Clinton. The National Safety Council. The Center for Disease Control. The American Automobile Manufacturers Association. Kemper, State Farm and Nationwide insurance companies. Mothers Against Drunk Driving. American College of Emergency Physicians. Consumer Federation of America. National Fire Protection Association. Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. Newspaper editorial boards, such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, and The Baltimore Sun. 
   But more important than the support of scores of businesses, health and science organizations, governmental agencies, public opinion leaders, is the support from the families and friends of victims of drunk driving--like the Fraziers of Westminister, Maryland,  and Louise and Ronald Hammell, of Tuckerton, New Jersey. Brenda and Randy lost their nine year old daughter, Ashley, to drunk driving. Louise and Ronald lost their 17 year old son, Matthew, to drunk driving. 
   Mr. President, organizations who support this bill have one thing in mind: the public's interest. The health and safety of our communities and of our roads is in the public's interest. 
   Every thirty minutes, someone in America--a mother, husband, child, grandchild, brother, sister--dies in an alcohol related crash. In the United States, 39 percent of all fatal crashes are alcohol related. Alcohol is the single greatest factor in motor vehicle deaths and injuries. 
   .08 is a reasonable and responsible level at which to draw the line in fighting drunk driving. It is at .08 that a person is drunk and should not be driving. 
   Adopting .08 BAC is just common sense. Think of it this way: you are in your car at night, driving on a two lane road. Your child is sitting next to you. You see a car's headlights approaching. The driver is a 170 pound man who just came from a bar, and drank five bottles of beer in one hour on an empty stomach. If he were driving in Maryland, he would not be considered drunk. But if he were driving in Virginia, he would be. Does this make sense? We should not have a patchwork quilt of laws when we are dealing with drunk driving. 
   This bill--.08--simply reflects what sound science and research proves, and interjects some reality into our definition of drunk driving and applies it to all 50 states. 
   No objective, credible person or organization can deny that adopting .08 BAC laws is the right thing to do. This bill does not eliminate the incentive grant program. In deference to those who authorized the incentive grant program, but who also supported my .08 bill, this bill specifically keeps the grant program. States will have the benefit of incentives for the first five years. After that, the money will be withheld. But, given past experience, I expect no state to lose funds. 
   The Senate has strongly supported this once. It should do so again. I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation.

   Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President I rise today to introduce the Public School Modernization Act of 1999. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my cosponsors, Senators ROBB, KENNEDY, DASCHLE, CONRAD, BINGAMAN, EDWARDS, TORRICELLI, KERRY, BREAUX, INOUYE, BOXER, and JOHNSON. 
   Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today is about opportunity. If there is one essential job of a responsive government, it is to provide opportunity--especially for young Americans. A solid education allows young people to open the door to a world of opportunity. 
   However, too many American children open the door each morning to enter a schoolhouse with inadequate facilities for a modern learning environment. To help remedy this situation, my Public School Modernization Act will fuel a nationwide effort to renovate older schools and build new, state-of-art educational facilities. 
   Mr. President, that is why this legislation must be at the top of the agenda for the 106th Congress. As we face the new millennium, we must invest in our young people--our future. Congress must look ahead to the challenges of the next century and prepare a new generation of Americans to continue our world leadership in innovation, industry, arts and science. 
   Mr. President, this legislation will improve the very base, the very foundation of American education. Our children's educational experience begins with the buildings they learn in every day. 
   We know the condition of these buildings has a direct impact on learning. A Georgetown University study revealed that the achievement levels of students taught in substandard educational facilities were 11 percent lower than students in modern facilities. Similarly, a 1996 Virginia study also found an 11 percentile point difference between students in substandard buildings and those in modern facilities. Both of these studies were controlled for other variables, such as a student's socioeconomic status. 
   Mr. President, this data, and numerous other studies like it, allows us to formulate a simple equation: Modern Schools Equal Better Learning. 
   Unfortunately, too many of our nation's school buildings fall into the inadequate category. A 1995 General Accounting Office report revealed that one-third of all schools, serving 14 million students, need extensive repair or replacement. In addition, 7 million students attend school every day with life-threatening safety code violations.  How can we expect our children to effectively focus on their lessons in such an environment? 
   In my home state of New Jersey we have a range of school modernization needs. The condition of low income, urban school facilities were at issue in a decades-long lawsuit that was recently settled. However, the problem is not just an urban problem. In my State, and across the U.S., it is a suburban and rural problem as well. 
   For example, suburban Montgomery Township has seen its enrollment grow by 99.6 percent over last 6 years. Another suburban district, South Brunswick, has seen enrollment grow by 60 percent in the past five years. One South Brunswick's student, sixth grader Amy Wolf, told me that the overcrowding of facilities has prevented teachers from working on a ``one to one'' basis with students. 
   This overcrowding often costs students their normal recreation area. Former playgrounds and sports fields on many suburban school campuses are becoming classroom trailer parks because of escalating enrollment. 
   In addition to overcrowding, suburban schools are crumbling. Many of these 
   facilities, built quickly in the 1960s, are not holding up well and need extensive repair. 
   And in older, urban schools the condition and age of buildings is making it harder to move more computers into the classrooms or wire schools to the Internet. According to the GAO report, nearly half of all schools don't have an electrical system ready for the full-scale use of computers. In addition, 60 percent lack the conduits necessary to connect classrooms to a computer network. 
   Mr. President, to remedy this situation, my Public School Modernization Act presents school districts all over the country with a unique opportunity to renovate existing buildings and build new schoolhouses from the ground up. The bill will provide special bond authority to school districts that will allow these districts to raise the necessary funds for school modernization by offering Federal tax credits to bondholders in lieu of traditional interest payments by States or school districts. 
   The low cost feature for school districts is a simple concept. The districts will not be obligated to pay interest to the bondholders. Rather the bondholders would receive a Federal tax credit equivalent to interest payments. 
   Mr. President, these savings will free up local school district funds for teaching and learning. The savings could also result in significant property tax relief for the community. 
   In addition, this federal legislation will not interfere in local control of education. The Public School Modernization Act offers opportunity--not continuous Federal oversight or Federal agency sign-off for every project. The act simply requires States and school districts to conduct a survey of their school facility needs and make sure that the bonding authority is distributed in a way that ensures that schools with the greatest needs and least resources do indeed benefit from the program. 
   This new bond authority will be split between two programs. Most of the authority will result from a new program, called Qualified School Construction Bonds. The majority of this bond authority, 65 percent, will be allocated to States in proportion to each State's share of funds under the Title I Basic Grant formula. The remaining 35 percent of the authority to issue these special, 15 year bonds, would be allocated to the 100 school districts with the largest number of low income children and in addition, to as many as 25 districts that demonstrate a particular need, such as very high enrollment growth or a low level of resources. 
   The rest of the bond authority will come from an existing program, Qualified Zone Academy Bonds, created by the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. It also provides a tax credit in lieu of interest, but for a variety of school expenses, including school modernization. This bond program will be significantly expanded and improved by this legislation. 
   Mr. President, the time for this legislation is now, and it must be enacted during this Congress. The vast majority of Americans support a major federal investment in modernizing public schools. It should be a bipartisan goal, and I hope that a number of Republicans will cosponsor on this bill before it becomes law. 
   The Public School Modernization Act is long overdue, especially when you consider that President Eisenhower first called for Federal school construction legislation in his 1955 State of the Union address. I hope we can make this proposal a reality before the 45th anniversary of President Eisenhower's call to action. 
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.
