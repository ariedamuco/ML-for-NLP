    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate and acknowledge LaGrange, Georgia, which was recently named the ``Intelligent City of the Year for 2000'' by the World Teleport Association. LaGrange is only the second city to win this award which can be awarded to any city worldwide. 
   LaGrange is deserving of this award, which is in recognition of its ``Internet For Everyone'' program to provide Internet access to every home in the city with cable access at no additional cost to the resident. In the 1990's, LaGrange officials deployed a fiber optic network because they recognized this infrastructure need to ensure their community is adequately prepared for the coming information age, and they saw the advantages of such an investment. This foundation led to the development of a two-way hybrid fiber coaxial cable network that supports cable modems and Internet access for the 21st Century. All the customer needs is a television, and the Internet is accessed through a set top box and wireless keyboard. 
   This investment in the workforce of tomorrow is one of a kind, and anyone who can access the world wide web will now be a recipient of the knowledge and information of the citizens of LaGrange. I have pledged to work with them to encourage the further development of the Internet for the benefit of users worldwide. In fact, last month, I was in LaGrange to celebrate the wiring of the city's government housing community. At this event, I was pleased with the amount of knowledge the children already have about the web, its uses, and the potential it brings. They are our future, and they are the people who will benefit the most from LaGrange's farsightedness. 
   As Congress looks for ways to bridge the digital divide, I would like to make an example of LaGrange, Georgia, the Intelligent City of the Year for 2000. There are many options available for communities around the country. Once we are connected we will truly be able to learn more from one another about ourselves, our communities, our country, and our world. 
   Again, I congratulate the city of LaGrange, Georgia and Mayor Jeff Lukken, and I hope that the children and families of LaGrange will take full advantage of this great opportunity.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to remind Members that the news today reminds us why we need a Defense authorization bill; why we need pay increases for our military men and women abroad; why we need our Armed Forces to be strong; why we need to take care of our military retirees, especially in terms of their health care needs; why we need a defense of this country at all. 
   Our young men and women are in 121 nations around the globe, and they stand on watch in defense of this country. In doing so, they voluntarily, every one of them, place themselves in  harm's way. We saw the cost today of that terrible price that is exacted from time to time on our service men and women. All of us have in our hearts and in our thoughts and in our prayers the families of those service men and women on board the U.S.S. Cole as they struggle with taking care of their dead, their wounded, and their missing. 
   This year's Department of Defense authorization conference report represents months of hard work and compromise on behalf of our Nation's military, as has been discussed. I thank Chairman WARNER and ranking member CARL LEVIN for their leadership throughout this entire process this year and for their support particularly of my initiatives to enhance the GI bill. Stephen Ambrose, the historian, particularly of the greatest generation of World War II, said the GI bill is probably the finest piece of legislation ever devised by the Federal Government. 
   I thank Senator HUTCHINSON, chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee, with whom I have worked closely this year on issues pertaining to the quality of life of our service men and women. 
   This conference report has been a long time coming, as has been discussed. We began the authorization process earlier this year. Here we are in the closing days of this session of the Congress and finally debating the conference report for the DOD authorization bill. 
   The extended time we have taken on this year's bill has been worthwhile, though. It represents our continued effort in the Senate to build upon a firm foundation by providing a substantial increase in funding for the U.S. military, and Lord knows we need it. 
   Last year was the first step in addressing some of the pressing needs of those who defend our Nation by providing pay increases--and by the way, with last year's pay increase and this year's 3.7-percent pay increase, we will have provided just in the last 2 years the biggest pay increase in a generation. 
   This bill not only provides pay increases but reform of the military retirement pay system, targeted bonuses, critical investments in spare parts, and continued support for the next generation of weapons systems. 
   We have taken an even bigger step this year throughout this process. We have talked with our men and women in uniform. This year I have been to Kosovo. I personally have been to Japan and the Korean peninsula. I talked with our men and women in uniform serving around the world. I consulted with the leadership of the services. We have taken yet another step to fulfill the promises to support those who put on the uniform and carry our flag every day. 
   Our people, as we now know, and are so painfully reminded today, face dangers every day in what seems the most routine of tasks. Our hearts do go out to the sailors and families of those serving, especially on the U.S.S. Cole, tonight in the Middle East. Those sacrifices are just a recent reminder of what our men and women face every day. 
   This year we continue the support of the modernization of our Armed Forces by funding the next generation of weapons systems, such as Joint Strike Fighter providing critical funding for the F-22 aircraft. We have authorized additions to some of our most trusted aircraft systems by increasing the funding for C-130s made in my home State of Georgia and funding additional JSTARS aircraft, without which we could not conduct modern warfare. 
   Also included in this bill is increased funding to support the Army's plan to transform itself into a leaner, more mobile fighting force. We have authorized funding of $222 million for our spare parts accounts and over $407 million for equipment maintenance accounts to address such critical readiness issues. 
   This year, as with last year, we have increased funding in support for the most critical weapon in our arsenal--our military men and women. It is their hard work and selfless service that make America's military the strongest force in the world. 
   This year, we provided that 3.7-percent pay increase to all military personnel. We have eliminated TRICARE copayments for our military families and extended TRICARE Remote to active duty family members assigned to remote locations who do not have access to military treatment facilities. 
   We have authorized almost $9 billion for military construction and provided improvements to family housing, which is much needed. We have included full implementation of a thrift savings plan for service members. 
   We have also authorized those military families eligible for food stamps to qualify for an extra $500 a month. Most importantly, this year, we have taken an enormous step by providing health care access for our military retirees. Since my election to the Senate, I have heard from military retirees in Georgia and across the Nation regarding health care benefits. When they were asked to serve their country, they did not turn their backs on our country. Time and again, we have heard their call for keeping this country's promises to them. 
   This year, we are living up to that promise. In this conference report, we have authorized the Warner-Hutchinson provisions granting TRICARE for seniors as a lifetime benefit for our retirees over the age of 65. For the first time, we are granting health care insurance for military retirees over 65. Though in the beginning this was a 2-year pilot program to be fully implemented and fully funded in the outyears, we worked to make this benefit permanent. 
   Additionally, I worked with my colleagues to provide a prescription drug benefit, prescription drugs being the biggest out-of-pocket expense for military retirees, for our Medicare-eligible retirees. This is the first prescription drug benefit to be offered by the Federal Government. 
   Our military retirees have earned these benefits, and I am proud to support both of these vital provisions. 
   One quality of life issue I have been working on during the past 2 years has been educational benefits. I was pleased that two provisions of my educational initiative are included in the conference report: authorizing the services to pay 100 percent of tuition assistance for going to school while in the military and allowing VEAP participants to buy into the Montgomery GI bill. However, we have to do more. I will continue to work to address the quality-of-life issues, especially educational benefits. I still believe we must make the GI bill more family friendly. We must work to offer a transferability option to our military families, as recommended by the congressionally mandated Principi Commission. 
   I note this conference report is subject to a budget point of order. There are important concerns about the increases in mandatory spending that are included in the legislation. However, this spending which is mainly for health care benefits is needed and justified. Therefore, I will not support the budget point of order and will support final adoption of this conference report. 
   In the next congressional session, we have to continue to work hard to establish meaningful benefits for service members who serve our great Nation by taking additional steps along the road to maintaining the finest military in the world. We must honor the soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines who serve this country. They deserve it. 
   I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am addressing the Senate to express my view on a vital part of our Nation's transportation infrastructure--the freight railroads. 
   I am aware of concerns that have been raised by some companies that ship by rail about the service and rates available to them. Certainly, the ability to safely, economically and efficiently transport raw materials to plants and finished products to both domestic and international consumers is as critical as the actual production of these commodities and goods. 
   Since 1827 with the founding of the Nation's first commercial railroad, the B&O, we have depended on the rails to perform this function. In its heyday, the iron horse dominated transportation of goods and passengers. Today, after surviving nearly total collapse in the 1970s, a streamlined, modernized rail industry continues to play a role, albeit a considerably downsized one, in the transportation marketplace. Our transportation infrastructure has evolved--now trucks on the interstate highways are by far the predominant mode of transportation, and inland barges carry coal and grain on our nation's waterways. 
   As many of you know, I have always been interested in rail history. Indeed, Atlanta was originally known as Terminus because of the railroads which were sited there. What history has taught us is that the rails require a continuing, massive capital investment to operate safely. In the late 1970s, Congress faced the dilemma of a severely under-capitalized system with a dismal safety performance. The rails would have to be supported by massive federal subsidy or freed to compete in the marketplace in an effort to generate needed capital. Congress wisely chose the latter course, and the railroads have been able to generate the quarter trillion dollars needed since 1980 to support the infrastructure. In 1999 alone, the private investment was $16.2 billion, with $2.87 of assets needed for every dollar of revenue produced. The industry's vastly improved safety record in large part is a testament to the wisdom of that infrastructure investment. Let me add that although progress in this area has been significant, nevertheless this safety record can be further improved. It is my hope that management and labor will work together toward that end. 
   The world is not perfect, of course, and in the intervening years issues have arisen which must be addressed--issues such as the need to honor the hard earned collective bargaining agreements of railroad workers. Many of these issues have been brought to the attention of Congress, the Interstate Commerce Commission and now its successor, the Surface Transportation Board, STB. Indeed, the Congress took a comprehensive look at rail regulation in 1995 when it created the STB. I know some companies believe their rail rates are excessive. While rates have declined more than 50 percent since 1981, some customers have benefitted more than others, reflecting the differential pricing put into place by the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. This has led in part to complaints being heard from segments of the shipping  public. Many have suffered from service disruptions following recent mergers and consolidations. While I am very concerned about these situations, I believe the STB has worked within its mandate to address them. 
   I have an open mind on whether these matters need to be examined further. If that is the case, I urge that we move carefully. We should not return to the very regulatory schemes that led to near disaster a generation ago. I would not favor policies that deprive the railroads of their ability to generate capital, resulting in the federal government--rather than the private sector--having to assume the costs of maintaining and operating the freight rail network.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in my lifetime, I have witnessed many changes, experienced fantastic joys, and seen countless faces. It is easy in today's fast-moving society to find yourself caught in a perpetual whirlwind. With days full of appointments and meetings, life sometimes seems to lose all semblance of stability. Luckily, I have always had a source of peace and inspiration in my life, Lithonia First United Methodist Church. 
   With great personal pride and happiness, I come before you today to commemorate an anniversary that is of particular importance to my family and me. One hundred-forty years ago, on Sunday, October 14, 1860, a small group of Lithonians convened for the first time to worship under the leadership of the Reverend Newdaygate B. Ousley. From its humble beginnings in a one room meeting house, Lithonia Methodist Episcopal Church, the forerunner to Lithonia First United Methodist Church began its ministry and a tradition of service that continues even today. 
   It is ironic that a church that grew during the tumult of the Civil War has lasted as long as Lithonia First has. In fact, it is perhaps even more astounding that over the years since its first meeting, during a time that has seen two world wars and countless technological innovations, the church has pulled even closer together and taken on a significant leadership role in its Georgia community. 
   For 140 years, Lithonia First United Methodist Church has provided services and leadership for the surrounding region. Through personal outreach, family ministry, and organizing events like flea markets and barbeques to raise money for the needy, Lithonia First has solidified its place of leadership in its community. 
   Since its simple beginnings, Lithonia First United Methodist Church has grown and become a source of stability and inspiration for its congregants. Under the ministry of its Pastor, Dr. Lawrence E. Wilson, the church has proven how important faith is to our prosperity, and illustrated the power of a community united. It is my pleasure to honor Lithonia First United Methodist Church for its historic anniversary. I am forever grateful for the church's acceptance, dedication, and commitment, I am truly blessed to be a part of such a wonderful community.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, amid the violence and uncertainty of the Civil Rights movement, many people distinguished themselves while fighting for fairness and justice. Men and women risked great personal harm and displayed unparalleled courage in a struggle none of us must ever forget. Although many of the names of those who fought for fairness have been lost to history, it is important to honor these selfless warriors of equality. 
   Although his name is not as familiar as those of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and James Farmer, Mr. LeRoy Collins, former Governor of Florida, played an instrumental role in preventing violence and ensuring the success of demonstrations one fateful Spring day in Selma, AL, 35 years ago. As marchers arrived at the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, they hoped against hope that a repeat of ``Bloody Sunday'' was not waiting for them. 
   President Lyndon Johnson, having witnessed the unconscionable violence initiated by Alabama State troopers on March 7, 1965, sought to stave off another potentially bloody day, and entrusted LeRoy Collins with the delicate task of easing the extremely tense situation. 
   Over the course of the day, Mr. Collins crisscrossed the Pettus Bridge, negotiating at either end with Dr. King and representatives of the Alabama police. After a tireless effort, Mr. Collins eventually secured an agreement that not only allowed the marchers to cross the bridge, but also prevented the violent clash so many people had feared. Later that day, with Alabama State troopers and the entire Nation looking on, 2,000 people led by Dr. King peacefully marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. 
   In an era known for its heated violence, peaceful encounters were a welcome surprise. The nonviolent nature of the second march across the Pettus Bridge was in no small measure a result of LeRoy Collins diligence and courage. One can imagine that had a deal not been brokered, an encounter, possibly more violent than the one on ``Bloody Sunday,'' could very easily have taken place. 
   LeRoy Collins' work illustrates why it is important to go beyond the stories printed in the history books. His hard work and selfless effort saved lives and empowered the movement led by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In a world seemingly devoid of real heroes, it is important to honor those who have made truly significant contributions to our Nation. It took a great man to accomplish what Mr. Collins did. As Dr. King once wrote, ``Human progress never rolls on wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.''

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there is a great outpouring of human generosity taking place in our great country that I must speak about here today. I was honored to be with my friends and colleagues, including the late Senator Coverdell, Representatives MAC COLLINS and SANFORD BISHOP, Columbus Mayor Bobby Peters, Col. Frank Helmick, along with Wayne Anthony of Hands On Columbus and many, many other volunteers, as we embarked on the historic event of initiating the House of Heroes program. This program should serve as a model to communities all across the country to provide needed assistance and support for aging veterans who bravely served their country and their families. 
   It is often said that ``Poor is the nation who has no heroes. Poorer still is the nation which has them but forgets them.'' The House of Heroes project makes sure we don't forget this adage by having volunteers take up shovels, paint brushes and brooms to show not only our veterans, but also their families, that they are not forgotten. This past May at the home of Betty Cook of Columbus, in my state of Georgia, the House of Heroes was inaugurated by federal, military, and local officials to help serve as a reminder to younger generations of Americans how our nation's older men and woman veterans have proudly served and sacrificed for their country to help preserve our freedom. The inauguration ceremony reminded us all that honor, valor, and sacrifice come not only from service members, but from their spouses and family as well. While Mrs. Cook's husband served his country as a medic in World War II, she fought the war at home. She supported their family on her own, while encouraging her husband to press on in battle overseas. Hundreds of thousands of G.I.'s fought for their families, sustained by the love they were getting from home. Victory was never won alone. 
   The House of Heroes program relies on people who volunteer their services to repair and improve the home of a veteran and/or their spouse as an act of appreciation from the Congress of the United States and people of this nation. I am especially proud of those who contributed their time, effort and energy to help bring this project to fruition. It was especially uplifting to have witnessed the hard work that was put into the project. I would like to express my gratitude to each and every volunteer who made this worthy event the great success that it was. 
   I strongly support H. Con. Res. 395 that expresses the sense of the Congress that the House of Heroes project in Columbus, Georgia, should serve as a model for public support for the Nation's veterans and strongly agree with everything this resolution represents. I especially thank Representative MAC COLLINS for introducing this worthy legislation. 
   Today, Columbus, Georgia, remains home to thousands of service members and their families stationed at Ft. Benning and Columbus has always been a critical area for our nation's defenses, both past and present. The initiation of the House of Heroes program proves that from beginning to end, this remarkable city is home to some remarkable people. This event is only the beginning for the House of Heroes program as communities across the nation will begin to undertake their own House of Heroes programs modeled after the great program that the fine people of Columbus started.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today, with my dear friend and wonderful colleague from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS, we come to the fifth and final in our series of floor discussions on the global role of the United States. We will begin with consideration of the key instruments of national security policy, and we will conclude this series with a presentation of what we have learned over the course of these dialogs. 
   The inspiration for the first of today's topics comes from a source we have often cited in this series: The great 19th century military thinker, Karl von Clausewitz, who wrote in his seminal work on war these words:  
   Its dominant tendencies always make war a paradoxical trinity. The passions that are to be kindled in war must already be inherent in the people. The scope which the play of courage and talent will enjoy in the realm of probability and chance depends on the particular character of the commander and the army; but the political aims are the business of government alone. 
   These three tendencies are like three different codes of law, deep rooted in their subject and yet variable in their relationship to one another. A theory that ignores any one of them or seeks to fix an arbitrary relationship between them would conflict with reality to such an extent that for this reason alone, it would be totally useless. 
   Our task, therefore is to develop a theory that maintains a balance between these three tendencies, like an object suspended between three magnets.  
   Attempts to find the proper balance between the roles of the people, the military and the government when America goes to war have been a major feature of the last 35 years, from the Gulf of Tonkin Resolution, to Operation Desert Storm, to Operation Allied Force. In my opinion, it is an effort which has not been overly successful. Certainly in the case of Vietnam, there was no real attempt to mobilize the American public in support of the war effort, nor for the Executive Branch to seek or the Congress to demand that the Constitutional role of the Congress to legitimize the conduct of hostilities be exercised. But I would also contend that much the same pattern is evident in more recent American interventions in the Balkans, and to an only somewhat lesser extent in the Gulf War. 
   The fact that we have emerged from all of these military interventions without major harm--though the negative impact from Vietnam was far from negligible--is a tribute to the efforts of our servicemen and women, the capabilities of our weaponry, but also, I would suggest, the fact that our vital national interests were never threatened in these cases. Only the Cold War, which by and large was prosecuted effectively, both militarily and politically and on a bipartisan basis, and in which we achieved a decisive victory, posed such a threat in the last half century. 
   We have spent much of the time in previous dialogues in discussing the proper ends of American national security policy in the post-Cold War era, but if we don't fix the problems in this ``holy trinity'' of means--the roles of the public, the military and the government--we are going to be continually frustrated in our achievement of whatever objectives we set. 
   Let's start with the first of Clausewitz' trinity: the people. 
   The post-Cold War world is not only producing changes abroad--changes which we have spoken of at some length in our previous global role discussions--but also a number of alterations here at home. Over the past decade or so, we have seen a democratization in terms of our foreign and defense policies in the sense that the American public is less and less disposed to leave these matters to the ``experts,'' and to trust the assurances of the ``Establishment'' with respect to the benefits of internationalism. 
   While there is certainly nothing wrong with such skepticism, and indeed a demand for accountability is a healthy and appropriate attitude for the public to take, whether on national security or any other public policy, this democratization of national security policy has been marked by widespread public disengagement from the details of that policy: 
   For example, a 1997 Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey found that foreign policy and defense ranked last, at 9 percent, among issues cited by the public as the most important matters facing the country. 
   A 1997 Washington Post/Kaiser Foundation/Harvard poll discovered that 64 percent of the American public thought that foreign aid was the largest component of the federal budget, when in fact it is one of the smallest at approximately 1 percent. 
   A 1999 Penn and Schoen survey discovered that nearly half--48 percent--of the American public felt that the U.S. was ``too engaged'' in international problems, while just 16 percent expressed the view that we are ``not engaged enough.'' 
   A 1999 poll for the Program on International Policy Attitudes found that only 28 percent of the American people wanted the U.S. government to promote further globalization while 34 percent wanted our government to try to slow or reverse it, and another 33 percent preferred that we simply allow it to continue at its own pace, as we are doing now. 
   Related to these results, I personally believe that the end of the draft and the dramatic reductions in defense personnel levels in recent years--since FY85 the size of our armed forces decreased by 30 percent--has produced a growing disconnect between the American public and the American military, with fewer and fewer people having relatives or friends in the military, or living in communities in which a military base is a dominant feature of the local economy. This growing separation between the military and civilian worlds has produced a profound impact on the perspectives and performance of the U.S. government when it comes to the use of force, and I will return to this point later. 
   We can bemoan the public's skepticism and disengagement, and wish that it didn't exist, but it is a fact which impacts on all major foreign and defense policy issues facing the Congress. We saw it in the NAFTA debate, and in the debates on Iraq, NATO and the Balkans. 
   Now, I believe that the critics of foreign trade and foreign engagement raise important and legitimate concerns which need to be addressed. I do not believe we can stand behind platitudes that ``foreign trade is always good,'' or ``U.S. leadership is always essential.'' In my view, the burden is now on those who would urge engagement overseas, whether military, political or economic. As the just discussed public opinion data indicate, they have their work cut out for them, with widespread indifference, lack of knowledge and doubt about the value of such engagement. However, it is a debate worth having, and indeed is essential if we are to achieve the kind of national consensus we need in this post-Cold War era. 
   The second of the war-making trinity of Clausewitz is the military itself. Lets talk about the military. The subject of military reform is a fascinating and important one in its own right, but is somewhat beyond the scope of our dialogues on the U.S. global role. However, I would like to touch on a few areas in which the specific needs of our Armed Forces, and the perspectives of and about the American military have a direct bearing on our role as policy-makers. 
   As perhaps the leading military analyst of the Vietnam War, Colonel Harry Summers, wrote in his excellent book On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Context:  
   Prior to any future commitment of U.S. military forces our military leaders must insist that the civilian leadership provide tangible, obtainable 
   political goals. The political objective cannot merely be a platitude but must be stated in concrete terms. While such objectives may very well change during the course of the war, it is essential that we begin with an understanding of where we intend to go. I couldn't have said it better. As Clausewitz said, we should not ``take the first step without considering the last .....'' There is an inherent contradiction between the military and its civilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and international political purposes the civilian leaders want maximum flexibility and maneuverability and are hesitant to fix on firm objectives. The military on the other hand  need just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to plan and conduct military operations. That is according to Harry Summers. 
   Mr. President, I know all too well the kind of price that is paid by our men and women in uniform when our political leaders fail to lay out clear and specific objectives. More than thirty years ago, in Vietnam we lacked clear and specific objectives. We attempted to use our military to impose our will in a region far from our shores and, in my view, far from our vital national interests, and without ever fully engaging the Congress or the American people in the process. The result was a conflict where the politicians failed to provide clear political objectives and where our policy was never fully understood or fully supported by the American people. From what I have seen since I came to this distinguished body in 1997, we have made very little progress on any of these fronts in the years since that time when it comes to America going to war. 
   The trend discussed earlier of a growing disconnect between the military and civilians has been perhaps even more pronounced among national foreign and defense policy-makers. A groundbreaking recent study, organized by the North Carolina Triangle Institute for Security Studies and entitled ``Project on the Gap Between Military and Civilian Society,'' made a number of major findings relevant to our discussion today. Let me quote from the Project's Digest of Findings and Studies:  
   Americans in the national political elite are increasingly losing a personal connection to the military. For the first 75 years of the 20th Century, there was a significant ``veteran's advantage'' in American politics: always a higher percentage of veterans in Congress than in the comparable age cohort in the general population. This veteran's advantage has eroded over the past twenty-five years in both chambers of Congress and across both parties. Beginning in the mid-1990s, there has been a lower percentage of veterans in the Senate and the House of Representatives than in the comparable cohort in the population at large ..... Compared to historical trends, military veterans seem now to be under-represented in the national political elite.  
   This particular growing disconnection is having a major impact on the central topic of our global role dialogues. To quote again from the Triangle Institute report:  
   The presence of veterans in the national political elite has a profound effect on the use of force in American foreign policy. At least since 1816, there has been a very durable pattern in U.S. behavior: the more veterans in the national political elite, the less likely the United States is to initiate the use of force in the international arena. The effect is statistically stronger than many other factors known to influence the use of force ..... The trend of a declining rate of veterans in the national political elite may suggest a continued high rate of military involvement in conflicts in the coming years.  
   I find that statistic astounding. 
   One part of the Triangle Institute study, titled ``The Civilian-Military Gap and the American Use of Force 1816-1992,'' found:  
   two broad clusters of opinion that track with military experience, yielding what we call civilian hawks and military doves.  
   Specifically, this particular survey discovered that civilian leaders are more willing to use force but more likely to want to impose restrictions on the level of force to be used, and more supportive of human rights objectives, while military leaders are more reluctant to use force but prefer fewer restrictions on what level of force to employ, and tend to support more traditional ``Realpolitik'' objectives for U.S. foreign policy. Fascinating. Interestingly, civilian leaders with prior military experience were found to hold views closer to the military rather than civilian leadership. 
   In other words, those who have seen the face of battle are more reticent about resorting to force than those who have not. This does not mean they--I should say we--are necessarily right in any particular case, but it should certainly give ``civilian hawks'' some pause in considering recourse to an instrument whose chief practitioners are wary of utilizing. Above all, as was the case with the government needing to engage the public far more effectively on questions of foreign policy, so must the military and the government--including the Congress --more effectively engage each other if we are ever going to achieve the kind of balance which Clausewitz wrote of. 
   This leads me to the third and final piece of the Clausewitz trinity: the government. As I noted earlier, Colonel Summers emphasized that military leaders must insist that the civilian leadership provide tangible, obtainable political goals. In this country, that duty rests squarely on the shoulders of the President and Congress when it comes to the business of war, as outlined by our Founding Fathers when they drafted our Constitution. 
   Under the Constitution, war powers are divided. Article I, Section 8, gives Congress the power to declare war and raise and support the armed forces, while Article II, Section 2 declares the President to be Commander in Chief. With this division of authority there has also been constant disagreement, not only between the executive and legislative branches, but between individual members of Congress as well, as we have seen in our most recent debates on authorizing the intervention in Kosovo and on the Byrd-Warner amendment concerning current funding of that very operation, dare I say war. Judging by the text of the Constitution and the debate that went into its drafting, however, members of Congress have a right, and I would say an obligation, to play a key role in the making of war and in determination of the proper use of our armed forces, which has brought Senator PAT ROBERTS and me to this floor, shoulder to shoulder, to see if we can't further articulate and work out a consensus on how do we commit American forces abroad. 
   It is generally agreed that the Commander in Chief role gives the President power to repel attacks against the United States and makes him responsible for leading the armed forces. During the Korean and Vietnam conflicts, however, this country found itself involved for many years in undeclared wars. Many members of Congress became concerned with the erosion of congressional authority to decide when the United States should become involved in a war or should use our armed forces in situations that might lead to war. 
   On November 7, 1973, the Congress passed the War Powers Resolution over the veto of President Nixon. As Dante Fascell, former Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs noted:  
   The importance of this law cannot be discounted. Simply stated, the War Powers Resolution seeks to restore the balance created in the Constitution between the President and Congress on questions of peace and war. It stipulates the constitutional directions that the President and Congress should be partners in such vital questions--to act together, not in separate ways.  
   The War Powers Resolution has two key requirements. Section 4(a) requires the President to submit a report to Congress within forty-eight hours whenever troops are introduced into hostilities or situations where imminent involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances. Section 5(b) then stipulates that if U.S. armed forces have been sent into situations of actual or imminent hostilities the President must remove the troops within sixty days--ninety days if he requests a delay--unless Congress declares war or otherwise authorizes the use of force. The resolution also provides that Congress can compel the President to withdraw the troops at any time by passing a joint resolution. It is important to note, however, that since the adoption of the War Powers Resolution, every President has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by the Congress on the President's authority as Commander-in-Chief, and the courts have not directly addressed this vital question. 
   I would submit that although the Congress tried to reassert itself after the Vietnam War with the enactment of the War Powers Resolution, we have continued to be a timid, sometimes non-existent player in the government that Clausewitz emphasized must play a vital role in creating the balance necessary for an effective war-making effort. Since I came to the Senate, it has been my observation that the current system by which the Executive and Legislative Branches discharge their respective Constitutional duties in committing American servicemen and women into harm's way has become inadequate. Congress continually lacks sufficient and timely information as to policy objectives and means prior to the commitment of American forces. And then, in my opinion, Congress largely abdicates its responsibilities  for declaring war and controlling the purse with inadequate and ill-timed consideration of operations. 
   Perhaps this failure has been a long time in the making. My dear friend and colleague Senator BYRD so eloquently stated in an earlier address to this body on the history of the Senate,  
   We remember December 7, 1941, as a day of infamy. We mourn the hundreds of American servicemen who died at Pearl Harbor, and the thousands who gave their lives in the war that followed. We might also mourn the abrupt ending of the debate over American foreign policy. While history proved President Roosevelt and his followers more correct than their isolationist opponents, it also buried for decades the warnings of the isolationists that the United States should not aspire to police the world, nor should it intervene at will in the affairs of other nations in this hemisphere or elsewhere.  
   A very wise statement by Senator BYRD. 
   Reasons for the failure of the War Powers Resolution and for our current difficulties abound. I believe that part of our problem stems from the disputed and uncertain role of the War Powers Resolution of 1973 in governing the conduct of the President, as well as the Congress, with respect to the introduction of American forces into hostile situations. Once again, these disputes continue to resound between both the branches and individual members of the legislative branch. 
   In all honesty, however, the realities of our government highlight the fact that while the legislature can urge, request, and demand that the President consult with members of Congress on decisions to use force, it cannot compel him to follow any of the advice that it might care to offer. 
   With that in mind, as an institution, Congress can do no more than give or withhold its permission to use force. And while this ``use it or lose it'' quality of congressional authorizations may make many members leery about acting on a crisis too soon, delays will virtually guarantee, as Senator Arthur Vandenberg once stated, that crises will ``never reach Congress until they have developed to a point where congressional discretion is pathetically restricted.'' 
   What a great quote. I felt that certainly as I tried to vote properly in this Chamber months ago in regard to Milosevic and his intervention in Kosovo. 
   Mr. President, I believe that in view of our obligations to the national interest, to the Constitution and to the young American servicemen and women whose very lives are at stake whether it be a ``contingency operation'' or a full-scale war, neither the executive or legislative branches should be satisfied with the current situation which results in uncertain signals to the American people, to overseas friends and foes, and to our armed forces personnel. In making our decision to authorize military action, Congress should work to elicit all advice and information from the President on down to the battlefield commanders, make a sound decision based on this information, and then leave battlefield management in the hands of those competent and qualified to carry out such a task. Only then will the proper roles and balance of the triad Clausewitz spoke of be obtained. And only then will our decisions to commit troops be based on the principles we spoke of in our earlier dialogs: (1) a vital national interest, (2) with clear national policy and objectives, and (3) with a well-defined exit strategy. As Senator Mansfield once stressed,  
   In moments of crisis, at least, the President and the Congress cannot be adversaries; they must be allies who together, must delineate the path to guide the nation's massive machinery of government in a fashion which serves the interests of the people and is acceptable to the people.  
   Beautifully said. 
   In light of the problems and issues just discussed, I would like to take a moment to discuss S. 2851, a bill I recently introduced with Senators ROBERTS and JEFFORDS, which seeks to find a more workable system for Presidential and congressional interaction on the commitment of American forces into combat situations. It is a bill derived from the current system for Presidential approval and reporting to Congress on covert operations, a system which was established by Public Law 102-88 in 1991. By most accounts, this system has been accepted by both branches and has worked very well with respect to covert operations, producing both better decisionmaking in the executive branch and improved congressional input and oversight with respect to these operations. Since overt troop deployments into hostilities almost certainly constitute a greater risk to American interests and to American lives, I believe such a system represents the very least we should do to improve the approval and oversight process with respect to overt military operations. It does not bind or limit the executive branch or military, but seeks to build upon the principles we have covered throughout our global roles dialog. 
   Precisely because the United States is a democracy, it is important that policy decisions be made democratically. As Michael Walzer observes in his article ``Deterrence and Democracy'': ``The test of a democracy is not that the right side wins the political battle, but that there is a political battle.'' Policies that pass through public debate and inspection emerge all the stronger for it, because they enjoy greater respect both at home and abroad. Instead of seeing executive-legislative conflict over foreign policy as a cause for dismay, we should recognize that healthy democracies argue over the wisdom of policies. Debate is what, ultimately, produces better policy. And this is precisely the role of the government, both the President and Congress, in fulfilling our constitutional duties and achieving the proper balance of the Clausewitz trilogy. 
   I believe the case has clearly been made that the public, the military, and the government--the three under-Ðpinnings of successful national security policy--are not now in proper ``balance,'' to use Clausewitz' term. Each part of this trinity is skeptical and increasingly disengaged from the other two, with a number of significant and negative effects on our 
   national interest which we have discussed today and in previous dialogs: a widening divide between the aspirations of American foreign policy-makers and the Congress' and the public's willingness to finance the necessary means is one such point; a military and civilian leadership which sees America's role in the world and the means appropriate to secure those ends in vastly different terms; a national government which is deeply divided along partisan lines and between the executive and legislative branches. 
   I suggest the chief responsibility for fixing this dysfunctional system lies squarely with us in the government. As Clausewitz said, ``the political aims are the business of government alone,'' and it is the political aims which drive, or at least should drive, both military requirements and the public's engagement, or disengagement, from American policy. We must find more and better ways of communicating with our constituents on the realities of our national interests and the real costs of securing them. We must find more and better ways to increase the exchange of experiences and ideas between the government and the military. And we must find more and better ways of ensuring that both the executive and legislative branches properly fulfill their constitutional responsibilities in the arena of national security policy. 
   Professor of Strategic Studies at Johns Hopkins University Eliot Cohen closed his paper on ``The Unequal Dialogue: The Civil-Military Gap and the Use of Force,'' which is a very interesting series of case studies on effective, and ineffective, civilian and military interaction during wartime, with these observations, which are extremely relevant to our discussion today:  
   (The lessons of serious conflict) are, above all, that political leaders must immerse themselves in the conduct of war no less than they do in great projects of domestic legislation; that they must master their military briefs as thoroughly as they do their civilian ones; that they must demand and expect from their military subordinates a candor as bruising as it is necessary; that both groups must expect a running conversation in which, although civilian opinion will not dictate, it must dominate; that that conversation will include not only ends and policies, but ways and means.  
   In other words, we in Government, the constitutionally established political leaders, must step up to the plate and do our jobs when it comes to national security policy--especially when it comes to making war--with great humility as to our own limitations, with great care and forethought, but with diligence and determination.  
   Mr. President, it is my honor and distinct personal privilege to yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. ROBERTS, for further remarks.

   Mr. CLELAND. I thank Senator ROBERTS for that wonderful presentation. 
   We have reached several conclusions in this year-long dialog regarding America's global role. Before I get to some of the conclusions, may I say a special thank-you to my key staff members. Mr. Bill Johnstone, who has been the absolute force behind my remarks and has helped my thought process for a number of years as we have discussed American foreign policy issues, a special thanks goes to him. A special thanks also to Tricia Heller of my staff, and Andy Vanlandingham; they have been invaluable in helping me form some of my conclusions about America's global role in the world. 
   I thank very much my dear friend from Kansas. It is an honor to be with him, continuing our dialog on America's role in the world in the 21st century, particularly in terms of military commitments, our footprint around the world, so to speak, and its rationale. It is a pleasure to stand shoulder to shoulder with him in a bipartisan way, to see if we can't find a consensus that might lead us well into the 21st century in terms of our foreign policy. 
   Mr. President, when Senator ROBERTS and I embarked on this series of Global Role Dialogues back in February, we set as our goal the initiation of a serious debate in this great institution of the United States Senate on the proper role of our country in the post-cold war world. We both believed--and continue to believe--that such a process is absolutely necessary if we are to arrive at the bipartisan consensus on national security policy which our Nation so badly needs, but has been lacking since the fall of the Soviet Union. While the vagaries of Senators' schedules have unfortunately limited somewhat our ability to involve more Senators in this process, I want to thank Senators HUTCHISON, HAGEL, LUGAR and LEVIN who all made important contributions to these discussions. Senator ROBERTS and I will be exploring ways in which we can broaden this dialogue in the next Congress. 
   When we began our discussions we also indicated that we had far more questions than definitive answers. And while we cannot claim to have found any magic solutions or panaceas for the challenges facing the United States on the global scene as we approach the end of the Twentieth Century, I believe I can speak for Senator ROBERTS when I say that we believe we have learned much from the writings and statements of many, many others, in this country and abroad, who have thoughtfully considered these questions we have been examining. 
   We have drawn heavily on the work of such entities as the Commission on America's National Interests--on which Senator ROBERTS serves with distinction--, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century, and the ODC's America's National Interests in Multilateral Engagement: A Bipartisan Dialogue. We have consulted the work of a large number of academics, and governmental, military and opinion leaders from around the world. And, for myself, I have certainly learned a great deal from my friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Kansas. 
   While what we are about to say is far from complete and very much a work in progress, we believe it is only fair to provide the Senate--which has indulged us with many hours of floor time to pursue this project--and to those who have followed our efforts with interest and encouragement to lay out the lessons we have learned and some general principles which we believe should guide our national security policies in the years ahead. 
   At this point, I yield again to my partner in these dialogues, Senator PAT ROBERTS of Kansas, but first I want to thank him for all of his help in this undertaking. His experience, his good humor and his wisdom have made our dialogues both instructive and extremely enjoyable. I yield to Senator ROBERTS.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, these are not the ``seven deadly sins,'' but I think in many ways it is a sin if we violate these basic fundamental lessons that we have learned. 
   First and foremost, we believe as a nation--including government, media, academia, personalities, and other leaders--we need to engage in a serious and sustained national dialog to do  several things: First, define our national interests and differentiate the level of interest involved, spell out what we should be prepared to do in defense of those interests; second, build a bipartisan consensus in support of the resulting set of interests and policies. 
   As a starting point, within the Senate, we would encourage the Foreign Relations Committee and our own Armed Services Committee upon which we both sit to hold hearings on the finished products of the Commission on America's National Interests, the U.S. Commission on National Security/21st Century and other relevant considerations of these critical topics. 
   I yield to the Senator from Kansas.

   Mr. CLELAND. Third, the President and the Congress need to urgently address the mismatch between our foreign policy ends and means, and between commitments and forces by: 
   Determining the most appropriate instrument--diplomatic, military, or other--for securing policy objectives; 
   Reviewing carefully current American commitments--especially those involving troop deployments--including the clarity of objectives, and the 
   presence of an exit strategy; and 
   Increasing the relatively small amount of resources devoted to the key instruments for securing our national interests--all of which can be supported by the American public, as detailed in ``The Foreign Policy Gap: How Policymakers Misread the Public'' from the University of Maryland's Center for International and Security Studies. 
   These include: 
   Armed Forces--which need to be reformed to meet the requirements of the 21st Century; 
   Diplomatic Forces; 
   Foreign Assistance; 
   United Nations Peacekeeping Operations--which also need to be reformed to become much more effective; 
   Key Regional Organizations--including NATO, the Organization of American States, the Organization for African Unity and the Association of South East Asian Nations. 
   I again yield to Senator ROBERTS.

   Mr. CLELAND. Fifth, with respect to multilateral organizations, the United States should: 
   More carefully consider NATO's new Strategic Concept, and the future direction of this, our most important international commitment; Press for reform of the UN's and Security Council's peacekeeping operations and decisionmaking processes; Fully support efforts to strengthen the capabilities of regional organizations 
   including the European Union, the Organization of American States, the Organization for African Unity, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations--to deal with threats to regional security; and 
   Promote a thorough debate, at the UN and elsewhere, on proposed standards for interventions within sovereign states. 
   I yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas.

   Mr. CLELAND. Beautifully said. I could not have said it better, nor concur more. 
   Finally, the United States can, and must, continue to exercise international leadership, while following a policy of realistic restraint in the use of military forces in particular, by: 
   Pursuing policies that promote a strong and growing economy, which is the essential underpinning of any nation's strength; maintaining superior, ready and mobile armed forces, capable of rapidly responding to threats to our national interests; strengthening the non-military tools discussed above for securing our national interests; and making a long-term commitment to promoting democracy abroad via a comprehensive, sustained program which makes a realistic assessment of the capabilities of such a program as described by Thomas Carothers in his  excellent primer on ``Aiding Democracy Abroad: The Learning Curve''. 
   I hope it is very clear that Senator ROBERTS and I are not advocating a retreat from America's global leadership role, and are not advocating a new form of isolationism. We both believe our country has substantial and inescapable self-interests which necessitate our leadership. However, when it comes to the way we exercise that leadership, especially when it involves military force, we do believe that our national interests sometimes require that we use restraint. The alternatives--whether a unilateralism which imposes direct resource costs far beyond what the Congress or the American people have shown a willingness to finance or an isolationism which would fail to secure our national interests in this increasingly interconnected world--are, in our judgment, unacceptable. 
   Over the course of these dialogues, Senator ROBERTS and I have both turned to the following words from the editor of the publication National Interest, Owen Harries:  
   I advocate restraint because every dominant power in the last four centuries that has not practiced it--that has been excessively intrusive and demanding--has ultimately been confronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans may believe that their country, being exceptional, need have no worries in this respect. I do not agree. It is not what Americans think of the United States but what others think of it that will decide the matter.  
   On his desk at the Pentagon when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell kept a quote from the great Athenian historian Thucydides:  
   Of all manifestations of power, restraint impresses men most.  
   With great thanks to my distinguished colleague, Senator ROBERTS, and to the Senate, I conclude these dialogs on the global role of the United States. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Illinois for yielding to me for the purpose of discussing the ambiguous situation in which we find ourselves in terms of the budget process and the appropriations process. 
   I thank the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, for his continuing efforts to remind Members of this Chamber of our responsibilities to this institution but, more importantly, responsibilities to the American people. 
   Today Senator BYRD is causing us to step back and reflect on what we are now doing with respect to the appropriations process. It brings back a comment I like from Winston Churchill: How do you know where you are going unless you know where you have been? 
   Senator BYRD reminds us where we have been in the appropriations process, our history, our tradition, and the rules of the Senate. He is very fearful of where we are going in that process, and so am I. 
   As a Senator now for 3 1/2 years, I am certainly not nearly as well versed as Senator BYRD in the history or the precedents of the Senate. I would like to add that I believe all other Senators, of whatever level of experience and of both parties, acknowledge his leadership in this respect. Nonetheless, from what I have read and heard in this debate, in the first budget and appropriations cycle of the 21st century, the Senate has moved in a new and deeply troubling direction. 
   I am certainly aware that on occasion the Senate has been compelled by necessity to resort to bypassing the regular process of committee action for consideration and amendment, conference action, and then final approval, final passage, of individual authorization and appropriations measures. 
   Indeed, I voted for the massive omnibus measure with which we concluded the 1998 session. That single bill totaled a whopping $487 billion and funded 8 out of the 13 regular appropriations bills. I think Senator BYRD himself said on that occasion, ``God only knows what's in it.'' Most of us didn't. 
   However, even on that occasion, the Senate actually took up separately and passed 10 of the 13 bills and considered 1 other bill--namely, Interior appropriations--while only 2 appropriations measures, the Labor-HHS-Education bill and the relatively small District of Columbia bill, were acted on in conference without any previous Senate floor action. 
   By contrast, this year the number of appropriations measures which are apparently headed for conference action without affording the full Senate an opportunity to work its will has grown to three: Commerce-Justice-State, Treasury-Postal, and VA-HUD. Not only is this trend disturbing, but apparently a determination was made fairly early on that these measures would somehow not require regular floor consideration. 
   I have heard many theories as to why this will be so, including fears of hard votes, difficult votes, or of obstructionist tactics. But I have yet to learn of any real justification or defense of the notion that the Senate has discretion as to whether or not it will consider appropriations bills--the means through which we are supposed to discharge perhaps the ultimate congressional authority under the Constitution, the power of the purse.  
   If we in the Senate are not authorized or able to have an impact on appropriations bills, we have what the American Revolution ostensibly was all about: taxation without representation. 
   I have the great privilege of representing the 7.5 million people in the State of Georgia, the 10th most populous State in America. Georgia hasn't had a representative on the Senate Appropriations Committee since 1992. And while the 28 members of that committee, representing 27 States, with Washington being fortunate to have 2 seats, do a good job of considering national needs and local interests, they cannot be expected to know the priorities and interests of the people of Georgia. 
   As the Senate was envisioned by the founders and as it has operated throughout our history, the absence of State representation on the Appropriations Committee was not an insurmountable burden. Nonappropriators could expect to have the opportunity to represent their constituents' interests when the 13 appropriations bills came to the Senate floor were open to debate and amendment. Indeed, in my first 3 years in the Senate, I often had recourse to offering floor amendments or entering into colloquies on behalf of Georgia--Georgia priorities and Georgia people. But with the apparent move to routinely bypassing the floor, what am I or, more importantly, my constituents to do? 
   In looking at the fiscal year 2001 bills, which apparently will not come to the Senate floor in amendable form, the potential adverse impact on my State is clear. For example, the Commerce bill funds key Georgia law enforcement efforts, including the Georgia Crime Lab and technology enhancement for local law enforcement agencies, such as the Macon Police Department. The Treasury bill contains the budget for the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Glynn County, GA. 
   And the Veterans' Administration appropriations measure covers the national veterans cemetery for north Georgia that I got authorized last year. For all of these and more, the Georgia Senators will now apparently have no direct role. 
   This is not the way it should be, under the Constitution, or the way we ought to act under the traditions of the Senate. More and more of the most important decisions affecting our constituents and their communities are being moved off the floor of the Senate and into closed-door deliberations involving a small number of negotiators where the people of my State are left out and where my only choice as their representative is a single take-it-or-leave-it vote on a massive and unfathomable package. This is taxation without representation. 
   Mr. President, I understand that in an election year--especially this one--it is always a challenge to have the Senate get its business done on time. But when ``business as usual'' starts becoming a process where the Senate routinely doesn't get to work its will, something fundamental has been lost. Then, we had better worry not just about the interests and constituents of today, but the precedents and legacies we are leaving for future Senates and future generations of Americans. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great personal joy and pride that I come before you today to commemorate an anniversary that is of particular importance to my family and me. One hundred years ago, on October 13, 1900, in a borrowed school building at the intersection of McDaniel and Rockland Roads, sixteen original members of the Turner Hill Baptist Church convened for the first time. 
   The group enjoyed being together and quickly became a strong extended family. In fact, within months of their first meeting at the Old County Line School, the members decided to cement their closeness by constructing a permanent church building of their own. On land donated by E.L. Turner and as a result of its members' ingenuity and hard work, the beginning of 1901 marked the opening of Turner Hill Baptist Church, a wooden structure heated by one wood stove and lit by kerosene lamps. 
   Although the congregation moved to a new brick structure in 1954, the original wooden building and the work that went into its creation continue to embody the values of all those associated with the church. Despite the absence of Turner Hill's original sixteen members at today's centennial celebration, many of their descendants are delighted to take part. By the same token, some of the original nine families, including my own, who were present as the church opened in 1901 continue to attend regular services: Turner Hill has both fifth and sixth generation members. I am also proud to be related to both the church's current youngest and oldest members. While my father, Mr. Joseph Hugh Cleland, and Aunt, Mrs. Georgia Mae Cleland Johnston, are Turner Hill's most senior members, my cousin, Miss Jessica Wages is the newest addition to the 151 member congregation. 
   Over the years, the church itself and the faces in the pews have changed, but one thing has remained a constant--community. My friends and family at Turner Hill have pulled together in times of crisis and joined each other in celebration throughout the years. Behind the leadership of Reverend Farrell Wilkins and with God and family at the center of their lives, the members of my church today commemorate an historic anniversary. May their next hundred years be as prosperous as their first.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, with a focus on the horizon and a knowledge of where we've been, I come before you today to laud a group that has dedicated its time and resources to Georgia's youth in attempts to secure a brighter future for us all. Throughout its existence, The Georgia Early Learning Initiative, a collaboration of business and labor leaders, health and human service providers, educators, and legislators, has sought to increase access to, and funding for, early education throughout our state. 
   As a reflection of today's fast-paced society, households increasingly boast two working parents who can neither afford to miss work nor pay the often exorbitant cost of childcare in our country. In fact, while only forty percent of children are cared for by a parent all day, sixty-seven percent of Georgia mothers with children under age six are in the workforce. Increasingly, many parents want to stay home, yet have no choice but to work. However, it takes a dedicated and selfless group of people to bring about results; there is no greater champion of Georgia's children and investment in the future than The Georgia Early Learning Initiative. 
   A child's pre-school years are more important than we have previously acknowledged. With 554,430 Georgia children currently enrolled in preschool, and the knowledge that ninety percent of human brain functions develop during the first three years of life, early learning and improved childcare are perhaps more important than ever before. It is our responsibility as a nation and leaders to support activists who are willing to fight for worthy causes, especially when those causes will benefit generations to come. We owe it to our children to provide equal access to early learning options which will place them on a secure footing and will allow them to excel in life. It is the mission of the dedicated men and women who comprise the Georgia Early Learning Initiative to increase childcare choices for parents and to extend the opportunity to succeed to all of America's children, no matter what their family's station in life. In the future, we will only be as strong as our children. As Pearl Buck said, ``If our American way of life fails the child, it fails us all.'' 
   As I think back to where we have been and once again focus on the glorious horizon, I cannot help but feel optimistic about our future knowing that men and women like those working with the Georgia Early Learning Initiative continue to fight for a better tomorrow for all of our children.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one thing behind the growth of the American economy is our educational system. There is good news and bad news about our educational system today. 
   In a climate that currently seems filled with more dissent than accord, I think we can at least agree that elected officials on both sides of the aisle are in lockstep with the American people on the importance of education: It is a priority so critical that it should be at the top of our national agenda. This is a view very similar to the opinion held by President Lincoln almost 150 years ago. ``Upon the subject of education,'' Lincoln said, ``not presuming to dictate any plan or system respecting it, I can only say that I view it as the most important subject which we, as a people, can be engaged in.'' 
   Education's priority having been espoused by both sides during this Congress, it is profoundly disappointing that S. 2, the critically important legislation to reauthorize the landmark Elementary and Education Act, appears to be dead for this year. What a shame. It is apparent from the earlier floor debate on S. 2 that agreement breaks down on the condition of America's educational system today and on the course we should pursue to improve our schools. 
   Seventeen years ago our country was rocked by the publication of ``A Nation at Risk.'' The findings were devastating: Our educational system was  being ``eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our future as a nation and a people.'' 
   That landmark report went on to say that if ``an unfriendly foreign power'' had tried to impose on America our ``mediocre educational performance,'' we might well have viewed it ``as an act of war.'' 
   I have listened to some of my colleagues maintain that nothing has changed in the last 17 years--that American education continues on a downward spiral. They claim that the federal government's role in education is a source of national shame. Barring a radical change in course, they say, America's report card will continue to be a document of failure. 
   Mr. President, I agree that there is compelling need for improvement. In fact, if you ask the companies in the high-tech world in my State and around America, they know that some 300,000 to 400,000 high-tech jobs out there in this economy today are going begging for want of educated and talented people. 
   Every day in America almost 2,800 high school students drop out. This is not acceptable. Each school year, more than 45,000 under-prepared teachers, teachers who have not even been trained in the subjects they are teaching, enter the classroom. Who here among us believes this to be acceptable? Here in America fourteen million children attend schools in need of extensive repair or replacement. Who in this body would argue that we have to do better? As a nation we have witnessed school shootings--classroom tragedies which were unheard of 20 years ago. Who here would not do everything in their power to restore safety and sanity to America's schools? 
   But, Mr. President, I would argue that this is only part of the picture. ``A Nation at Risk'' was a wake-up call. Educators, parents, businesses, community leaders, and officials at all levels of government responded. Yes, serious problems still exist, but so do success stories. America's dropout rate is down--from 14 percent in 1982 to single digits today, including in many of our toughest neighborhoods. In my own State of Georgia, over 70 percent of high school students 
   now graduate, a marked improvement over the 52 percent graduation rate in 1980. In 1950, only 5 percent of Georgians held college degrees. Now over one in five--22 percent--do. 
   And there's more good news. Nationally SAT and Advanced Placement test scores are up. Performance on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, NAEP, has increased, particularly in the key subjects of reading, mathematics, and science--with African American and Hispanic students making significant gains in both math and science. 
   Just consider: From 1994 to 1998, average reading scores increased at all three grades tested (4, 8, and 12). The average math score is at its highest level in 26 years. And let us not forget that this progress is happening during a time when many states and school districts are raising standards and putting in place tough graduation requirements. This progress is happening during a time when U.S. students are taking more rigorous courses than ever. By 1994, 52 percent of high school graduates had taken the core subjects recommended by ``A Nation at Risk,'' almost quadruple the 1982 number. 
   To those who over the last 20 years have uttered doomsday predictions about our failing schools, let me say that parents in this country, in overwhelming numbers, continue to send their children to public schools. In fact, ninety percent of children in the K-12 age group attend public schools. That's nine out of every ten children in this country. When America's school bell rang this September, over 53 million students returned to class, a record school enrollment. What's more, surveys show that most parents think their own child's public school is doing a pretty good job. It's other people's schools they fear are failing. 
   Mark Twain once said, ``Get your facts first, and then you can distort them as much as you please.'' The facts, I believe, bear out that we have made progress since the publication of ``A Nation at Risk.'' The facts also bear out that many of our education challenges continue to go unmet. In a survey on education issues conducted this past March, Americans were asked to list the major problems facing our public schools today. ``Lack of parental involvement'' topped the list, followed closely by ``undisciplined students.'' The majority of respondents also cited ``lack of retention of good teachers,'' ``overcrowded classrooms,'' ``lack of academic standards for promotion/graduation,'' ``lack of teachers qualified to teach in their subject area,'' and ``outdated schools'' as issues meriting our nation's attention. 
   It all boils down to this central issue: Do we stay the course or do we reshape, dramatically, the federal government's role in education? I believe strongly that we should increase our federal investment in public schools, for surely the education of America's children is a vital national interest. I also believe that we should continue to work with the states and local school districts--who are now and who should and will remain the major education decision-makers in this country--to ensure that those federal dollars are spent on initiatives that aim to fix the specific problems in our schools which are causing the American people so much concern. 
   We need to be willing to invest the nation's dollars into improving the recruitment, retention, and professional development of our nation's teachers. What teachers know and can do is the single most important influence on what students learn, according to the National Commission for Teaching and America's Future Teachers. 
   In the American educational system, it falls to our States and local communities to set high educational standards and provide quality education so that all children can achieve to standards of excellence. While the federal government's precise role in education is open to debate, I believe it is unquestionably in our national interest for federal officials to work in cooperation with States and localities to promote educational excellence and to encourage standards-based reform. 
   We should work to ensure that parents have information on teacher qualifications and achievement levels at their child's school. One important way to improve our schools is to enable parents to hold schools accountable for progress and to give them choices they can exercise if progress does not occur. 
   Research has shown that class size directly relates to the quality of education. Students in smaller classes consistently outperform students in larger classes on tests, are more likely to graduate on time, stay in school, enroll in honors classes, and graduate in the top ten percent of their class. We need to help local school districts recruit, hire and train 100,000 qualified teachers to reduce class sizes in the early grades. It is an investment in reducing teacher turnover and in improving student performance. 
   Research also links student achievement and conduct to the condition of their schools. Yet fourteen million children in the U.S. attend schools in need of extensive repair or replacement. In my own State of Georgia, nearly two-thirds of our schools--62 percent--report a need to upgrade or repair their buildings. We need to help local communities from Savannah to San Antonio to Seattle rebuild, modernize and reduce overcrowding in more than 6,000 of America's public schools. 
   There is consensus in every borough, town and city throughout this country that bloodshed in our schools cannot and will not be tolerated. Yet every day five million children are left to care for themselves in the hours before and after school. We know that these are the very hours that children are most likely to participate in risky behavior. In fact, almost half of all violent juvenile crime takes place between the hours of 3 and 8 p.m. We need to help our communities reduce juvenile crime by investing more dollars in after-school care. We need to expand the popular 21st Century Learning Centers Program to ensure that 1 million children each year--up from the current 190,000--will have access to safe and constructive after-school tutoring, recreation, and academic enrichment. 
   Mr. President, I maintain that there is no more powerful--and empowering--force in the universe than education. ``On education all our lives depend,'' said Benjamin Franklin. And Christa McAuliffe, selected to be the first schoolteacher to travel in space, described simply but poetically the  awesome potential of her vocation: ``I touch the future,'' she said. ``I teach.'' While we may bring to the debate on education differing views, it is my hope that we ultimately remember this is a profoundly important issue which should be above politics and ideology. It is all about the future of this country--and the future, after all, is in very small hands.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I applaud the distinguished Senator from Maine, Ms. COLLINS, for her gargantuan effort to tackle the Byzantine aspects of the U.S. Tax Code to see if there is some way we can assist our venture capitalists to help our small businesses, particularly our high-tech small business more. 
   It is a pleasure to work with Senator COLLINS, not only in this endeavor but in other endeavors. We serve together on the Government Affairs Committee. One of our responsibilities is oversight of the Securities and Exchange Commission which looks at the world of investments in businesses in this country. I applaud her for her insight, for her innovation in this area, she is right on target. I am pleased to associate myself with her remarks today and pleased to cosponsor the legislation of which she speaks. 
   On that point, in terms of being relevant to what is driving the American economy, not only in my home State of Georgia, particularly in Atlanta, where more and more high-tech businesses are located, but in Silicon Valley, where I just got back from a tour in early August, it is obvious that we are generating a lot of talented young minds in America with great ideas and that those young minds can form together, and with the right capital at the right time can generate businesses that literally were unknown or unheard of just months ago. We see those kind of successes now driving the American economy. Information technology economies now provide the leading edge for American economic growth and our prosperity. I couldn't agree more with the Senator from Maine. We will do everything in our power to assist this legislation and move it forward.

   Mr. CLELAND. Madam President, on April 11, 2000 the Senate Commerce Committee held a hearing regarding the impact of China's accession to the World Trade Organization, WTO, on the American economy. This was a fascinating meeting that covered a wide range of topics from trade deficits and tariff barriers to national security and human rights. After participating in this hearing, and after months of meetings and speaking with Georgia farmers, small business owners, and workers, as well as conferring with national security experts, I have concluded that, on balance, establishing Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China--which is necessary for the U.S. to obtain the trade concessions made by China in order to gain entry into the WTO--is in the best interest of both our national security and our economic security. Therefore, I plan to support the PNTR legislation that passed the House in May. 
   In the April hearing, General Brent Scowcroft, the former National Security Advisor to President Bush, stated that granting PNTR to China would be, ``very much in the interest of the United States. This, in my judgement goes far beyond American business and economic interests, important as these are, to key political and security issues.'' Mr. President, I have just returned from a trip to Japan and Korea where the issue of China PNTR as it pertains to our national security, while not the purpose of my trip, was an important topic of discussion with some of our key allies in the region as well as some of the U.S. military's finest leaders including Admiral Dennis Blair and General Thomas Schwartz--the Commander in Chief of U.S. Pacific Command and the Commander in Chief of the U.S. Forces in Korea respectively. After these discussions, I am even more convinced that the Senate should approve PNTR as an important national security measure. Admiral Fargo, the Commanding Officer of the CINCPAC Fleet echoed these sentiments when he mentioned that the ``right answer'' to many of the difficult questions facing us with regard to our strategic interest in the region, including PNTR, ``is to engage China.'' 
   While in Japan, I met with Japanese Foreign Minister, Yohei Kono. When asked, Minister Kono stated that he believes PNTR for China and its upcoming membership in the WTO, will help China become a member of the international community and, in so doing, will help stabilize not only the Sino-Japanese relationship--which is a part of our national security since we are treaty-bound to defend Japan and because we have 46,000 troops stationed on Japanese soil--but will further stabilize the entire Asia-Pacific region. I find Foreign Minister Kono's sentiments especially significant given the historically difficult relations between these two nations and given the fact that Japan would be a primary beneficiary of trade with China should the U.S. Congress not approve PNTR. 
   Regarding the economic security of the U.S., granting Permanent Normal Trade Relations will open up China's market to countless Georgia goods and services, especially for Georgia's emerging high-tech and communications sector as well as for our largest  industry--agriculture. Earlier this year, Tommy Irvin, Georgia's Commissioner for Agriculture, wrote to me that, ``Normalizing trade relations with China will surely aid our farmers and agribusinesses' lagging export economy, which ..... has slowed over the past two years due to the economic crisis in Southeast Asia.'' Similarly, Governor Roy Barnes has signaled his support for PNTR and its benefits for Georgia. 
   Let me be clear that I do believe that U.S. trade with China, which under our current trade rules accounts for our single largest bilateral trade deficit, has had--and will continue to have, whether or not we approve PNTR--a negative effect on some American industries and workers, including some in my state in such areas as textiles and manufacturing. And I would certainly concur that China's labor, environmental and political rights standards fall far short of those we enjoy in the United States. 
   However, it is my belief that the annual vote currently required regarding China's Most Favored Nation status has not been an effective tool in forcing China to expand political rights or to observe international rules of free and fair trade. It seems obvious to me that both the Chinese and American leaderships have viewed the threat of not passing MFN as just that, a threat, which has never been carried out--not even after the Tiananmen Square massacre. It is important to note that while some Chinese dissidents in the United States have indicated their strong opposition to PNTR, most human rights advocates who have remained in China, the Hong Kong democratic opposition lead by Martin Lee and the government of democratic Taiwan all support PNTR for China. They believe that China's acceptance of the multilateral WTO as the arbiter of its international trade polices will, in time, produce a significant opening up of the Chinese economic, legal and, ultimately, even political systems. 
   Again, let's be clear on one point. China's membership in the WTO will happen with or without the support of the U.S. Congress. Should Congress not pass PNTR, then businesses in the European Union, Japan and other nations will gain the benefits of Chinese trade concessions plus fair trade enforcement by the WTO, while U.S. exporters will be left behind. 
   Each trade agreement is different and I am not one who believes that so-called free trade is always and necessarily a good thing for America. Several months ago, I voted against the Caribbean Basin Initiative and the Sub-Saharan African Trade bill because I thought the net effect on the U.S. economy was not going to be positive. In contrast, the trade agreement signed with China in November of 1999--which is contingent on our approval of PNTR for China--would slash Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods and services with no concessions by the United States. 
   While increased trade with China will likely result in a net benefit for the American economy, we must not ignore the possible impact upon industries, such as textiles and auto manufacturing, that have been adversely impacted under previous trade agreements such as NAFTA or indeed under our current trade policies--including annual MFN review--toward China. Nor should we ignore China's performance on the whole range of issues important to our bilateral relationship, including its labor and environmental standards, its respect for the human rights of its own citizens, its involvement in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems, its relationship with Taiwan, and its efforts to promote stability in such key regions as the Korean Peninsula and the Indian Subcontinent. We can, and should, vigorously defend our national interests in these matters through diplomacy, targeted sanctions, and other appropriate means. 
   However, in my opinion, none of our legitimate concerns about China will be effectively pursued via a continuation of our current annual review of trade relations with that country. There is little evidence to suggest that this current policy has produced any appreciable modification of Chinese behavior on trade, human rights or the other issues. On the other hand, a vote for permanent normal trade relations for China will, while relinquishing what I regard as an ineffective policy tool, secure greater access to the Chinese market for American companies, and will make the U.S. a full party to international efforts to enforce China's compliance with the terms of the WTO accession agreement. And approval of PNTR will in no way prevent the United States from considering other, more effective responses to the actions of the Chinese government. Therefore, I intend to vote for PNTR for China.

   Mr. CLELAND. Thank you, Mr. President. I rise today to discuss the current situation of Brunswick Harbor, an issue which is very important to me. I hope that I can engage the Chairman and the Ranking Member of the Senate Energy and Water Subcommittee in a floor discussion of this key matter. 
   The Brunswick Harbor deepening project, which was authorized in the 1999 Water Resources Develop Act, has received a favorable report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and has met all required cost-benefit and environmental reviews. Preconstruction engineering and design are in the final stages. In order to keep this project on schedule, it is necessary to complete several administrative requirements before the deepening project begins. Namely, the Corps of Engineers and the Non-Federal sponsor must initiate Project Cooperation Agreement discussions, complete the final project design, and develop contract award documents. I have requested a modest funding level of $255,000 to carry out these tasks. Unfortunately, no funds were provided in the House or Senate bills.  
   I believe it is important to take action on this issue immediately. Navigation channel restrictions in Brunswick have cost shippers and consumers a significant amount in lost revenue. The current controlled depth of 30 feet subjects 57 percent of the vessels to tidal delays, sub-optimal loading and inefficient port rotations. In fact, it is estimated that these delays result in an annual loss of $6.65 million in revenue. We can avoid incurring these losses another year by providing nominal funding to complete the required administrative processes. 
   I would echo the remarks of the Committee's report language which notes the importance of our waterways and harbors to our national transportation system. The Port of Brunswick plays an integral role in supporting the maritime transportation arm of our national infrastructure. Additionally, I would say that the Port of Brunswick is very much an intermodal facility. Brunswick is well-connected to our nation's system of highways and railroads, providing increased opportunities for commercial transportation. 
   I will go one step further in stating that the Port of Brunswick is not only important to our national transportation system, but it is important to our national defense. Located between Savannah and Jacksonville, Brunswick is readily accessible to the numerous military installations in the region. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and as a former Army Officer, I know very well the need to move troops, tanks, and supplies as rapidly as possible. During a war, more than 95 percent of all the equipment and supplies needed to sustain the U.S. military are carried by sea. The potential for the Port of Brunswick to play a major role in the movement of military cargo must not be overlooked, nor must it be hindered by administrative delays. 
   I understand the tight budget restraints the Subcommittee faces this year, and I respect the fact that there will be no ``new start'' projects appropriated. However, we are not attempting to start dredging in Brunswick. We are simply trying to complete the administrative requirements which are necessary prior to such action. I appeal to my colleagues to help me keep the Brunswick Harbor deepening project on schedule through the inclusion of funds in Conference with the House. In fact, I believe we can proceed with the Project Cooperation Agreement, the final project design, and the development of contract awards if the Conference Committee were to simply include favorable report language to this effect. I thank my distinguished colleagues, and I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been my honor, and a privilege, to know our distinguished friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL, for a long time. I have had, overnight, the opportunity to think about his life and about his death. 
   When a man dies, especially a friend, we are inevitably struck by the frailty of life, the speed of death, and the very painful void that is left behind. With the passing of our friend and colleague, PAUL COVERDELL, we are also struck by the promise of a truly brilliant future left unfulfilled. 
   Alphonse de Lamartine once said:  
   Sometimes, when one person is absent, the whole world seems less.  
   Today, that is exactly how I feel. The world seems less today. 
   PAUL and I worked together for many years. We were sworn into the Georgia State Senate on the same day, in January of 1971. In Georgia, we sit not as partisans, across the aisle, but we sit by numbers of our State senate districts. Fate had it that Senator PAUL COVERDELL sat right in front of me. So even though he was of one party and I another, we shared space on the floor of the State senate. We worked together in harmony for 4 years. It was a joyous time. It was a marvelous time to get to know this young talent. 
   When I came to the U.S. Senate, PAUL had preceded me. PAUL stood on the floor of the Senate here with my parents watching from the balcony as I was sworn in. After that day, he helped me, he guided me, tutored me in the same way we had worked together so beautifully in the early 1970s in the Georgia senate. From time to time in this body, on different sides of the aisle, we were on different sides of the issues. But he helped me learn. He helped me because he was a good man and a great friend, because he knew it was good for Georgia and for the country. 
   I watched him work, incredulous--putting in 12- and 14- and 16-hour days. In Georgia, we have a saying: You are either a workhorse or a show horse. He was certainly a work horse. He fought hard for our State, for our farmers and businesses and the average taxpaying citizen. He used his deep breadth of knowledge in international affairs, which he had gained as Director of the Peace Corps, to fight what he called the most serious threat to America's freedom today--the war on drugs. 
   Our colleague, Senator MOYNIHAN, yesterday called PAUL COVERDELL a man of peace. I will reiterate that observation. From his time in the Georgia senate to his post as head of the Peace Corps under President Bush, to his quiet and wonderful leadership in the Senate, PAUL had a peaceful and resolute efficiency about his work that I think we could all try to emulate. He worked hard. He achieved results. And he didn't care who got the credit. To lose a leader of this quality in this body in this day of ``gotcha'' politics, and one-upmanship, is a loss for this body and for our country and for Georgia. 
   PAUL was a leader. He led in his own quiet, positive way. I never heard him speak an ill thought or an ill phrase or a mean-tempered comment about anyone. He was a great legislator and a dear personal friend. 
   I extend my deepest sympathies to his wife Nancy, whom I have known for almost 30 years. I knew them when they first got married. 
   Proverbs tell us:  
   Good men must die, but death cannot kill their names.  
   I think we can all take great comfort in that. Nothing will lessen the impact that PAUL COVERDELL and his legacy have had on the State of Georgia and on this country. It is not the time for political thoughts or words but only words to remember one of the best U.S. Senators this body has ever known. PAUL COVERDELL, United States Senator from Georgia, a peach of a guy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, The Cleland Savings Bond Tax-Exclusion for Long-Term Care Services Amendment would exclude United States savings bond income from being taxed if used to pay for long-term health care expenses. Current law provides an income exclusion for savings bond income used to pay for qualified higher education expenses. This amendment expands the tax code section 135 to allow the savings bond income exclusion for eligible long-term care expenses as well. This measure will assist individuals struggling to accommodate costs associated with many chronic medical conditions and the aging process. A staggering 5.8 million Americans are afflicted with the financial burdens of long-term care. 
   This legislation will assist families by: 
   Providing a tax exclusion for savings bonds used to pay for long-term care; 
   Allowing families to use their savings bond assets to face the dual challenge of paying for long-term care services and higher education expenses. 
   Thank you and I urge you to support this proposal to provide tax relief to Americans burdened by the financial constraints of providing long-term care and higher education expenses. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, we have on the books today a special enhanced tax deduction for individuals and corporations which donate computers to our nation's elementary and secondary schools. This deduction--which helps to keep America on the cutting-edge in technology--is scheduled to expire at the end of the year. The amendment I am offering is twofold: it would extend this tax deduction for five years and it would expand it to include computer donations to public libraries and non-profit and governmental community centers as well. 
   My amendment will help to close the ``digital divide'' which exists in this  country by providing a viable alternative for Americans who are being left behind because they do not have access in their homes to computer and Internet use. We know, for example, that Americans earning less than $20,000 who use the Internet outside the home are twice as likely to get their access through a public library or community center. And Americans who are not in the labor force, such as retirees or homemakers, are twice as likely to use public libraries for on-line access. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. It would extend a tax deduction which has proved invaluable in boosting efforts by individuals and companies to donate computer equipment and web access to our Nation's schools. And it will help to keep this Nation a leader in the global economy by helping to close the gap between the technological haves and the have nots.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the Cleland Savings Bond Tax-Exemption for Long-Term Care Services Amendment would exclude United States savings bond income from being taxed if used to pay for long-term health care expenses. This bill will assist individuals struggling to accommodate costs associated with many chronic medical conditions and the aging process. A staggering 5.8 million Americans are afflicted with the financial burdens of long-term care. 
   My bill proposes a tax credit for individuals who are limited in daily activities or have a comparable cognitive impairment. Providing a tax credit for families paying for long-term health care will help alleviate the financial burdens for one of the fastest growing health care expenses. Federal and state spending for nursing home care and home care continues to skyrocket. Current estimates forecast that in the next 30 years, half of all women and a third of all men in the United States will spend a portion of their life in a nursing home at cost of $40,000 to $90,000 per year per person. 
   My legislation will assist families by: providing a tax credit for savings bonds used to pay for long-term care, and allowing families to use their savings bond assets to face the dual challenge of paying for long-term care services and higher education expenses. 
   I urge you to support proposal to provide tax relief to Americans burdened by the financial constraints on providing long-term care and higher education expenses.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce with my colleague, Senator SNOWE, a bill to designate 2-1-1 as the nationwide, toll-free number to access health and human services. Such designation is needed to simplify access to the maze of numbers and service organizations that currently exist. These organizations, which exist to help people, are useless if those in need do not know how to access the services provided. 
   Imagine a single mother who needs shelter and dinner one night for herself and her children. Although she may know of a shelter providing these services, there may be one closer that better fits her needs by catering to children and women in need. 2-1-1 could provide her with a targeted referral to a shelter specializing in child care and empowering mothers to get back on their feet. Or, visualize an older American on a fixed income, who may need assistance paying her electricity bill during a particularly cold month, can call 2-1-1 for a referral to an agency to assist her with her need. Also, if someone has goods or services she would like to donate to her community, she can call 2-1-1 for a referral to an agency with a specific need for her items or time. All 2-1-1 calls are confidential and unaffiliated with government agencies. 
   The United Way of Metropolitan Atlanta has implemented 2-1-1 service with much success. Not only has this consolidation of human services referrals provided direction and aid to those in need, it also has helped pool the resources of area charitable organizations. This pooling of resources has eliminated duplication and highlighted gaps in current service, which in turn has improved the delivery of services to the citizens of Metro Atlanta. Because of the great success in Atlanta, the United Way and other non-profit groups are attempting to replicate this service in almost every state in the nation. Petitions to designate 2-1-1 as a referral to health and human services have been approved or are pending in several other states. However, 2-1-1 offers such an important service to communities, that I believe it is time to reserve this number nationwide. Several states have indicated reservations about pending petitions without direction from the appropriate federal agencies that 2-1-1 will not be used for another purpose. Senator SNOWE and I believe it is time to indicate to state and federal regulators Congress's clear support for 2-1-1. 
   One of the unique aspects of 2-1-1 in Metropolitan Atlanta, which I believe can be replicated in the other states, is the generous support it has received from the community through private donations. This funding model is one of the unique aspects of this legislation. Specifically, the bill stipulates that none of the costs of 2-1-1 service shall be passed on to telephone customers but will be supported by the organizations operating the 2-1-1 service. 
   Mr. President, I would like to submit a letter endorsing this legislation signed by the United Way of America, the American Red Cross, the Alliance for Children and Families, Girls Scouts of the United States of America, United Jewish Communities, Lutheran Services of America, and Volunteers of America to name only a few. I realize that N-1-1 numbers are finite in availability, but 2-1-1 is a service in the public interest that needs a national designation. I urge my colleagues to support this legislation that will enable Americans, no matter where they are, to obtain the assistance they need through the use of a three digit number.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 2775. From the beginning of the debate on the Internet Tax Moratorium Act, I have fought for the sovereignty of state and local elected officials and a level playing field for on-line and off-line retailers. This bipartisan bill accomplishes both of these goals by allowing the states to work together in an Interstate Sales and Use Tax Compact to simplify and streamline the existing sales tax system in to a blended rate that will enable remote on-line and off-line sellers to collect and remit sales taxes without an undue burden. While states work toward this objective, the current tax moratorium will be extended four more years. 
   In addition to providing greater equity in the tax treatment of both Internet-based and Main Street businesses, this legislation also provides means for on-line retailers to pay their fair share in supporting the communities in which their employees and customers live. Local sales tax revenue contributes to the infrastructure and emergency services of these communities. Also of importance is the aid these funds provide to local education. If the high-tech community is truly looking to expand the domestic pool of eligible employees, they should be lauding this legislative approach because of the support it will provide the local, public school systems. Sales tax revenue will help educate the future programmer, software developer, or information architect for the virtual world of tomorrow. 
   As a former state official, I understand the important role state and local officials play in establishing public policy. Although Internet sales represent a small portion of overall consumer sales today, Net sales are increasing every day. Without a level playing field between on-line and off-line retailers, the forty-five states and the District of Columbia that collect sales tax could be crippled by the budgetary impact. 
   The Internet offers a more convenient means of purchasing goods. No longer do consumers need to fight traffic, search for a parking space, and deal with sometimes unhelpful sales people in order to purchase an item. This legislation would further ease on-line purchases by removing the confusing and often misunderstood use tax remission policies of states. The consumer would be able to take care of any tax questions in one transaction. 
   Some of my colleagues claim that applying existing sales taxes to the Internet will destroy this powerful news, information and commerce medium. I, on the other hand, do not see any signs of a slowing of the Net. It is growing so quickly that we are running out of Internet addresses. If anything, enacting this legislation now will enable new ``e-tailers'' to adjust their business design to adapt to this policy. In addition, this fear completely ignores the fact that these taxes are already due. They are not collected because it is too difficult. 
   The National Governors Association, the National Retail Federation, and the e-Fairness Coalition are among the groups that believe this legislation is a proper approach to level the e-commerce playing field. I urge my colleagues to join with this bi-partisan group in supporting the balanced approach of S. 2775 that accomplishes one of the main goals of the Internet Tax Freedom Act: to find a way to simplify the existing sales and use tax structure for remote sellers while the moratorium remains in place.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr President, today I am introducing legislation which will provide for the Federal recognition of the Lower Muskogee-Creek Indian Tribe of Georgia. 
   I realize that Congress has traditionally deferred to the Secretary of the Interior on matters relating to tribal recognition. Further, while it is within our jurisdiction, I understand that there is a reluctance in Congress to federally recognize Indian tribes through legislation. I would certainly prefer to settle this particular recognition issue in accordance with the practices and procedures established by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. However, I am compelled to introduce this legislation because I believe there has been a fundamental flaw which, in this case, has prevented the Lower Muskogee tribe from obtaining a fair and equitable review of its recognition request. Mr. President, please allow me to elaborate on this statement. 
   It is my understanding that once a petition has been denied, the rules prohibit a tribe from petitioning the Secretary of the Interior a second time. While the intent of the rule may be to eliminate redundant and frivolous petitions, I believe there are times when we must make an exception. Further, Mr. President, I would contend that this rule is especially unfair to those tribes who petitioned the Agency prior to the finalization of the rules in 1978. This is the case with respect to the Lower Muskogee tribe in my home State of Georgia. 
   The Lower Muskogee tribe has tried for over two decades to obtain a favorable review of their status as a tribe. In 1977, members of the tribe petitioned the Secretary of the Interior for recognition. Without the assistance of legal counsel or technical support, the tribe submitted their petition. While the petition was pending, the Department of Interior (DOI) proposed and finalized rules relating to the procedures by which tribes may petition for federal recognition. In December 1981, the tribe's petition was denied due to technical omissions. 
   I understand that there are serious concerns associated with the federal recognition of tribes by an Act of Congress--the most obvious being the perception that establishment of a gaming facility may soon follow. However, members of the Lower Muskogee tribe are not seeking to open casinos in Georgia. In fact, at the request of the tribe's Principal Chief, I have included language in the bill to prohibit such action. Under my bill, federal recognition of the Lower Muskogee tribe will not permit casinos or any other games of chance. It will simply recognize these well-deserving people as an Indian tribe, and allow their participation in programs which should be available to them as legitimate Native Americans.

   Mr. CLELAND. I would like to join my distinguished colleague, the senior Senator from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, in highlighting the critical needs of Fort Stewart in Georgia. I would also like to note my appreciation for the remarks of Chairman WARNER and his recognition of Fort Stewart. 
   I too would like to highlight the importance of Fort Stewart. Since its birth in 1940, Fort Stewart has seen a flurry of activity. Its original mission began as an anti-aircraft artillery training center and later evolved into a helicopter training facility, and is now home to 3rd Infantry Division. Fort Stewart has shown its importance during the Korean war, Vietnam war, the Persian Gulf war, and even during the Cuban missile crisis. Through the years, Fort Stewart has adapted to the changing landscape of our military missions. Despite this glorious history, Fort Stewart needs our attention. Fort Stewart has important military construction needs to provide the critical infrastructure to fulfill its mission. It is my hope that through increased attention from the Department of the Army, the Pentagon, and the Congress, Fort Stewart's needs can be addressed. I thank my colleagues for engaging in this colloquy regarding such a vital facility.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Hours of Service provision in H.R. 4475, the Department of Transportation appropriations bill. As directed by Congress, the Department of Transportation, and most recently the new Federal Motor Carrier  Safety Administration (FMCSA), set out to examine the hours of service standard for motor carrier drivers that had been in effect since the 1930s. 
   As I stated in the Surface Transportation Subcommittee's hearing in September 1999, I am concerned about fatigued drivers on the road. The fatigue related accident I profiled at this hearing occurred August 31, 1999 in Atlanta, and resulted in deadly consequences for the drivers of the truck. The accident occurred in the early morning hours and thankfully, no other automobiles were directly involved. However, daily commuters felt the effects during morning and afternoon rush hours, and the tragedy and frustration from incidents such as this accident resulted in Congress directing DOT to examine hours of service regulations. 
   Admittedly, I have concerns about the effects of the proposed rule, but I do not believe that the appropriations bill is the proper vehicle through which to express concerns. I would like to remind my colleagues that the DOT has only issued a proposed rule. DOT is still accepting comments on this rule through October 31, 2000--an extension of the original date--and continues to hold hearings on the issue throughout the country. I believe these hearings have brought, and will continue to bring, potential problems to the attention of DOT officials. For example, during emergencies, utility drivers must restore service to customers. How do these rules apply to such drivers in these special situations? 
   Congress directed DOT to evaluate the hours of service rules. Is this the best proposal? I am not convinced so, but I do believe DOT should be able to move forward with the prescribed process. The American driving public deserves the continuation of the hours of service reform process. The truck drivers want this collaborative process to continue. As this point, why should the Senate attempt to short-circuit the efforts of the FMCSA to reform the hours of service rule as directed by Congress? 
   I do not support the prohibition on moving forward with the hours of service process, and I urge the conferees on H.R. 4475 to remove the hours of service provision from the final bill. Let's work together in thoroughly considering the best way to ensure the safety of automobile and truck drivers traveling America's roads.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the most successful college baseball regular season in history. This year, the Savannah State University, SSU, Tigers set a new National Collegiate Athletic Association record for the most consecutive wins--an incredible 46. Led by their coach, Jamie Rigdon, a former Savannah State graduate, the Tigers played with all their heart despite the knowledge that they would not be able to participate in NCAA Regional Playoffs because they are in the process of moving from NCAA Division II to Division I. 
   The historic season began with twelve straight victories over their fellow Division II rivals. In February, the Tigers defeated Florida A&M in what would become the first of many Division I opponents to meet their match in Savannah State. As the season wore on, the Tigers kept playing hard each and every day and, on March 19 they were rewarded for their efforts with an amazing 34th consecutive victory, thereby breaking the NCAA record. However, Savannah State's celebration was cut short when it learned that a Division III school in Ohio reported that it won 40 consecutive games the season before but had failed to notify the NCAA's official record keepers. While the media and officials debated which team held the record, the Tigers kept winning. In the end, the Savannah State University baseball team had won an astonishing 46 consecutive game, shattering every record in the books and laying indisputable claim to the most successful regular season in college baseball history. 
   In addition to their consecutive win streak, the Tigers compiled many impressive statistics this year. For example, each SSU starter batted over .330 for the season, the starters fielding average was .947, and the team's earned run average was an incredible 2.30 for the entire season. 
   I recognize each Tiger player from the record setting team: Brett Higgins, captain; Torrie Pinkins; Derron Street; Jarvis Johnson; Robert Settle; Roderick Ricks; Marcus Griffin; Mike Eusebio; Lamar Leverett; Marcus Johnson; Richard Castillo; Guy Thigpen; Chris Cesario; Charles Brown; Isaiah Brown; James Runkle; Jeremy Batayias; J.J. Stevens; James Greig; and Shantwone Dent. 
   Savannah State University President, Carlton E. Brown, spoke highly of the student athletes saying that, ``the members of the Savannah State University baseball team are not just extraordinary athletes, they are exceptional students and model citizens. Even without the prospect of post-season play, the team put its heart and soul into each game. The team exemplifies the Savannah State University motto, which is `You can get anywhere from here.' '' I agree with President Brown that these young men can get anywhere with their education from Savannah State just as they went from the baseball diamond and into the record books. While I do not doubt that the Tigers could have been very successful in the playoffs, I hope their tremendous season is simply one remarkable achievement in a life where they make history, on and off the field.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment to be offered by my distinguished colleague from Ohio. People in my region of the country in the South are usually known for their position in favor of States rights. This is not just a transportation issue; this is a States rights issue. 
   This amendment is not a mandate. It is not a threat to highways or the Highway Trust Fund. It would not change any Federal transportation formulas. It requires not a penny in new spending. What it does do is to give States the option to spend Federal transportation funds on intercity passenger rail. What this amendment does do is give States the opportunity to make transportation spending decisions based on their own local needs. 
   Mr. President, part of my State is in a transportation crisis. Metro Atlanta has the worst traffic congestion of any southern city, and our drivers have the longest commute in the Nation. Due in large part to the exhaust from nearly three million vehicles, Atlanta's skies are in violation of national clean air standards. For two years now, Federal funds have been frozen for new transportation projects. The bottom line? Metro Atlanta's congestion and pollution problems are now threatening our most valuable selling point: our quality of life. 
   The good news is that the best transportation minds in the State have rallied around Metro Atlanta's transportation crisis. These movers and shakers are not afraid to redraw the maps. The result is a new transportation plan that is going to meet our air quality goals, and that plan devotes 60 percent of Georgia's transportation dollars to rail. Georgia has dramatically reformed its transportation focus: from moving cars to moving people, from promoting sprawl to promoting smart growth. 
   As the folk song says, ``the times they are a-changing.'' We're about to witness a rebirth of rail in Georgia, rivaled only by the days before General Sherman when Atlanta was the undisputed railroad hub of the Southeast. And key to this vision is intercity rail. The amendment before us, if adopted, will be a Godsend to my state. Let me state loud and clear, this amendment will be a Godsend not just to Georgia, for Atlanta's commuter congestion is mirrored in countless highways across America. One viable solution to two of the 21st century's most challenging and frustrating problems, smog and gridlock, may very well be found in a renaissance of rail, not just in my home State, but throughout this great Nation. 
   For those States which see rail as key to their transportation future, we should at least give them another option for financing their intercity rail investments. Our amendment will do just that. It will give states whose highways and skyways are clogged with traffic not a mandate, but a chance to use their CMAQ, National Highway System, and Surface Transportation Program funds on passenger rail if they want to. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote for the bipartisan measures before us. The National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the Council of State Governments, the National League of Cities and the National Council of State Legislatures are all on record in support of providing flexible funding for passenger rail. This is States' rights legislation, and it's the right legislation for a balanced transportation system in the 21st century.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, as we vote today on the Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001, I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a remarkable achievement in the Atlanta region of my home state of Georgia. But first let me thank Chairman SHELBY and our Ranking Member, Senator LAUTENBERG, for their assistance on my state's transportation priorities in this bill. 
   The bill provides assistance for a number of alternative transportation projects, from water taxies to eliminating high-hazard grade crossings on the proposed Atlanta to Macon commuter rail line. We have direction to the Federal Railway Administration and funding to extend the agency's high-speed rail transportation plan from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Macon, Georgia. We have important funding to make up for a shortfall in funding to complete a regional transit study for metropolitan Atlanta, so that this fast growing region--whose motorists drive the longest distance of any metro area--can plan for a region-wide system of seamless intermodal transportation. We have the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, GRTA, the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, MARTA, the Georgia Department of Transportation, Chatham Area Transit, and the Southern Coalition for Advanced Transportation on the eligibility list for bus funding. In addition, MARTA is eligible for New Starts mass transit rail funding. And, the maglev program to provide high-tech, high-speed fixed guideway service between Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Atlanta would receive $3 million to continue pre-construction planning in this Senate bill. 
   These are important projects, especially in light of the unanimous decision yesterday by the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority to approve the Transportation Improvement Program, TIP, for the Atlanta region. This was a remarkable event given the intense process that has been underway the past 12 weeks in Atlanta, culminating a two-year effort to submit a fiscally constrained, air quality conforming plan to the U.S. Department of Transportation for approval. As many of my colleagues know, the Atlanta region has been called the ``poster-child of urban sprawl.'' The region is in a conformity lapse, and, as a result, new highway and transit construction dollars are frozen until the Federal Government approves a plan that conforms with the Clean Air Act and the requirements of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. 
   The Atlanta region has developed and submitted a plan that has been under the closest scrutiny of any metropolitan region of the country. No other region has had to fulfill the requirements set forth by the Federal transportation agencies for not only local financial commitments, but to adopt a land-use strategy that would support the major public transportation investments called for in the TIP. In regard to these requests, let me remind my colleagues that the counties in my state are very protective of their home rule powers and rightly so, and Federal directives on local control issues are difficult to swallow. 
   Nevertheless, officials from the Atlanta Regional Commission, ARC, which is the metropolitan planning organization for the region, and from the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority, GRTA, our new regional agency established to implement the ARC's plan, worked with the Federal agencies to craft a process to ensure that the transportation alternatives in the TIP are successful. This 3-year TIP makes a very strong investment in alternative transportation. Half of the $1.9 billion plan is devoted to mass transit, bicycle, pedestrian and air quality improvement projects and only 10 percent is devoted to new capacity for single-occupant vehicles. 
   Even more important, the ARC and the GRTA are pledged to work together to implement a land use strategy that links the regional development plan with this transportation improvement program. This is an historic linkage of land-use guidelines with transportation improvements. The Atlanta Regional Development Plan calls for land use policies that strengthen town centers, foster transit-oriented development, encourage new development to be more clustered in portions of the region where new opportunities exist, protect environmentally sensitive areas, support the preservation of stable, single-family neighborhoods and encourage best development practices. 
   For the first time, these high-sounding goals are not just left to gather dust on a shelf. They are the guideposts for the region's transportation program. The GRTA resolution calls  the regional development plan ``an integral part of fulfilling its responsibility to manage land transportation and air quality. . . .'' 
   Mr. President, I would like to point out that these plans for mixed-use and transit-oriented development do not mean that the GRTA is going to mandate high-density housing throughout the region. That could not be farther from the truth. What this plan sets out is that where opportunities exist along certain transportation corridors the counties should allow the free market to step in and build higher-density housing and commercial development that would attract support for transportation alternatives, such as express buses or commuter rail lines. 
   Let me state that many local governments have submitted written promises that they will do their part in implementing the TIP. Even more important, everybody is now fully aware of what will be expected of them. For that reason--and because the GRTA has pledged to use its influence to put the program into action--I believe moving forward is the right thing to do. I urge the Department of Transportation to move this plan forward. It is time to put solutions that improve air quality, reduce traffic congestion and provide transportation choices on the roads and railways in Atlanta.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank Chairman WARNER and ranking member LEVIN for their hard work during the Department of Defense authorization process this year. They have done a tremendous job in enhancing the quality of life for our military personnel and their families. I appreciate the support of Senators LEVIN, BINGAMAN, REED, and ROBB, who have cosponsored my GI bill enhancements which we are about to adopt. 
   Specifically, I recognize the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, the distinguished Senator from Virginia, Mr. WARNER, who himself went to school on the GI bill after World War II. I thank him for his support and his encouragement in improving the GI bill for military personnel and their families. 
   My amendment will improve and enhance the current educational benefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century. 
   One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the service Secretaries the authority to authorize a service member to transfer his or her basic Montgomery GI bill benefits to family members. It will make the GI bill for the first time family friendly. This will give the Secretaries of the services a very powerful retention tool. 
   My amendment will also give the Secretaries the authority to authorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, VEAP, participants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in the Montgomery GI bill to participate in the current GI bill program. 
   Another enhancement to the current Montgomery GI bill extends the period in which the members of Reserve components 
   can use this benefit. 
   Other provisions of this amendment will allow the Service Secretaries to pay 100 percent of tuition assistance or enable service members to use the Montgomery GI bill to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses when the services do not pay 100 percent. 
   This GI bill amendment is an important retention tool for the services, as well as a wonderful benefit for the men and women who bravely serve our country. I believe that education begets education. We must continue to focus our resources in retaining our personnel and meeting their personal needs. It is cheaper and better all around to retain than retrain. 
   I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before you today to offer an amendment that addresses the educational needs of our men and our men and women in uniform and their families. I appreciate the support of my colleagues who have supported my provisions to enhance the GI bill, Senators LEVIN, BINGAMAN, REED, and ROBB. I also like to recognize the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator WARNER, who himself went to school on the GI bill. I want to thank him for his support and encouragement in improving the GI bill for military personnel and their families. 
   I call this measure the HOPE--Help Our Professionals Educationally--Act of 2000. This measure is the same at my original legislation, S. 2402. 
   Last year, Time magazine named the American GI as the Person of the Century. That alone is a statement about the value of our military personnel. They are recognized around the world for their dedication and commitment to fight for our country and for peace in the world. This past century has been the most violent century in the  modern era. The American GI has fought in the trenches during the First World War, the beaches at Normandy, in the jungles of Vietnam, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf, and most recently in the Balkans and Kosovo. 
   The face of our military and the people who fight our wars has changed. The traditional image of the single, mostly male, drafted, and disposable soldier is gone. Today we are fielding the force for the 21st century. This new force is a volunteer force, filled with men and women who are highly skilled, married, and definitely not disposable. Gone are the days when quality of life for a GI included a beer in the barracks and a three-day pass. Now, we know we have to recruit a soldier and retain a family. 
   We have won the cold war. This victory has changed the world and our military. The new world order has given us a new world disorder. The United States is responding to crises around the globe--whether it be strategic bombing or humanitarian assistance--and our military is the most effective response. In order to meet these challenges, we are retooling our forces to be lighter, leaner and meaner. This is a positive move. Along with this lighter force, our military professionals must be highly educated and highly trained. 
   Our nation is currently experiencing the longest running peacetime economic growth in history. This economic expansion has been a boom for our nation. However, there is a negative impact of this growing economy. With the enticement of quick prosperity in the civilian sector it is more difficult than ever to recruit and retain our highly skilled force. 
   In fiscal year 99, the Army missed its recruiting goals by 6,291 recruits, while the Air Force missed its recruiting goal by 1,732 recruits. Pilot retention problems persist for all services; the Air Force ended FY99 1,200 pilots short and the Navy ended FY99 500 pilots short. The Army is having problems retaining captains, while the Navy faces manning challenges for Surface Warfare Officers and Special Warfare Officers. It is estimated than $6 million is spent to train a pilot. We as a nation cannot afford to train our people, only to lose them to the private sector. It is better to retain than retrain. 
   There is hope that we are addressing these challenges. Last year was a momentous year for our military personnel. The Senate passed legislation that significantly enhances the quality of life for our military personnel. From retirement reform to pay raises, this Congress is on record supporting our men and women in uniform. However, more must be done. 
   In talking with our military personnel, we know that money alone is not enough. Education is the number one reason service members come into the military and the number one reason its members are leaving. Last year the Senate began to address this issue by supporting improved education benefits for military members and their families. Since last year, we have gone back and studied this issue further. In reviewing the current Montgomery GI bill, we found several disincentives and conflicts among the education benefits offered by the services. These conflicts make the GI bill, an earned benefit, less attractive than it could be. 
   My amendment will improve and enhance the current educational benefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century. 
   One of the most important provisions of my amendment would give the Service Secretaries the authority to authorize a service member to transfer his or her basic MGIB benefits to family members. Many service members tell us that they really want to stay in the service, but do not feel that they can stay and provide an education for their families. This will give them an Educational Savings Account, so that they can stay in the service and still provide an education for their spouses and children. This will give the Secretaries a very powerful retention tool. The measure would allow the Services to authorize transfer of basic GI bill benefits anytime after 6 years of service. To encourage members to stay longer, the transferred benefits could not be used until completion of at least 10 years of service. I believe that the Services can use this much like a reenlistment bonus to keep valuable service members in the service. It can be creatively combined with reenlistment bonuses to create a very powerful and cost effective incentive for highly skilled military personnel to stay in the Service. In talking with service members upon their departure from the military, we have found that the family plays a crucial role in the decision of a member to continue their military career. Reality dictates that we must address the needs of the family in order to retain our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. 
   My amendment would also give the Secretaries the authority to authorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program (VEAP) participants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in MGIB to participate in the current GI bill program. The VEAP participants would contribute $1200, and those who did not enroll in MGIB would contribute $1500. The services would pay any additional costs of the benefits of this measure. 
   Another enhancement to the current MGIB would extend the period in which the members of Reserve components can use this benefit. Currently they lose this benefit when they leave the service or after 10 years of service. They have no benefit when they leave service. My amendment will permit them to use the benefit up to 5 years after their separation. This will encourage them to stay in the Reserves for a full career. Other provisions of this amendment would allow the Service Secretaries to pay 100 percent tuition assistance or enable service members to use the MGIB to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses when the services don't pay 100 percent. 
   Mr. President, I believe that this is a necessary next step for improving our education benefits for our military members and their families. We must offer them credible choices. If we offer them choices, and treat the members and their families properly, we will show them our respect for their service and dedication. Maybe then we can turn around our current retention statistics. This GI bill is an important retention tool for the services. I believe that education begets education. We must continue to focus our resources in retaining our personnel based on their needs.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I wish every American could have heard that distinguished lecture, dialog, and discussion of what I think is the most important action this Government can ever take, and that is the question of committing young Americans in harm's way. It is the most serious decision that I as a Member of the Senate can take. It is one of the reasons that brings me here to share the podium and  the floor in the Senate with the distinguished Senator from Kansas, PAT ROBERTS, my colleague, my friend. We work together so well on the Armed Services Committee on behalf of young Americans in the military and retired military and Guard and Reservists, we thought we would bring our thoughts, our concerns, to the floor of this body and stand shoulder to shoulder as we are today discussing at the question of American intervention abroad. 
   I will recap a couple of items that Senator ROBERTS, in his eloquence and in his great research, has pulled together for Members to consider as we look at the question of America's intervention abroad today. He mentioned that we were involved militarily in 141 places around the globe. I deal with these issues most every day. That is even a shocking statistic to me. Additionally, we were involved militarily in more than 55 percent of all the nations on the globe. One wonders if we are not becoming the new Rome. My greatest fear is we will become part of a Pax Americana, or as 2,000 years ago, Pax Romana, where Rome kept the peace in the known world. Is that our role today? Is that our mission? Are we called upon to be the new Rome or is that part of our intervention strategy? 
   I thought it was fascinating that Senator ROBERTS pointed 
   out since Eisenhower we have intervened in the world some 51 times; just since 1992 we have had 51 interventions. We have had an increase in American military commitments in the last 10 to 15 years of some 400 percent, but we have downsized the American military's ability to meet those commitments by some 40 percent. A classic case is the Balkans. I just got back from Macedonia, Kosovo, and visited the airbase where we launched the attacks into Kosovo and Serbia at Aviano, Italy. We have three U.S. Army divisions, as the distinguished Senator from Kansas has pointed out, in effect, bogged down in the Balkans. That is almost a third of our entire U.S. Army. They are bogged down in the Balkans with no end in sight. As the distinguished Senator has pointed out, it is hard to keep the peace when there is no peace to keep. 
   I think also fascinating is his point that some 75 percent of our young Americans in active duty military service joined the service since 1989. All they have known is turmoil, deployments, commitments, time away from their family. I think that is a powerful point and one of the things that stresses and strains our American military today. 
   That brings us to the floor today on this key question of trust, trust in the leadership, especially the civilian leadership of this Government, and trying to increase that trust among our young men and women deployed all over the world. His point is certainly well taken today, that if we don't judiciously use the American military, then we will see it attrited over time to where we cannot use it. So that element of trust is a key element that I keep close to my heart. I appreciate the Senator mentioning it. 
   The distinguished Senator mentioned that next Monday is Memorial Day, May 29. Pursuant to a joint resolution approved by the Congress in 1950, the President of the United States will issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe a day of prayer for permanent peace in remembrance of all those brave Americans who have died in our Nation's service. That is what Memorial Day is supposed to be all about--a day of remembrance. As someone who almost wound up on the Vietnam veteran wall, I can say that Memorial Day honoring those who never made it back from our wars is something special to me. 
   With this, our fourth discussion on the role of the United States in today's world, Senator ROBERTS and I come to what is probably the core issue motivating us to take on this entire project. The key question is, Under what circumstances should the Government of the United States employ military force as an instrument of national policy? I can think of no more fitting subject for the Congress to contemplate as we prepare for the Memorial Day recess. 
   We have quoted Clausewitz, the great German theoretician on war, numerous times, but this is a quote that I think is appropriate as we approach Memorial Day. Clausewitz said of war,  
   Kind-hearted people might of course think there was some ingenious way to disarm or defeat an enemy without too much bloodshed, and might imagine this is the true goal of the art of war. Pleasant as it sounds, it is a fallacy that must be exposed: war is such a dangerous business that the mistakes which come from kindness are the very worst ..... It would be futile--even wrong--to try to shut one's eyes to what war really is from sheer distress of its brutality.  
   General Sherman said it best: War is hell. For those who participate they understand it must only be undertaken under the most serious circumstances. My partner in these dialogues, the distinguished Senator from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS, has often cited the following quotation from one of my personal heroes, Senator Richard B. Russell, from thirty years ago, during the war in Vietnam. At that time I was serving in that war. Senator Russell said:  
   While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards to life and limb in pursuing them. As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support and protection of which we are capable.  
   That was Senator Russell 30 years ago. As Senator ROBERTS has observed, ``That is a most powerful statement of truth that has direct applications to the challenges we face today ..... The only thing that has changed is that today we refer to American men and women.'' 
   I share Senator ROBERTS' sentiment completely. 
   Richard Haass, a former official in the Bush administration and now director of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, and also someone whom both Senator ROBERTS and I have frequently cited during these discussions, has written a wonderful primer called ``Intervention, The Use of American Military Force in the Post-Cold War World.'' In it Mr. Haass provides an overview of the evolution of American thinking about intervention, followed by an analysis of current policies on the subject and a set of pragmatic guidelines which Mr. Haass proposes to improve the conduct of future American interventions. It is well worth the attention of every Member of this distinguished body. 
   Mr. Haass writes:  
   The changes intrinsic to the post-Cold War world have created new, intense conflicts that complicate any prospective use of force by the United States. On the other hand, a number of political and technological developments enhance opportunities for the United States to use its military might effectively........But if there are new reasons as well as new opportunities for the United States to use force, there are no longer any clear guidelines for when and how to do it........Intervening too often poses an obvious danger. Any government indulging in what might be described as wanton uses of force would be guilty of acting irresponsibly, particularly toward those in uniform........At the same time, setting too high a bar against intervention has costs as well. Defining interests too narrowly or prerequisites for employing force too broadly would be tantamount to adopting a policy of isolationism.  
   In my view, this is a very lucid discussion of where we are and of the difficult choices we face when--and unfortunately I must add if--the Congress of the United States is included in these deliberations on intervention. We saw these issues largely recapitulated here on the Senate floor as recently as last week with our belated but still illuminating debate on the ongoing Kosovo intervention. 
   I wish my distinguished friend from Kansas and I could have had that kind of debate before we engaged in the first military strike in Kosovo. I still remember well, as the Senator from Kansas has indicated, virtually by the time we got the ball here in the Senate, the prestige of the United States and NATO was already at stake. The horse was already out of the barn. We debated military intervention into Kosovo, an offensive strike by NATO, which is a basically defensive military organization--we debated it here only a couple of days. We had a very fine debate, pro and con, about the future of that military engagement in Kosovo in the last few days. Those debates will continue as long as that force is there, and properly so. But our point here is let's make those debates on the floor of the Senate before we commit military force, and not after.  
   As I mentioned before, the Haass book also offers a useful presentation on the evolution of American thinking on intervention, starting with our heritage under what he calls Christian ``just wars,'' or the ``just war'' theory as enunciated by such luminaries as St. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and others. As defined by Haass, under this approach, ``wars are considered to be just if they are fought for a worthy cause, likely to achieve it, sponsored by legitimate authority, undertaken as a 
   last resort, and conducted in a way that uses no more force than necessary or proportionate and that respects the welfare of noncombatants.'' 
   While the ``just war'' theory has never been the sole criterion by which America or other western nations have waged war, it is nonetheless still a standard moral benchmark, if you will, which we can and should apply to individual proposed interventions. It is something we ought to keep in mind. 
   As we have discussed before in this series, the end of World War II and the onset of the cold war produced great tension, the threat of a global nuclear Armageddon, and a vast expenditure of resources. But it also created a very clear standard of military interventionism for the United States; namely, the containment of the Soviet Union and its allies. It was under this overall framework that the two largest post-World War II American interventions took place, in Korea and Vietnam. 
   The eminent military historian of the war in Vietnam, Colonel Harry G. Summers, Jr., discussed the failure--on many different levels--of that American intervention in his book ``On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Context.'' 
   I have read this book thoroughly. I just wish I had read it before I went to Vietnam and not after. 
   It is not my purpose today to revisit that conflict in detail, but for purposes of today's discussion on the general subject of American intervention abroad, let me quote briefly from Summers' work. He says:  
   By our own definition, we failed to properly employ our Armed Forces so as to secure U.S. national objectives in Vietnam. Our strategy failed the ultimate test, for, as Clausewitz said, the ends of strategy, in the final analysis ``are those objectives that will finally lead to peace.''  
   Given the magnitude of our defeat in Vietnam, and attendant human, financial, and political costs, there was a very understandable recoiling from military interventionism in the public and Congress, among various Presidential administrations and among the American military itself. Nearly a decade passed from the end of U.S. combat participation in Vietnam in 1973 until the deployment of the U.S. Marines as part of the Multinational Force in Lebanon in August of 1982. However, this was also a period when many of the post-cold-war conditions described by Haass as facilitating U.S. interventions were first taking hold, including the diminution of the Soviet/Warsaw Pact threat, the development of greater U.S. capacity to sustain long-distance military operations, and the resurgence of national and ethnic tensions around the globe. 
   A little less than a decade after the Lebanon debacle, in the aftermath of other interventions in Grenada in 1983, Libya in 1986, Panama in 1989-1990, and in the 1990-1991 timeframe in the gulf war, and after the final end of the cold war, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Colin Powell, who had lived through this entire era, propounded a list of six questions which must be addressed before we commit to a military intervention. 
   I submit General Powell's summation here is a summation based on his own experience and his own history in looking at this turbulent time. 
   No. 1, is the political objective important, clearly defined, and well understood? 
   No. 2, have all nonviolent means been tried and failed? 
   No. 3, will military force achieve the objective? 
   No. 4, what will be the cost? 
   Next, Have the gains and risks been thoroughly analyzed? 
   Next, After the intervention, how will the situation likely evolve and what will the consequences be? 
   That is, I guess, my biggest problem with some of our interventions. We have not thought through the end game, sometimes called the exit strategy. But what would be the result of failure? What will be the result of success? I am not sure we are thinking through our interventions. 
   In a similar vein, falling on the side of what I would call restraint with respect to U.S. military interventions, in 1993, then-Secretary of State Warren Christopher outlined four prerequisites for the use of force by the United States: 
   No. 1, the presence of clearly articulated objectives; 
   No. 2, a high probability of success; 
   No. 3, the likelihood of congressional and public support; and No. 4, the inclusion of a clear exit strategy. 
   Not bad advice. However, even before the start of the Clinton administration, developments in Africa and in the Balkans were leading to a reassessment of the limits on U.S. military interventions. At the same time his administration was deciding in favor of intervention in Somalia but against military involvement in Bosnia, President Bush articulated a somewhat lower bar for U.S. military intervention. As described by Haass:  
   Bush argued for a case-by-case approach in deciding when and where to use force. He argued against using interests as an absolute guide, noting that ``military force may not be the best way of safeguarding something vital, while using force might be the best way to protect an interest that qualifies as important but less than vital.''  
   That is Haass.  
   Instead, Bush set out five requirements for military intervention to make sense: force should only be used, he said, where the stakes warrant it, where and when it can be effective, where the application can be limited in scope and time, and where the benefits justify the potential costs and sacrifice. Multilateral support is desirable but not essential. What is essential in every case is a clear and achievable mission, a realistic plan for accomplishing the mission, and realistic criteria for withdrawing U.S. forces once the mission is complete.  
   That is a pretty thorough analysis of the thought process that must be undergone if we are to be successful in our interventions. 
   During the Clinton administration, there have been military interventions in Iraq on several occasions, and continuing to this day: In Somalia from 1992 to 1995, in Bosnia and Macedonia since 1993, in Haiti from 1993 to 1996, in Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998, and of course in Kosovo beginning last year. 
   There has been an accompanying evolution away from the more restrictive view of interventions expressed by Secretary Christopher and toward the less restrictive stance perhaps expressed most clearly recently by British Prime Minister Blair in an April speech last year in Chicago. 
   Prime Minister Blair said:  
   The principle of non-interference must be qualified in important respects. Acts of genocide can never be a purely internal matter. When oppression produces massive flows of refugees which unsettle neighboring countries then they can probably be described as ``threats to international peace and security. .....'' So how do we decide when and whether to intervene. I think we need to bear in mind five major considerations. First, are we sure of our case? War is an imperfect instrument for righting humanitarian distress, but armed force is sometimes the only means of dealing with dictators. Second, have we exhausted all diplomatic options? Third, on the basis of a practical assessment of the situation, are there military operations we can sensibly and prudently undertake? Fourth, are we prepared for the long term? In the past, we talked too much about exit strategies. But having made a commitment we cannot simply walk away once the fight is over, better to stay with moderate numbers of troops--  
   Does that sound familiar?  
   than return for repeat performances with large numbers. And finally, do we have national interests involved? The mass expulsion of ethnic Albanians from Kosovo demanded the notice of the rest of the world. But it does make a difference that this is taking place in such a combustible part of Europe.  
   That is the end of Blair's statement. Interesting. 
   Clearly, we have come a long way from Vietnam, and today's world is quite different than the world of the sixties and seventies. Questions about the use of force are, by their very nature, difficult ones. There are no easy answers and no easy choices for any President, and certainly not us in the Congress. Part of this is a product of the disorderly post-cold-war order, or a new world disorder. Every American and every inhabitant of this planet is certainly better off than we were in the cold war which threatened the very survival of global civilization. That  ended, but the termination of that phase of international politics has made the world actually more complex for foreign policymakers. 
   In the cold war, the superpower rivalry and its mutually assured destruction doctrine, in terms of nuclear war, imposed strong constraints on interventions by either superpower. Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan were notable exceptions. 
   In the pre-cold-war history of the United States, the question of U.S. intervention outside of the Western Hemisphere rarely arose, short of a Pearl Harbor or a Lusitania incident that began the First World War. In the new post-cold-war disorder, we largely face only self-imposed constraints to our actions abroad. Thus, we now need answer only whether we should undertake such an action, not whether we can do so. 
   That is a clear distinction. In the cold war, we had a line that we knew we could not cross or should not cross. Now there are no lines. If my colleagues read Tom Friedman in the book ``Lexus and the Olive Tree,'' barriers of all kinds, not only the Berlin Wall, are coming down all over the world. So the question more and more on American intervention is, Should we do it? What Senator ROBERTS and I are trying to say is that it is not only a Presidential decision, it is a decision in which all of us have to participate and, hopefully, one that we can arrive at a consensus on before we send young Americans into harm's way. That is why we are here. That is why we are taking the Senate's time today. 
   The two administrations which have confronted the post-Soviet Union world have grappled mightily with the complexities in places such as Iraq, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Haiti, and now Kosovo. And almost every step in these areas have been subjected to questioning and controversy before, during, and after the operation in question. Opposition to the Presidential policies has not offered a clear-cut alternative, with some opponents calling for greater and some for lesser exertions of American power. As I have said before on several occasions, I approach the debate on intervention with the greatest respect for the difficulties which the current or, indeed, any other post-cold-war administration and Congress must face when deciding Americans should go to war. 
   However, I must say that I believe any departure from the principle of using our military intervention solely in defense of vital national interests is a slippery slope. Let me say that again. I have to say that I personally believe that any departure from the principle of using American military intervention solely in defense of vital national interests is a slippery slope. Let's recall from our previous discussions the very small ``A'' list of truly vital interests. As articulated by the 1996 Commission on America's National Interests--and Senator ROBERTS and I are engaging ourselves with that commission that is cranking up again and we hope to have some input--the Commission on America's National Interests articulated that those interests are ``strictly necessary to safeguard and enhance the well-being of Americans in a free and secure Nation,'' and include only the following: Prevent, deter, and reduce the threat of nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons attacks on the United States. That is simple. That is clear. 
   Two, prevent the emergence of a hostile hegemon in Europe or Asia. As Senator ROBERTS the other day said, hegemon means the big bully, the lead dog, the big dog. 
   Three, prevent the emergence of a hostile major power on U.S. borders or in control of the seas. 
   Four, prevent the catastrophic collapse of major global systems such as trade, financial markets, supplies of energy, and so forth. 
   Five, ensure the survival of U.S. allies. 
   In pursuit of these objectives, the ``United States should be prepared to commit itself to fight,'' the commission says, ``even if it has to do so unilaterally and without the assistance of allies.'' I understand my friend and colleague, Senator ROBERTS, says this list might be slightly modified and updated by a new commission, but the content will basically be similar. 
   In short, I believe we can and must be prepared to commit all available American resources--including military forces--in the defense of truly vital national interests. In such cases, I believe Presidents should seek congressional approval, and I cannot imagine a Congress not granting such authority in these cases. But in all other cases, I believe we have to impose a much higher bar before we put American service men and women into harm's way--a much higher bar and a much higher standard than we have used in the last 10 or 15 years. 
   General Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, put it beautifully in an address to the Kennedy School at Harvard recently:  
   In every case when we contemplate the use of force, we should consider a number of important questions. These are not new questions, as most are articulated formally in the National Security Strategy. They are: 
   Is there a clearly defined mission? 
   Is the mission achievable, and are we applying the necessary means to decisively achieve it? 
   Do we have milestones against which we can measure or judge our effectiveness? 
   Is there an exit strategy? Or, put another way, a strategy for success within a reasonable period? 
   Do we have an alternate course of action should the military action fail or take too long? 
   Are we willing to resource for the long haul? 
   If our military efforts are successful, are the appropriate national and international agencies prepared to take advantage of the success of the intervention?  
   We see that in the Balkans right now.  
   Have we conducted the up-front coordination with our allies, friends, and international institutions to ensure our response elicits the necessary regional support to ensure long-term success?  
   These are powerful questions, as articulated by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
   He goes on to say:  
   The military is the hammer in America's foreign policy toolbox.......and it is a very powerful hammer. But not every problem we face is a nail.  
   That is critical.  
   We may find that sorting out the good guys from the bad is not as easy as it seems. We also may find that getting in is much easier than getting out.  
   Boy, is that true.  
   These are the issues we need to confront when we make the decision to commit our military forces. And that is as it should be because, when we use our military forces, we lay our prestige, our word, our leadership and--most importantly--the lives of our young Americans on the line.  
   As we approach Memorial Day, where we pay tribute and honor to those young Americans who have given their lives in the past, we must think carefully and judiciously how we commit young Americans in the future in terms of American military intervention in the world. 
   Americans who serve today on the front lines in the service of this great Nation in Korea, Kosovo, Bosnia, Saudi Arabia, and elsewhere around the globe, are very special Americans. They have volunteered to do this duty for the rest of us. 
   When we return from the Memorial Day break, Senator ROBERTS and I will resume these dialogs with a discussion of Clausewitz's trinity of warmaking. He said, successfully war is prosecuted if you have three things together: the people, the government, and the military. 
   Marching forward arm in arm is what we are all about. That will be the subject of our next discussion. 
   I yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, my partner, my dear friend, Mr. PAT ROBERTS.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend the United States Postal Service for receiving two distinguished awards for its Celebrate the Century Express Educational Train Tour. I would like to thank Mr. Gary A. Thuro, Jr., Manager, Promotions, and Mr. Ernest Cascino, Jr., Project Manager, for bringing the awards to my attention. The United States Postal Service deserves special recognition for receiving the Department of Transportation's Design for Transportation National Award of Merit and the Transportation Marketing & Communications Association's 2000 Award of Excellence. 
   Both awards were presented in recognition of the United States Postal Service's Celebrate the Century Express Train which is a specially outfitted four-car Amtrak train and traveling postal history exhibition that serves as the ``iron ambassador'' of the Celebrate the Century commemorative stamp and education program. The train is a rolling history museum, presenting the story of how the mails and rails helped develop our country and, highlighting some of the most significant people, places and events of the 20th century. 
   Over its 18-month tour from March 1999 to fall 2000, the Celebrate the Century Express will visit dozens of communities across the nation, from the biggest cities to the smallest towns. In 1999, the train traveled over nearly 13,000 miles of track, visiting 36 cities in 18 states and being viewed by more than 150,000 people, including thousands of schoolchildren. The train is expected to make at least 36 stops this year before concluding its two-year run in November 2000. 
   The Design for Transportation National Awards 2000 honor those facilities and activities that exemplify the highest standards of design and have made an outstanding contribution to the nation's transportation systems and the people they serve. The United States Postal Service received a Merit Award (which is only given every 5 years) for achieving a high level of design quality for its Celebrate the Century Express. The Postal Service is among 30 winners out of more than 300 entries and is the only recipient to receive an award for any type of vehicle. 
   The Transportation Marketing & Communications Association's Transportation Communicators Award program, also known as the ``Tranny'' Awards, recognizes excellence in communications programs in the transportation and logistics industries. The program recognizes individual practitioners who apply solid communications principles and creativity to effectively promote the goals of their organizations. The United States Postal Service received an Award of Excellence in the category of ``best practices in special events'' and was one of 18 winners out of more than 150 entries.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that would authorize the President to present a Gold Medal on behalf of Congress to former President Jimmy Carter and former First Lady Rosalynn Carter in recognition of their service to the Nation. I would like to thank Senator COVERDELL for co-sponsoring this bill and extend an invitation to all our other colleagues to join us in supporting this legislation to award these two great Americans with Congress' highest honor. 
   It is widely agreed that President Jimmy Carter and his wife Rosalynn Carter have distinguished records of public service to the American people and the international community. Internationally, the Carters have been involved in a number of public service initiatives ranging from combating famine in Sub-Sahara Africa and encouraging better health care in Third World nations to serving as mediators in an effort to end civil wars in half a dozen countries. President Carter has monitored numerous foreign elections in an effort to spread democracy throughout the world.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the information highway began just a few years ago as a footpath and is now an unlimited lane expressway with no rush hour. People can now use the Internet to shop at virtual stores located thousands of miles away, find turn-by-turn directions to far away destinations and journey to hamlets, cities and states across the country--and indeed around the world--without ever leaving home. 
   While the virtual world is available to us with a few key strokes and mouse clicks, there is one area of the Internet that many are finding troublesome. It is the collection and use of personnel data. All too often web surfers are providing personal information about themselves at the websites they visit, without their knowledge and consent. There is so much information being collected every day that it would take a building the size of the Library of Congress to store it all in. That is a lot of information, much of which is very personal and I believe it must be kept that way. 
   Concern about one's privacy on the Internet is keeping people from fully enjoying this marvelous technology. According to a recent survey by the Center for Democracy & Technology, consumers' most pressing privacy issues are the sale of personal information and tracking people's use of the Web. In another recent survey, 66.7 percent of online ``window shoppers'' state that assurances of privacy will be the basis for their making online purchases. These surveys make the same point that was made when credit cards were first introduced to the American public. Back then, credit cards did not initially enjoy widespread usage because of a fear that others could misuse the card. From these studies' findings it can be reasoned that the Internet is experiencing the same effects because of privacy concerns. These concerns are translating into lost opportunity, for consumers as well as electronic businesses. 
   Most of the Dot Com companies doing business over the Internet today are very cognizant of the fact that privacy is a major concern for their customers. Many of these firms allow visitors to their web site to ``opt out,'' or elect not to provide data they consider private and do not wish to give. A Federal Trade Commission May 2000 Report to Congress found that 92 percent of a random sampling of websites were collecting great amounts of personal information from consumers and only 14% disclosed anything about how the information would be used. More interesting in this report was the finding that a mere 41% of the randomly selected websites notified the visitor of their information practices and offered the visitor choices on how their personal identifying information would be used. These report findings seem to suggest that industry efforts by themselves are not sufficient to control the gathering and dissemination of personal data. 
   There are some Dot Coms that are not concerned about the privacy of their customers. These firms are successfully collecting enormous amounts of data about a person and in turn sell it to others or use it to intensify the advertising aimed at that person. At one website visit, a company can collect some very interesting facts about the person who is on the other end. While surfing the web the other day, I hit on a website that was designed to provide me with information about my PC. The report the site provided opened my eyes about the types of information that could be obtained from a website visitor in less one minute. In this small amount of time it could tell what other sites I had visited, what sites I would likely visit in the future, what plug-ins are installed on my PC, how my domain is configured and a whole lot more information that I did not understand. Many consider this type of tracking capability akin to stalking. I believe that the information that can be collected by website administrators can create problems for people through a violation of trust and an invasion of privacy. Novice Internet users are generally unaware, as I was until visiting this site, of the extent of the information being collected on them. Even those who are aware of the capabilities of firms to collect private data are frightened by what can happen with the information once it is collected. 
   I am proud to be cosponsoring the Consumer Privacy Protection Act of 2000 that was introduced today by Senator HOLLINGS. This Act will legitimize the practices currently being used by many reputable firms who are collecting private data. Does it seem unreasonable that firms collecting private data should notify consumers of the firm's information practices, offer the consumer choices on how the personal information will be used, allow consumers to access the information that is collected on them and require the firms to take reasonable steps to protect the security of the information that is collected? I think not. Firms like Georgia-based VerticalOne are already performing under standards very similar to these. I believe that all firms should be held to the same standard and that a level playing field should be established for every firm that is collecting data. Taking these actions will translate into greater consumer confidence in the Internet. 
   Increasing the level of protection for private information to a level that the people of our nation can live with should be a welcome relief to those firms already providing fair privacy treatment of their site visitors. This Act certainly will be a relief to the people who are visiting their sites.  Passing this Consumer Privacy Protection Act will help prevent confusion by establishing a common set of standards for all firms to follow and all Americans to enjoy.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I echo the marvelous remarks of the distinguished Senator from Wyoming, and my seatmate, the great distinguished Senator from Wisconsin, and others who support the Byrd-Warner amendment. 
   The question is, simply put: Will the Congress of the United States step forward and help this Government articulate an exit strategy of our military might out of Kosovo and out of the Balkans ultimately or will we not? 
   I just got back from a trip to Western Europe, particularly to Kosovo. I visited Brussels. I talked to NATO leaders. I visited the Aviano Air Base in Italy where I met with some who flew the incredible air missions in the war. I went to Macedonia and saw the areas where more than 100,000 refugees were, and into Kosovo itself and up on the Serbian border. We then exited through London. I came back with a definite impression that unless this country articulates its own exit strategy, particularly for our military forces, there will be no exit strategy. Our allies are quite willing for us to stay there forever and ever and ever. 
   I met with the distinguished Deputy Secretary General of NATO in Brussels. He looked at me and said: I can't count on one hand the number of years NATO will have to be in Kosovo. People in the United States have to accept that you are a European power whether you like it or not, both in Europe and the Balkans. 
   I believe very strongly that we have borne the brunt of war. Seventy percent of the air missions in that war in Kosovo were ours. It was American airpower and American mobility and technology that actually won that war. I supported that. I voted on the floor of this great body for air and missile strikes against Milosevic. I have also voted for the accession of the Czech Republic, Poland, and Hungary to come into NATO. I, by no means, want to abdicate the role of the United States in filling the power vacuum in Eastern Europe left by the fall of the Soviet Union. By the same token, I came back with a couple of clear senses that I carry in my mind of what our American role should be. First, before we went in a helicopter into Kosovo, an Army colonel said: Look out the windows. There is a Roman aqueduct. I thought: I'm flying over terrain where Alexander the Great and his father, Philip II, made wars in Macedonia and that part of the world in 300 B.C. Then the Romans were there. Later the Turks were there. And now we are there. 
   I respectfully submit, what thousands of years of foreign occupation have failed to do to that area, we will fail to do. So I specifically support the Byrd-Warner language which allows 75 percent of the more than $2 billion contained in the supplemental appropriations title for Kosovo operations to be released immediately and unconditionally for such operations. 
   I do support these operations now. But the remaining 25 percent would be withheld pending a certification by the President, due by July 15 of this year, that our European allies are making significant progress in meeting their overall commitments for economic reconstruction, humanitarian assistance, administrative expenses, and police forces for Kosovo. 
   I understand our European allies did not have the capability, in terms of technology or maneuverability or mobility, to mass in an offensive attack against the forces of Milosevic. But I also understand they do have the ability to provide economic reconstruction aid. As a matter of fact, the European Union is stepping forward with $2.3 billion. I applaud that. They have the capability for humanitarian assistance, and that is forthcoming. They do have the ability to provide police forces for Kosovo. These are things our European allies can do and should do. 
   Furthermore, the amendment requires the President to develop and report to the Congress a plan to turn over all peacekeeping operations in Kosovo to those allies by July 1, 2001. This is the plan that is due by July 1, 2001, not the withdrawal of American forces. But at least this is a plan; it is an exit strategy. 
   How do we get to this point? The U.S. Constitution says the Congress declares war. The Congress raises money for our Army and our Navy. It is the Congress that is the ultimate, final authority on whether young men and women are committed in harm's way. 
   Finally, by that day, July 1, 2001, the Byrd-Warner language requires the termination of funding for the continued deployment of U.S. ground combat troops in Kosovo unless the President seeks and obtains specific congressional authorization for a continuation of such deployment. 
   I am open to reasoned argument by any President on our role there, but I think the Congress ought to make that decision. 
   As Senator WARNER said in explaining the authors' intent, the Byrd-Warner language reflects two concerns:  
   the indefinite commitment of our troops into the Kosovo situation and that indefinite commitment not being backed up by the affirmative action of the Congress of the United States which has a clear responsibility to act when we send young men and women in harm's way.  
   I have just returned from a trip to Brussels and Kosovo where I met with key military leaders from the U.S., European nations and NATO. On that trip, I was discussing the role of the United States in Europe with the Deputy Secretary of NATO, Sergio Balanzio, when he told me that the United States is, ``a European power whether you like it or not--not only in Europe but in the Balkans too.'' I responded that it is one thing to be on the point of the spear and to bear the heavy load in certain cases, as the U.S. did in Bosnia and Kosovo, but quite another to always be called upon to ride to the rescue, even in Europe itself. 
   A large portion of the military operation in Kosovo was supplied by the United States, and I believe it is now time to ``Europeanize'' the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo. While the soldiers I spoke with at Camp Bondsteel certainly displayed high morale, reflected in the excellent job they have done, if we stay in the Balkans indefinitely, with no clear way out, I believe we run an increasing risk of further overextending our military thus exacerbating our recruitment and retention problems and lessening our capability to respond to more serious challenges to our vital national interests. The Byrd-Warner amendment will help Europeanize the peace, unless and until a compelling and vital American interest can be identified which would justify our continued deployment of ground forces, and I will be pleased to support it. 
   However, I must add that, while this amendment does indeed address our military problem in Kosovo and does indeed reassert the constitutional responsibilities of Congress with respect to that problem, it does not address the underlying situation in Kosovo and is silent on the similar problem right across the border in Bosnia. From my perspective, the basic problem in the Balkans today is political, not military, and requires a political rather than military solution. And, in the  same way as the United States took the lead in military operations, it is now time for the U.S. to lead in finding a political solution. Essentially, at this point in time, the various communities wish to live apart and exercise self-determination along ethnic lines. I would agree that such a development is unfortunate and not in keeping with our American view of the way the world should be. However, for any solution to the current situation to be acceptable to the parties directly involved--and thus durable--this inescapable fact must be taken into account. 
   On June 30 of last year, the Senate accepted by voice vote my amendment to the foreign operations appropriations bill which expressed ``the sense of the Senate that the United States should call immediately for the convening of an international conference on the Balkans'' to develop a final political settlement of both the Kosovo and Bosnia conflicts.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I truly believe that such an approach is best, if not the only, way to resolve the difficulties in Bosnia and Kosovo--allowing our troops eventually to come home but avoiding an unacceptable security vacuum in southeast Europe--and is definitely in the best interest of the United States and Europe.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, forty-six years ago today, the U.S. Supreme Court in its Brown vs. Board of Education of Topeka decision overturned an 1896 ruling that education should be ``separate but equal'' thus outlawing racial segregation in the state school system. It is important to note that when the ``separate but equal'' ruling first went into effect in 1896, there were very few colleges and universities that women could attend. This means that ``separate but equal'' meant for men only. 
   Some forty-one years before colleges like the Georgia College and State University was founded in 1889, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, an eminent women's rights leader, drafted a Declaration of Sentiments that pointed to other areas of life where American women were not treated equally. Some of the facts at that time were: 
   Women were not allowed to vote; 
   Women had to submit to laws they had no voice in formulating; 
   Married women had no property rights; 
   Divorce and child custody laws favored men, giving no rights to women; 
   Most occupations were closed to women, including medicine and law; and 
   Women had no means to gain an education since no college or university would accept women students. 
   Through the efforts of Ms. Stanton and others, colleges and universities began to be established with the mission of preparing the women of our nation to become self-sufficient by affording them an opportunity for an education. Today, many of these colleges and universities are continuing to provide educational opportunities to women to enable them to continue making significant contributions to our country by becoming writers, educators, scientists, heads of state, politicians, civil rights crusaders, artists, entertainers, and business leaders. However, some of the historic buildings that were built between 1884 and 1908 as institutions of higher learning for women are beginning to crumble and decay. 
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of legislation introduced today by Senator SESSIONS which was crafted to allow the preservation and restoration of treasured historic school buildings. The legislation will provide seven colleges and universities with $10 million each for five years to help ensure that some historically significant buildings that were built between 1884 and 1908 at women's public colleges and universities continue to serve as national symbols of women's early civil rights and as important monuments to the power that knowledge has brought to America's women. I'd like to note that the amounts needed to fully rejuvenate the buildings to their former glory is far greater than those provided by this legislation. 
   The list of institutions that need this assistance is quite impressive. One of the seven universities included in this bill is the Georgia College and State University which is located in Georgia's antebellum capital, Milledgeville. The University was chartered in 1889 as the Georgia Normal and Industrial College and its early emphasis was on preparing young women for teaching or industrial careers. From the beginning of this prestigious school, the jewels of the university campus have been the former State Governor's mansion and the old Baldwin County Court House. General Sherman, while occupying the  city of Milledgeville, slept in the mansion and refused to allow it to be burned because he was so impressed with its stateliness. The stately court house and former Governor's mansion, while continuing to be used by the university, are in dire need of repair. The $10 million included in the bill for the Georgia College and State University will go a long way toward helping to pay the estimated $27 million repair cost for these, and other treasured campus buildings. 
   Today the Georgia College and State University's enrollment has grown to an impressive 5,200 students. The institution is now offering more than 65 baccalaureate and 35 graduate degree programs and awards more than 1,100 degrees annually, of which 300 are graduate degrees. 
   It seems that we are living in a disposable world. We have disposable towels, disposable cameras, and disposable contact lenses. Let us not dispose of these buildings or the history they represent. I believe that the college and university campus buildings that are to be preserved and restored by this legislation will continue to serve our nation well by continuing to provide quality education for the leaders of tomorrow.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator ROBERTS, to continue our dialog on the global role of the United States. This is the third such dialog in what we have intended to be a year-long series. In February, we began by taking a broad look at the priorities and approaches of U.S. foreign policy in the post-cold-war period. A few weeks ago we narrowed the focus somewhat by trying to define and defend our national interest, which must be the first step in arriving at a coherent national security strategy. 
   Today, as we start to go from general principles to concrete applications, Senator ROBERTS and I, along with several of our colleagues, will attempt to zero in on the U.S. role in multilateral organizations which strongly impact our national security, especially NATO and the U.N. 
   I have just returned from a trip to Brussels and Italy where we were briefed on the air campaign from Aviano Air Base. In Brussels, I met with the Deputy Secretary General of NATO. As I said, Italy and then on to Macedonia, where we saw the regions where the refugees were kept during the war in Kosovo. Then, into Kosovo itself. 
   I met with key military leaders and key political leaders from the United States, European nations, and NATO. These meetings only served to reinforce my strong belief that there is a pressing need to address the global role of the United States, both in our own national strategic planning and in NATO's planning. This conclusion is not a result of the recent actions taken in Serbia and Kosovo. Rather, these actions were merely symptomatic of, I think, the problem. 
   A large portion of the military operation in Kosovo was supplied by the United States. I believe it is now time for the United States to lead in finding a political solution. Similarly, I believe the time has come to ``Europeanize'' the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo. While the soldiers I spoke with at Camp Bond steel certainly displayed high morale, reflected in the excellent job they actually have done, if we stay in the Balkans indefinitely with no clear way out, I believe we run an increasing risk of further overextending our military, thus exacerbating our recruitment and retention problems and lessening our capability to respond to more serious challenges to our vital national interests. 
   From my perspective, the 
   basic problem in the Balkans today is political, not military, and requires a political rather than military solution. Essentially, at this point in time, the various communities wish to live apart and exercise self-determination along ethnic lines. I would agree that such a development is unfortunate and not in keeping with our American view of the way the world should be. However, for any solution to the current situation to be acceptable to the parties directly involved--and, thus, durable--this inescapable fact must be taken into account. 
   On June 30 of last year, the Senate accepted by voice vote my amendment to the Foreign Operations Appropriations bill which expressed ``the sense of the Senate that the United States should call immediately for the convening of an international conference on the Balkans'' to develop a final political settlement of both the Kosovo and Bosnia conflicts.

   Mr. CLELAND. I truly believe that such an approach is the best, if not the only, way to resolve the difficulties in Bosnia and Kosovo--allowing our troops eventually to come home but avoiding an unacceptable security vacuum in southeast Europe--and is definitely in the best interest of the United States and Europe. 
   Two years ago this week, the Senate was debating the expansion of NATO, and I should add that I found that discussion to be perhaps the finest deliberation on national security issues that I have witnessed in the time I have served in the U.S. Senate. The debate raised serious questions regarding both the makeup and purpose of NATO, but, in the end, I, and a large majority of the Senate, concluded that extension of NATO membership to Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary was in our, and NATO's, best interest because NATO was the only entity ready and able to fill the security void in northeastern Europe. 
   Much has changed in the time since that vote, including the launching of the first offensive military operations in the history of the alliance last year in Kosovo and Serbia, an action which also represented the first time NATO asserted the right to intervene in the internal affairs of a sovereign nation. Both of these were significant departures from the Senate's understanding of NATO as expressed during that debate as well as the representations we made to other nations, most notably Russia, about the goals and the intentions of NATO in the aftermath its eastward expansion. Specifically, section 3 of the Senate Resolution of Ratification affirmed that the ``core mission'' of NATO remains ``collective self-defense,'' and we sought to calm Russian anxieties by pointing to the 50-year record of NATO in never launching offensive operations, and never violating the sovereignty of states except in pursuit of collective self-defense. 
   Since we voted for NATO expansion we have also witnessed the issuance of a new Strategic Concept for NATO, in April of 1999, and here again, the results were not exactly as anticipated at the time of the Senate's ratification vote on NATO expansion 2 years ago. For a particularly insightful and detailed treatment of this subject, I would commend to all Senators a May 24, 1999 floor statement by my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Mr. ROBERTS, which 
   dissected in some detail the numerous departures from the Senate's 1998 Resolution of Ratification in the April 1999 NATO Strategic Concept. 
   For purposes of today's discussion on how multilateral organizations impact on the U.S. global role, I would like to highlight just two of the issues identified by Senator ROBERTS: the central issue of NATO's purpose, or ``core mission,'' and the matter of how European nations should provide for their own defense, the so-called European Security and Defense Identity. 
   For its first 50 years, which culminated in its victory in the Cold War without ever having to fight a battle, the core purpose of NATO, recognized by friend and foe alike, was set forth in article 5 of the North Atlantic treaty of April 4, 1949:  
   The Parties agree that an armed attack against one or more of them in Europe or North America shall be considered an attack against them all and consequently they agree that, if such an armed attack occurs, each of them, in exercise of the right of individual or collective self-defense recognized by Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations, will assist the party or parties so attacked by taking forthwith, individually and  in concert with other Parties, such action as it deems necessary, including the use of armed force, to restore and maintain the security of the North Atlantic area.  
   In contrast, the new NATO Strategic Concept goes well beyond the traditional collective security role in its aspirations for NATO. Item 24 in the April 24, 1999 text states that:  
   Any armed attack on the territory of the Allies, from whatever direction, would be covered by Article 5 and 6 of the Washington Treaty. However, Alliance security must also take account of the global context. Alliance security interests can be affected by other risks of a wider nature, including acts of terrorism, sabotage, and organized crime, and by the disruption of the flow of vital resources.  
   I wonder if NATO is designed to track terrorism around the world, sabotage around the world, and organized crime around the world. 
   I continue to quote:  
   The uncontrolled movement of large numbers of people, particularly as a consequence of armed conflicts, can also pose problems for security and stability affecting the Alliance.  
   Item 10 in that document includes as ``fundamental security tasks'' for NATO the traditional objectives of security, consultation, and deterrence and defense, as well as ``crisis management,'' within which allies are ``to stand ready, case-by-case and by consensus, in conformity of Article 7 of the Washington Treaty, to contribute to effective conflict prevention and to engage actively in crisis management, including crisis response operations.'' 
   I wonder if NATO has become not a self-defense organization but a crisis management and crisis intervention organization. I wonder. 
   I point out that Article 7 of the NATO Treaty says that:  
   This Treaty does not affect, and shall not be interpreted as affecting in any way the rights and obligations under the Charter of the Parties which are members of the United Nations, or the primary responsibility of the Security Council for the maintenance of international peace and security.  
   While some Western observers, especially in the United States, maintain that the 1999 Strategic Concept does not represent a significant change in NATO's policy, I believe that the Norwegian newspaper, Oslo Aftenposten, was much closer to the mark when it wrote last April that:  
   In its new ``strategic concept'' NATO has approved a radical expansion of the alliance's tasks, both geographically and with regard to content. From now on it will be the alliance's task to promote ``security and stability in the Euro-Atlantic area'' by ``becoming actively involved in dealing with crises, including operations in response to crises.'' We see the first example in Kosovo.  
   It is my view that the members of the NATO alliance, and especially the United States, need to think much more carefully about the expanded aspirations of their new strategic concept, and the costs--economic, political, and human resource--they are willing and able to pay in pursuit of these aspirations. Specifically, at the very least I believe both Houses of Congress, especially this House, the Senate, need to undertake a thorough series of hearings on the strategic concept and the future of NATO. 
   As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I could not urge this set of hearings more strongly. 
   The Norwegian paper goes on to say that:  
   It is also new and important that the alliance said ``yes'' at the summit meeting to the desire of the EU countries to play a more independent role and thus acquire greater political weight in the NATO cooperation. Behind this also lies a desire for a cautious counterweight to a United States that is perhaps more strongly dominant now, militarily and politically, than ever before in NATO's history.  
   Distinguished colleagues, this leads to my other major concern about the United States and NATO: the question of a ``more independent role'' for the European Union countries. John Keegan, one of the world's leading military historians, summed up the current debate in an article last December. He said:  
   Though it has long been American policy to encourage European political and economic integration on the model of its own federal structure, the United States is far less ready to welcome moves by the Europeans to go their own strategic way. There are two reasons for that. The first is that the United States sees its own security as inextricably bound up within the alliance system in which it is a partner. The second is that it doubts the ability of the Europeans to construct parallel systems which will deliver military value....... The Americans are right to regard all current European attempts, either through the European Union, or the belatedly revived Western European Union or through ad hoc arrangements such as the newly announced Anglo-French force, to bypass NATO as damaging to the security structure that already exists.  
   Despite its advances in economic integration, the European community still lags far behind in developing a common national security structure. As we witnessed in Bosnia, and most recently Kosovo, Europe lacks either the will or the means, or both, to conduct independent military operations even in its own backyard. And whatever the end result of the recent European Security and Defense Initiative, or Identity it will be many years before the Europeans can develop a military capable of significant action independent of the United States. When one adds the additional questions of national sovereignty, domestic pressures to cut defense spending, and, of course, the need for consensus on how and when to take military action, the challenges facing the Europeans are daunting indeed. 
   Until Europe can surmount these challenges, which, most likely, will be many years from now, American involvement and leadership via NATO will still be seen, by Europeans at least, as essential. On my recent trip, I was discussing the role of the United States in Europe with the Deputy Secretary of NATO, Sergio Balanzio, when he told me that the United States is, ``a European power whether you like it or not --obviously, indicating we are a European power, whether we like it or not, in Europe and in the Balkans. 
   I responded that it is one thing to be on the point of the spear and to bear the heavy load in certain cases, as the U.S. did in Bosnia and Kosovo, but quite another to always be called upon to ride to the rescue, even in Europe itself. 
   Going back to 1949, when NATO was formed, one of the quotes that rings in my ears is a quote from Lord Ismay, the first Secretary General of NATO. When he was asked the purpose of NATO, Lord Ismay said: The purpose of NATO is to keep the Americans in, the Russians out, and the Germans down. 
   I have serious reservations about that particular mission statement now. There is no need to keep the Russians out. As a matter of fact, we are wrapping our arms around the big bear in every way in every trade agreement, every cooperative agreement we can possibly put together. Secondly, there is no need to keep the Germans down. They are an emerging strong force on the European continent. 
   I wonder, though, having just come back from dealing with my NATO friends and our NATO allies, and having gone to Kosovo, whether the real ultimate purpose of NATO for the Europeans now is to keep the Americans in. 
   Personally, I do not mind sharing power. I do mind always being the lead dog that is called upon to bear the burden. I think more and more Americans are feeling that way themselves. 
   For me, however, the bottom line is that, despite all of the difficulties, despite the possibility that there may well be some short-term disadvantages for the United States, I believe the 
   United States must, I repeat must, be unequivocally supportive of the development of a strong, independent European military capability to accompany Europe's growing economic and political integration. There is at present, and for the foreseeable future, no overwhelming threat to European security such as that posed by the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact. Europe should be able to attend to its own defenses in the post-Cold War world. The fact that it has not done so is certainly attributable to many factors, especially its divided and conflict-ridden history, but if it does not act now--when the threat is so low--then when will it? 
   Developing the necessary support structures, both political and military, to produce an effective European security identity will be neither quick, nor easy, nor cheap. But they have to start sometime, and while the United States must avoid precipitous actions--such as threatening a unilateral troop pull-out--I believe we must clearly signal that we fully understand and support moves toward greater European self-defense capabilities. Such moves may well produce some short-term redundancies and inefficiencies in  NATO, but I believe that unless we encourage the Europeans to develop their own capabilities for their own defense, we will not see the kind of increased defense efforts that Europe ought to undertake. Certainly American taxpayers have done their share, throughout most of the 20th Century, to contribute to European security. 
   I think British Prime Minister Tony Blair said it best in a November 22, 1999 speech in London. He said:  
   We must shape European Defence policy in a way designed to strengthen (the) transatlantic bond by making NATO a more balanced partnership, and by giving Europeans the capacity to act whenever the United States, for its own reasons, decides not to be involved. Only then will Europe pull its weight in world security and share more of the burden with the United States.  
   I could not have said it better. 
   Mr. President, I now yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from Kansas, my friend and colleague in these dialogs on the U.S. global role in the world, Mr. ROBERTS.

<TEXT>
   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to conclude my remarks with some additional thoughts and comments. 
   I thank Senator LUGAR, a distinguished student and practitioner of foreign policy in this body for many years, and the distinguished Senator from Michigan, Mr. LEVIN, and thank him for his wonderful letter from General Clark, who is a man with whom I have shared a meal recently and discussed Kosovo and many other matters. He is a distinguished American. I respect him highly. 
   I thank my distinguished colleague from Kansas. One of the things that impressed me was the point the Senator from Kansas mentioned, that this country is committed and obligated in some form or fashion to 90 different treaties or organizations, and that is indeed quite an astounding number. 
   I have two basic fears about America's global role. One is that, like Gulliver, we will get wrapped up in many lilliputian events and treaties and entanglements and not be free to move to crises in the world where we need to have a maximum impact; secondly, that we get drawn into power vacuums around the world, particularly in the wake of the fall of the Soviet Union, and institute a pax Americana. 
   I was recently in Macedonia. As the helicopter took off, headed toward Kosovo, an Army colonel pointed out that if you looked out of the helicopter to your left, you could see a Roman aqueduct. I had never really been in that part of the world. It was amazing to actually see a Roman aqueduct put together by the Roman armies there in Macedonia over 2,000 years ago and it still be intact. 
   I began to think the very ground over which I was flying had been occupied by not only Alexander the Great but his father Philip, and that Greek and Roman armies had gone over this very terrain. Later, after the Dark Ages, for some 600 years the Turks and the Ottoman Empire occupied this particular land. Now we, the Americans, were there. 
   It was a sobering moment for me. I wondered exactly how effective we could really be in that part of the world with those conflicts which seem to be eternal. I wondered exactly what we could do there, what we could contribute, especially with our military force. 
   Those are some thoughts I have. 
   I would like to address one other issue in terms of our multilateral and multinational relations, and that is our relationship with the United Nations. 
   In large part because of American support, the UN was founded in 1945 with the purpose, according to its Charter:  
   To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace.  
   Furthermore, under Article 34 of the U.N. Charter, U.N. ``members confer on the Security Council primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.'' And Article 52 provides that:  
   Nothing in the present Charter precludes the existence of regional arrangements or agencies for dealing with such matters relating to the maintenance of international peace and security as are appropriate for regional action, provided that such arrangements or agencies and their activities are consistent with the Purposes and Principles of the United Nations.  
   In recent years, the United States has worked with, and sometimes without, the cooperation of the U.N. Security Council when seeking to accomplish its objectives. Despite all the difficulties associated with it, the Security Council remains the only widely accepted, multinational, legitimizing force for conducting military operations against a sovereign nation. In the 1995 book, ``Beyond Westphalia,'' editors Gene Lyons, Michael Mustanduno and their colleagues tackled the difficult question of ``state sovereignty and international intervention.'' The authors write that:  
   A historical transition was marked by the settlement of Westphalia in 1648, which ended the Thirty Years' War and opened the quest-- which goes on to this day-- to find a way for independent states, each enjoying sovereignty over a given territory, to pursue their interests without destroying each other or the international system of which each is a part.  
   One of the recurring themes which has been highlighted in these floor dialogues organized by Senator ROBERTS and myself about the global role of the United States in the post-Cold War world is on this very question of sovereignty. More specifically, under what conditions is it permissible and appropriate for a nation or coalition of 
   nations to intervene in the internal affairs of another sovereign state? 
   In an April 1999 speech in Chicago, British Prime Minister Blair posed the question in a way which is representative of the concerns of many of those--especially in the Western democracies--who believe that, under certain egregious circumstances, there must be limits on national sovereignty in today's world. Prime Minister Blair said:  
   The most pressing foreign policy problem we face is to identify the circumstances in  which we should get actively involved in other people's conflicts. Non-interference has long been considered an important principle of international order. And it is not one we would want to jettison too readily. One state should not feel it has the right to change the political system of another or foment subversion or seize pieces of territory to which it feels it should have some claim. But the principle of non-interference must be qualified in important respects. Acts of genocide can never be a purely internal matter. When oppression produces massive flows of refugees which unsettle neighboring countries then they can properly be described as ``threats to international peace and security.''  
   It is interesting that on that same day in 1999, Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso offered some related observations, with his views on the Kosovo War, which he and his country supported. President Cardoso's views reflect the concerns of many of those in the developing world who worry about the consequences of a loss of sovereignty in reducing their ability to control their own destiny. 
   We heard Senator ROBERTS talk about the fear of the United States and its growing hegemony or being a great hegemony in various portions of the world, or being the ``big dog.'' 
   President Cardoso said this:  
   Who has the authority and approval of the international community to drop bombs? Such attacks are not endorsed by an international organization that legalized such actions. The United Nations was left aside.......The United States currently constitutes the only large center of political, economic, technologic, and even cultural power. This country has everything to exert its domain on the rest of the world, but it must share it. There must be rules, even for the stronger ones. When the strongest one makes decisions without listening, everything becomes a bit more difficult. In this European war, NATO made the decision, but who legalized it? That is the main problem. I am convinced more than ever that we need a new political order in the world.  
   How do we reconcile these different and sometimes conflicting, yet both legitimate, concerns: the need on the one hand to protect powerless individuals from the depredations of their own governments, and on the other to protect less powerful nations from unilateral or even multilateral decisions by the stronger powers? 
   Mr. President, in the last dialog, I tried to quote President Kennedy. I think I got the quote wrong. I think he said that ``we must dream of a world in which the strong are just, the weak secure, and the peace preserved.'' I think that is what President Cardoso was after. 
   The editors of Beyond Westphalia draw four principal conclusions which bear on this matter. The first two offer encouragement to those who see a clear need for constraints on unfettered sovereignty, especially in cases of massive human rights violations:  
   First, constraints on state sovereignty not only have a long history but have been increasing significantly in recent years as a consequence of both growing interdependence and the end of the cold war.......(Second), while constraints on state sovereignty traditionally were largely constraints on states' behavior with regard to other states, in recent decades constraints on sovereignty have increasingly involved the internal affairs of states, or how governments relate to their own citizens, economies, and territories.  
   However, the current limits on international interventions are captured in the final two observations:

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there are an estimated 2.3 million foreign-born school children living in the U.S. today and more are arriving daily. This is placing increasing demands on our nation's schools and community organizations to help these newly arrived children and their families with becoming successful in America's schools and communities. 
   These children began arriving here in large numbers in the 1990s in a wave of immigration that is rivaling the first and second waves of German, Irish, Polish and Scandinavian immigrants who arrived here in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Like those who have preceded them, our nation's newest immigrants have a strong desire to succeed in their new found homeland. Our challenge is to provide them with the support and services they need to achieve to high standards in our schools--and beyond--and in so doing we will all be the beneficiaries. 
   The wave of immigrants settling into communities all across America is resulting in a significant increase in children with diverse linguistic and cultural backgrounds enrolling in our schools. For example, the Waterloo, Iowa school system is being challenged to teach 400 Bosnian refugee children who came here without knowing our language, culture or customs. Schools in Wausau, Wisconsin are filled with Asian children wanting to achieve success in the United States. In Dalton, Georgia, 47% of the student population in the public schools are Mexican children eager to participate in their new schools and community. In Turner, Maine, the school-aged children of hundreds of recently arrived Mexican immigrant families are pouring into this rural town's schools. 
   As these examples illustrate, the foreign-born, school-aged children living in our nation today constitute an increasingly significant portion of the population, not just in communities accustomed to large immigrant populations like New York, Los Angeles and Miami, but also non-traditional immigrant communities like Gainesville, Georgia and Fremont County, Idaho. According to recently released estimates, this trend will continue. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the recently arrived immigrant and refugee populations living here today will account for 75% of the total U.S. population growth over the next 50 years. U.S. schools from Florida to Washington State are being increasingly challenged by these changing demographics. As Secretary of Education Richard Riley recently said, ``dealing with this kind of change requires creative thinking and an eagerness to adopt and to incorporate cultural and linguistic differences into the learning process.'' 
   We need to make sure that these children are served appropriately--and that their families are as well. Studies have shown that where quality educational programs are joined with community-based services, immigrants have an increased opportunity to become an integral part of their community and their children are better prepared to achieve success in school. 
   The recent influx of immigrants into U.S. communities calls for innovative and comprehensive solutions. Today, I am joined by my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Senator PAUL COVERDELL, in introducing the Immigrants to New Americans Act. This legislation would establish a competitive grant program within the Department  of Education to assist these school systems and communities that are experiencing a high number of immigrant families. Specifically, this new grant program would provide funding to partnerships of local school 
   districts and community-based organizations for the development of model programs that assist immigrant children to achieve in U.S. schools and that provide services like parenting skills to their families as well as access to comprehensive community services, including health care, child care, job training and transportation. 
   Senator COVERDELL and I have both seen first hand the benefits of one community's program that brings togther teachers, community leaders and businesses in an innovative partnership to aid their linguistically and culturally diverse population. It is the Georgia Project and its mission is to assist immigrant children from Mexico achieve to higher standards in Dalton, Georgia's public schools. 
   In recent years, the carpet and poultry industries in Dalton and surrounding Whitfield County experienced the need for a larger workforce. The city's visionary leaders encouraged Mexican immigrants to settle into their community to fill that need. The challenge has been in Dalton's public school system where Hispanic enrollment went from being just 4 percent ten years ago to over 47 percent today. 
   To deal with this sizable increase, Dalton and Whitfield County public school administrators and business leaders formed a public-private consortium. This consortium, known as The Georgia Project, initiated a teacher exchange program in 1996 with the University of Monterrey in Mexico. Today, seventeen Mexican teachers are helping to bridge the language and culture gap by serving as instructors, counselors and role models and providing Spanish language training to English-speaking students. In addition, Dalton Public School teachers spend a month in Monterrey, Mexico, each year learning first hand the culture, language and customs of the Mexican students they serve. 
   There are other programs across the United States that address similar challenges experienced by the City of Dalton and Whitfield County. One such example is the Lao Family Project. This is a community-based refugee assistance organization that provides a wide range of parent-student services to Hmong and Vietnamese refugees in St. Paul, Minnesota in an effort to help parents become economically self-sufficient and their children succeed in school. The Lao Family Project's staff are bilingual/bicultural paraprofessionals who provide services that include adult English as a second language instruction and preschool literacy activities for children. 
   In the rural communities of Healdsburg and Windsor, California, the Even Start program provides a variety of instructional and support services to low-income, recently arrived Mexican immigrant families and their preschool and elementary school children. The program focuses on increasing family involvement in their children's education, helping parents and children with their literacy skills, and offering English as a second language course. Many of the instructional activities for the parent's classes are coordinated with the classroom teachers to ensure consistency with what is being taught to both the parent and their children. One focus of these classes is to communicate what the children are learning in their regular classes so that parents can help their children at home. 
   The Exemplary Multicultural Practices in Rural Education Program, or EMPIRE, operates in the Yakima region of rural Central Washington State, an area with a diverse mix of ethnic groups, including Caucasians, Hispanics, Native Americans, African Americans, and Asian Americans. The program promotes positive race relations and an appreciation for ethnic and cultural differences. It encourages schools to develop learning environments where children of all backgrounds can be successful in school and the community. With support from EMPIRE's board of advisors, each school designs and carries out its own projects based on local resources and needs. Schools in which EMPIRE is active plan a wide variety of programs and activities with emphasis on staff development, student awareness, parent involvement and improvement of curriculum and instruction. 
   The Immigrants to New Americans Act is endorsed by the National Association for Bilingual Education, The National Council of La Raza, the League of United Latin American Citizens, the India Abroad Center for Political Awareness, and the National Korean American Service and Education Consortium. 
   I would like to close with the words of Education Secretary Richard Riley: ``Regardless of the cultural diversity of our nation's students, there is one unifying factor in their lives, education, the primary and shared source of hope, opportunity and success. It is our duty as a nation to ensure that every ethnically diverse community has the opportunity to achieve a quality education and the success that accompanies it--just as we have done for generations of Americans before them.'' 
   Our nation's communities are being transformed by the diverse culture of their citizens. Successfully addressing this change will require leadership, creative thinking and an eagerness to encourage and promote the promise that these new challenges bring. By doing so, we as a nation will better serve all our children--the best guarantee we have of ensuring America's strength, well into the 21st century and beyond. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print their letters of support in the RECORD.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very honored to host Reverend Don Harp of Atlanta as the guest Chaplain in the Senate today. 
   Reverend Harp was born in Fayette County, GA, and graduated from Fayette County High School. 
   He attended Young Harris Junior College before receiving his BA degree from Huntingdon College in Montgomery, AL. Reverend Harp then went on to earn his masters degree in divinity from Emory University in Atlanta, and his doctorate from McCormick Theological Seminary in Chicago. 
   He has served on the Carrollton, Georgia City Council, Mayor Bill Campbell's Atlanta Advisory Committee, and the President's Advisory Council of Oglethorpe University. 
   He has received the Mary Mildred Sullivan Award from Brenau College in Gainesville, GA, and was a delegate to both the General and Southeastern Conferences of the United Methodist Church. 
   Reverend Harp has been a good friend and pillar of support for me over the years. As Tagore once said, ``Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings when the dawn is still dark.'' 
   Reverend Harp taught me that faith in God sometimes requires strength, but God gives back that strength many times over. 
   I am proud to welcome my distinguished friend to the United States Senate today.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution recognizing the 20th century as the ``Century of Women in the United States.'' I would like to thank Georgia State Representative Hinson Mosley for introducing a similar resolution in the Georgia General Assembly recognizing the tremendous accomplishments of women in Georgia and in the United States during the 20th century and for sharing his resolution with me. Representative Mosley's exceptional resolution passed the Georgia House of Representatives by a vote of 120-0 and the Georgia Senate on a vote of 51 to 0. 
   Like Representative Mosley's resolution, my proposal recognizes that as we enter the 21st century, it is essential that we note the vast opportunities available to today's women that were not available to women entering the 20th century. Women made unprecedented strides in civil rights, careers, religion, education and military service. Although we must keep in mind the challenges that women in our society continue to face and the work that women and men must yet accomplish, let us celebrate the victories won by women in the past 100 years. 
   I, along with Senators BOXER, BOND, BAUCUS, BRYAN, DURBIN, LANDRIEU, MIKULSKI, MURRAY, LINCOLN, KERRY, JEFFORDS, FEINSTEIN, ROBB and COCHRAN urge my colleagues to support this resolution and recognize the 20th century as the ``Century of Women in the United States.''

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I cannot express strongly enough what an honor it is to be on the floor of the Senate and listen to my distinguished colleague talk about the need for a meaningful dialog on a subject that often gets put down at the bottom of the list when it comes to public issues. I am reminded of a line from one of Wellington's troops after the battle at Waterloo, after the battle was won, that in time of war, and not before, God of the soldier, men adore; but in time of peace, with all things righted, God is forgotten and the soldier slighted. 
   Unfortunately, I think my dear colleague, Senator PAT ROBERTS, and I have sensed that the vital interests of the United States, the interests that cause us to go to war, the interests that compel us to fight for our vital national interests, these basic fundamental principles have been lost in the shuffle. Somehow they have been slighted and somehow the issue of foreign policy and defense has been shoved to the background. We have lost sight of the basis of who we are and what we are about as we go into the 21st century, which is why we have tried through this dialog to call attention to this issue. 
   We have some wonderful colleagues joining in our dialog, including my fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator KERREY, and Senator HAGEL, as well as Senator HUTCHINSON and Senator KYL. 
   For a few weeks, I wondered whether I was a little bit out of touch and wondered whether or not this dialog on American foreign policy and global reach was something that was out of touch with what was going on in the world. I went back home the last few days and in my own hometown paper in Atlanta I came across an article, a New York Times piece, Anti-Americanism Growing Across Europe. 
   Hello. Good morning. I realized that what I was seeing in a daily newspaper was what I was attempting to engage here in terms of a perspective on our global reach, a sense that we were overcommitted in the world and yet underfunded, a sense of mismatch between our ends and our means to achieve those ends. I realized we really were on target. 
   In my State, we say that even a blind hog can root up an acorn every now and then. I think my distinguished colleague and I from Kansas have rooted up an acorn. 
   We are on to something. That is a reason why I am strengthened in pursuing this dialog, and I am delighted we will have additional Senators entering into this dialog because unless we ourselves begin to define who we are as a nation, what we want out of our role as a nation, and where we want to go and how we exercise our power, unless we decide it, it will occur by happenstance. We will move from crisis to crisis. We will not have a plan and we will end up in places in the world where we know not of what we speak. 
   One of the quotes I have come across, one of the lines that continues to reinforce my view of my own concern and caution about America's expanded role in the world, is from our first dialog back in February when Owen Harries, editor of the National Interests, summed up his views on the appropriate approach for the United States in today's world with the following comments: I advocate restraint because every dominant power in the last four centuries that has not practiced it, that has been excessively intrusive and demanding, has ultimately been confronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans may believe that their country, being exceptional, need have no worries in this respect. I do not agree. It is not what Americans think of the United States but what others think of it that will decide the matter. 
   Anti-Americanism is growing across Europe. The distinguished Senator from Kansas has accumulated, in a shocking way, some headlines from 40 or 50 newspapers among our allies and our friends, questioning our role, particularly in the Balkans, but questioning our exercise of power, as it were. 
   The foreign perspective is not one to which we generally devote much attention in the Congress, certainly after the cold war is over, but our attention to foreign affairs has been slight. We do not really devote much attention to foreign affairs and consideration of our foreign policy options unless we are threatened. 
   I am delighted Senator ROBERTS is sitting as the chairman of the Emerging Threats Subcommittee in the Armed Services Committee. He has his  eye on the ball, certainly an emerging ball in terms of threats to our country. I think the overall threat is that we do not realize one could occur now that the cold war is over. 
   I think, also, one of the emerging threats, from my point of view, is that we will overcommit and overexpand and overreact and, instead of being only a superpower working with others and sharing power, we will wind up imposing--by default, almost, in the power vacuums around the world--a pax Americana that cannot be sustained by the will of the people in this country--again, a mismatch between means and ends. 
   But it is important, as Mr. Harries suggests, to focus on this issue. 
   I have spent some time, over recent months, as has the distinguished Senator from Kansas, reviewing what foreign opinion makers and leaders are saying about the United States. While we may think, as I do, that our country has not made a clear choice about our global role, the view from abroad is very different. Many people think we have chosen the path we are now on.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to add some additional comments, if that is all right with my distinguished colleague. 
   Earlier, I spoke about the mismatch between the goals of American foreign policy and the means we employ in achieving them. Whether one espouses a unilateralist or multilateralist approach, or something in between, most of those with a strong interest in American foreign policy have major goals for that policy, whether in preventing the emergence of global rivals or in promoting the spread of democracy, whether in halting the spread of weapons of mass destruction or in protecting human rights. Yet today we devote a little over 1 percent of the Federal budget for international affairs, compared to over 5 percent in 1962 in the middle of the cold war. 
   Of particular concern to me as a member of the Armed Services Committee, since the 1980s we have gone from providing roughly 25 percent of the budget for national defense to 18 percent today. We have reduced the active-duty armed forces by over one-third but have increased overseas deployments by more than 300 percent. I have often said we have, as a country, both feet firmly planted on a banana peel. We are going in opposite directions. That cannot last. We have a mismatch between our commitments and our willingness to live up to those commitments. We are sending a mixed message abroad. 
   What is the result of all of this? Newspapers reported that last November, for the first time in a number of years, the U.S. Army rated 2 of its 10 divisions as unprepared for war. Why were they unprepared for war? Because they were bogged down in the Balkans. That was never part of the deal going into the Balkans, that an entire U.S. Army division would be there for an indefinite period of time. No wonder these other two divisions were unprepared for war because they had elements in the Balkans doing something else--not fighting a war, but peacekeeping missions. 
   The services continue to struggle in meeting both retention and recruiting goals, and the service members and their families with whom I meet and who are on the front lines in carrying out the policies decided in Washington are showing the visible strains of this mismatch between our commitments and our resources. They deserve better from us. 
   I hope other Senators had an opportunity to watch Senator ROBERTS' discussion of our national interests during our February 24 dialog. If not, I commend my colleagues' attention to those remarks as printed in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of that date. 
   In brief, he stated the opinion, which I share, that in the post-cold-war world, our country has had a hard time in prioritizing our national interests, leading to confusion and inconsistency. He went on to cite the July 1996 report by the Commission on America's National Interests, of which he was a member, along with our colleagues Senators JOHN MCCAIN and BOB GRAHAM and my distinguished predecessor, Sam Nunn. 
   Of particular relevance to our topic today of defining and defending our national interests, the Commission found:  
   For the decades ahead, the only sound foundation for a coherent, sustainable American foreign policy is a clear public sense of American national interests. Only a national-interest-based foreign policy will provide priorities for American engagement in the world. Only a foreign policy grounded in American national interests will allow America's leaders to explain persuasively how and why specific expenditures of American treasure or blood deserve support from America's citizens.  
   As my colleagues will note from the charts I have, the Commission went on to divide our national interests into four categories. 
   They defined ``vital interests'' as those: 
   Strictly necessary to safeguard and enhance the well-being of Americans in a free and secure nation.  
   And as Senator ROBERTS has discussed, and you can see on the chart, they found only five items which reached that high standard. 
   In addition to attempting to identify our national interests, the commission also addressed the key issue of what we should be prepared to do to defend those interests:  
   For ``vital'' national interests, the United States should be prepared to commit itself to fight, even if it has to do so unilaterally and without the assistance of allies.  
   But there is a lower priority than that. 
   Next in priority come ``extremely important interests''--these are not vital; but they are extremely important--defined as those which:  
   ......would severely prejudice but not strictly imperil the ability of the U.S. Government to safeguard and enhance the well-being of Americans in a free and secure nation--  
   And for which: 
   the United States should be prepared to commit forces to meet threats and to lead a coalition of forces, but only in conjunction with a coalition or allies whose vital interests are threatened.  
   Next, third, we have another set of interests. These are called ``just important interests.'' They are not vital, not  necessary. These are important, which would have major negative consequences:  
   The United States should be prepared to participate militarily, on a case-by-case basis, but only if the costs are low or others carry the lion's share of the burden.  
   Finally, last, comes the most numerous but lowest priority category of ``less important or secondary interests,'' which:  
   Are intrinsically desirable but that have no major effect on the ability of the U.S. government to safeguard and enhance the well-being of Americans in a free and secure nation.  
   My colleagues in the Senate, this is exactly the kind of exercise--of defining and differentiating our national interests, and of gauging the proper kind and level of response for protecting such interests--that we need to be engaging in if we are to bring coherence and effectiveness to our post-cold war 
   foreign and national security policy. Everything is not the most important thing to do. Everything is not necessarily in America's vital interest to do. It is, in my judgment, what we must do in considering our policies, particularly toward the Balkans and now with a plan in Colombia to involve ourselves in a war against narcotraffickers in Colombia. We need to do several things. We need to ask ourselves: How vital are our interests in those areas? And what are we willing to pay to protect those interests? 
   What about the role of other countries, who, for reasons of history and geography, may have even greater national interests at stake? 
   Senator ROBERTS pointed out back in February the similarities between the Commission on America's National Interests list of ``vital'' interests and related compilations by other groups and individuals. I believe, for example, that the commission's definitions of ``vital'' and ``extremely important'' national interests are quite compatible with the relevant portions of the January 2000 White House ``National Security Strategy for a New Century.'' The conflicts will lie in applying these general principles to specific cases. That is what Senator ROBERTS and I intend to do with the remaining sessions of these global role dialogs, including such applications as the role of our alliances and the decision on when and how to intervene militarily. 
   However, from my perspective, though we may have some implicit common ground as to our most important national interests and what we should be prepared to do in defending them, in the real world where actions must count for more than words and where capabilities will inevitably be given greater weight than intentions, the picture we too often give to the world--of unilateralist means and narrowly self-interested ends--and to our own citizens--of seemingly limitless aspirations but quite limited resources we are willing to expend in achieving them--is surely not what we should be doing. 
   Samuel P. Huntington writes in the March/April edition of Foreign Affairs:  
   Neither the Clinton administration nor Congress nor the public is willing to pay the costs and accept the risks of unilateral global leadership. Some advocates of American global leadership argue for increasing defense expenditures by 50 percent, but that is a nonstarter. The American public clearly sees no need to expend effort and resources to achieve American hegemony. In one 1997 poll, only 13 percent said they preferred a preeminent role for the United States in world affairs, while 74 percent said they wanted the United States to share power with other countries. Other polls have produced similar results. Public disinterest in international affairs is pervasive, abetted by the drastically shrinking media coverage of foreign events. Majorities of 55 to 66 percent of the public say that what happens in western Europe, Asia, Mexico, and Canada has little or no impact on their lives. However much foreign policy elites may ignore or deplore it, the United States lacks the domestic political base to create a unipolar world. American leaders repeatedly make threats, promise action, and fail to deliver. The result is a foreign policy of ``rhetoric and retreat'' and a growing reputation as a ``hollow hegemon.''  
   One of my favorite authors on war and theorists on war, Clausewitz, put it this way:  
   Since in war too small an effort can result not just in failure but in positive harm, each side is driven to outdo the other, which sets up an interaction. Such an interaction could lead to a maximum effort if a maximum effort could be defined. But in that case, all proportion between action and political demands would be lost: means would cease to be commensurate with ends, and in most cases a policy of maximum exertion would fail because of the domestic problems it would raise.  
   I think we are maximally committed around the world. I think we have to review these commitments because I am not quite sure we have the domestic will to follow through on them or the budgets to take care of them. We do not want to risk failure. 
   Once again, I thank all of the Senators who have joined in today's discussion. I have benefitted from their comments, and encourage all of our colleagues of whatever party and of whatever views on the proper U.S. global role to join in this effort to bring greater clarity and greater consensus to our national security policies through these dialogs. Our next session will be on the role of multilateral organizations, including NATO and the United Nations, and is scheduled to occur just after the Easter break. 
   During the Easter break I intend to go visit our allies and friends in NATO, in Belgium, to go to Aviano to get a background briefing on how the air war in the Balkans was conducted, to go on to Macedonia and into Kosovo itself to see our forces there. That would be over the Easter break. I will go back through London to get a briefing from our closest ally, our British friends. 
   I hope to come back to the Senate in a few weeks with a more insightful view of what we should do, particularly in that part of the world, regarding our responsibilities. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before you today to introduce legislation that addresses the educational needs of our men and women in uniform and their families. I call this measure the HOPE Act of 2000: HOPE, Helping Our Professionals Educationally--that is, our military professionals. 
   The great Stephen Ambrose, the marvelous historian of World War II, the author of ``D-Day'' and other books, has said the GI bill is the single best piece of legislation ever passed by the Federal Government. 
   Last year, Time magazine named the American GI as the Person of the Century--how appropriate. That alone is a powerful statement about the high value of our military personnel. They are recognized around the world for their dedication and commitment to fight for our country and for peace in the world. This past century has been the most violent one in modern memory. The American GI has fought in the trenches during the first World War, the beaches at Normandy, in the hills of Korea, in the jungles of Vietnam, in the deserts of the Persian Gulf, and most recently in the valleys of the Balkans. 
   During that period, the face of our military and the people who fight our wars has changed dramatically. The traditional image of the single, mostly male, drafted, and ``disposable'' soldier is now gone. Today we are fielding the force for the 21st century. This new force is a volunteer force, filled with men and women who are highly skilled, married, and definitely not disposable. Gone are the days when quality of life for a GI meant a beer in the barracks and a 3-day pass. Now, we know we have to recruit a soldier but retain a family. 
   We have won the cold war. This victory has further changed the world and our military. The new world order has given way to a new world disorder. United States is responding to crises around the globe--whether it be strategic bombing or humanitarian assistance--and our military is often seen as our most effective response and our best ambassadors. In order to meet these challenges, we are retooling our forces to be lighter, leaner, and meaner. This is a positive move. Along with this lighter force, our military professionals must be highly educated and highly trained. 
   Our Nation is currently experiencing the longest continuous peacetime economic growth in our history. This economic expansion has been a boon for our country. However, there has been a downside to this growing economy insofar as our Armed Forces are concerned. With the enticement of quick prosperity in the civilian sector it is more difficult than ever to recruit and retain our highly skilled forces. 
   In fiscal year 1999, the Army missed it recruiting goals by 6291 recruits, while the Air Force missed its goal by 1,732 recruits. Pilot retention problems persist for all services; for fiscal year 1999 the Air Force ended up 1,200 pilots short and the Navy ended 500 pilots short. We have other problems. The Army is having problems retaining captains, while the Navy faces manning challenges for surface warfare officers and special warfare officers. It is estimated that $6 million is spent to train a pilot. We as a nation cannot afford to continually train our people, only to lose them to the private sector. It is unarguably far better to retain than retrain. 
   There is hope that we are now beginning to address these challenges. Last year was a momentous one for our military personnel. The Senate passed legislation that significantly enhances the quality of life for our military personnel. I am the Ranking Democrat on the Armed Service, Committee. The Senate, with my vote and support, passed legislation that significantly enhances the quality of life for our military personnel from retirement reform to pay raises. This Congress is on record supporting our men and women in uniform. However, more must be done. 
   In talking with our military personnel on my visits to the military bases in Georgia and around the world, we know that money alone is not enough. One of the things I would like to do is focus on education as a wonderful addition to the positive incentives we offer people to come into the military and stay in the military. Education, as a matter of fact, is the No. 1 reason service members come into the military. Unfortunately it is also the No. 1 reason why its members are leaving. We have to restructure our educational program in the military. We have to have a new GI bill. We have to provide hope to our military people, hope that the military can become the greatest university they will ever encounter. 
   Last year the Senate began to address this issue by supporting improved education benefits for military members and their families but we encountered some concerns in the House. Since last year, we have gone back and studied this issue further. In reviewing the current Montgomery GI bill--named after the wonderful Representative from Mississippi, Congressman Sonny Montgomery--we found several disincentives and conflicts among the education benefits offered by the services. These conflicts make the GI bill, which is actually an earned benefit, less attractive than it could be. 
   My legislation will improve and enhance the current educational benefits and create the GI bill for the 21st century. 
   One of the most important provisions of my legislation would give the Service Secretaries the ability to authorize a service member to transfer his or her basic MGIB benefits, educationally, to family members. Many service members tell us that they really want to stay in the service, but do not feel that they can stay and provide an education for their families. This proposed change will give them an opportunity to stay in the service and still provide an education for their spouses and children. It will give the Service Secretaries a very powerful retention tool by allowing them to authorize transfer of basic GI bill benefits, that are earned through the service of the service man or woman, anytime after 6 years of service. 
   To encourage members to stay longer, the transferred benefits could not be used until completion of at least 10 years of service. I believe that the services can use this much like a reenlistment bonus to retain valuable service members. It can be creatively combined with reenlistment bonuses to create a very powerful and cost effective incentive for highly skilled military personnel to stay in the Service. In talking with service members upon their departure from the military, we have found that family considerations play a crucial role in the decision of a member to continue their military career. 
   I found in discussions with military families and service members that at the 8- to 10- to 12-year mark when young service members are beginning to make a choice about whether to stay in the military, that choice is driven not so much by their own choice to serve the country--obviously they want to serve the country and stay in the military--that choice is more and more driven by family needs, whether their spouse is employed or whether their spouse would like to gain an extra degree or whether they need to create a college fund for their kids. 
   Reality dictates that we must address the needs of the family in order to retain our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines. 
   My legislation would also give the Secretaries the authority to authorize the Veterans' Educational Assistance Program, known as VEAP. Those  VEAP participants and those active duty personnel who did not enroll in Montgomery GI bill to participate in the current GI bill program. The VEAP participants would contribute $1,200, and those who did not enroll in the Montgomery GI bill would contribute $1,500. The services would pay any additional costs of the benefits of this measure. 
   Another enhancement made by my proposal to the current GI bill extends the period in which the members of Reserve Components can utilize the program. I was shocked to find out that currently, Reserve members lose their education benefits when they leave the service or after 10 years of service. Amazing, they have no benefits when they leave service. My legislation will permit them to use the benefits up to 5 years after their separation from the military. This will encourage them to stay in the Reserves for a full career. 
   It is obvious we are calling upon our reservists and our guards men and women more and more to fulfill our commitments around the globe. This will, I think, fulfill this Nation's commitment, certainly to our reservists, for an improvement in their educational opportunities. 
   Other provisions of this legislation would allow the Service Secretaries to pay 100 percent tuition assistance or enable service members to use the GI bill to cover any unpaid tuition and expenses when the services do not pay 100 percent of tuition. 
   This will allow a service member an additional incentive to use the GI bill in service. Education begets education. 
   I believe this is a necessary next step for improving education benefits for our military members and their families. We have to offer them credible choices. If we offer them such options and treat the members and their families properly, we will show them our respect for their service and dedication, which they expect. Maybe then we can turn around our current sad retention statistics. This GI bill is an important retention tool for the services. 
   We must continue to focus our resources on retaining our personnel based on their actual life needs, particularly their need for an educational opportunity. This bill gives them hope.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there has been a lot of talk recently about the ``digital divide'' and the differences in the availability of information between the technological haves and have nots. With the emerging digital economy becoming a major driving force of our nation's economic well-being, we must ensure that all Americans have the information tools and skills that are critical to full participation in the new economy. Access to such tools is an essential step to ensure that our economy grows strongly and that in the future no one is left behind. 
   While we know that Americans are more connected to digital tools than ever before, the ``digital divide'' between certain demographic groups and regions of our country continues to persist and in many cases is widening significantly. As a member of the Commerce Committee, Subcommittee on Communications, I am alarmed by these developments. Just consider: 
   A third of America's economic growth in recent years has come from information technologies, producing 19 million new jobs. Yet, while thirty percent of white Americans are connected to the Internet only 11 or 12 percent of African Americans or Hispanic Americans are on-line. Households with incomes of at least $75,000 are more than 20 times as likely to have access to the Internet as those at the lowest income levels, and more than 9 times as likely to have a computer at home. Additionally, citizens in rural areas, including large parts of my state of Georgia, are less likely to be connected to the Internet than urban users. Regardless of income level, those living in rural areas are lagging behind in computer ownership and Internet access. 
   A viable alternative for many of these under served individuals is Internet access outside the home and statistics show that computer use at public libraries and community centers is on the rise. First of all, among all Americans, 17 percent use the Internet at some site outside the home. Secondly, minorities are even more likely to use the Internet and pursue online courses and school research at even higher rates. Third, those earning less than $20,000 who use the Internet outside the home are twice as likely to get their access through a public library or community center. Finally, Americans who are not in the labor force, such as retirees or homemakers, are twice as likely to use public libraries for access. 
   Given the ``digital divide'' among these demographic groups, and the dependence of many Americans on the use of technology outside the home, especially at libraries and community centers, I am introducing today the Community Technology Assistance Act. Currently, the special enhanced tax deduction exists in the case of computer equipment donated to elementary and secondary schools. My bill would extend for five years the special enhanced tax deduction, currently scheduled to expire at the end of this year, and would expand it to include computer donations to libraries and community centers as well as to elementary and secondary schools. Consider the many high profile technology and Internet related companies, such as Microsoft, Intel and AmericaOnline, that have donated computer equipment and web access to schools and universities across America. My bill would make it easier for companies and individuals to invest in their community and jump start efforts to help bridge the ``digital divide'' in rural and low income areas everywhere. 
   Ensuring access to the fundamental tools of the digital economy is one of the most significant investments our nation can make. Our country's most important resource is its people. Our companies are only as good as their workers. Highly-skilled, well educated workers make for stellar businesses and create superior products. In a society that increasingly relies on computers and the Internet to deliver information and enhance communication, we need to make sure that all Americans have access. Our domestic and global economies will demand it. Ready access to telecommunications tools will help produce the kind of technology-literate work force that will enable the United States to continue to be a leader in the global economy well into the 21st Century and beyond.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, over the past several years, our nation's military has become increasingly overcommitted and underfunded--facing problems from recruiting and retention, to cuts in active fleet numbers and a dwindling active duty force. Yet in spite of these problems, the United States' naval power, with it's fleet of nuclear-powered attack submarines, life-saving Coast Guard and Merchant Marine forces, and highly skilled sailors and mariners, is the best in the world. These components are a part of one of the most technologically sophisticated defense systems in the world. In Kings Bay, Georgia, we are fortunate to be home to the greatest submarine base in the nation, Kings Bay Naval Submarine Base. During my visits there, however, I have heard time and again how detrimental the growing gap between commitments and funding has become. 
   I believe that by appropriating additional funds to our nation's defense system and by supporting efforts to create a larger force structure, we will resolve or at least begin to remedy some of these problems that are facing today's military forces. Since I came to the Senate in 1997, I have supported funding for procurement, research and development, and readiness. In order for the United States to retain it's role as a military super power, we must pay attention to the gaps that exist today and prevent further deterioration in our armed forces. If we do not reverse this trend now, a very high price will be paid tomorrow for our collective lethargy on defense issues and for the massive under-funding of our armed forces. 
   Mr. President, I now respectfully request that an article from the January, 2000 edition of Seapower magazine be inserted into the RECORD, as I believe it accurately and appropriately outlines the existing gap between our commitments and resources, and effectively argues the case for remedying this situation. 
   Thank you.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity to salute my dear friend and colleague, the distinguished Senator from Arizona, JOHN MCCAIN. Although he has suspended his campaign for President, he should nonetheless know that he has scored a great victory in American electoral politics. More so than any other candidate in recent memory, Senator MCCAIN has beaten two of the greatest enemies facing our political system in the twenty-first century--apathy and cynicism. We should all be grateful to him for reminding Americans that ``politics'' is not a dirty word, that campaigns can be about more than 30 second sound bites, and that heroes still exist. We in the Senate should all feel proud to call him one of our own. 
   I think I and the four other Vietnam veterans in the Senate feel a particular kinship with Senator MCCAIN, for obvious reasons. You do not go through an experience like combat without being profoundly affected. You recognize a change in yourself when you come home, and you recognize it in others when you meet them for the first time. You are brothers. We are brothers. But why did the rest of America respond to Senator MCCAIN so strongly? Why did the ``Straight Talk Express'' appear every night on the evening news? Why did so many people want to see Luke Skywalker emerge out of the Death Star? 
   I believe it is because JOHN MCCAIN reacts to challenges the way we wish we would ourselves, but fear we might not. He remained in the Hanoi Hilton for seven years with his fellow P.O.W.'s even when he could have left. He fights for campaign finance reform, for strong action to reduce youth smoking, and for curbs in pork barrel spending even when he knows it will make him unpopular with his party. He shoots from the hip. He tells reporters how he really feels. He loves his family. 
   He is not perfect, but none of us are. He and I disagree on many issues, but we agree on this: that the purpose of politics is to generate hope, that serving our country--as a soldier or a sailor or a Senator--is the greatest honor of a person's life, and that, in the words of Babe Ruth, ``It's hard to beat a person who won't give up.'' 
   Speaking for myself, I am a loyal Democrat who strongly supports the candidacy of AL GORE. But as an American and as a fellow Vietnam veteran, I am proud of the work JOHN has done, and will no doubt continue to do, in restoring the public's faith in their government and the political process. 
   Mr. President, JOHN MCCAIN is an authentic American hero, and I am proud to serve along side him.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I come before my colleagues today to pay tribute to the many brave Georgians who pulled together to support one another in the aftermath of the devastating tornadoes that hit Southwest Georgia earlier this month. In the pre-dawn hours of Valentine's day, February 14th, the town of Camilla, Georgia was hit by a series of brutal tornadoes that took the lives of nearly twenty people. This storm caused not only terrible damage--destroying homes, farms and businesses--but it tested the limits of residents across the Southwest portion of the state. It has been said that ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes. Poorer still is the nation which has them, but forgets.'' When the storm calmed, true heroes emerged and they should be recognized. 
   I ask that I may be able to insert into the Congressional RECORD a list of individuals, organizations, and area businesses that made all the difference in preparing the people of Mitchell, Grady, Colquitt, and Tift counties for recovery from this tragic event. This list reflects only a portion of the many groups and individuals who reached out to our communities in their time of need. There are others who are often lost in the shuffle, whose movements and actions did not attract the media's spotlight. From the children who donated their own toys, to the families who reached into their savings, to the people who opened their doors for relatives or strangers who needed a place to find refuge. 
   The people and groups mentioned in this insert are not well known. These are everyday people--everyday Georgians. Individually, they each make a small contribution, collectively they make a tremendous difference.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, prescription drugs currently constitute the largest out-of-pocket health care cost for seniors. Over 85 percent of Medicare beneficiaries take at least one prescription medicine, and the average senior fills eighteen prescriptions per year. 
   Because prescription drug coverage was not a standard part of health insurance when Medicare was enacted 35 years ago, many seniors must pay for the high cost of prescription drugs out of their own pockets. We are now facing a crisis of monumental proportion for many older Americans. 
   The simple fact is, the high cost of today's modern medicines and the absence of Medicare coverage have placed needed medications out of reach for too many seniors. Most older Americans must juggle daily costs like groceries and utilities with paying for medicine. They are being forced to compromise by buying only a portion of the needed medications, too often making their treatment regimens incorrect and ineffective. Without the proper medication and dosage for conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and heart problems, seniors may find themselves faced with even more costly hospitalizations and compromised health. 
   Recently, I received a letter from Reverend Lois Congdon of Decatur Georgia. Reverend Congdon wrote to me about her impending retirement. She told of her expensive drug treatment costs and the coverage she was currently receiving under her employer-based insurance plan. Without her current salary, and once she is placed on Medicare, Reverend Congdon will no longer be able to afford her expensive prescription drugs. Even supplemental prescription coverage such as medigap offers only limited benefits and is too expensive for most seniors. Currently only one-fourth of Medicare enrollees have supplemental drug insurance and the number of firms offering such coverage has declined by 25 percent in the last four years alone. 
   Last month, I cosponsored legislation to provide similar prescription drug coverage for military retirees. The bill would enable military retirees over age 65 to use the National mail order pharmacy program for drug coverage. However, affordable prescription drug coverage is a benefit that all seniors should be able to obtain, not just armed service men and women. Seniors make up 12 percent of our nation's population and they purchase over one-third of all prescription drugs in America. Most older Americans live on fixed incomes of $15,000 a year which is adjusted slightly for inflation each year. However, for far too long, the rate of increase in prescription drug costs has exceeded the rate of inflation. This situation has created a need more urgent than ever to strengthen the Medicare Program with a prescription drug plan, and thereby protect millions of American seniors from more costly hospitalizations and treatments. 
   Expanding Medicare by adding a prescription drug benefit will bring the program in line with the realities of modern medicine. Prescription drug coverage is essential to the delivery of 21st century medicine. These medicines keep people healthy, independent, and out of the hospital. To not include prescription benefits in Medicare today is  akin to not including a major form of treatment such as a surgical procedure when Medicare was established in 1965. It is absolutely unthinkable. Too many seniors lack dependable drug coverage and their health is being compromised. I am committed to providing Medicare coverage for prescription drugs, and promise to continue fighting for America's seniors. The Congress must move forward expeditiously to adopt legislation to accomplish this important objective. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, 20 years ago, my friends and colleagues Senator BARBARA MIKULSKI of Maryland and Senator ORRIN HATCH from Utah joined to create a National Women's History Week. Since that time, the commemoration has expanded into an entire month of celebration and recognition of the many contributions and accomplishments of American women. I am proud to use this occasion to highlight the many accomplishments of one of Georgia's own, author and teacher Alice Walker. 
   Alice Walker has become one of the leading voices among African-American writers. She has published poetry, novels, short stories, essays, and criticism, the most famous probably being ``The Color Purple'', for which she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1983. Her portrayal of the struggle of African-Americans throughout history, especially the experiences of black women in the American South, has earned her praise around the world. Ms. Walker's insightful and riveting portraits of poor, rural life display human resourcefulness, strength and endurance in confronting oppression. 
   Alice Walker was born on February 9, 1944, in Eatonton, Georgia, the eighth and last child of Willie Lee and Minnie Lou Grant Walker, who were sharecroppers. When she was eight years old, she lost sight in one eye during an accident with one of her brothers' BB guns. This incident proved to be a turning point in Walker's life. Walker has said that it was from this point that she ``really began to see people and things, really to notice relationships and to learn to be patient enough to see how they turned out *.*.*'' 
   In high school, Alice Walker was valedictorian of her class. That achievement, coupled with a ``rehabilitation scholarship,'' made it possible for her to go to Spelman College, a historically black women's college in Atlanta, Georgia. After spending two years at Spelman, she transferred to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, traveling to Africa as an exchange student during her junior year. She received her bachelor of arts degree from Sarah Lawrence College in 1965. 
   After graduation, Alice Walker spent the summer in Liberty County, Georgia where she helped to draw attention to the plight of poor people in South Georgia. She went door to door registering voters in the African-American community. Her work with the neediest citizens in the state helped her to see the debilitating impact of poverty on the relationships between men and women in the community. She moved to New York City shortly thereafter where she worked for the city's welfare department. It was then that she was awarded her first writing grant in 1966. 
   Ms. Walker had originally wanted to go to Africa to write, but decided against it and instead traveled to Tougaloo, Mississippi. It was there where she met her future husband, civil rights attorney Melvyn Leventhal. He was supportive of her writing and admired her love for nature. They married in 1967 and became the first legally married interracial couple in the state of Mississippi. While her husband fought school desegregation in the courts, Alice worked as a history consultant for the Friends of the Children, Mississippi's Head Start Program. 
   Since there was still a great deal of racial tension in the state, and because her husband was working adamantly in the courts to dismantle the laws barring desegregation, animosity against the couple was strong. While the couple lived in Mississippi, Alice and her husband slept with a gun under their bed at night for protection. Their only daughter, Rebecca, was born in 1969.  
   Alice Walker became active in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960's, and remains an involved and vocal activist for many causes today. She has spoken out in support for the women's equality movement, has been involved in South Africa's anti-apartheid campaign, and has worked toward global nuclear arms reduction. One of her most pronounced involvements has been her tireless work against female genital mutilation, the gruesome practice of female circumcision that remains prevalent in many African societies. 
   Among her numerous awards and honors for her writing are the Lillian Smith Award from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rosenthal Award from the National Institute of Arts & Letters, a nomination for the National Book Award, a Radcliffe Institute Fellowship, a Merrill Fellowship, a Guggenheim Fellowship, and the Front Page Award for Best Magazine Criticism from the Newswoman's Club of New York. She has also received the Townsend Prize and a Lyndhurst Prize. 
   In 1984, Ms. Walker started her own publishing company, Wild Trees Press. She has authored more than 20 books over the years. Divorced from her husband, she currently resides in Northern California with her dog, Marley where she continues to write. Her most recent book, ``By the Light of My Father's Smile'', was released in 1998. I am honored to recognize this remarkable woman, a daughter of Georgia and mother of the fight for equality.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, and Members of the Senate, I am very pleased to join with my distinguished colleagues, Senators BARBARA MIKULSKI and CHARLES GRASSLEY, to introduce our proposal for the largest employer-based long-term care insurance program in American history. Today, we are introducing the Federal Employees and Uniformed Services Group Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 2000. 
   At age 25, I returned from Vietnam facing the potential need for long-term care. I did not have the opportunity to plan for those needs and I was fortunate to avoid that outcome through the support of my family and the wonderful military health care system and VA system I encountered. Our legislation will provide federal employees, members of the Uniformed Services, including Reservists and the National Guard, retirees, spouses, parents and parents-in-law with the opportunity to plan for assistive care needs that become a necessity for all of us at some time in our lives. 
   Currently there are several measures pending in the Senate which offer different approaches to providing long-term care insurance to federal and military employees and their families. Our bill represents a carefully considered compromise between these competing approaches. 
   The Cleland-Mikulski-Grassley bill combines the features of our original proposals, S. 894, S. 57 and S. 36, as well as additional provisions to produce the most comprehensive proposal for an employer-based long-term care insurance program. Our legislation will: 
   One, allow federal employees, members of the Uniformed Services and Foreign Service, Reservists and retirees, spouses, parents, and parent-in-laws to purchase long-term care insurance at group rates. 
   Second, have premiums based on age (premiums are expected to be 10%-20% less than on the open market). 
   Third, provide individuals with options, including cash reimbursements for family caregivers, tax exemptions under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and portability of benefits. 
   The current forecast for the cost of meeting long-term care needs of our aging population is staggering in terms of personal and national resources. Average nursing home costs are projected to increase from $40,000 per person per year today to $97,000 by 2030. Medicare and regular health insurance programs do not cover most long-term care needs. Medicaid can offer some long-term care support, but generally requires ``spend-down'' of income and assets to qualify. Additionally, very few employers offer a long-term care insurance benefit to their employees. We hope that our legislation will be a model that other employers will use in providing long-term care insurance for their employees and will lessen the financial burden on the Medicare and Medicaid programs. 
   Working families are too often being forced to choose between sending a child to college and paying for a nursing home for a parent. Families desperately need the tools to help themselves and to meet their family responsibilities. 
   Consider these astounding statistics: 
   Almost 6 million Americans aged 65 or older currently need long-term care. 
   As many as six out of 10 Americans have experienced a long-term care need either for themselves or a family member. 
   41% of women in caregiver roles quit their jobs or take family medical leave to care for a frail older parent or parent-in-law. 
   80% of all long-term care services are provided by family and friends. 
   The need for this legislation is clear. By working together in a bipartisan cooperative spirit my fellow sponsors and I have bridged some significant differences in approach to craft a proposal which should have widespread support in the Senate. I hope and expect that we will take up and pass this bill this year. Those who have served, and are now serving, our nation deserve nothing less.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, one of the first issues to come before me as a new member of the Commerce Committee was INTELSAT privatization. Although this was a challenging issue that required balancing the international role of the U.S. in communications technology with the needs of the signatories to INTELSAT, I chose to become an original co-sponsor of the Open-market Reorganization for the Betterment of International Telecommunications Act ``ORBIT'' because  I believed it was important to get behind a bill that can be enacted in to law this Congress to address these challenges. 
   One provision that was of particular concern to me is that of ``fresh look.'' The conference agreement on S. 376 does eliminate the ``fresh look'' provision that continued to be debated this year. ``Fresh look'' is a policy that, if implemented, would allow the federal government to permit COMSAT's corporate customers to abrogate their current contracts with COMSAT. The conference agreement rejects ``fresh look'' and preserves the ability of the private parties involved to negotiate contracts so that one party cannot simply walk away from its business obligations without any attendant liability. 
   This conference agreement does not allow the FCC to take any action that would impair lawful, private contracts or agreements. Both chambers in the 106th Congress emphatically rejected ``fresh look'' when they passed their own versions of international satellite privatization legislation, and the conference agreement reflects this consensus. 
   I commend the conferees for including language in the conference agreement that protects private agreements, contracts, and the like. To read the relevant section otherwise would be to dismiss the clear intent of Congress to preserve existing and binding obligations of parties.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is an honor to be here today with my distinguished colleague from Kansas, Senator PAT ROBERTS. We want to institute a process by which this body can increasingly come to grips with some of the challenges that persist in our foreign policy and continue to be, in terms of our defense, a challenge to us and to the young men and women of America. 
   It is an opportunity for us to continue our dialog which we started in the Armed Services Committee over the last 3 years as we have encountered difficulties in the Middle East, southwest Asia, and as we see problems around the world. He and I have more and more come to an understanding that we have more in common than we do in disagreement. 
   One of the things we have in common is that we asked some very important pertinent questions about our foreign policy and our defense as we go into the 21st century. We are delighted today to kick off, not so much a debate on American foreign policy but a dialog which we hope will develop a consensus of some basic first principles by which we ought to engage the world. 
   We have the post-cold-war world, as it is called. I was with Madeleine Albright today, our distinguished Secretary of State, and she said it is probably not the post anything; it is just a new era. We have gone through the cold war and the terrors of that period, but we are certainly in a new era, and it does not even really have a name. 
   We hope to provide for our colleagues in the Senate--and 
   we hope they will join us--over the course of this year, an understanding of key national security issues and begin building the building blocks of a bipartisan consensus on the most appropriate priorities and approaches for our country in today's international environment. 
   In launching this endeavor, I am very mindful of both the enormity of the undertaking and of my own limitations in addressing such a subject. Having been only 3 years, beginning my fourth year in the Senate, I certainly do not claim to have a solution to these problems about which we are going to talk, but I hope to ask some pertinent questions. 
   American foreign policy is challenged because of the end of the cold war, and Senator ROBERTS and I approach these questions on the road to the future with great humility and certainly with far more questions of our own than answers. Yet I believe this dialog is one the Senate must have. We owe it to the other nations of the world, including those that look to America for leadership, as well as those that make themselves our competitors, and certainly we owe it to those that make us their adversaries. Even more, we owe it to those who serve our country in the Armed Forces and in the Foreign Service, whose careers and sometimes very lives can be at stake. Perhaps most of all, we owe it to our children and our grandchildren. 
   I was with Senator Nunn last night at the State Department. He was being honored by the State Department. I always learn something from him whenever I am with him. We were talking about a particular country, a particular challenge in American foreign policy. He said: Yes, what happens there will affect our children and our grandchildren. 
   It is astounding that the consequences of the decisions we make today will, indeed, affect future generations, so we must make these decisions wisely. 
   Uncertainty, disunity, partisanship, and overstatesmanship will not serve this country well. We need to seriously consider what our global role in the 21st century is and what it should be. That decision will affect future generations more than we can possibly understand. 
   One more point: I do believe a meaningful, bipartisan dialog on the U.S. role, which many believe is vital to our national interest, is also imminently doable even in this election year. While the subject matter is very important to our country and our future, it is not an issue of great use on the campaign trail. This great body is the place to discuss these great and momentous issues where we can lay it all out and talk about it in a way that does not impinge on anybody's particular partisan views. Simply put, neither the Presidential race nor the elections for the Congress will be determined by who has the partisan upper hand on foreign policy. 
   Over the course of the year, Senator ROBERTS and I--and we hope a number of other Senators--will be engaging in a series of floor dialogs relating to the general direction of U.S. foreign policy and national security policy in the 21st century. 
   We have actually chosen to sit together. We are on different sides of the aisle, but we chose to come from our back-bench positions to show that we stand actually shoulder to shoulder in this regard. We are all Americans, and we hope we can do something good for our country. 
   Our current game plan is to begin today by considering 
   frameworks for the U.S. global role with respect to priorities and approaches. In the weeks to come, this will be followed by sessions on U.S. national interests. Of course, the first question about American engagement in the world should be: Is it in our vital strategic national interest? That is question No. 1. The next session will be on U.S. national interests, what are they. 
   Another phase of our discussion will be the use of our military forces. Quite frankly, this should be question No. 2 because if we do not have a military objective following America's strategic vital interests, why commit the military? 
   Next is we want to engage the question of our relationship with multilateral organizations. We realize the United States is the world's foremost military and economic power, but that does not necessarily mean we can go it on our own everywhere. The issue of multilateral organizations and our relationship to them is an important one. 
   After multilateral organizations is the foreign policy roles of the executive and legislative branches. One of the first things that came to my attention when I came to the Senate 3 years ago was something called the U.S. Constitution. Senator BYRD was kind enough to give me an autographed copy of the U.S. Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, which I proudly carry with me. Quite frankly, if you read the Constitution carefully, it gives the Congress the power to declare war, to raise and support armies, and to provide and maintain a navy. That is a responsibility we have, along with a unique role in the Senate of advising and consenting, particularly on treaties into which the executive branch may enter. 
   The executive and legislative branches have to work together for foreign policy and defense policy in this country to actually work. 
   Next is economics and trade. One can hardly separate economics from defense issues anymore. Economics and  trade are absolutely mixed up with our foreign policy and defense issues. Arms control is certainly an issue we need to confront. 
   Then there will be a final wrapup at the end of the year, probably in September. 
   However, this is just a preliminary outline, and we want these discussions to be flexible enough to go wherever the dialog takes us--that is the beauty of the Senate--and to include a wide array of viewpoints and illustrative subjects. 
   We encourage all our colleagues, of whatever mind on the topics under consideration, to join in so we can have a real debate in this Chamber, 
   one in which we, indeed, ask each other hard questions, not in order to score partisan points and not in a particularly prearranged set of choreographed responses between like-minded individuals but to seek a better understanding of each other's thoughts. 
   That is exactly what we are after. We have determined that we will not tie this dialog, this debate, to any particular administration, any particular issue, any particular commitment, any particular budget item, any particular legislative proposal. We hope for a freewheeling dialog that we think can benefit the country. 
   What we are hoping for is not to find final answers, for surely that would probably be too ambitious an objective, but, rather, to bring this body, which has a key constitutional role in the conduct of American foreign and national security policy, to the same kind of serious examination of our foreign policy goals and assumptions as is now underway among many of our leading foreign policy experts. 
   I was thinking about this dialog today. I was thinking, how does this dialog differ from what might be termed, shall we say, an ``academic undertaking''? There are many seminars. There are thousands of courses on American foreign policy. There are numerous reviews of our defense strategy going on in this country and around the world. 
   What makes this different? I think what makes this dialog different is that we are the ones who ultimately have to make the decision. This is not an academic exercise. I can remember voting for NATO expansion. It was an incredible experience for me to know that by the raising of my hand I could extend the security of NATO to three nations on the face of the globe that did not have that security before. That was an incredible experience for me. 
   So we do not participate just in some academic exercise here. We are the leaders. We are the ones who have to ultimately bite the bullet and make the decisions. Therefore, we need to think these things through. That is the point. 
   One of my favorite lines from Clausewitz, the great German theoretician on war, is: The leader must know the last step he is going to take before he takes the first step. That is the spirit of these discussions. At some point, and in some fashion, a bipartisan consensus on America's global role must emerge because our national interest demands it. It may not be as pure as in World War II when Senator Vandenberg said: Politics stops at the water's edge, but certainly at some point statecraft should overtake politics. 
   If these dialogs can assist that effort, in even a small way, they will be time well spent. We hope our discussions will not be tinged with particularly partisan or highly personalized considerations because the subject matter clearly transcends the policies and views of any one individual or certainly any one administration. The challenges will be the same, no matter which party controls the White House next year or which party controls the Congress. 
   With that, I yield to my good and distinguished friend and colleague, the Senator from Kansas. Let me say, in the time I have been in the Senate, I have found him to be a great source of reason and thoughtful pronouncements on national security matters. He has a marvelous sense of humor, which will come out whether we want it to or not in the dialogs. It is my pleasure to turn the discussion over to my distinguished friend and colleague, the great Senator from Kansas, Mr. PAT ROBERTS.

   Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Senator. We appreciate working with him on this quite challenging and daunting task, but it is worth doing. It is an honor to be with him today and work with him. One of my key staff people, Mr. Bill Johnston, has done a momentous job of research for the speeches, the addresses, the facts, the figures, and the quotes I will be using in this dialog. I want to make sure he gets proper credit at this time. 
   Mr. President, I will now set the stage for today's discussion by sketching a brief outline of the evolution of the main currents of U.S. foreign policy and, then, by providing a short look at what some leading voices are currently proposing for how America should make its way in the post-cold-war world. 
   As in any transition period, we are feeling our way for the appropriate strategy and policies with which to maintain and enhance our national security interests in this period of a ``new world disorder.'' As the debates on NATO enlargement, Kosovo and the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty revealed, those leading voices on American foreign policy currently offer divided counsel on this issue. It is obvious that no clear consensus has yet formed as to America's post-cold-war strategy, and that, or course, is what we are looking to address in these discussions. 
   Until the 20th century, it would be fair to sum up our general philosophy on foreign policy as an attempt to continue to follow President Washington's recommended approach contained in his Farewell Address of September 17, 1796:  
   Observe good faith and justice toward all nations. Cultivate peace and harmony with all. ..... The Nation which indulges toward another an habitual hatred or an habitual fondness is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. ..... Steer clear of permanent alliances, with any portion of the foreign world. ..... There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate upon real flavors from nation to nation.  
   Then Secretary of State John Quincy Adams further elaborated on this approach when he proclaimed in 1821 that:  
   Whenever the standard of freedom and independence has been or shall be unfurled, there will her [America's] heart, her benedictions and her prayers be. But she goes not abroad, in search of monsters to destroy. She is the well-wisher to the freedom and independence of all. She is the champion and vindicator only of her own.  
   As Henry Kissinger, a modern day commentator, has put it, this policy, augmented by the Monroe Doctrine of 1823 which sought to prevent European interference in the Western Hemisphere, made imminent good sense until early in the 1900s:  
   In the early years of the Republic, American foreign policy was in fact a sophisticated reflection of the American national interest, which was, simply, to fortify the new nation's independence. ..... Until the turn of the twentieth century, American foreign policy was basically quite simple: to fulfill the country's manifest destiny, and to remain free of entanglements overseas. America favored democratic governments whenever possible, but abjured action to vindicate its preferences. ..... Until early this century, the isolationist tendency prevailed in American foreign policy. Then two factors projected America into world affairs: its rapidly expanding power and the gradual collapse of the international system centered on Europe.  
   Woodrow Wilson took this increased American power and the shattered European order, added to it the traditional American view of our exceptional role in the world and developed  what has become the dominant approach of modern American foreign policy-making. As he said in 1915:  
   We insist upon security in prosecuting our self-chosen lines of national development. We do more than that. We demand it also for others. We do not confine our enthusiasm for individual liberty and free national development to the incidents and movements of affairs which affect only ourselves. We feel it wherever there is a people that tries to walk in these difficult paths of independence and right.  
   Thus, for the first time in American history, the notion that it was our right and our duty to ..... wherever they might arise was established. While the details have changed from time to time, with some variation in the degree of enthusiasm for foreign interventions, this is still today the foundation in defining our role in the world. It was elaborated somewhat in the famous 1947 Foreign Affairs article penned by ``X''--later disclosed to be George Kennan--which guided our ultimately successful conduct of the cold war by urging, ``a policy of firm containment, designed to confront the Russians with unalterable counterforce at every point where they show signs of encroaching upon the interests of a peaceful and stable world.'' 
   To be sure, there has rarely been a time in American history when all voices have been united behind the dominant approach to the U.S. global role. Many in this body, including myself, participated in one way or another in the national turmoil over the application of the containment policy in Southeast Asia, in a place called Vietnam. But, while there was vigorous debate on the advisability of specific implementations of Wilsonian ``idealism'' there has never been a serious challenge since the Second World War to what might be called an ``internationalist interventionist'' model for the United States in its national security policies. 
   Yet, as we begin the year 2000, the world has changed in significant ways from the one we have known since World War II. The Soviet Union is no more. The Communists did not, in the end, bury us, but with a few notable exceptions who currently survive in China, Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea, it is they who have been buried by historical inevitability. Again, to quote, Dr. Kissinger:  
   The end of the Cold War produced an even greater temptation to recast the international environment in America's image. Wilson had been constrained by isolationism at home, and Truman had come up against Stalinist expansionism. In the post-Cold War world, the United States is the only remaining superpower with the capacity to intervene in every part of the globe. Yet power has become more diffuse and the issues to which military force is relevant have diminished. Victory in the Cold War has propelled America into a world which bears many similarities to the European state system of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, and to practices which American statesmen and thinkers have consistently questioned. The absence of both an overriding ideological or strategic threat frees nations to pursue foreign policies based increasingly on their immediate national interest.  
   Just as the very different international environment facing America at the start of the 20th century--with growing American strength accompanying a collapse of the European order--occasioned the need for a fundamental reassessment of the U.S. place in the world, so the end of the 20th century--with an end to the bipolar cold war and the emergence of multiple, if not yet super at least major, powers--necessitates another thoroughgoing review and evaluation of where we are and where we should be headed. 
   And if one has been reading the foreign policy journals and white papers during the last few years, one finds a vigorous and thoughtful debate underway on just such questions. I'd like to take just a few minutes to provide the Senate with a small bit of the flavor of this dialog among American foreign policy commentators. 
   In a 1995 article in Foreign Affairs magazine, Richard Haass of the Brookings Institute provided I think a useful starting point for our consideration by separating the debate on America's global role into two parts: the priorities or ends of American policy, and the approaches or means currently available to achieve those ends. As possible priorities, he lists Wilsonian idealism with its emphasis on promotion of democratic values, economism which--as the 
   name suggests--gives primacy to economic considerations, realism which is often associated with the traditional diplomatic concepts of balance of power and international equilibrium, humanitarianism which focuses more on alleviating the plight of individuals, and minimalism which could be thought of as ``neo-isolationism'' but accepts the need for selected and limited U.S. engagement in global affairs. On the side of means, Haass lists unilateralism which provides the dominant country--the United States--with largely unfettered freedom of action in pursuit of its goals, neo-internationalism or ``assertive multilateralism'' which relies on multilateral organizations and approaches to international problem-solving, and regionalism which he defines as U.S. leadership within alliances and coalitions. 
   Writing in the Spring 1996 issue of Strategic Review, Naval Postgraduate School Professor of National Security Affairs Edward A. Olsen presented a view which might be termed as minimalism when he advocated a return to our pre-World War II approach which he characterized as one of ``abstention, benign neglect, and non-interventionism within a policy of highly selective engagement.'' Professor Olsen distinguished his proposed policy of disengagement and non-intervention--which would be marked by less military intervention, less foreign aid, and fewer international entanglements--from isolationism because his approach would allow the U.S. ``strategic independence'' to determine for itself, independent of other countries or multilateral organizations, when and how to engage abroad. 
   In almost direct opposition to the Olsen prescription, with goals akin to Wilsonian idealism and employing a largely unilateralist approach, William Kristol and Robert Kagan used a summer 1996 edition of Foreign Affairs to argue for a U.S. role of benevolent global hegemony in the belief that, ``American principles around the world can be sustained only by the continuing exertion of American influence,'' including foreign aid, diplomacy, and when necessary military intervention. 
   In his 1994 book, entitled Diplomacy, Henry Kissinger, provides a contemporary, updated version of the realist balance of power view:  
   America's dominant task is to strike a balance between the twin temptations inherent in its exceptionalism: the notion that America must remedy every wrong and stabilize every dislocation, and the latent instinct to withdraw into itself....... A country with America's idealistic tradition cannot base its policy on the balance of power as the sole criterion for a new world order. But is must learn that equilibrium is a fundamental precondition for the pursuit of its historic goals.  
   A quote that comes to mind for me is when President Kennedy said, ``There is not necessarily an American solution for every problem in the world.'' 
   I think that is the real issue. Former Congressman Stephen Solarz espoused the humaniarianism goal in the Winter 2000 edition of Blueprint Magazine:  
   Some, of course, will object to humanitarian intervention as a violation of the principle of sovereignty, which precludes military interference in the internal affairs of other nations....... Yet it is clear today that the non-interference doctrine no longer trumps all other considerations. This was obvious when the United Nations sanctioned interventions during the 1990s in Northern Iraq, Somalia, and Haiti. Where crimes against humanity or genocide are involved, the doctrine of humanitarian intervention is increasingly accepted as a justification for violating the otherwise inviolable borders of sovereign states.  
   A particular variant of the regionalism approach is contained within Samuel P. Huntington's 1996 work, The Clash of Civilizations: Remaking of World Order. 
   I know that is a favorite of the good Senator from Kansas.  
   In the aftermath of the cold war the United States became consumed with massive debates over the proper course of American foreign policy. In this era, however, the United States can neither dominate nor escape the world. Neither internationalism nor isolationism, neither multilateralism nor unilateralism, will best serve its interests. Those will best be advanced by eschewing these opposing extremes and instead adopting an Atlanticist policy of close cooperation with its European partners to protect and advance the interests and values of the unique civilization they share.  
   These are just a very few of the many ``think pieces'' which have been coming  out of the American foreign policy community since the end of the cold war. Even this brief glimpse reveals a wide divergence in expert opinions on the preferred priorities and approaches for post-cold-war U.S. global engagement. To further evaluate the current debate among individuals with strongly held views on where we should be headed I asked the outstanding Congressional Research Service to provide me with a ``review of the literature'' on U.S. global role options.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, James Lindsay of the Brookings Institution, I think, well summed up where we in Congress are today in this great debate on America's proper role in the world in the Winter 2000 Brookings Review, where he wrote:  
   Much like friends who agree to dine but can't agree on a restaurant, foreign policy elites agree that the United States should do something, just not what. Congress naturally reflects this dissensus, which makes it difficult for the institution to function. Divided by chamber, party, ideology, region, committee, and generation, Congress lists toward paralysis whenever a modicum of agreement and a sense of proportion are absent.  
   In a nutshell, attempting to overcome this ``dissensus'' and ``paralysis'' is what Senator ROBERTS and I are trying to do in these dialogs. I'd like at this point to yield to the distinguished Senator from Kansas for his comments.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, may I say my colleague from Kansas, as he so often does, put his finger right on it. The question is one of priorities. I appreciate him pointing out the CNN effect. The extent to which this country can respond to each and every problem in the world is limited. We have to recognize that; therefore, we must insist on dealing with our top priorities. 
   I deeply appreciate the wonderful quote of General Shelton which I first heard at an Armed Services Committee hearing, that we have, in effect, a great hammer, but not every problem in the world is a nail. What a great way to phrase that particular point of view. 
   I appreciate Senator ROBERTS' mentioning General Powell, one of my personal heroes. I once had the pleasure of visiting him in the Pentagon when he was Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. We spoke about the purpose of the American military. He said: My purpose is to give the President of the United States the best advice I can on how to use the American military to stay out of war; but if we get in war, win and win quickly. 
   That is still probably the finest definition of the mission statement of our military forces I have ever heard. 
   So I thank the Senator from Kansas for his insight and for his timely remarks. 
   I will now conclude my prepared remarks today by offering some preliminary thoughts as we begin this dialogue on the U.S. global role. As I said at the outset, I certainly do not have any final judgments or answers to this critical question. In my view, no one has, or can have, all of the answers right now because so many of the elements of the post-cold-war world--including its geopolitical alignments,  ``rules of the game'' in dispute resolution and trade, and the role of non-national actors, including non-governmental organizations, the news media and unfortunately transnational terrorists--are in flux. But we cannot let this lack of certainty and finality deter our efforts to find the best set of policies we can now develop, not when challenges or potential challenges to our national interests continue to arise, not when the people of America are asked to sustain whatever policy we here espouse. 
   I might say, as a Vietnam veteran who almost came back in a body bag, the Dover test, the Dover, DE test, or the ability of this country to measure the rightness of our actions based on the price we are willing to pay, is a powerful one. 
   When our sons and daughters in the military are asked to put their family life on hold and their lives on the line in support of whatever the civilian authorities determine, they have a right to ask us if those policies are worth it. 
   I have been deeply disturbed by the tenor of our recent debates in the Congress and with the administration on a host of important national security issues. Most recently, the Senate failed to ratify the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty after little meaningful debate and no Senate hearings. This was one of the most consequential treaties of the decade, and it was sadly reduced to sound-bite politics and partisan rancor. 
   In addition to the CTBT, the Senate has made monumental decisions on our policies in the Balkans and the Persian Gulf, funding for the Wye River Accords and the future of NATO and the United Nations, all without a comprehensive set of American goals and policies. Simply put, I do not believe we can afford to continue on a path of partisanship and division of purpose without serious damage to our national interests. 
   In addition, as the ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Personnel Subcommittee, I have been heavily involved in trying to improve the quality of life for our servicemen and women through such steps as increasing pay and enhancing health and education benefits. It is my deeply held view that not only do we need to take such action to address some disturbing trends in armed forces recruitment and retention, but we owe these individuals nothing less in recognition of their service. 
   However, as important as these other factors are, the ultimate quality of life issues center on decisions made by national security decisionmakers here in Washington relating to the deployment of our forces abroad. It is these deployments which separate families, disrupt lives, and in those cases which involve hostilities, endanger the service member's life itself. This is not to say that I believe our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines are not fully prepared to do whatever we ask of them. But we on this end owe them nothing less than a full and thorough consideration each and every time we put them into harm's way. 
   There are thirteen military installations in Georgia, and I visit the troops whenever I can. When I go to these bases, I see weary and beleaguered families who are doing their best to make it through the weeks and months without their husbands or wives. They are, indeed, on the point of the spear of this Nation's military force. They are paying a heavy toll for our military engagements around the world. It is a price they are ready to pay, but one I want the Senate to understand and appreciate as we continue in our commitment of troops aboard. 
   For what it is worth, based on what I have seen and heard to date, I believe we in positions of foreign policy making responsibility in the United States need to be much more mindful of such traditional realist diplomatic precepts as ``balance of power'' and ``equilibrium.'' This is not to say that I believe our distinctly American approach to foreign policy, dominated throughout by idealist considerations and in most of the 20th century by what is often called Wilsonian internationalism has been wrong-headed or unfounded. Clearly, for the most part, it has served us well in advancing our vital national interests, whether those were securing our national independence, promoting the spread of self-determination and democracy, or defeating Soviet communism. 
   But the post-cold-war period is a new day for America as well as the world. In my view, we need not, and certainly will not, renounce our ideals, but in this new era, those ideals must be grounded in a policy which realistically gauges what price Americans can or should pay in support of our global role. 
   We have to ask the Dover, DE test: How many body bags do we want to see coming home? We have to ask what price we are going to pay for our military. We cannot continue to downsize our American military by a third and increase our commitments abroad by 300 percent, whether or not our commitments abroad are actually sustainable over a period of time. 
   Last, I am struck by the words of the conservative editor of the National Interest, Owen Harries:  
   I advocate restraint because every dominant power in the last four centuries that has not practiced it--that has been excessively intrusive and demanding--has ultimately been confronted by a hostile coalition of other powers. Americans may believe that their country, being exceptional, need have no worries in this respect. I do not agree. It is not what Americans think of the United States but what others think of it that will decide the matter.  
   Mr. President, I appreciate the indulgence of the Senate for our discussion here, and I thank my colleague for his tremendous insight and his marvelous research into the challenges we face in America's global role today. I look forward to continuing this discussion and this dialog in the coming weeks.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce this military health care initiative--the Military Health Care Improvements Act of 2000. 
   I am here today because the military health care system saved my life. 
   Many distinguished members have preceded me in attempting to address this issue of ensuring that our military members and their families are properly cared for. 
   As I have stated many times--and devoted untold hours of thought, meetings, and considerations to--military health care is the issue for those who have served and for those who are serving, and especially those who will serve in the military. 
   From my first day in the Senate, I have considered no issue more important in the maintenance of our military forces than the military health care system. I have addressed this issue in prior legislation. 
   As I arrived in Washington, the Tricare system of military health care was taking hold in my State with poor performance I might add. Of course, much has been improved because of this body and the Congress as a whole responding to our constituents, and ensuring we live up to our obligations to our military members. 
   In any scholar's opinion, our Nation's rise as a national power has been dependent on our military power--military power is the enabler to economic power and well being of any country. 
   The underpinning to our military power has always been and always will be our military service members. In fact, Time magazine recently voted the American GI as the Person of the 20th Century. 
   We have obligations to these brave souls and their families who serve selflessly and proudly. 
   I believe that among many other quality of issues, the most important of these obligations is quality military health care. Service members serve with distinction, in places unknown, without question to orders, and without expectations. It is up to this Congress to act on legislation, and to provide the most comprehensive health care for those members--past, present, and future. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this bill with conviction. Why? Because it is more than the right thing to do--it must be done, if we are to fill the ranks of our services, and if we are to live up to the obligations of all those brave soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen that have given their lives for this country so that we could enjoy this country's bounty. 
   Our legislation would cover several main health care issues for military personnel, their families, and military retirees, such as: expanding health care coverage for Medicare Eligible Retirees by extending the demonstration projects already underway to 2005, expanding the Tricare Senior Prime demonstration, and expanding the Federal Employees Health Care Benefits Program (FEHP), demonstration for Medicare eligibles, that is also currently underway; expanding the military pharmacy programs by expanding the national mail order pharmacy program to Medicare-eligible beneficiaries, reducing enrollment fees for the pharmacy pilot program and implementing deductibles and quarterly/monthly payment schedules; eliminating copays for Tricare Prime and expanding the Tricare remote program and improve Tricare business practices; and grandfather those participating the Department of Defense home health care demonstration program; and additionally, encourage the Department of Defense and Veterans Administration Cooperative Programs already underway to address patient safety and pharmaceutical safety, two key issues in health care today. Several other legislative initiatives have been introduced this year to address health care for the military--active duty and retirees. 
   In the coming weeks, the Personnel Subcommittee of the Senate Armed Services Committee, which Senator HUTCHINSON heads and of which I am pleased to be the ranking Democrat, will address each bill that comes to us on the subject of military health care reform in the hopes of finding the right combination of each of these bills to formulate the best final product for the committee's markup. I look forward to receiving testimony on each measure, and I look forward to working with Senator HUTCHINSON on these important health care initiatives. Since his appointment to the Senate Armed  Services Committee, I have truly enjoyed a wonderful working relationship with him, and I am sure that will continue. I appreciate his support and his interest in the issue of service men and women and their health care. 
   I have also been encouraged by the bipartisan support our measure has received, and I am happy to be working with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Chairman WARNER, Ranking Member LEVIN, Majority Leader LOTT, and Minority Leader DASCHLE on addressing this critical issue. This legislation continues our work on addressing health care for retirees and the active components. I am excited at the possibility of passage of this comprehensive legislation.

    Mr. CLELAND. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to introduce the ``Road Back to Clean Air Act''. Georgia has one of the fastest growth rates in the nation, specifically in the Metropolitan Atlanta area. Although this growth is welcomed and encouraged as an economic boom for the region, two of the results created by this growth have been traffic congestion and air pollution. Unfortunately, as we embark into a new millennium with all of its great possibilities, what is most noted about Metro Atlanta is the severe transportation problems of the region. A recent survey found that Atlanta had the very worst traffic congestion of any Southern city, and Metro Atlanta drivers have the longest average vehicle miles traveled in the nation--an average of 34 miles per day. All of this costs our economy $1.5 billion a year in wasted time and fuel. And, this congestion has been accompanied by significant environmental problems. 
   To make matters even worse for the State and Metro Atlanta, the ability of the area to correct this problem is complicated and constrained for two reasons. First, Metro Atlanta is designated a ``serious'' non-attainment area under the Clean Air Act. Second, Metro Atlanta has been in a conformity lapse since January 17, 1998. Each of these designations restricts the ability of the Metro area to implement new transportation projects, thus hindering the economic growth and quality of life in the region. 
   In addition, in March of last year, the D.C. District Court of Appeals effectively ruled that Metro Atlanta's 61 ``grand-fathered'' transportation projects were illegal because they were not in conformity with clean air requirements, thus calling into question some $1 billion worth of such construction projects. Fortunately, on June 21, 1999, an out-of-court settlement was reached in Atlanta relating to a similar lawsuit filed by The Georgia Conservancy, the Sierra Club, and Georgians for Transportation Choices. These groups indicated that they did not file the suit to kill road projects, but rather to bring attention to the need for regional planning, air quality improvement, and transportation alternatives. The settlement allowed 17 of the 61 road projects to move forward while declaring the remaining 44 ineligible. 
   I must express my sincerest appreciation to Transportation Secretary Slater whose personal intervention and commitment made this settlement agreement possible. This was very positive news which has allowed Metro Atlanta to finally begin to move forward with its 17 approved projects and to re-direct its surplus funds toward transportation alternatives which will help reduce traffic congestion and improve air quality. In fact, as a result of the settlement, Atlanta is soon expected to submit its Regional Transportation Plan (RTP) which not only embodies a new focus on more regional planning and transportation alternatives, but also includes most, if not all, of the grand-fathered projects which were halted. The difference here of course is that these grand-fathered projects are now incorporated into a more comprehensive long-range transportation plan which takes into account Atlanta's clean air problems. This is a win-win situation for Metro Atlanta. 
   However, this is a serious, serious problem and is in large measure a product of the very economic success which has made, year after year, Metro Atlanta one of the fastest growing areas of the country. Because the problem has been building over many years, the planners in Metro Atlanta understand that a solution will not occur overnight. However, Atlanta's experience has highlighted the need for providing local planners with additional flexibility during a conformity lapse. It is this experience that has led me to introduce the Road Back to Clean Air Act. 
   The purpose of the Road Back to Clean Air Act is to assist metropolitan areas, such as Atlanta, which are facing severe transportation problems that are complicated by time-consuming, inflexible constraints. 
   First, the Road Back to Clean Air Act codifies the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) guidance put forward as a result of the D.C. District Court decision. The Atlanta situation has demonstrated that these guidelines can allow transportation projects to move forward while ensuring that local residents are protected from the negative health effects of dirty air. 
   Second, the bill provides local planners with additional flexibility to obtain federal funding for beneficial transportation projects during a conformity lapse. Among other projects which could move forward during such a lapse would be public transit and high occupancy vehicle lanes. 
   The main benefit of this legislation is that it provides transportation planners in cities across the country with additional flexibility in meeting their transportation goals while preserving the health benefits of clean air. Additionally, it has the endorsement of numerous environmental groups, including the plaintiffs in the D.C. District Court case. Therefore, costly litigation that can only delay Atlanta's, and other areas, good faith efforts to alleviate traffic congestion and improve air quality will be avoided should this legislation be enacted into law. 
   Beyond Atlanta, other metropolitan areas in the United States are currently or will in the future face the constraints of non-conformity and non-attainment as they attempt to develop and implement their transportation plans. I believe the Road Back to Clean Air Act will provide these cities with the flexibility to move forward with vital transportation projects while at the same time maintaining the integrity of the Clean Air Act. 
   I thank my colleagues for their attention and I urge your co-sponsorship of this important legislation.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, to support Americans faced with long-term care needs I am proposing a savings bond tax credit. Many people are struggling to pay for the assistive care needs associated with conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. An estimated 5.8 million Americans aged 65 or older need long-term care. Nursing home care is only one component of long-term care services that includes assisted living, adult day and home care. Medicare and health insurance do not cover long-term care. In 1995, federal and state spending for nursing home care was approximately $34 billion and an additional $21 billion was used for home care. It is projected that half of all women and a third of men in this country who are now age 65 are likely to spend some time in their later years in a nursing home at a cost from $40,000 to $90,000 per person. About 40% of all nursing home expenses are paid for out-of-pocket by patients and/or family members. Liquidating family assets is often the only way for many to fund the high costs for care. These staggering statistics and the pleas for help from Americans in such situations reinforce the critical need for long-term care assistance. 
   To qualify for this proposed tax credit, the person receiving care must have at least two limitations in activities of daily living or a comparable cognitive impairment. Activities of daily living, like eating, bathing, and toileting, are basic care needs that must be met. Families that claim parents or parents-in law as dependents on their tax returns can qualify for this tax credit if  savings bonds are used to pay for long-term care services. ``Sandwich generation'' families paying for both college education for their children and long-term care services for their parents can use this tax credit for either program or a combined credit up to the maximum.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today to pay tribute to a great American and dear friend, Mr. Zachary Fisher. Zach led an extraordinary life that included service to his fellow man and to our country. He was a major philanthropic benefactor for the men and women of the United States Armed Forces. His generosity was shared with numerous non-profit organizations and foundations including causes such as Alzheimer's Disease, military retiree housing, and educational benefits for our men and women in uniform. 
   When the United States entered World War II in 1941, Zach was ineligible to serve in the armed forces due to a serious knee injury sustained in a construction accident. ``I could have cried,'' he said, recalling the day he was told he did not pass the Marine Corps physical. ``I wanted to go defend my country.'' 
   Nevertheless, determined to do his part, he aided the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in building coastal fortifications at home. Following the war, Zach, along with his brothers, earned an international reputation as a leader in the construction industry. Zach spent the rest of his life doing good deeds for his country, turning the wealth he earned as a developer into good will for the men and women of the armed services. 
   In 1978, Zach founded the Intrepid Museum Foundation to save the historic and battle-scarred aircraft carrier Intrepid. Through his efforts the vessel became the home of the Intrepid Sea Air Space Museum, which opened in New York City in 1982. Zach went on to contribute more than $25 million for the establishment and operation of the Museum, a tribute to the thousands of military men and women who have served and continue to serve our country. 
   In addition to founding the Intrepid Museum, Zach and his wife Elizabeth also formed the Fisher Armed Services Foundation to provide contributions to families who survive the death of a loved one in the armed service. Since then, the Foundation has supported hundreds of families of military personnel. 
   The Foundation also provides scholarship funds to active duty and former service members as well as their families. Since 1987, hundreds of students have received significant scholarships to further their education. In 1990, the Fishers began the Fisher House Program, dedicating more than $15 million to the construction of housing for families of hospitalized military personnel. The houses are designed to provide all the comforts of home and allow families to support one another through their difficult times. 
   The Presidential Medal of Freedom Award, the highest honor that can be awarded a United States citizen, was presented to Zachary Fisher by President Clinton in 1998. Fisher was awarded the Medal for his steadfast and generous support of the U.S. military. His support of the military was also recognized this year as legislation, which I had the honor of sponsoring in the Senate designating Zachary Fisher as an honorary veteran of the United States Armed Forces. Zach was only the second person ever to receive such a designation. In addition, Zach was also awarded the Congressional Medal of Freedom. 
   Sadly, Zach lost his long battle with cancer on June 4, 1999. Zach was truly the friend of the everyday soldier. He will be dearly missed and remembered for his selfless devotion to United States service members and their families. Zachary Fisher was a great man who leaves behind a legacy that will continue to better the lives of American men and women for years to come.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise before you today to recognize the outstanding achievements and hard work of the Georgia Board of Regents. This dedicated group of men and women has committed itself to improving higher education in the state of Georgia and I am proud of their accomplishments. As John F. Kennedy said, ``Our progress as a nation can be no swifter than our progress in education.'' 
   Over the past five years, the Regents have developed a commitment to bring the Georgia higher education system into the new millennium through strategic planning and sweeping vision. In October of 1994, just as Dr. Stephen Porch was officially inaugurated as the University System's ninth Chancellor, the Board adopted the first step of a new program, ``Access to Academic Excellence for the New Millennium.'' The Board called for Georgia's public colleges and universities to be recognized for first-rate education, leading edge research and committed public service. The Board's new statement took into account input from various student groups, University and Regent presidents, and leaders in the education community. 
   Later that same year, the Regents adopted a new set of guiding principles to serve as the foundation for future policy making and modified the affiliated graduate degree structure. This cleared the way for institutions throughout the state to offer graduate programs autonomously, collectively, or under shared authority. 
   In March of 1995, Chancellor Porch introduced another new policy direction to address the need for ``co-reform'' of public education in the state. This reform was an effort to recognize that all sectors of education are fundamentally linked and that improvement in one sector requires a comprehensive effort of all sectors. Governor Miller's support of this initiative became a critical element in its success and he appointed a statewide Council to implement the directive. 
   Throughout 1995, the Board of Regents continued to see successes in its effort to improve the delivery of education throughout Georgia. In June, the Board introduced a new admissions policy with the goal of breaking the cycle of low admissions expectations and inadequate college preparation. The new admissions policy aimed to make such changes in two ways: fostering more effective preparation of students before they are accepted for admission; and broadening the admissions evaluation process to look beyond single quantitative measures such as standardized test scores. 
   In 1996, the Board approved the framework for a new core curriculum, just eight months after the first meeting of the Advisory Committee meeting. The committee was charged with redesigning the original core curriculum--a redesign that focused on a multidisciplinary effort that maximizes the resources of a particular institution. 
   All of these efforts came together in December of 1997 when the Board gave final approval on 
   the University System's new admissions policy. This approval included policy on admissions for students without a high school diploma and outlines specific courses that fulfill the College Preparatory Curriculum requirements. 
   In August of 1998, Chancellor Porch began a tour of all 34 System institutions. He travelled to update faculty, staff, students and elected officials as well as local communities on the progress the University System had made over the past four years, and the work that remains to be done to create a more educated Georgia. 
   By this fall, the members of the Georgia Board of Regents saw the fruits of their labor. SAT scores of students entering the University System were up, and a survey of state business leaders showed their satisfaction with the quality of the University had increased from two years prior. Plans to increase access to technology were drafted, and an effort to be even more responsive to the educational, economic and fiscal needs of the state was committed. As Ben Franklin once said, ``An investment in knowledge always pays the best interest.'' How true that is. 
   I once heard Marian Wright Edelman of the Children's Defense Fund say that ``service is the rent each of us pays for living.'' I want to thank the men and women of the Georgia Board of Regents for their service and dedication to the higher educational system in the great state of Georgia. We will all benefit from your efforts. 
   At this point, I would ask to include in the RECORD the names and hometowns of the distinguished Georgians who have served on the state's Board of Regents from January 1993 to the present.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to add some additional comments to my statement that appeared in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD on Tuesday, November 16, 1999. 
   Just a few days ago, on Tuesday, November 16, several constituents of mine were involved in a disastrous truck-related crash on I-285, a major commuter route around Atlanta. The crash took place during the morning rush hour. Four tractor-trailer trucks were involved in the crash, two of which were tankers hauling flammable materials. Four passenger cars were also involved in the crash, and tragically, one woman was killed when her vehicle was crushed between two tractor-trailer trucks. Four others were rushed to the hospital to be treated for injuries. Thankfully, no further fatalities have been reported and no evacuation was required due to the sensitive material two of the trucks were hauling. This crash underscores the need to guarantee that truck safety is a priority in this country, and hopefully, reduce the occurrence of accidents such as this. 
   H.R. 3419 is a step in the right direction. It creates a new motor carrier safety administration. In a hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee, of which I am a member, the Department of Transportation (DOT) Inspector General (IG) testified that the current oversight system for the trucking industry within the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) is not adequate. In fact, one of the main supporters of this legislation is Transportation Secretary Slater, who saw the need to create a separate motor carrier oversight administration focused entirely on safety. 
   Now that Congressional sentiment has swung toward adoption of H.R. 3419 and the establishment of a new Motor Carrier Safety Administration, my colleagues and I should track the implementation of this statute to ensure that the new agency will not bring with it the problems associated with the former body. Safety and compliance should be the utmost concerns of this office, with the American motorist as the benefactor of their efforts.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on November 9, 1999, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed (411-8) the conference report on H.R. 1554, the Intellectual Property and Communications Omnibus Reform Act of 1999. Arriving at a conference report compromise was a long process. For months, conferees have been negotiating over these provisions. The bill the Committee produced was a good bill, and that is underscored by the overwhelming, bipartisan support the final version received. 
   However, the Senate will not act on this bill propr to adjourning for the year. Instead, Congress will recess without passing the complete Conference Committee version of H.R. 1554. In an attempt to achieve some of the gains from this bill, a modified version of the Satellite Home Viewers Act will be attached to the final omnibus appropriations bill and passed by Congress. However, it will be absent one important provision that would help ensure that rural citizens are not overlooked as they often are in other sectors. 
   The two major direct broadcast satellite (DBS) companies have stated to Congress that they will only serve the most popular markets with local broadcast channels once the statutory restriction prohibiting this action is removed. An incentive needs to be there for businesses to develop this same service for households in second tier markets and rural areas as well. The conference report to H.R. 1554 would have provided $1.25 billion in loan guarantees for satellite companies that seek to serve these often overlooked markets. It was an idea I strongly supported because it would have encouraged development of this service in second tier and rural markets in Georgia and elsewhere in the country. 
   Instead, a single Senator demanded the removal of this provision because of procedural issues and because, at the end of a legislative session it generally takes unanimous consent to expedite consideration of each measure, the bill presented to the Senate as part of the final appropriations bill reflects an acquiescence to this demand. To respond to those of us who supported the loan guarantee, the Chairman of the Banking Committee has promised to take up this provision and pass appropriate legislation by April 1, 2000. In the meantime, millions of satellite viewers who live in middle and rural America will not have the opportunity to view their local channels nor will they have the solace in knowing such service will be coming soon. This is very disappointing, and it is my sincere hope that the promise to act swiftly on the loan guarantees will be kept in an environment where promises and compacts are too often ignored. 
   As a member of the Commerce Committee, I have been closely following this bill throughout the entire process. At the heart of this debate is viewers' access to local broadcast television. I say to my colleagues that rural Americans deserve the same access to their local broadcast stations that urban and suburban DBS customers will soon enjoy. I will work next year to ensure that this loan guarantee program is acted upon swiftly.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I share with my colleagues some very exciting news coming out of my home state of Georgia. Earlier this month, two giant pandas, Lun Lun and Yang Yang, were delivered safely by UPS from Beijing, China to their new home at Zoo Atlanta after a 17-hour global journey. 
   Zoo Atlanta Director Dr. Terry Maple ``signed'' for the special delivery during a welcoming ceremony at Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport with more than 200 dignitaries and elementary school children looking on. The very special delivery brings to six the total number of rare giant pandas now residing in the United States. 
   I would like to recognize the special role that UPS has played in this long journey to bring the pandas to their new home. UPS became involved with the panda transport when Zoo Atlanta officials asked for their help in the construction and maintenance of the panda habitat. The UPS Foundation agreed to give $625,000 over five years to fund the habitat project at the zoo, and also agreed to provide all the logistical support necessary to move the pandas from Beijing to Atlanta. 
   The move involved over 100 UPS employees in six cities from around the world (Atlanta, Louisville, Anchorage, Singapore, Hong Kong and Beijing) covering travels of 7,526 miles. There were backup flight crews and a backup aircraft in place in case of health problems or mechanical failures, customs support people to smooth the process of bringing the animals onto U.S. soil, and even a UPS manager to accompany the two-person flight crew and act as load master. 
   UPS also flew two Chinese and one American veterinarians from Beijing to Atlanta. The animals were unloaded by UPS air gateway employees and placed in UPS package cars (the familiar brown delivery truck) that were specially marked with panda graphics. The vehicles (four trucks, two as back ups in case of mechanical problems) were driven by specially chosen Circle of Honor members, UPS drivers who have driven for 25 years or more without an accident. The package cars were outfitted with air conditioning and heating units for the animals. 
   This exciting new addition to the Atlanta landscape would not have been possible without the hard work, dedication and financial support of many people, especially at Zoo Atlanta and UPS. I am thrilled that Atlanta will be a part of such an important exchange and friendship endeavor with the people of China and I am proud of the support and enthusiasm that have showered Lun Lun and Yang Yang throughout their journey and now that they are in their new home.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a great American institution and its leader. The American Legion Barrett-Davis-Watson Post #233 is located in a small Georgia town called Loganville and it is commanded by a true patriot in every sense of the word--Mr. Bobby Boss. For over 50 years this man's leadership has allowed the post to continue offering community services that any American would be proud of. 
   Post #233 held its first meeting on November 19, 1946 with the Legion's standard program of the day: patriotism, rehabilitation, community service, community welfare and membership. Less than ten years after its inception, the Post responded to the town of Loganville's need for a medical doctor by building a clinic. The Post later donated a truck and tractor to the city. 
   Over the past 40 years, the Post has continued to make numerous donations to the community, including an annual $1,500 donation to the town's elementary school to help purchase shoes and clothes for the needy and a $12,000 donation for dropout prevention programs in all Walton County Schools. 
   Tragedy struck the Post in 1977 when a fire all but destroyed the Post building, leaving nothing but ashes and concrete. At the first monthly meeting after the fire, a majority of the members present chose not to rebuild, but Commander Boss was not in that majority. Two weeks after that meeting, he took his own bulldozer and cleared the charred remains. His efforts resulted in the fine building the Post uses today. 
   Once the Post was back on its feet, many of the programs that had fallen by the wayside due to rebuilding costs were reinstated. In the past 10 years alone, Post #233 has supported renovation projects for the city of Loganville and donated $8,000 towards the purchase of computers for the local high school; donated half the costs of building a baseball field complete with lights, restrooms and a concession stand. Post #233 has also contributed funds to help the local Sheriff's department purchase camera equipment for patrol cars. This Christmas season, members of Post #233 will prepare and deliver more than one thousand baskets for widows, the disabled and needy families. 
   The good work of Post #233 represents all that is noble in our great nation. I applaud their community service and their patriotism. They are an asset to their community, the great state of Georgia and the United States of America.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss S. 1501, the Motor Carrier Safety Improvement Act of 1999. During the Commerce Committee's Subcommittee on Surface Transportation hearing on this bill, I brought the attention of the entire room to a deadly tractor trailer accident that occurred in Atlanta in the early morning hours of August 31, 1999. Two lives were lost as a result of that accident, but if the incident would have occurred at a busier time of day, I shudder to think of the fatalities that could have resulted. 
   In 1998, 221 people were killed in Georgia as a result of truck related crashes, and thousands more were injured. Recently, I met with two people who lost their families in truck related accidents. These stories are ones which I hope will become less frequent as a result of the action we are taking in S. 1501. This bill has the opportunity to improve safety for drivers and truckers.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before my colleagues today to pay tribute to a dear friend, Jerry Davis, Jr. Jerry and I first met in the Army when we were stationed in New Jersey together before we headed to Vietnam. Jerry is a man with an extraordinary story and I am proud to be among his circle of friends. 
   Jerry was born on January 2, 1925 in Terry, Louisiana--a humble beginning for a sharecropper's son destined for the cover of FORTUNE Magazine (October, 1975). Jerry was a man committed to a life of service and his family, his church, his community and his country. A generous, loving and forgiving spirit, a respect for order and tradition and a legendary helping hand were the hallmarks of his life. 
   After graduating first in his class from the Magnolia Training School, he cut his formal education short , despite receiving a scholarship from Southern University, by enlisting in the U.S. Army. Joining the all African-American 94th Engineer Construction Battalion at the end of World War II, he began his military career as an enlisted man in Paris. Seven years later he completed Officer Training School in Fort Benning, Georgia and as a new 2nd Lieutenant was company commander in the Korean War. In 1967, he returned to combat as one of two African-American battalion commanders in Vietnam. After 26 years of distinguished  service, Lieutenant Colonel Davis retired. 
   From there, Jerry went on to accomplish many great things. Among them were, being Chairman of the Board of M.U.S.C.L.E.--a non-profit organization providing low income housing in Southwest Washington--and serving as a trustee for the retirement fund of the Washington Suburban Sanitation Commission. In the early 1970's, Jerry founded Unified Services Inc., a successful building service management company and was Chairman of the Board and CEO of Unibar Maintenance in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Jerry was also a delegate to the 1980 White House Conference on Small Business. 
   While on a business trip to Portland, Oregon with a friend, he met Jean Cotton Simmons and swept her off her feet. They married and shortly after created a family whose dimensions extend miles beyond their shared hearth with a tradition of hospitality, humor and huge holiday celebrations. 
   Jerry fills his free time with the sounds of Duke Ellington, Frank Sinatra and Miles Davis, and when his wife isn't looking, it's long cigars and the Redskins. And I can't forget our shared love of Westerns, especially ``Gunfight at the OK Corral.'' Countless people have had life defining moments with this ordinary man who produced extraordinary results, leaving behind an enduring legacy of living life to its unreasonable fullest. As Jerry and his family battle against his cancer, I applaud the courage and determination he has shown throughout his life. 
   As George Bernard Shaw once said, ``The reasonable man adapts himself to the conditions that surround him. The unreasonable man adapts surrounding conditions to himself. Our progress depends on the unreasonable man.''

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on the eve of its one hundred and seventy-fifth birthday, I rise today to recognize a most charming and prosperous town, Perry, GA. When the first settlers came to the fertile plains of central Georgia, they found a wealth of natural  resources that promised prosperity. The land proved not only beautiful, but also perfectly suited for agriculture. The town's initial successes attracted entrepreneurial citizens who contributed greatly to Perry's strong industrial and agricultural presence in Georgia which continues to grow to this day. 
   Perry is the seat of Houston County, and is blessed with a rich abundance of natural, historic and cultural diversity. Formerly known as Wattsville, Perry became the first official town in the county on November 25, 1824. Perry is named after Commodore Oliver Perry, who became famous for a battle on Lake Erie during the war of 1812. During the battle of September 10, 1813, Perry defeated and captured a flotilla of six large British frigates with an improvised fleet of nine American vessels and in so doing neutralized the British naval presence on Lake Erie. 
   For as long as anyone can remember, Perry has been a favorite place for tourists to stop. Known as the ``Crossroads of Georgia,'' Perry is located in the geographic center of the state where U.S. Highways 341 and 41 and the Golden Isles Parkway intersect with Interstate 75. With an ideal location along I-75, Perry has long enjoyed the distinction as Georgia's halfway point to Florida. As a result, snowbirds and vacationers of every type have recognized Perry as a pleasant place to stop and rest, grab a bite to eat at one of Perry's many restaurants, including one of my favorites, The New Perry Hotel, or simply to enjoy the peacefulness of the small town. Combined with the graciousness with which they are received by Perryans, many have found it difficult to leave! 
   For festival-goers, Perry's warm climate and 628-acre events complex provide ample opportunity for fun and entertainment. Perry is home to Georgia's National Fair, a much-anticipated, 10-day extravaganza held each October. Activities at the fair are reminiscent of county fairs of old, revolving around livestock and horse shows, FAA and FHA events, home and fine arts displays, as well as the ever-popular baking and quilting competitions. This year marked the 10-year anniversary of the fair. The 628-acre complex is the largest of its kind, and the events hosted at the Georgia National Fairgrounds and Agricenter have an estimated economic impact of $30 million annually. 
   For about two weeks starting in mid-March, the Peach Blossom Trail on U.S. 341 north of Perry is lined with pink and white blossoms. From mid-May through mid-August, an abundance of fresh peaches can be found for sale at roadside stands. Dogwoods and azaleas bloom profusely during the spring and camellias brighten the landscape during the winter. The dogwood has been adopted as the city's official tree. Perry's downtown has been maintained as a colonial-style village with specialty shops and restful atmosphere. 
   More than the festivals, beauty, history or industry, it is the wonderful people of Perry who make it such a unique place. Perry manages to maintain a less hectic pace and small town friendliness that has become a rarity in today's hustle-bustle society. There is an extremely strong sense of community in Perry as is evident in the strong church attendance, school participation, civic activism and neighborhood involvement among Perry's citizens. Additionally, Perry can be claimed as home by such noted national leaders as General Courtney Hodges of World War II fame, former U.S. Senator Sam Nunn, and the late former Congressman Richard Ray. 
   Mr. President, I warmly request that you and my colleagues join me in paying tribute to a jewel of a town, Perry, GA.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am reminded of incredibly sacred places and moments in our history when I rise to talk about recognition of our veterans--past and present--on Veteran's Day--recognizing all our veteran's from all our wars. Places like Arlington National Cemetery, Andersonville, Georgia, the beaches of Normandy, Pearl Harbor, the Chosin Reservoir, Keshan, the deserts of Kuwait, and now the skies over Kosovo, should be indelibly etched in all our thoughts. 
   It is often said ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes, but poorer still is the nation which has them but forgets.'' We will gather all over this great nation on Thursday, November 11, 1999 to remember for the last time this century our veterans and to restate our commitment that they will never be forgotten. I consider all those who has ever been in uniform to my brothers and sisters. We all came to these hollowed chambers through distinguished routes, I got to Washington because of those who served in the military and I work here, day in and day out, for them! 
   As we depart Washington, I ask that we reiterate our promise to our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, DoD civilians, and their families--that they will not be slighted, now or ever--that we honor their service--that we honor the service of those still missing, because their plight is our plight. 
   We cannot remember our Veterans properly without remembering the sacrifices of war--these are the issues that hit home. We remember those service members who have sacrificed for this nation, and we pay special tribute to their families. 
   I ask through my resolution that we additionally pay special tribute this Veteran's Day to those service members--active, guard, reserve, and civilians--who participated in the recently successful military operations--combat and humanitarian--in Kosovo and the entire Balkans area of operations. 
   Over 39,000 members of the Armed Services deployed to the Balkans area during the peak of Kosovo operations, 700 U.S. aircraft were deployed, 37,000 overall missions were flown with 25,000 of these by U.S. aircraft, and 5,000 missions were weapons strike missions. We all know that this is only a partial picture of what was occurring on the ground, on the high seas, and in the air. These facts fit any definition of warfare. 
   We can not forget these individuals and their families any more than we can forget those of all of our past wars. If freedom is the fruit of victory, Veteran's Day reminds us too of the cost of war--casualties, POWs, and MIAs. They live in our hearts while we live in the world they made safe for us. I call for us all this Veteran's Day to remember specially our Kosovo and Balkans service members as we remember all past veterans. 
   Every day I wake up, I thank God I am here. I am inspired to continue living by the memory of our veteran's. The vigilance of those that went to Kosovo, like those who still serve in the Balkans, those in the desert, those in ships, and those in Korea and in the far corners of the earth, is now my vigilance, their fight is now my fight. I ask my colleagues to remember and to ensure that their sacrifices are not made in vain. 
   Secretary Cohen recently stated at the POW/MIA recognition ceremony at Arlington Cemetery--an awesome, somber experience--that ``we are the heirs of freedom, paid for with the blood of patriots.'' I ask my colleagues to remember our Kosovo and Balkans patriots in their ceremonies this Veteran's Day. How fortunate we are, how much we owe. 
   I will be remembering veterans from Georgia in the Kosovo conflict, especially veterans from Warner Robbins Air Force Base, Fort Stewart near Savannah, the naval air station in Atlanta and Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support of private sector innovation to solve a public problem. My state is the site of a brand new, state of the art facility that will recycle carpets, chemically breaking them down to their virgin chemical components. Allied Signal and DSM are jointly opening the first-ever carpet recycling plant in Augusta, GA, on November 15. It's a fitting day for the opening of a carpet recycling plant since it is America Recycles Day 1999. 
   Carpets comprise of a significant portion of the Nation's landfills. Yet there are few programs at the state or local level targeted to redirecting carpets out of community landfills. The AlliedSignal-DSM facility, aptly named ``Evergreen,'' will ensure that each year over 200 million pounds of carpet never see a landfill. Now it may be hard to imagine 200 million pounds of carpet, so let me help you visualize it. If you had a 12 foot wide roll of carpeting you could lay it from New York to San Francisco and back again, and that would equal about 200 million pounds. And the Evergreen facility will save that much landfill space each year. 
   The carpeting that will be recycled in Augusta will not simply be broken down mechanically and remade into new carpets. Instead it will be depolymerized--broken down chemically into the individual chemical polymers that comprise the nylon fiber in the carpets. The primary chemical is caprolactum, but they can't produce enough at their facilities to meet the demands of their customers. 
   So they had a choice to make--either find another source of caprolactum or build new chemical plants that could be used to make caprolactum. With dedicated research engineers, they made several technological breakthroughs that enabled them to obtain caprolactum from used carpeting in a more economical fashion than to produce it at a new chemical plant. They can actually recycle old carpets into caprolactum more economically than they could produce it from scratch. 
   Avoiding the production of caprolatum in itself yields tremendous environmental benefits. To produce from scratch the amount of caprolactum that the Evergreen facility will generate would take more than 700 million barrels of oil a year, and 4 trillion Btus more in energy usage. That is enough energy to heat 100,000  homes a year. So it is not just landfill space that is saved under the Evergreen project. 
   AlliedSignal and DSM plan to market nylon 6 products made with caprolactum from the Evergreen facility to carpet manufacturers, auto makers and others to produce the highest quality nylon products. You will soon see Infinity Forever Renewable Nylon on products in early 2000. 
   I applaud the private sector initiatives that led to the evergreen project and I am particularly pleased that they have chosen the great state of Georgia in which to operate.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to speak about a subject which has been the topic of much political rhetoric in recent days: Social Security. While there was a time when not all in Congress acknowledged this fact, Social Security's long-term solvency is crucial to today's and tomorrow's retirees. There has never been a more successful Government program: Social Security has helped cut the poverty rate of older Americans by two-thirds. We must ensure this program will survive well into the 21st century. 
   The current dispute centers on which party is more committed to preservation of the Social Security program. I must say that I am personally pleased to see this development, which reflects the fact that Social Security is truly a consensus issue among the American people. The current debate takes place in the confusing world of arcane budgetary terminology and it is sometimes difficult to sort out. However, in evaluating the present-day claims and counterclaims, the historic record clearly shows that it is the Democratic Party which has consistently fought to protect the program since its inception in the Social Security Act of 1935. And though I could certainly be accused of being biased on the question, I believe that a close look will reveal unmistakably that Democratic proposals to save Social Security for future generations greatly surpass the recent efforts of my friends across the aisle in laying claim to be the protectors of Social Security. 
   For example, let's look at the competing proposals to place a ``lockbox'' around Social Security and see which one truly best protects the benefits of tomorrow's recipients. 
   First, Democratic lockbox proposals establish a Social Security and Medicare lockbox that precludes any portion of the Social Security surplus or any portion of the surplus reserved for Medicare to be used for any purpose other than to strengthen and preserve these programs. Over the next 15 years, the Democratic lockbox would protect 100 percent of the Social Security surplus each year, and one-third of any on-budget surplus for Medicare. 
   On the other hand, the Republican lockbox proposal does not reserve any of the projected surpluses for Medicare, nor does it extend the life of the Social Security trust fund, which, under their proposals, will be insolvent in 2034. Furthermore, in the absence of protections for Medicare, this critical program is projected to be insolvent in 2015. Perhaps most importantly, the Republican proposals include language which creates a large potential loophole for the lockbox protections. Specifically, if any legislation is designated as ``Social Security reform provisions''--regardless of whether such provisions help or hurt the interests of beneficiaries--lockbox surpluses would not have to be used to pay benefits and could be used for tax cuts. Finally, the Republican lockbox proposal does not even 
   require that such Social Security ``reform'' legislation extend the solvency of the Social Security program. Is this meaningful, long-term protection for Social Security? 
   Some on the other side have accused Democrats of raiding Social Security surpluses, yet the bipartisan Congressional Budget Office--whose head was appointed by the Republican leadership--has determined that spending bills supported by the congressional majority have already tapped into the Social Security surplus by at least $13 billion. In belated recognition of this fact, House Republicans have proposed a 1.4 percent across-the-board cut in the operating budgets of Federal agencies. As a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am loath to take a step in the wrong direction just after we have recently provided--on a bipartisan basis--the Department of Defense with much-needed budget relief for both personnel and equipment costs. 
   But when we consider the impact of recent congressional proposals on the future of Social Security we must look back no further than August 1999 when the Republican majority pushed through Congress a tax cut that, at the time, I labeled a ``convenient but fiscally irresponsible measure.'' This tax bill would have consumed virtually all of the projected $1 trillion non-Social Security budget surplus over the next 10 years, without setting aside any funds for Medicare solvency. The direct revenue loss was estimated at $792 billion over that period, and with the sharply diminished surplus, higher interest costs on the national debt would bring the total to $964 billion. And the projected $1 trillion surplus itself is dependent on large cuts in national defense, education, and other priority programs. If one only assumes that these programs are held at their current levels, plus inflation, the projected 10-year surplus falls from $1 trillion to $46 billion. 
   Clearly, enactment of this massive tax cut, which the President appropriately vetoed, would have vastly compromised and complicated our ability to preserve Social Security and Medicare. No other action considered in this Congress comes even close to having this large a negative impact on Social Security's future. 
   We can continue to attempt to ``one-up'' each other over who has the better plan to protect the existing Social Security trust fund. In trying to set the record straight from my own viewpoint, I have spoken today from perhaps a partisan perspective. However, there is plenty of blame to go around for our joint failure in this session of Congress to use the unique opportunity afforded by the long-sought end to massive Federal budget deficits to enact true Social Security reform to protect the benefits of millions of future recipients. The millions of Americans who depend on Social Security for themselves or their parents and grandparents, now and in the future, deserve no less. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I once heard Marian Wright Edelman, President of the Children's Defense Fund, say that ``Service is the rent each of us pays for living--the very purpose of life and not something you do in your spare time or after you have reached your personal goals.'' I can think of no greater example of that philosophy than Mr. Lyndon A. Wade. 
   Lyndon A. Wade has served as President of the Atlanta Urban League for over 30 years. Since 1968, under his leadership, this broad-based community and social service agency has affected major decisions and brought about changes in among other things, land and transportation planning, equal employment opportunities and minority employment in building and construction trades. 
   Currently, the League operates programs of service in the areas of employment, housing, education and youth services. The agency provides social services to over 3,000 people annually and is affiliated with the United Way Agency and also receives funding from city, county, state, and federal governments, foundations, and corporations. 
   Mr. Wade is a native Atlantan and a product of the Atlanta public schools. He received his BA form Morehouse College and his Masters degree in Social work from Atlanta University. He began his career as an assistant professor in Emory University's Department of Psychiatry, a position he occupied from 1963 to 1968. 
   Between 1971 and 1975, while serving as President of the Atlanta Urban League, Mr. Wade was appointed by Federal Judge Frank Hooper to chair the bi-racial Advisory Committee to the Atlanta Board of Education. This group was successful in forging the Atlanta Compromise which ended 15 years of protracted court struggle surrounding the desegregation of Atlanta's public schools. 
   From 1971 until 1985, Mr. Wade served on the Board of Directors of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority where he held the posts of Secretary, Chairman of the Development Committee and Vice-Chairman. He was one of the major architects of Marta's Affirmative Action Program which has  resulted in hundreds of jobs for minorities and females as well as producing approximately $3 billion in contracts for minority and female entrepreneurs since the beginning of the system. 
   During the early 1970's, the Atlanta Urban League, under Wade's leadership, paved the way for minorities and women to gain admission to the building trades elite crafts. Working with Arthur Fletcher and the U.S. Department of Labor a federal employment plan was developed for the construction industry in Metropolitan Atlanta. This plan served as a monitoring guide for hiring and utilization of minority and female workers. 
   Over his long and distinguished career, Mr. Wade has received numerous citations and honors including: Fulton County Medical Society's Distinguished Service Award; Social Worker of the Year 1971 by the North Georgia Chapter of the National Association of Social Workers; and the Distinguished Service Award by the Atlanta Morehouse Alumni Club. 
   He is a member of the Academy of Social Workers, the Atlanta Action Forum, the Atlanta Committee for Public Education, Organizing Committee for Gilda's Club, Channel 36's ``Quest'' Advisory Board, the Association of United Way executive committee, the Urban Insurance Task Force, and District Attorney Paul Howard's Transition Team as well as a 1970 Graduate of leadership Atlanta. 
   From September 1958 to July 1962, Mr. Wade served in the United States Military and received an honorable discharge with the rank of First Lieutenant. He is married and the father of four children. He is also a life-long member of the Central Methodist Church in Atlanta. 
   I thank Mr. Wade for the wonderful work he has done on behalf of Atlanta and its residents and I wish the very best for him and his family in his much deserved retirement.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been said that ``Poor is a nation which has no heroes. Poorer still is the nation which has them, but forgets them.'' I rise today before my colleagues to pay tribute to two fallen heroes, Sergeant Steve Reeves and Officer Stephen  Gilner. These policemen were two of Cobb County's, and indeed America's, finest. Unfortunately, in a tragic incident earlier this year, they were killed in the line of duty. 
   These men dutifully served and protected the great citizens of Georgia up until the last moments of their lives, when on July 23, 1999, these heroes were struck down by gunfire. 
   Colleagues described Stephen Gilner as a wonderful human being who had never been happier than when, after seven years in the Marine Corps, he was handed his police uniform and could make a career out of helping people. In 1999, Officer Gilner was nominated for the Officer of the Year award after saving a man from a burning van. He died last summer trying to save the life of a fellow officer. Officer Gilner leaves behind his wife Elisa and their daughter Nicole. 
   Sergeant Reeves had been with the Cobb County Police Department for fourteen years. Fellow officers remember Reeves for his sense of humor and his ability to remain calm under pressure. Just two months before the tragic shooting claimed his life, Steve Reeves had been promoted to Sergeant. The beloved hero was twice decorated--once for saving the life of a fellow officer during a struggle with an armed suspect and again for rescuing a family from their burning house while he was off-duty. Sergeant Reeves is survived by his wife, Beth, and two sons, Clint and Chris. 
   The selfless bravery and public service displayed by these heroes are in the finest tradition of the United States. I am sure my colleagues in the Senate will join me as I extend my thoughts and prayers to Elisa, Nicole, Beth, Clint and Chris. This tragic incident is the first of its kind in more than thirty five years where two police officers were killed in the same incident in the Atlanta Metro area. Our prayers are sent up to these men in heaven who made the ultimate sacrifice for their fellow citizens.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am introducing a bill today to direct that the sailing vessel Sandpiper, Official Number 1079439, be accorded coastwise trading privileges and be issued a certificate of documentation under section 12103 of title 46, U.S. Code. 
   The hull and interior of the Sandpiper were constructed in Taiwan in 1998 by Ta-Yang Yacht Building Company, Ltd. She is a 48 foot Cutter Rig presently used as a recreational vessel. Since construction, the vessel has been rigged and outfitted in the United States. It is estimated that 60% of the cost of the vessel has been spent on the mast, rigging, sails, electronics, navigational instruments, safety equipment, interior furnishings, and various other deck fittings. These items were acquired in Annapolis, Maryland and refitting was completed in April, 1999. 
   The vessel is owned by Mr. and Mrs. David Maner of Augusta, Georgia. The Maners would like to utilize their vessel in the coastwise trade of the United States. However, because the vessel's hull was constructed in Taiwan, it did not meet the requirements for coastwise license endorsement in the United States. Such documentation is mandatory to enable the owner to use the vessel for its intended purpose. 
   The owners of the Sandpiper are seeking a waiver of the existing law because they wish to use the vessel for charters. The desired intentions for the vessel's use will not adversely affect the coastwise trade in U.S. waters. If the Maners are granted this waiver, it is their intention to comply fully with U.S. documentation and safety requirements. The purpose of the legislation I am introducing is to allow the Sandpiper to engage in the coastwise trade of the United States.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which would allow my home state of Georgia to participate in the State Infrastructure Bank (SIB) program. Prior to the enactment of the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21) all 50 states were eligible for SIB revolving funds, which are capitalized with federal and state contributions and used to provide loans and other forms of non-grant assistance to transportation projects. TEA-21, however, limited an enhanced SIB program to four states (California, Florida, Missouri, Rhode Island). My bill would add Georgia as a fifth state for participation in the SIB program. 
   Georgia and Metro Atlanta, I believe, can be a national model on how to meet clean air standards and manage suburban sprawl without compromising economic growth. Governor Roy Barnes and the Georgia General Assembly deserve a great deal of credit for grabbing the bull by the horns when they enacted historic legislation creating the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority (GRTA). GRTA will work with other state agencies and organizations to solve the traffic, pollution, and sprawl problems that plague Metro Atlanta. 
   In order to carry out its legislative charge in conjunction with the Georgia Department of Transportation (GDOT), the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA), the Atlanta Regional Commission (ARC), and other transportation agencies, GRTA will need sufficient financial resources to become a regional authority with teeth. To assist in procurement of these resources, the legislation I am introducing today would extend the State Infrastructure Bank program to include Georgia. I believe that this program can be a vital component in funding such important projects as the multi-state high speed rail corridor. 
   The SIB program authorizes loans to a public or private entity to cover the partial or complete cost of an approved project, and it allows for innovative planning and development of funding streams for repayment, which does not begin until five years after the completion of the project. Additionally, TEA-21 allows for the creation of a multistate infrastructure bank system among the pilot states. In so doing, states would be encouraged to share not only funds but also ideas for combating pollution and traffic problems and encouraging alternative forms of transportation. Georgia would be a perfect addition to this mix. 
   Georgia can be a model for the nation--an example for other states that are facing similar problems of balancing growth and livability. Georgia's participation in the SIB program would provide more options to fund the solutions that will allow the proper balance to be struck. GRTA, GDOT and the other transportation entities in Georgia have expressed to me their enthusiasm over the possibilities that are presented by Georgia's participation in the SIB program. I hope that my Senate colleagues will join with me in support of this legislation which will allow Georgia to participate in the SIB program and in doing so it will illustrate to the country the full potential of this program.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I will vote for the Defense Appropriations Conference Report because there is much in it that I strongly support, especially including funding for the essential pay and benefit improvements for our service men and women which had been created by the Defense Authorization bill. I will also cast an affirmative vote as a measure of my admiration and respect for the fine work done by the Senate conferees, who were ably led by the distinguished senior Senator from Alaska and the distinguished senior Senator from Hawaii. Without the hard work of Senator STEVENS and Senator INOUYE I would likely have had to oppose the final product of the conference. 
   The reason for my concern, and for my reluctant support for the Defense Appropriations Conference Report, is that, because of the adamant position of the House conferees, the conference report, in my judgment, seriously hampers the rational and cost-effective development and production of the Pentagon's highest-priority new weapons system, the F-22 aircraft. The slow-down in production will undoubtedly result in increased costs and the House conferees indeed have indicated that the final production level will likely have to be reduced to well below the currently planned 339 aircraft which would precipitously drive up the unit costs. The F-22, which has been under development for 16 years and has received close and ongoing testing and Congressional oversight, is absolutely critical to maintaining our air superiority into the 21st Century. 
   Once again, I would like to thank Senators STEVENS and INOUYE for producing the best result for the F-22 that could be obtained, given the position of the House. While the compromise is an impediment to the F-22 program, it is not fatal, and with some extra effort, plus some shifting of Air Force funding, the delays and higher costs can be minimized. Nonetheless, I think all Members of the Senate, especially the 56 other Senators who joined with Senator COVERDELL and me in writing to the conferees in support of the Senate's position on the F-22, must be on notice that we will face another, and perhaps even tougher, fight on the future of the F-22 next year and beyond. 
   In closing, I want to note that the work on this Defense Appropriations bill, and the preceding Defense Authorization bill has been marked by bipartisanship and pragmatism, resulting in the kind of national consensus and resolve which is perhaps the single biggest factor undergirding a nation's security. Unfortunately, this stands in stark contrast to what we saw yesterday, with the near-party line vote rejecting the Comprehensive Test Ban. I believe both parties bear some of the blame for that most unfortunate outcome. What I want to say today is that, beyond the Test Ban Treaty, beyond any specific dispute in national security policy, we in this body, as well as those in the House, and in the Executive Branch must, I repeat must, work to repair the partisan breach, and begin to recreate a bipartisan consensus on national security policy. I have some ideas along those lines which I will be sharing with my colleagues in the days ahead, but I think we can all take a lesson from the cooperative efforts of Senators STEVENS and INOUYE who have achieved that objective in the critical area of Defense Appropriations.

   Mr. CLELAND. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, campaign finance reform was the first issue on which I chose to speak when I was duly elected to the Senate almost 3 years ago. I occupied this desk and talked about my understanding of the state of campaign financing in America. I had just gone through one of the most expensive Senate races in the history of the United States where I was outspent some 3 1/2 to 1. I am lucky to be here. 
   The current status of campaign financing in America is a moral swamp; it is full of skunks; it is full of special interests out to buy their way into the heart of the American Government. Those of us in this Senate, 100 selected, want to make sure the public interest prevails, not special interests. I tip my hand and my hat to two fine Members of this body who day in and day out, year in and year out, have fought the good fight in cleaning up this moral swamp of campaign financing. 
   My dear friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, Senator JOHN MCCAIN, and my seatmate, Senator FEINGOLD, have put together an effort which I believe has a reasonable chance of succeeding. 
   I can remember sitting here a couple years ago after a whole year of sitting on the Governmental Affairs Committee and listening to one horror story after another about problems of campaign financing in America, and a majority of our Governmental Affairs Committee decided we needed campaign financing; we needed the McCain-Feingold bill. I was an original cosponsor of it and a majority of the Senate supported 
   it, but we could not get 60 votes. 
   Senator MCCAIN, in those days, said something like: It is a question of time. This Senate will pass campaign finance reform. It is just a matter of  when, and it will be whether or not we are here. 
   I am glad the issue of campaign finance reform is back before this distinguished body, and it is none too late. In 1998, the last general election in this country, we had higher spending, more negativity, greater public cynicism, and not coincidentally, lower voter turnout than at any time in this century. We are at a turning point. I thank Senator JOHN MCCAIN and Senator RUSS FEINGOLD for offering to us, again, a chance to clean up this moral swamp. 
   My dear colleague from Arizona and I were in the Vietnam war. We have been shot at before. We have been attacked before. We have been criticized before. But his integrity is still intact. He is incorruptible, he is unbought and unbossed, and I am honored to serve with him today. 
   Over the years, opponents of McCain-Feingold have continued to concentrate their spoken criticisms on its alleged violations of free speech, though that is, in my opinion, a flawed equation of money with speech. 
   I look back at the 1976 decision by the Supreme Court which, in effect, equated the ability to spend money with free speech. In the campaign finance hearings a couple of years ago, I asked the simple question: If you do not have any money in this country, does that mean you do not have any speech? Of course not. The problem is we have equated money with speech and the ability to get on the air with 30- and 60-second spots which make us want to throw up. 
   I share the concern of the distinguished Senator from Alabama, Mr. SESSIONS, about these negative attack ads that come from out of State and seem to originate from God knows where. They come in and assassinate someone's character. That is not the country for which Senator MCCAIN and I fought. That is not the kind of democracy we intend to serve. That is one reason why I have bonded with him in such a close way: to support cleaning up this incredible process. 
   Right now we have a system where every millionaire in America can expect to run for public office. The rest of us will have to take a back seat. 
   I would say there is little doubt about the commitment of James Madison, father of the Constitution, an architect of the Bill of Rights, and President of the United States, to the great cause of free speech. Madison was the author of the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, the Bill of Rights. In The Federalist Papers, Madison put the challenge of governing this way. He said:  
   But what is government itself, but the greatest of all reflections on human nature? If men were angels, no government would be necessary. In framing a government which is to be administered by men over men, the great difficulty lies in this: you must first enable the government to control the governed; and in the next place oblige it to control itself.  
   We have to control this campaign finance system or it will eat us alive. Our system of elections is fast becoming a system of auctions. While Madison was certainly both a revolutionary and a visionary, he never allowed himself to stray too far from the practical realities of the world in which he lived. To him, the lack of human perfection was thus the basis for government and a factor which must be taken into account in providing a government with sufficient powers to accomplish its necessary functions. 
   The last time the Senate debated McCain-Feingold, back in 1997, Senator FRED THOMPSON, the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee, delivered a very fine statement on the Senate floor about campaign finance reform and free speech in which he pointed out that, in the real world, the debate about campaign finance reform and free speech is not one of absolutes, as some would have it. There is not a choice between a system of unfettered free speech and government regulation, for our 
   current system recognizes many instances in which there is a legitimate and constitutional public interest in regulating speech, from slander laws, to prohibitions on the disclosure of the identities of American intelligence agents, to the campaign arena itself, with a longstanding ban on corporate contributions and quarter-century and older limits on other forms of contributions and disclosure requirements. 
   So the debate isn't really over whether or not there will be government regulation of campaigns but on what form that regulation will take. In the words of Dr. Norm Ornstein, a noted political scientist and a witness in the Governmental Affairs hearings, the question is whether or not we will erect some ``fences'' to prevent the worst abuses from recurring. 
   As I have told anyone who has asked me, I love being a Senator. I cherish this body. As does Senator BYRD, I cherish its traditions. Having the privilege of representing my State in this body, where such giants as Clay and Webster and Calhoun and Norris and LaFollette and Dirksen and Russell and Senator BYRD have served with great distinction, is the greatest honor of my life. But, my fellow Members of the Senate, I was not honored by the process that I and every other candidate for the Senate had to undergo in order to get here. 
   We have to spend years in raising millions of dollars just to defend ourselves out there in the marketplace. I have not felt privileged sitting here day by day, with evidence continually mounting in congressional hearings, in newspaper reports, of campaign abuses, or public opinion surveys chronicling the loss of public trust in the political process, or the ongoing massive fundraising which takes place all the time in this, the Nation's Capital. The current system is broken, and it cries out for reform. 
   We have heard a lot of talk, and we will hear more talk, about these abuses, and about the general topic of campaign finance reform. But the time is coming when we must take action. Certainly the revised McCain-Feingold package is not perfect; it is not all that I think needs to be done to remedy our problem, but it is an essential first step, aimed at dealing with the worst of the abuses which currently plague our campaign system. 
   It is fascinating how the term ``soft money'' has grown up. It is really not soft money; it is hard money with soft laws. It is now time to correct that abuse. The revised bipartisan campaign finance reform proposal does not contain spending limits. I wish it did. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has declared that unconstitutional. It does not contain limits on PACs. The current law does. It does not provide free discounted broadcast air time for Federal candidates. I think we ought to have that. And the bill does not place any limitations on sham issue ads, which we need very badly. We need to place some limitations on that, especially 60 days out from an election. 
   But what the proposal does do is this: 
   One, it bans soft money contributions to and spending by national political parties and candidates for Federal office. That, in and of itself, is an achievement. 
   Two, it curbs soft money contributions to and spending by State parties when such activities are related to Federal elections. 
   And three, it strictly codifies the Beck decision concerning the right of nonunion members to have a refund of any union fees used for political purposes to which they object. 
   There are certainly areas where I believe this package should be strengthened, but we must not let the pursuit of a politically unattainable ideal prevent us from adopting the very useful and important provisions in this package. 
   Let us remember that it was soft money which was at the heart of most of the egregious campaign abuses uncovered by the Governmental Affairs Committee's investigation of the 1996 campaign. I sat through a whole year of listening to those 
   horror stories, and it convinced me it is long since time that we act. 
   The country is watching what we do on campaign finance reform. Make no mistake about that. They are understandably skeptical that we will take action to reform the very system under which we all were elected, and, shall we say, expectations are extremely low. Unfortunately, based on our behavior to date, those expectations are being fulfilled. 
   But this is a real opportunity, the best we will have in this Congress to show we can take the hard but necessary steps to help begin to restore the public's faith in the workings of our great experiment in democracy. 
   Earlier this year, by an overwhelming bipartisan majority, the  House of Representatives approved the Shays-Meehan bill, which goes far beyond the measure currently before the Senate. The President of the United States stands prepared to sign any reasonable version of either of the bills into law. Now the ball is clearly in our court. 
   As we consider the McCain-Feingold legislation, I hope we will at long last be allowed to engage in the normal amendment process whereby the Senate can truly work its will and seek to improve the pending legislation. There are a number of areas in which I think the existing bill can and should be improved. For my part, I will be offering a series of amendments related to enforcement of existing laws by strengthening the Federal Elections Commission and campaign disclosure requirements. The FEC is the referee in this ballgame. It is time we gave the referee some strength. 
   One of the most glaring deficiencies in our current Federal campaign system is the ineffectiveness of this referee. The FEC, whether by design or through circumstance, has been beset by partisan gridlock, uncertain and insufficient resources, and lengthy proceedings which offer no hope of timely resolution of charges of campaign violations. It is similar to a referee in a football game blowing a whistle and 9 months later throwing the flag. 
   Thus, the first major element of my amendments is to strengthen the ability of the Federal Election Commission to be an effective and impartial enforcer of Federal campaign laws. 
   I will be offering amendments to do several things: 
   One, alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of partisan gridlock by adding a seventh member, who would serve as Chairman and would be appointed by the President --with the advice and consent of the Senate--from among 10 nominees recommended by the Supreme Court. 
   Two, require electronic filing of reports to the FEC; authorize the FEC to conduct random audits; give the FEC independent litigating authority, including before the Supreme Court; and establish a right of private civil action to seek court enforcement in cases where the FEC fails to act, all of which should dramatically improve the prospects for timely enforcement of our campaign finance laws. 
   Three, provide sufficient funding of the FEC from a source independent of congressional intervention by the imposition of filing fees on Federal candidates, with such fees being adequate to meet the needs of the Commission. 
   There is another area to be addressed by my amendments. The area I would like to address is to enhance the effectiveness of campaign contribution disclosure requirements. 
   I have to admit, of all the laws, of all the requirements I have seen at the State level and the Federal level, over the years in which I have been dealing with the question of campaign finance reform--and I was the State official in Georgia for 12 years who was the State elections officer, and I pushed for campaign finance reform then, and now I am pushing for it as a Senator. 
   Of all the requirements I have seen, of all the laws and the rules and regulations, I think the most effective brake on abuse in the campaign finance system is disclosure. As Justice Brandeis once observed: Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants. 
   This is certainly true in the realm of campaign finance. Let there be more sunlight. Perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Watergate reforms of a quarter century ago is the expanded campaign and financial disclosure requirements which emerged from that tragedy. By and large, those increased disclosure requirements have served us well, but as with everything else, they need to be periodically reviewed and updated in the light of experience. 
   Therefore, based in part on testimony I heard during the last session's Governmental Affairs Committee investigation and in part on the FEC's own recommendations for improved disclosure, my amendments would make several changes in current disclosure requirements. 
   Specifically, I am recommending a reform which will make it more difficult for contributors and campaigns alike to turn a blind eye to current disclosure requirements by requiring those who contribute $200 or more to provide a signed certification that their contribution is not from a foreign national and is not the result of a contribution in the name of another person. 
   In addition, I will offer amendments embodying a number of disclosure recommendations made by the FEC in its reports to the Congress and by other campaign finance experts, including, among others: One, requiring all reports to be filed by the due date of the report; two, requiring all authorized candidate committee reports to be filed on a campaign-to-date basis rather than on a calendar-year cycle; three, mandating monthly reporting for multicandidate committees which have raised or spent or anticipate raising or spending in excess of $100,000 in the current election cycle; again, clarifying that reports of last-minute independent expenditures must be received at the FEC within 24 hours of when the expenditure is made; and, finally, requiring that noncandidate political committees which have raised or received in excess of $100,000 be subjected to the same last-minute contribution reporting requirements as candidate committees. 
   It is so easy to be pessimistic about campaign finance reform efforts. The public and the media are certainly expecting this Congress and this Senate to fail to take significant action in cleaning up this swamp. The scandalous campaign system, though, under which we all now suffer must be changed. 
   I suggest we cannot afford the luxury of complacency. We may think we will be able to win the next election or reelection because the level of outrage and the awareness of the extent of the vulnerability of our political system have perhaps not yet reached critical mass. I am confident it is only a matter of time, as Senator MCCAIN has said, and perhaps the next election cycle, which will undoubtedly feature more unaccountable soft money, more sham issue ads, more circumvention of the spirit and, in some cases, the letter of current campaign finance laws, before the scales are decisively tilted in favor of reform. 
   We will have campaign finance reform, Mr. President. The only question is whether or not this Congress and this Senate step up to the plate and fulfill their responsibility to the American public and give them a system in which they can have confidence. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. REID addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, there are many important Constitutional responsibilities of United States Senators, but none is more important than providing ``Advice and Consent'' for treaties with other nations. And among treaties, those involving control of nuclear arms, which continue to be the only instruments capable of threatening the physical survival of the United States, must top the list of our concerns. 
   Since the landmark Limited Test Ban Treaty of 1963, every American president, no matter his party affiliation, has recognized the value of responsible and verifiable arms control agreements in making the arms race less dangerous and the American people more secure. And each time an American president has entered into negotiations, concluded a treaty and then sought ratification by the United States Senate, the debate in the Senate and in the country has been remarkably similar. For example, when President Kennedy announced the signing of the Limited Test Ban Treaty on July 16, 1963, he responded to the concerns and criticisms then being directed at that proposed first step in the effort to control nuclear weapons:  
   Secret violations are possible and secret preparations for a sudden withdrawal are  possible, and thus our own vigilance and strength must be maintained, as we remain ready to withdraw and to resume all forms of testing if we must. But it would be a mistake to assume that this treaty will be quickly broken. The gains of illegal testing are obviously slight compared to their cost and the hazard of discovery, and the nations which have initialed and will sign this treaty prefer it, in my judgment, to unrestricted testing as a matter of their own self-interest. For these nations, too, and all nations have a stake in limiting the arms race, in holding the spread of nuclear weapons and in breathing air that is not radioactive. While it may be theoretically possible to demonstrate the risks inherent in any treaty--and such risks in this treaty are small--the far greater risks to our security are the risks of unrestricted testing, the risk of a nuclear arms race, the risk of new nuclear powers, nuclear pollution and nuclear war.  
   Now, thirty-six years later, the United States Senate is being asked to give its advice and consent on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, a goal first formulated in the Eisenhower Administration. The Treaty itself was approved by the United Nations General Assembly in September of 1996 by a vote of 158 to 3, and signed by President Clinton later that same month. As of today, 153 nations have signed the treaty, with 47 of those formally ratifying it. 
   Today, in spite of the long history of the treaty's development, in spite of the fact that we now have over a third of a century of experience in negotiating, implementing and monitoring arms control agreements, in spite of the long list of current and former military leaders have endorsed the treaty and in spite of the treaty's widespread support among the American people and other nations, we still confront the same doubts and fears that President Kennedy sought to address so long ago. 
   While I have heard legitimate concerns voiced about certain aspects of the treaty, I reject the notion that the test this proposal must pass is one of perfection. Rather, in this world of imperfect men and women and laws, the test must be a less absolute one--Will the people of the United States, on balance, be better off if this treaty enters into force than if it doesn't? In other words, is it an acceptable risk, realizing that no possible course is risk free? 
   In my opinion, this agreement appears to be very much in the best interests of the United States and its ratification will inhibit nuclear proliferation, enhance our ability to monitor and verify suspicious activities by other nations, assure the sufficiency of our existing nuclear deterrent, and inhibit a renewal of the nuclear arms race. 
   Speaking on behalf of the unanimous view of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Henry Shelton, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, told us on the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that:  
   The Joint Chiefs support ratification of the CTBT with a safeguards package. This treaty provides one means of dealing with a very serious security challenge, and that is nuclear proliferation. The CTBT will help limit the development of more advanced and destructive weapons and inhibit the ability of more countries to acquire nuclear weapons. In short, the world will be a safer place with the Treaty than without it, and it is in our national security interests to ratify the CTBT Treaty.  
   In other words, what the Joint Chiefs are telling us is that the fewer fingers on the nuclear trigger, the better. 
   As reported in an October 8, 1999 New York Times article about a recent conference organized by the United Nations on the CTBT:  
   Several delegates seemed mystified that hawkish Republicans oppose the treaty. It was negotiated by a Republican president, and polls show that 82 percent of Americans support it. It would freeze the arms race while the United States enjoys a huge lead. And instead of paying 100 percent of the cost of the world's second-most-sophisticated nuclear-test detection system (the current American one), they said, the United States would pay only 25 percent for the world's most sophisticated one, with sensors deep inside Russia, China, Iran and other nations where the United States is not normally encouraged to gather data.  
   Most of this debate has centered on questions like these, related to the risks of ratifying the treaty, and has been concerned about the verifiability of the proposal, and its impact on the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent. These are indeed important questions, and I stand with the large majority of the American people, of our military leadership, and of our allies in concluding that, on balance, the CTBT is a net plus for our security. 
   But when weighing the risks involved in the Senate's action on this treaty, we must also examine the risks involved in rejecting the treaty. The leaders of three of our major allies who have already ratified the CTBT, Great Britain, France and Germany--who also represent two of the world's seven recognized countries which have successfully tested nuclear weapons--recently sent an unprecedented joint communication to the United States Senate which concluded:  
   Rejection of the treaty in the Senate would remove the pressure from other states still hesitating about whether to ratify it. Rejection would give great encouragement to proliferators. Rejection would also expose a fundamental divergence within NATO. The United States and its allies have worked side by side for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty since the days of President Eisenhower. This goal is now within our grasp. Our security is involved, as well as America's. For the security of the world we will leave to our children, we urge the United States Senate to ratify the treaty.  
   The consensus assessment of what will happen if the Senate rejects the treaty is that none of the other nuclear powers--Russia, China, India and Pakistan--will ratify the agreement while all are likely to do so if we ratify. 
   In May of 1998, in an irresponsible show of strength, both India and Pakistan detonated nuclear devices to demonstrate to the world, but, more importantly each other, their formal initiation in the ranks of nuclear powers. Yesterday's disturbing news that the democratically elected government of Pakistan had fallen victim to a military coup stresses just how important the CTBT is to both the subcontinent and to global security. These events coupled with the recent elections in India which returned Prime Minister Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)--the party which chose to ignite the nuclear arms race on the subcontinent--further underscore the need for sensibility when it comes to testing nuclear weapons. Both India and Pakistan have indicated their unwillingness to consider ending their nuclear arms race and sign the CTBT only if the United States has ratified the treaty. The national security of the United States and, in fact, the security of everyone on the planet, will be enhanced when countries such as India and Pakistan decide to stop testing nuclear weapons. 
   The United States stands today as the unchallenged military superpower, with by far the largest, most reliable and most versatile nuclear arsenal, as well as the strongest conventional arsenal. Indeed, the trends of the last decade, where the demise of the Soviet Union has led to an ongoing and inexorable decline in the capacity of what had been the only comparable strategic nuclear force and a continuing ``technology and investment gap'' has led to a circumstance where our conventional forces are vastly more capable than those of even our closest allies as evidenced by the recent war against Serbia, have placed us in the strongest relative military posture we have perhaps ever experienced as a Nation. As such, we are certainly more secure than when John F. Kennedy sought ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, more secure than when Ronald Reagan sought approval of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988, and more secure than when President Bush submitted the START I Treaty for Senate ratification in 1992. 
   While no course of human action is ever risk free, of all nations in the world, we have the most to gain from slowing the development of more capable weapons by others and the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries, even if we cannot expect to prevent such developments altogether. In addition, the Treaty cannot enter into force unless and until all 44 nuclear-capable states, including China, India, Iran, North Korea and Pakistan, have ratified it. Should any one of these nations refuse to accept the treaty and its conditions all bets are off. Finally, even if all of the required countries ratify, we will still have the right to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty if we determine that our supreme national interests have been jeopardized. 
   After debating concerns about verification and the impact on our nuclear arsenal on September 22, 1963, the United States Senate, on a bipartisan  basis ratified the Limited Test Ban Treaty by a vote of 80 to 19. On October 7th of that year, President Kennedy signed the instruments of ratification in the Treaty Room at the White House. He said:  
   In its first two decades, the Age of Nuclear Energy has been full of fear, yet never empty of hope. Today the fear is a little less and the hope a little greater. For the first time we have been able to reach an agreement which can limit the dangers of this age. The agreement itself is limited, but its message of hope has been heard and understood not only by the peoples of the three original nations but by the peoples and governments of the hundred other countries that have signed *.*.* What the future will bring, no one of us can know. This first fruit of hope may not be followed by larger harvests. Even this limited treaty, great as it is with promise, can survive only if it has from others the determined support in letter and in spirit which I hereby pledge on behalf of the United States. If this treaty fails, and it need not fail, we shall not regret that we have made this clear and national commitment to the cause of man's survival. For under this treaty we can and must still keep our vigil in defense of freedom.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I have a strong sense of deja vu today. 
   On September 22, 1963, the Senate, on a bipartisan basis, ratified the Limited Test Ban Treaty by a vote of 80-19. I was present in the Chamber, in the gallery, as a young 21-year-old student observing my country in action and studying government and politics. I was very proud of the Senate on that day. 
   I was very proud of President Kennedy when, on October 7, 1963, he signed the instruments of ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in the treaty room at the White House. 
   Today I am saddened. I am saddened by our rush to judgment. I am saddened that our Nation may see a rejection by this Senate of the first real treaty in terms of arms limitation in 70 years. 
   We are in the strongest military posture I think we have been in as a nation. As such, we are certainly more secure today than when John F. Kennedy sought ratification of the Limited Test Ban Treaty in 1963, certainly more secure than when President Ronald Reagan sought approval of the Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty in 1988, and certainly more secure than when President Bush submitted the START I treaty for Senate ratification in 1992. Of all the nations in the world, we have the most to gain from slowing the development of more capable weapons by others and the spread of nuclear weapons to additional countries. 
   The treaty cannot enter into force unless and until all 44 nuclear-capable states, including China, India, Iran, North Korea, and Pakistan, have ratified it. Should any one of these nations refuse to accept the treaty and its conditions, all bets are off. Finally, even if  all the required countries ratify, we will still have the right to unilaterally withdraw from the treaty if we determine that our supreme national interests have been jeopardized. 
   President Kennedy said, when he signed our first real nuclear test ban treaty: In the first two decades, the age of nuclear energy has been full of fear, yet never empty of hope. Today the fear is a little less and the hope a little greater. 
   Mr. President, it is my hope that at the end of today's work, this Senate can say the same. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, these are difficult times for our nation's children as they watch their peers turn to violence, drugs, truancy and gang membership. If one were to believe the evening news, there appears to be little good news coming from our schools. But I rise before my colleagues today to share with them some good news. Thunderbolt Elementary School in Savannah, Georgia, has been recognized by the Concerned Businessmen's Association of America as violence-free and the ``Best Example in America'' of what a safe and drug-free school should be. 
   Thunderbolt Elementary is the only school out of the 10,600 which enrolled in the national ``Children's Set a Good Example'' Competition during the past 12 years to win the national award three times in a row. Additionally, Thunderbolt has also been chosen this year by the judges of the first ``Best of the Best'' competition, which will be held just once every ten years, as the best of the best elementary schools in America. 
   The war against drug abuse, violent crime, illiteracy and intolerance is a multifaceted battle being fought in every sector of our community. It is a war that ravages our streets and has kids killing other kids. Too many of our children have become casualties of this epidemic. We as a society must apply proven, workable methods if we are to salvage our youth and rid our cities of those social ills. Positive counter peer pressure could be more effective than authoritarian efforts when it comes to influencing youth away from drug abuse and gang involvement and I am so proud of Thunderbolt Elementary for showing this to be true. 
   The work that the students at Thunderbolt have done is inspiring and I hope that they will be an example to other students around the country.

    Mr. CLELAND. This great nation, which was born as a nation of immigrants, is quickly becoming even more one of many faces, many voices, and many ideas, and it is this diversity which is one of our greatest assets. One of the fastest growing populations in our Nation today is the Hispanic American population. I rise before my colleagues today to bring attention to and celebrate the occasion of Hispanic Heritage Month. 
   This month of recognition is a wonderful opportunity to recognize the wide-ranging achievements and contributions of the Hispanic American population. This is a community with leadership which is notable in every facet of our society, a community filled with courage and persistence who have continually shown a commitment to family, business and education, and economic growth. 
   America's diverse and vibrant Hispanic population has made an enormous contribution to the building and strengthening of our nation, its culture, and its economic prowess. As the 21st century approaches, Hispanic Americans are poised to play an increasingly prominent role in our Nation's political, economic, and cultural life. 
   Look no further than Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson; or Small Business Administration head, Aida Alvarez; Chicago Cub Sammy Sosa; or entertainers Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez; or business leaders like Sal Diaz-Verson of Columbus, Georgia or the late Roberto Goizueta. Hispanic Americans offer a valuable and vital social, intellectual, and artistic component of American society and their culture deeply enriches the vast American landscape. 
   What unites Hispanic Americans is a fundamental respect for the traditions and values of their native lands combined with a strong commitment to the American dream. In return, we in the Congress must show a commitment to a legislative agenda that addresses the needs and priorities of Hispanic American families, which are in fact the same as the those of most Americans. We must continue the policies that have laid the foundation for the longest peacetime expansion of the economy, improve and strengthen our education system, provide access to quality healthcare, and protect this nation's children from crime and drugs. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the valuable contributions of the Hispanic American population and honoring Hispanic Heritage Month.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr President, I rise today to honor the contributions of the Mel Blount Youth Home of Georgia, Inc. The primary mission of the Mel Blount Youth Home is to provide youth with the guidance, education, and life skills needed to get their lives back on track, resulting in self sufficient, productive contributors to society. 
   The Mel Blount Youth Home of Georgia, Inc., was founded in 1983 by Melvin and Clinton Blount. It is located in Vidalia, Georgia, and offers an alternative for troubled youths who have not been successful in their home environment. The home is licensed by the State of Georgia and serves youth from all around the country to meet the spiritual, educational, physical, and emotional needs of all children participating in the program. 
   The Mel Blount Youth Home program places an emphasis on academics, discipline and hard work with a consistent effort to meet the spiritual and emotional needs of young men placed the program. The average stay is from nine to eighteen months. Residents attend school on the grounds of the home and can earn credits toward graduation upon returning to high school at home. A GED program in collaboration with Southeastern Technical Institute is also offered. The academic program consists of a curriculum designed for youth who have been left behind in public school, with tutors available to work with each child on an individual basis. 
   The Mel Blount Youth Home of Georgia provides young men of diverse backgrounds and cultures who have experienced difficulty adjusting during adolescence a secure and safe haven to grow and develop. The home provides a family setting with a spiritual base in addition to a foundation which places high emphasis on education, hard work and discipline. For some youth, the Mel Blount Youth home is the only place they can call home. 
   Every child deserves to grow and develop in an environment where they are nurtured and molded by hands and hearts that care. Different circumstances have brought each child to the Mel Blount Youth Home, but all have come with a quiet hope of restarting their lives. At this home, they get a second chance. 
   I ask my colleagues in this body to join me in recognizing the noteworthy and noble mission of this great institution.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to engage the distinguished Ranking Member of the Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee on funding for the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and Prevention's building and facilities project. The CDC's physical plant facilities are in dire need of expansion and renovation. The lack of adequate laboratory and research facilities is crippling one of the nation's  critical resources. Some of the infectious disease laboratories which conduct research on deadly organisms are 60-year old temporary wooden structures. This raises serious concerns regarding safety for employees and the public. The existing CDC's buildings and facilities threatens the United States' position as the world's last line of defense for protecting the health of the public.

   Mr. CLELAND. I commend the Chairman and Ranking Member and the Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Subcommittee for the FY 2000 appropriations bill. Under the circumstances, The Subcommittee has done a more than adequate job than others in addressing CDC's needs. The Administration's FY 2000 budget request was $39.8 million for all of CDC's buildings and facilities activities, including the repair and improvement of existing structures. The House Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee mark was for $40 million for buildings and facilities. The Ranking Member is correct in stating that the Senate Subcommittee exceeded the Administration and marks by $20 million. I want to state for the record that, given the need, the initial funding request was set far too low. The CDC needs $141 million or an additional $81 million to modernize the substandard existing buildings and laboratories. I would request that Senate conferees examine all possible sources to obtain additional funding for CDC, and at the very least, hold firm behind the Senate's funding level in conference.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to the Atlanta Braves baseball team for winning their eighth consecutive divisional championship and, once again, finishing the season with the best record in Major League Baseball. While their record may suggest that this championship was won with a great deal of ease, this could not be further from the truth. Before the season began, the Braves and baseball as a whole were shaken by the news that Andreas Galarraga, the All-Star first baseman of the Braves, had been diagnosed with non-hodgkin's lymphoma, a form of cancer. Although Galarraga had to sit own the entire 1999 season, he has now fully recovered and everyone is eagerly awaiting his return to the field next year. 
   Despite the loss of Galarraga and several other individuals who had been an integral part of the previous championship teams, the Atlanta Braves never gave up. Through this difficult time, the Braves played to the best of their ability and exceeded everyone's expectations. This season the Braves won more games than any other team in baseball which is why, including the worst to first season of 1991, this season may have been the most meaningful of all their recent successes. 
   In this year when each major league team individually celebrated Hank Aaron Day--a day devoted to the memory of baseball's all time homerun leader breaking Babe Ruth's staggering record of 714 homers--the Atlanta Braves once again rose to the top. Their national following combined with their hard work and perseverance have given the Braves the moniker of ``America's Team,'' an honor well suited for these champions.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, the noise mitigation funding which this bill authorizes is very much needed--and appreciated--by communities located near our nation's airports. Over 10 years ago, Georgia's second busiest airport, Dekalb-Peachtree Airport, began a runway expansion program to accommodate its increased traffic. Six years ago, the FAA began providing funding to relocate the residential homes located in the Airport's Runway Protection Zone. Thanks to noise mitigation money, 108 homes have had the opportunity to relocate. Unfortunately, after a decade, 58 homes and 61 businesses are still in limbo, and still impacted by the noise from 225,000 flights a year. This community near Atlanta--and I am sure there are communities in similar straights in Arizona--has suffered for years, because the buy-out has gone on far too long. Don't you agree that in determining the need for noise money, the FAA should take into consideration the harmful, drawn-out impact on communities from long-standing projects which have awaited completion over a number of years?

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, we are all hearing from our constituents about the hardships they have encountered from the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) of 1997. From rural hospitals to home health care agencies, cuts in Medicare reimbursement have forced these health care providers to absorb tremendous debt and have threatened patients' access to care. Senator DASCHLE has proposed over 30 items that will provide immediate relief across the health care continuum. Among these provisions, the bill would redirect BBA surplus monies to provide a cap on hospital outpatient Prospective Payment System (PPS) loss, a delay on the proposed 15 percent cut to home health care reimbursement, a fix for the graduate medical education resident cap and the indigent care problem, the repeal of nursing home therapy caps, a technical correction to limit oscillations to Medicare physician reimbursement, a delay of risk adjustment for frail elderly/Evercare. Senator DASCHLE is to be commended for developing this comprehensive BBA relief bill in an incredibly short period of time. My colleague has more than met the challenge of this urgent health care dilemma. I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this critical remedial legislation for a BBA fix. I will support Senator DASCHLE with all my resources to pass a BBA fix this session.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Henry David Thoreau once said ``If one advances confidently in the direction of his dreams, and endeavors to live the life which he has imagined, he will meet with a success unexpected in common hours.'' I rise before my colleagues today to reflect on the successes of one of our nation's great leaders and to pay tribute on the occasion of his 75th birthday, President Jimmy Carter. 
   James Earl Carter, Jr. was born October 1, 1924, in Plains, Georgia. Peanut farming, talk of politics, and devotion to the Baptist faith were mainstays of his upbringing. Upon graduation in 1946 from the United States Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, he married Rosalynn Smith. The Carters have three sons, John William (Jack), James Earl III (Chip), Donnel Jeffrey (Jeff), and a daughter, Amy Lynn. 
   After seven years' service as a naval officer, Jimmy Carter returned to Plains. In 1962 he entered state politics, and eight years later he was elected Governor of Georgia. Among the new young southern governors, he attracted attention by emphasizing the environment, efficiency in government, and the removal of racial barriers. I was pleased to serve in the Georgia State Senate during his Governorship and to support his reform agenda. 
   Jimmy Carter announced his candidacy for President in December 1974 and began a two-year campaign that quickly gained momentum. At the Democratic National Convention, he was nominated on the first ballot. He campaigned hard, debating President Ford three times, and won the Presidency in 1976 by 56 electoral votes. One of the greatest honors of my life was when President Carter chose me to lead the Veterans' Administration. In fact, I was President Carter's first scheduled appointment--it was not more than a couple hours after the inauguration when he asked me to be a part of his administration. It remains one of my proudest moments. 
   As President Jimmy Carter worked hard to combat the continuing economic woes of inflation and unemployment by the end of his administration, he could claim an increase of nearly eight million jobs and a decrease in the budget deficit, measured as a percentage of the gross national product. He dealt with the energy shortage by establishing a national energy policy and by decontrolling domestic petroleum prices to stimulate production. He prompted Government efficiency through civil service reform and proceeded with deregulation of the trucking and airline industries. 
   President Carter also sought to improve the environment in many ways. His expansion of the National Park System included protection of 103 million acres of Alaskan wilderness. To increase human and social services, he created the Department of Education, bolstered the Social Security system, and appointed record numbers of women, African-Americans, and Hispanics to jobs in the Federal Government. 
   In foreign affairs, Jimmy Carter set his own style. His championing of human rights was coldly received by the Soviet Union and some other nations. In the Middle East, through the Camp David agreement of 1978, he helped bring amity between Egypt and Israel. He succeeded in obtaining ratification of the Panama Canal treaties. Building upon the work of predecessors, he established full diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China and completed negotiation of the SALT II nuclear limitation treaty with the Soviet Union. 
   Remarkably fit and compulsively active, President Carter remains a leading figure on the world stage. After leaving the White House, Jimmy Carter returned to Georgia, where in 1982 he founded the nonprofit Carter Center in Atlanta to promote human rights worldwide. The Center has initiated projects in more than 65 countries to resolve conflicts, prevent human rights abuses, build democracy, improve health, and revitalize urban areas. 
   His invaluable service through his work at the Carter Center has earned him a record that many regard as one of the finest among any American ex-President in history. Jimmy Carter's high-profile, high-stakes diplomatic missions produced a cease-fire in Bosnia and prevented a United States invasion of Haiti. He supervised elections in newly democratic countries and has aided in the release of political prisoners around the world. 
   Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, still reside in Plains, Georgia and enjoy their ever-growing family which now includes 10 grandchildren. I ask my colleagues today to join with Mrs. Carter, Jack, Chip, Jeff, and Amy to honor President Carter on his 75th birthday.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am coming to the floor today to introduce the Peanut Labeling Act of 1999. This bill will require country of origin labeling for all peanut and peanut products sold in the United States; specifically  it will require that consumers be notified whether the peanuts are grown in the United States or in another country. The main purpose of this bill is to provide American consumers with information about where the peanuts they purchase are grown. This bill will allow consumers to make informed food choices and support American farmers. And, with the labeling requirement, should a health concern be raised about a specific country's products, such as the Mexican strawberry scare we witnessed a few year's back, consumers would have the information they need to make their own choices about the products they buy at the market. 
   Family farmers in America are facing dire circumstances. Farmers' ability to grow and sell their products have been severely affected by bad weather conditions, poor market prices, and trade restrictions. This bill allows consumers to help American farmers in the best way that they can--with their food dollar. Consumers are provided with information about the country of origin of a wide range of products, including clothes, appliances and automobiles. It only seems appropriate and fair that consumers should receive the same information about agricultural products, specifically peanuts. In fact, because consumers purchase agricultural products, including peanuts, based on the quality and safety of these items for their families, it seems even more important to provide them with this basic information. 
   By providing country of origin labels, consumers can determine if peanuts are from a country that has had pesticide or other problems which may be harmful to their health. This is true particularly during a period when food imports are increasing, and will continue to increase in the wake of new trade agreements such as the WTO and GATT. As I previously mentioned, recent outbreaks linked to strawberries in Mexico, and European beef related to ``mad cow disease'' have raised the public's awareness of imported foods and their potential health impacts. Consumers should not have to wait for the same thing to happen with peanuts before they have the information they need to make wise food choices. With the labeling requirement, should such an outbreak occur, consumers would have the information to not only avoid harmful products, but to continue to purchase unaffected ones. 
   The growth of biotechnology in the food arena necessitates more information in the marketplace. Research is being conducted today on new peanut varieties. These research efforts include seeds that might deter peanut allergies, tolerate more drought, and be more resistant to disease. As various countries use differing technologies, consumers need to be made aware of the source of the product they are purchasing. GAO recently pointed out that FDA only inspected 1.7 percent of 2.7 million shipments of fruit, vegetables, seafood and processed foods under its jurisdiction. Inspections for peanuts can be assumed to be in this range or less. This lack of inspection does not provide consumers of these products with a great deal of assurance. 
   Another purpose of this bill is to provide consumers with the ability to gain benefit from the investments of their hard earned taxes paid to the U.S. government. The federal government spends a large sum of money on peanut research infrastructure that is by far the most advanced in the world. This research not only increases the productivity of peanut growers, but provides growers with vital information about best management practices, including pesticide and water usage. It assists growers in their efforts to more effectively and efficiently grow a more superior and safer product for American consumers. Consumers should be able to receive a return on this investment by being able to purchase U.S. peanuts. 
   Polls have shown that consumers in America want to know the origin of the products they buy. And, contrary to the arguments given by opponents of labeling measures that such requirements would drive prices up, consumers have indicated that they would be willing to pay extra for easy access to such information. I believe that this is a pro-consumer bill that will have wide support. 
   I am also very pleased that peanut growers in America strongly support my proposal. I have endorsement letters for my bill from the Georgia Peanut Commission, the National Peanut Growers Group, the Southern Peanut Farmers Federation, the Alabama Peanut Producers Association, and the Florida Peanut Producers Association. 
   In conclusion, as my colleagues know, we live in a global economy which creates an international marketplace for our food products. I strongly believe that by providing country of origin labeling for agricultural products, such as peanuts, we not only provide consumers with information they need to make informed choices about the quality of food being served to their family but we also allow American farmers to showcase the time and effort they put into producing the safest and finest food products in the world. I believe this bill represents these principles and I ask my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I would like to discuss with the Ranking Member of the VA/HUD Appropriations Committee the documented need for funding of the Atlanta Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center for funds to renovate and modernize patient wards. The Atlanta VA construction project was rated 5th on the Department of Veterans Affairs Fiscal Year 2000 Priority Medical Construction Project Report. This project was listed as 12th last year and with the increasing need was moved to the top 5 by the Office of Management and Budget. On September 8, 1999, I was pleased to support the Senate's passage of S. 1076, the Veterans' Benefits Act of 1999, which authorized $12.4 million for the renovation critical to caring for our veterans. The need for this project will not go away. I believe that this project should receive at least $2 million in initial design and planning for FY 2000 to pave the way for later full funding. Included in this start-up money would be asbestos testing that needs no further delays for environmental safety.

Unfortunately, the Marietta cemetery has been full since 1970. As the senator knows legislation which I sponsored, S. 695, passed the Senate. This legislation would authorize the VA Secretary to establish national cemeteries in Atlanta, Georgia; southwestern Pennsylvania; Miami, Florida; Detroit, Michigan; and Sacramento, California.

I was horrified to see the current state of this building. the building is not only completely dilapidated and partially torn down, but also contains major friable asbestos contamination as well as traces of cadmium and celenium--all of which present serious health risks to the residents of the surrounding community. Senator MIKULSKI, you were kind enough to take the time to review this project with me. Would you agree that the Swift Building presents this community with a serious problem--one that needs and deserves immediate attention.

   Mr. CLELAND. The Senator is correct. The building with its major friable asbestos is not only located right along this major highway, but the exposure to this migratory hazard has been further exacerbated by the partial destruction of this building. As I mentioned earlier, the Swift Building is located in a severely economically depressed area, so without federal assistance the health and economic consequences it presents will remain unaddressed. As you know, the Administration has stated its strong opposition to the exclusion of funding for the Redevelopment of Abandoned Building Program. The purpose of this new program is to address the blight caused by abandoned apartment buildings, single family homes, warehouses, office buildings and commercial centers. I believe that the Swift Building provides an ideal example of the type of project well suited for this program. Although I was greatly disappointed that I was unable to have my amendment accepted to obtain this critical funding, I will be glad to withdraw my amendment if I can get the assurances of the Chairman and Ranking Member that if funding is provided for the Redevelopment of Abandoned Buildings during conference with the House, this project will be given high priority.

   Mr. CLELAND. I thank the distinguished ranking Member. The Tubman African American Museum, located in Macon was founded in 1981. The Museum is dedicated to educating people about all aspects of African American art, history, and culture. In addition to its permanent and visiting art exhibits, the museum hosts concerts, plays, celebrity storytelling and frequent lectures by well-known authors. The benefits from these programs and others is not only to enhance the cultural opportunities for local residents, but also to showcase the significance of the social, cultural, and historical influence of African American culture on our society. I strongly support the Tubman African American Museum and believe that it strongly contributes to the education and understanding of both local citizens and visitors to the Macon area. This museum also has the strong support of the local community in Macon as well as prominent leaders in Georgia, including former Governor Zell Miller, Senator Sam Nunn, Macon's Mayor Jack Ellis and Macon's former Mayor Jim Marshall. 
   The amendment that I have filed before the Senate would provide $2 million for the purposes of relocating and expanding the Tubman African American Museum. The proposed new facility is estimated to cost $15 million. The City of Macon and Bibb County have proven their commitment and support for this project by already providing $775,000 for the project's feasibility study and to purchase property in downtown Macon, the selected site for this project. Senator MIKULSKI, I recognize the budget constraints that you and Senator BOND are facing in trying to consider many valuable projects that deserve funding. With this recognition, I will be glad to withdraw my amendment. I simply ask that should additional funding become available during conference with the House, I would greatly appreciate this project be given strong consideration for funding.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I come before the Senate today to address an issue of critical importance for the people of my State of Georgia and the Nation. It is a matter of personal relevance to me. The issue is our treatment of our nation's veterans and particularly their health care. 
   Upon returning from Vietnam after sustaining my injuries, I was introduced to the VA system, where I received quality care from a VA hospital. It was then that my awareness of veterans and veterans issues took hold. Since then, not only have I been a patient, but I also had the honor of serving as the Administrator of the Veterans Administration during the Carter Administration. 
   This year has seen a welcome and overdue increase in attention to the plight of our nation's veterans. I salute the Chairmen and Ranking Members of the Appropriations Committee and the VA/HUD Subcommittee for their successful efforts to increase funding in this bill for veterans health care, and I regret that the Senator from Minnesota's attempts to provide an even more adequate boost in such funding were not approved. 
   I am particularly proud that earlier this year the Senate passed my legislation to establish new national cemeteries not only in Metro Atlanta, but also in Pennsylvania, Florida, California, and Michigan--the areas with the greatest documented need for such facilities. While I understand the difficult budgetary constraints which confronted the VA/HUD Subcommittee, I believe it is unfortunate that no funding or report language consistent with the authorizing legislation for new national cemeteries has been included. I have an amendment which would seek to correct this shortcoming, at least with respect to the Metro Atlanta cemetery. 
   I also introduced the Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999. This legislation would provide the opportunity for Federal employees, as well as current and retired members of the uniformed services, to obtain long-term care insurance to assist them with nursing home or other long-term care. Working closely with the distinguished Ranking Member of the VA/HUD Subcommittee as well as a number of other Senators from both sides of the aisle, we are close to having a consensus bill which I hope will receive favorable Senate action in this Congress. 
   This year has also seen the passage of H.R. 1568, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act. Included in the bill is language from S. 918, the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act, which I co-sponsored. The bill provides financial and technical assistance to veteran-owned small businesses through the Small Business Administration (SBA). It also offers assistance to businesses owned by reservists during and following times of military conflict. America's reservists and veterans supported our nation, and it is now time for our nation to demonstrate its commitment to them and their small businesses. 
   We are here today, Mr. President, to debate and approve the VA/HUD appropriations budget for fiscal year 2000. It is with a renewed sense of hope that I will support this legislation, which will represent the first real increase for veterans programs after a five year flat-lined budget. The House has already supported the $1.7 billion increase for the VA, and with the Senate's earlier action on 
   this bill, we are now in agreement with the House position. 
   The VA estimates that there are 25.6 million veterans in America. Our nation is proud to count within its population 3,400 World War I veterans, 5,940,000 World War II veterans, 4,064,000 Korean War veterans, 8,113,000 Vietnam War veterans, and 2,223,000 Gulf War veterans. My home state of Georgia has a veterans population of 667,128. 
   Department of Veterans Affairs facilities have grown over the years from 50 hospitals in 1930 to today's 171 medical centers, 350 outpatient, community, and outreach clinics and 126 nursing home care units. 
   The Department of Veterans Affairs has undergone many changes in recent years. I appreciate the general direction in which this agency is moving to answer the challenges of the new millennium. Unfortunately, these changes, exacerbated by under funding, have too frequently disrupted the service systems for our veterans. The VA has found cost savings and efficiencies in outpatient care, a departure from the long-term hospital care of the past. This shift allows the VA to reach beyond the normal geographic locations through Telemedicine and Telepharmacy to Medicare subvention. I support these proposals to move the VA beyond the large hospitals to more rural and small markets to provide access to all veterans. 
   Despite these new directions, there is still more to be done. As I stated, this is the first significant increase in the VA budget in five years. The department is seeing a rise in veterans seeking treatment because of the recently enacted VA enrollment plan and the aging of our veterans population. The VA estimates an increase in total patients to 3.6 million in 2000, up from 2.7 million in 1997. However, with this growing patient load, the VA is currently estimating a reduction in VA employment of up to 8,000 employees in the medical system alone. This fact was recently brought home to me by announcements of serious potential reductions in force at the VA in Augusta if the VA budget is not boosted. 
   As President Coolidge was quoted as saying, ``The nation which forgets its  defenders will be itself forgotten.'' Simply put, our veterans community--who won the two great World Wars of this Century, vanquished Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevich, and served honorably and well in Korea and Vietnam--needs our support. Our former service members should not only be the first in our hearts, but the first in our priorities when it comes to keeping the promises of the nation. They kept their commitment to us, let us fulfill our promise to them. I yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it has been marvelous to listen to the eloquence of the distinguished Senator on the high-tech environment of Duck Hill, MS. It reminds me of my own educational background in Lithonia, GA, at little Lithonia Elementary School there. I worshiped my second- and third- and fourth-grade, fifth-grade teachers, too. But by no means do I want to go back to those days in 1953 and 1954. 
   This is 1999. We are fixing to go into a new millennium and a new century. I am afraid this country is about to go into this new century, with great opportunity ahead of it, with minimal opportunity for our citizens to take advantage of it. 
   Bill Gates, who has become preeminent as a thinker and an innovator, and certainly one who is interested in the cause of education, has put it clearly. He said: It is clear that our ability to continue benefiting from technology will largely depend on how well we educate the next generation to take advantage of this new era. 
   I don't think anyone really questions the wisdom of Mr. Gates. The challenge, of course, is to live up to that challenge Mr. Gates has put before us. He not only talks the talk; he walks the walk. Last week, Bill Gates pledged to spend $1 billion to provide college scholarships to thousands of deserving but financially needy students across the country. This gift is the largest individual contribution to education in history. We can learn something from the leadership our business leaders around America are now showing. I think the Senate leadership can learn something. 
   We are only 4 months away from the year 2000. We must not forget the future of this country is in very small hands. Yet 
   despite all the rhetoric, the great speeches, and the fact that three out of four Americans in the latest Washington Post/ABC poll put improving education No. 1 on the national agenda, what we see here in the agenda  of the Senate is a desire to raid the education pot to pay for other programs higher up on someone else's national agenda. 
   How do I say that? If the words of our distinguished majority leader are true and the tremendous commitment he has shown on the floor today is actually true, then I wonder why the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education of the Committee on Appropriations of this great Senate has reduced the money for education by 17 percent over last year's levels. If all this rhetoric is really true, why are we, in the background, in some subcommittee on appropriations, cutting 17 percent out of education funding from last year? 
   I agree with the words of Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, the great British Prime Minister of the last century, when he said for his countrymen in that century words that ring true for us as we go into a new century. He said: Upon the education of the people of this country, the fate of this country depends. 
   If I had to sum up our challenge as a Nation--and I am on the Armed Services Committee, and I know we are challenged in our military defense of this great Nation--I would say to you, without an educated workforce, without an educated defense force, we cannot compete in the world, either economically or in terms of our own defense. 
   The sad part about it is, every day in America almost 2,800 high school students drop out. The United States, once the leader in high school graduation among industrialized nations, now trails 22 nations and leads only 1, Mexico. This is not acceptable. This will not get us where we want to go in the next century. Each school year, more than 45,000 underprepared teachers, teachers who have not even been trained in the subjects they are teaching, enter the classroom. Who here among us believes this to be acceptable? I don't. Most fourth graders cannot read and understand a simple children's book, and most eighth graders can't use arithmetic to solve a practical problem--that according to a recent survey in Education Week. Who would argue in this body we have to do better? 
   Last year, there were 4,000 reports of rape and sexual battery in America's public schools. We have had an outbreak of violence in the schools. Remember Littleton, Jonesboro, Conyers? School shootings were unheard of in this Nation 20 years ago. Who here would not do everything in their power to restore safety and sanity to America's schools? 
   The truth is, Democrats and Republicans alike have to raise this to the top of our agenda. It is time to put education first and put first things first. We have to be willing to invest in the Nation's future, improve the recruitment and retention of professional teachers. 
   We have to improve our test scores, although that is not, in my opinion, the single-most important goal of our public educational system. The most important goal is to teach kids to think. I remember a story about Bill Gates. Out in Seattle, his mother went out in the garage where Bill was and said, ``Son, what are you doing?'' He said, ``Mother, I'm thinking.'' That is the goal of our public educational system. 
   The Public Schools Excellence Act recognizes America's ability to attract and retain qualified teachers is key to quality education. S. 7, of which I am a cosponsor, would provide local school districts with the help and support they need to recruit excellent teacher candidates. I agree, the States are the leaders in educational improvement. They have to be. I was a State official, with 4 years in the State senate and 12 years as secretary of state. I spent more time as a State official than I have as a Federal official. But it is obvious, a lot of our school systems in our States can't get to where we need them to be without some Federal help. Who would deny that? 
   We need 100,000 new, trained, qualified teachers in this country. One reason is to reduce class size in grades 1 through 3. Every index I have seen of student performance--and part of the key to student excellence and achievement is the reduction of the pupil-teacher ratio, particularly in grades 1 through 3. No matter how you cut it, a teacher with 10 or 15 students in the class, regardless of where those teachers and students are--what State, what district, what county--they learn more and do better than a teacher who has 30 or 35 kids in the class. 
   We have another problem: 14 million children in the U.S.A. attend schools in need of extensive repair or replacement. I come from a State that is fast-growing, and it is hard to build enough classrooms, particularly in Metropolitan Atlanta. If you look around my State, a recent survey pointed out that in Georgia some 62 percent of our classroom buildings need repair. We have had legislation on the floor of the Senate to deal with this. We have not dealt with it. 
   There is another issue. Every day, 5 million children have to care for themselves in the hours before and after school. When I was growing up, in my hometown of Lithonia, when I came home--and my mother and father were working--my grandmother was there. I was not a latchkey kid. The truth is, in that key time period from 3 o'clock to 8 o'clock at night, half of all the violent juvenile crime in this country takes place. This is a key period for our youngsters in America. Why can't we help out? 
   Today, only a virtual handful of children participate in good afterschool care. Let's not cut educational funding from what it was last year by 17 percent. Let's not let this subcommittee, behind our backs, cut the feet out from under us as we make great speeches on the floor of how many of us support education. 
   Let us actually take a lesson from Bill Gates: Let us help our communities reduce juvenile crime by investing our dollars in afterschool care. That is one of the challenges before us and one of the programs that was cut by the subcommittee. 
   Let me say also that I think we ought to take the words of Benjamin Disraeli to heart as we enter this debate next week, as it is a truism: ``An investment in education is an investment in the future of America.'' 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. ROTH addressed the Chair.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to voice my support for and cosponsorship of Senator ROBB'S amendment to remove the Section 329 rider from the Interior Appropriations bill. This rider would undermine sound science in wildlife management in my state and across the nation. It would suspend U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management requirements to research and monitor certain wildlife populations, integral requirements that the agencies themselves adopted as early as 1982. I strongly support this amendment and believe that we should remove this rider. 
   Section 329 attempts to overturn a recent court case, Sierra Club versus Martin, issued by the 11th Circuit, which confirmed the agencies' duties to monitor certain wildlife species in order to make credible and well-informed management decisions. The 11th District Court unanimously ruled that the Forest Service was not properly performing its responsibilities to inventory ``rare'' species in the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests as mandated by its own Forest Management Plan. The court's decision does not expand monitoring requirements, but merely ruled that the absolute failure to collect any data or implement any monitoring of indicator and sensitive species was not legal. 
   Monitoring the health of ``indicator'' and ``sensitive'' species is both sound science and good wildlife management. Indicator species act as proxies for other wildlife in the forest. That is why monitoring of indicator species was included in the 1982 implementing regulations of the National Forest Management Act and is included as an integral part of forest management plans adopted by the agencies. If we ignore what is happening to these ``indicators,'' we are ignoring the impacts on the whole forest. Collecting new and important data is the only way to ensure that our land mangers are using the most up-to-date and accurate scientific information. By limiting decisions to ``available'' science as this rider would dictate, Section 329 turns a blind eye to the information we need to make the best possible management decisions. 
   I understand that some argue the best ``available'' definition is the same  rigid standard set forth by the Endangered Species Act. While true, this is a complete misrepresentation of the law's intent. The intent of best ``available'' information for Endangered Species is to encourage swift listings of animals so that we avoid risking the extinction of such animals. Associating this definition with determining the status of animals in a National Forest section scheduled for timber harvesting runs completely contrary to the intent of the Endangered Species Act version which is to protect species. Applying this definition when making forest management decisions risks the habitat and future of both ``sensitive'' and ``endangered'' species by not having accurate and current data upon which to make these decisions. Each forest manager will be without guidance and our national lands will be managed according to the whims of individuals rather than the interests of the public. 
   In my own state of Georgia, National Forests provide a refuge for black bear, migratory songbirds, native brook trout, and an incredible diversity of aquatic species. Some of these species are already listed under the federal Endangered Species Act. Many more may be listed in the future if we ignore the warning signs. The smart, economical approach is to monitor and conserve ``sensitive'' species before they reach a crisis state and are listed on the endangered 
   species list. By avoiding such listings, we have the maximum amount of flexibility and the costs of conservation are low. Unfortunately, Section 329 discourages land managers from doing just that. 
   I understand that, in reaction to the court decision, the regional forester for the Chattahoochee and Oconee National Forests is amending its forest management plan and this rider completely short circuits that process. Amending the Forest Management Plan is the proper method for handling these kinds of issues. It allows for Public Comment and Participation and also allows for Sound Science to be utilized and reviewed. The Forest Service has stated that this rider, ``Overrides a Federal Court Ruling, agency regulations, and resource management plans that require the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to obtain and use current and appropriate information for wildlife and other resources before conducting planning and management activities.'' Note the language that resource management plans require the agencies to obtain and use current and appropriate information. It does not say, see what data you can scrounge up and use that. 
   Considering the Senate's recent debate on Rule 16, it is clear that this rider is attempting to legislate on an Appropriations bill. I believe that contentious authorizing language such as this should have the benefit of a full review by the authorizing Committee which has jurisdiction over these matters. These important decisions should not be done through an environmental rider on an appropriations bill. 
   In closing, it is clear that the Forest Service's own National Forest Management Act regulations require monitoring of certain, but not all, resident wildlife to ensure that land managers are using the most up-to-date and accurate scientific information in their decisions. Now, I understand that every single species of plant and animal cannot and should not be documented in these inventories. However, I believe that in order to protect species from becoming threatened and endangered, the Forest Service must employ effective measuring techniques which will provide accurate estimates. These estimates are critical to making sound management decision. I believe that this rider short circuits both the Senate's ability to provide proper oversight and the Forest Service's process for amending forest management plans. 
   I urge my colleagues to remove this rider and vote in favor of this amendment. I thank my colleagues and yield the floor.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am very pleased to endorse S. 1076, the Veterans' Benefit Act of 1999. I want to thank the distinguished Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs for all their hard work to maintain and enhance veterans' benefits and for including the much needed construction renovation at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Senators SPECTOR and ROCKEFELLER have provided excellent leadership during these challenging times of matching current budget levels with the provision of promised benefits. 
   The Atlanta VA Medical Center renovation will be critical to providing care for all of our veterans, men and women, in the new millennium. S. 1076 proposes other needed benefits in the areas of service-connected disability compensation, health and education, medical facility construction and burial entitlements.

   Mr. CLELAND. I rise to engage the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a colloquy regarding Cumberland Island National Seashore, which is located just off the coast of Georgia. As Senator GORTON and Senator BYRD are aware, the Congress recently provided funding for an important land acquisition for Cumberland Island, which will ensure the protection of lands on Cumberland Island for generations to come. In conjunction with this land acquisition, I worked with the National Park Service, residents of the island, and members of the historic and environmental communities to reach a unanimous agreement on the management of Cumberland Island National Seashore. The agreement provides a framework for the proper management of the cultural and wilderness resources on the island. I strongly supported the development of this agreement and am committed to ensuring that this agreement is followed regarding the management of Cumberland Island National Seashore. Do the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee share my strong support for the implementation of the agreement?

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued support for the U.S. Army School of the Americas (SOA), located at Fort Benning, Georgia. Legislation has been introduced by my colleagues both in the House and the Senate which would close the School of the Americas, and last evening the House adopted an amendment to do so. Mr. President, I rise to support the School of the Americas and the vital mission it performs in encouraging diplomacy and democracy within the militaries located in the Americas. 
   The School of the Americas has been a key instrument of U.S. foreign policy in Latin and Southern America for over fifty years and is the single most important instrument of our National Security Strategy of engagement in the Southern Hemisphere. 
   The legislation opposing the School has been accompanied by a mountain of communications alleging that this School, operated by the U.S. Army and funded by taxpayers' dollars, is the cause of horrendous human rights abuses in Central and South America. In twelve separate investigations since 1989, the Department of Defense, the Army, the GAO and others have found nothing to suggest that the School either taught or inspired Latin Americans to commit such crimes. Yet, sponsors of these measures reproduce the critics' list of atrocities allegedly committed by a small number of graduates in order to transfer responsibility for these crimes to the backs of the School and the Army rather than to the individuals themselves. 
   The School is, and always has been, a U.S. Army training and education institution teaching the same tactics, techniques, and procedures taught at other U.S. Army schools and imparting the very same values that the Army teaches its own soldiers. These U.S. military personnel receive the same training as all graduates of our military schools. To suggest that terrorist activities are taught to students would suggest that we in fact teach terrorist activities to all of our own military personnel. This is assuredly not the case. 
   The School is commanded by a U.S. Army colonel whose chain of command includes the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Infantry Center and the Commanding General of the U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. The School also receives oversight and direction from the Commander-in-Chief of U.S. Southern Command. The School's staff and faculty includes over 170 U.S. Army officers, noncommissioned officers, enlisted soldiers, and Department of the Army civilians. The School counts among its graduates over 1,500 U.S. military personnel including five general officers currently serving on active duty in our military. 
   I agree completely with critics of the School that ``Human rights is not a partisan issue,'' and I further agree that, in the past there were indeed some shortcomings in the School's fulfillment of its mission to transmit all of the values we hold dear in our country. In that regard, today, the U.S. Army School of the Americas has the U.S. Army's premier human rights training program. The program has been expanded in recent years in consultation with the International Committee of the Red Cross and Mr. Steve Schneebaum, a noted human rights attorney and a 
   member of the School's Board of Visitors. Every student and instructor at the School receives mandatory human rights instruction and the International Committee of the Red Cross teaches human rights each year during the School's Command and General Staff and Peace Operations courses. Last year, over 900 Latin American soldiers, civilians, and police received human rights instruction at the U.S. Army School of the Americas. 
   Latin America is currently undergoing an unparalleled transformation to democratic governance, civilian control of the military, and economic reform along free market principles. Almost every nation in Latin America has a democratically elected government. During this transition, the region's militaries have accepted structural cuts, reduced budgets, and curtailed influence in society. In many cases, their acceptance of this new reality has been encouraged and enhanced by the strategy of engagement of which the U.S. Army School of the Americas is an integral part. However, many Latin American democracies are fragile. True change does not occur in days, months, or even years. We must continue to engage Latin American governments, including their militaries. Marginalizing or ignoring the militaries of the region will not help in consolidating hard-won democracy but, instead, will have the opposite effect. Our efforts to engage the militaries of the region are more important and more relevant than ever. The U.S. Army School of the Americas is unique in this regard because it trains and educates large numbers of Latin American students who cannot be accommodated in other U.S. military service schools due to limited student spaces and the inability of other U.S. military schools to teach in Spanish. 
   Over the years, changes have been made to enhance the School's focus on human rights and diplomacy. Recently introduced courses such as Democratic Sustainment, Humanitarian Demining, International Peacekeeping Operations, Counternarcotics Operations, and Human Rights Train-the-Trainer, directly support shared security interests in the region, and are not offered elsewhere. Other proposed changes include placing the School under the jurisdiction of U.S. Southern Command and expanding the Board of Visitors to include congressional membership--both proposals which I strongly support. 
   By focusing on the negative, critics ignore the many recent positive contributions that U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates have made. In 1995, this nation helped broker a cease fire between Peru and Ecuador when a historical border dispute threatened to ignite into war. The key members of the delegations that put together that accord were U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates, from Peru, from Ecuador, and from the guarantor nations of the United States and Chile. In fact, the Commander of the U.S. contingent to the multinational peacekeeping force, who received special recognition from the State Department for ``extraordinary contributions to U.S. diplomacy,'' was a 1986 graduate of the School's Command and General Staff course, and serves as the current Commandant of the School. More recently, in 1997, the President of Ecuador was removed from office, creating a constitutional crisis. Some of the people of Ecuador called for the military to take power, but their military refused. Many of the officers in the high command were U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates. Finally, less than four months ago, the President of Paraguay was impeached for misconduct. Once again, a constitutional crisis ensued. Once again, the military refused to take power. Once again many of the officers in that military were U.S. Army School of the Americas graduates, including one general officer who played a key role in the refusal. 
   I ask each of you to take a careful look at the U.S. Army School of the Americas as it exists today. Look to the future. As stated by the School's critics, ``The contentious politics of U.S. foreign policy in Central America in the 1980s are over.'' I strongly urge you to continue your support of the Army School of the Americas and the U.S. Army.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to clarify with the ranking member of the Treasury Appropriations Subcommittee the intent of this bill regarding its appropriation of $80.1 million for salaries and expenses at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) located in Glynco, GA. This appropriation is $6 million less than the $86 million for salaries initially requested by FLETC. It is my understanding that the lion's share of this reduction is simply the result of a readjustment based on what the Subcommittee and Committee believe will be the actual workload at FLETC and not an indication of the Committee's intent that there be any reduction in FLETC's ability to fulfill its mission. Does the Senator care to comment?

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an exceptional company based in Atlanta, Georgia. The Nationwide Companies proudly established its national headquarters in Atlanta just seven years ago, and through the progressive leadership of its founder and president, Bill Case, it has succeeded in the American marketplace. 
   As you well know, success earns recognition, and Money Maker's Monthly recently awarded this growing company the distinction of ``The Company of the Month'' in the United States. The front-page feature, appropriately titled, ``The Nationwide Miracle,'' describes the progress of Nationwide, and applauds Mr. Case for his leadership and integrity. Perhaps the most telling description of Nationwide as a uniquely American business is the conclusion in the feature that Bill Case and his company are ``revolutionizing the way the American public earns and saves money.''

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am happy to announce that I have decided to cosponsor S. 680. This bill, which was introduced by Senators HATCH and BAUCUS, makes the tax credit for research and development permanent so as to encourage investment by companies and external investors in research activities. It has been shown through studies conducted by the General Accounting Office and the Bureau of Labor Statistics that R&D tax credit stimulates domestic R&D spending by U.S. companies. This continued spending on R&D is very important for the U.S. economy as we head into the next century, and I believe this bill serves an important purpose in achieving this goal. 
   I look forward to cosponsoring this bill and gaining support for it in the days ahead.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor and personal privilege for me to pay tribute to two distinguished Americans. One of them is General James L. Jones, Jr., the newly confirmed 32nd Commandant of the United States Marine Corps. 
   The general hails from Kansas City, Missouri. He spent his formative years in France where he acquired his fluency in the French language. 
   He is a graduate of Georgetown University School of Foreign Service and I understand he still keeps up a Georgetown tradition by playing a little basketball now and then. 
   General Jones is a warrior--part of a family of distinguished marines. His father commanded a Marine Corps Force  reconnaissance company during the Second World War. His uncle, Lieutenant General William Jones, commanded Marine Forces in the Pacific and had a long and distinguished combat record. 
   On a personal note, General Jones and I served together in Vietnam during the siege of Khe Sahn. The general was twice decorated for bravery, receiving the Silver Star Medal--our Nation's third highest award for valor--as well as the Bronze Star Medal with combat ``V.'' 
   For me, the general is truly ``a brother of the bond''--a member of the small ``band of brothers'' who have served their country with courage and honor in the crucible of combat. 
   General Jones is a highly experienced infantry commander and staff officer--during his long and distinguished career he has served as an infantry battalion commander, Marine Expeditionary Unit 
   commander and as the commanding general of the Second Marine Division at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. 
   He has led marines from the fire-swept rice paddies of Vietnam to the mountains of Northern Iraq and Turkey. 
   General Jones just recently completed an assignment as the Military Assistant to the Secretary of Defense, our former colleague Bill Cohen. In this capacity, he accompanied the Secretary around the globe in support of the defense of our Nation's vital national interests. 
   Many may not know this, but General Jones is also a ``veteran'' of the United States Senate. He served as the Marine Corps Liaison Officer to the Senate alongside another colleague--then Captain, United States Navy, JOHN MCCAIN. 
   Mr. President, I, again, welcome Lieutenant General Jones as the 32nd Commandant and as the newest member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. He will lead one of the finest military organizations on Earth, the United States Marine Corps. He will be responsible for our Nation's premier ``911'' force, charged with guiding and directing our Corps of Marines into the new century and millennium. 
   I know I speak for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle in wishing General Jones, his lovely wife Diane--as well as his family Jim Jr., Kevin, Greg, and Jennifer--our very best wishes. On June 30, 1999, he will take on the awesome responsibility of being the 32nd Commandant of the Marine Corps. Semper Fi and Godspeed, General Jones.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a distinguished soldier, General Eric K. Shinseki, whose inspiring personal journey is a story that could happen only in America. 
   My good friend and distinguished colleague, the senior senator from Hawaii, presented a moving tribute to General Shinseki when he formally introduced his fellow Hawaiian to the Armed Services Committee on June 8th. Senator INOUYE reminded us that when the general was born on the island of Kauai in the midst of the Second World War, his Japanese heritage made him, according to the regrettable laws that existed at that time, an enemy alien. Due in large part to the heroism of noble Hawaiians like our colleague, who fought so bravely and honorably and at such great personal sacrifice with the 442d Regimental Combat Team in Europe, Japanese-Americans no longer bear the indignity that the government of their country visited upon them during that time of war. As Senator INOUYE reminded us, President Roosevelt declared that Americanism is a matter of mind and heart and that it is not, and never has been, a matter of racial color. The birthright that Senator INOUYE's blood purchased for these Americans enabled young Ric Shinseki to rise to the top of the military profession in this great country. And for that we owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to our brave and distinguished colleague. 
   General Shinseki began to show promise at a tender age. An outstanding student, he left the Territory of Hawaii for the first time and came east to become a high school exchange student in New Jersey. 
   Having broadened his horizons, he sought and secured an appointment to the United States Military Academy. While a cadet at West Point he heard a young president challenge the Nation to ``ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.'' He listened in the Cadet Mess as General of the Army Douglas MacArthur eloquently defined the words of the Academy motto, ``Duty, Honor, Country.'' Cadet Shinseki has never stopped answering those ringing calls to duty. He answers them still. 
   He graduated from the Military Academy in 1965 with a commission in the field artillery. He soon found himself en route to Vietnam and a tour of duty with the 25th Infantry Division, the ``Tropic Lightning'' Division. Onboard a ship crossing the Pacific a veteran non-commissioned officer taught the young lieutenant his craft. For days and days the two men drilled on the techniques of calling for and observing artillery fire. Second Lieutenant Shinseki never forgot the value of skilled and dedicated non-commissioned officers. He has been a soldier's soldier ever since. 
   Combat wounds cut short his tenure in Vietnam. After a long convalescence, he volunteered to return to the war, to answer the summons of the trumpet once again. While commanding a cavalry troop with the 5th Infantry Division, he received another wound, this one far more serious. For a while, his life was in jeopardy. And even after the healing had begun, there were serious questions about whether he could continue his career. 
   True to his nature, honoring his birthright and still answering the call to duty, Ric Shinseki fought to stay in the Army. Fortunately for us, the Army saw more than a little potential in this twice-wounded warrior, and granted his request to stay. They sent him to Duke University to get a degree in English literature so that he could return to teach at his alma mater on the banks of the Hudson. There, as a member of the West Point faculty, he could teach and mentor a new generation of officers, inspiring them with his stoic example of duty and sacrifice. 
   Since that time, General Shinseki has built two great legacies in the Army. First, he is a leader and trainer of soldiers. He has been a commander and operations officer in armored and mechanized formations from the 3rd of the 7th Cavalry in Europe, to my own beloved First Team, the First Cavalry Division at Fort Hood, Texas, where he served as commanding general. 
   General Shinseki has also built a reputation as a brilliant staff officer who has helped the army to shape its force and modernize its training during tours of duty in five different positions in the Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. There he came to know the army as an institution, to learn the folkways of the Pentagon, and to understand the byzantine nature of this great city. 
   In 1997 the President and the Senate recognized the enormous potential of this soldier by promoting him to a fourth star and appointing him Commanding General of United States Army, Europe. This critical assignment was all the more important because General Shinseki was also soon to become Commanding General of the Stabilization Force (SFOR) in Bosnia-Herzegovina. There he undertook the difficult and delicate mission of implementing the Dayton Peace Accords among the Bosnians, Croats, and Serbs, a task whose complexity has been underscored by our more recent trials in the Balkans. 
   Last year, General Shinseki returned home to become Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, to run the staff in the building he knows so well. He has brought a mature, steady hand to his administration of the Army Staff. 
   A combat veteran, a soldier's soldier, an accomplished trainer, a consummate staff officer, a respected commander, this son of Japanese immigrants who was born an enemy alien has now risen to the pinnacle of the American military profession. Wow, what a story. In a ceremony on June 22, 1999 at Fort Myer, Virginia, General Eric K. Shinseki assumed duty as the 34th Chief of Staff of the Army. 
   He is a visionary leader and there is no one better qualified to lead the United States Army into the next millennium. I salute his service, his sacrifice, his devotion to duty. I applaud his perseverance, his intelligence, his humility. I feel honored that the members of the Armed Services Committee  and I will have many opportunities to work with General Shinseki over the next several years as we labor to guarantee the readiness of the Armed Forces and to maintain our covenant with the men and women of the United States Army, who guarantee our own freedoms and guard our interests at home and abroad. 
   Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleague from Minnesota for his remarks today on the subject of health care and HMO reform, and particularly his strong advocacy for what has become known as the Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I would like to report to my colleagues in the Senate the most recent Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard University survey reports that problems with managed care are, indeed, growing and that Americans are increasingly worried about how their health care plan will treat them. The survey found that in 1998 as many as 115 million Americans either had a problem or knew someone who had a problem with a managed care plan. 
   A number of provisions have been included in the Patients' Bill of Rights to maintain the sanctity of the provider-patient relationship, basically known as the doctor-patient relationship. We used to think that was sacrosanct. Unfortunately, it is not today under many HMO plans. Health plans frequently impose restrictions on that relationship by taking it upon themselves to determine the most appropriate treatment. These determinations are often made on the basis of costs rather than what is in the patient's best interest. The fact that health plans are now making medical decisions that were traditionally made by the treating physician really causes me great concern. I think it concerns a number of Members of this body. 
   If health plans continue to arbitrarily define medical necessity, patients will be ultimately denied the health care they were promised. In this HMO debate, this debate on reforming health maintenance organizations, I do not think there is any more pressing issue than ensuring that patients are protected against the practice of some health plans of having insurance bureaucrats determining medical necessity rather than trained physicians. I think that is an incredible abuse of the system. I think it is terrible when we treat people based on financial necessity rather than medical considerations. 
   Health plans, I don't think, should interfere with decisions of treating physicians when those decisions concern a covered benefit that is medically necessary, according to that physician, and appropriate based on generally accepted practices and standards of professional medical practice. It seems to me that is common sense. 
   The Patients' Bill of Rights protects the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship by allowing physicians, not accountants, to make medical necessity determinations. I think that is critical. In addition, some managed care organizations use improper financial incentives to pressure doctors to actually deny care to their patients--incredible. The Patients' Bill of Rights, I think, will go a long way to stopping this practice. 
   I would like to share one personal experience. I am glad that when I was wounded in Vietnam I was not covered by a HMO. I am glad I was covered by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. I could see myself laying there after the grenade went off, trying to call an insurance bureaucrat, being told my conditions were not covered by what was in the plan and, second, I was not cost effective. 
   I am afraid more and more Americans are experiencing that, which is why I personally support the Patients' Bill of Rights. Many of my colleagues do as well. 
   I appreciate the opportunity to discuss this important issue in the Senate. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am deeply honored to rise today to recognize Douglas Scales, Floyd Eugene Collins, Jr., and Richard Floyd Burnham, Jr., three young men from my home town of Lithonia, Georgia who fought in Vietnam, but tragically, did not come home. On July 5, 1999, the city of Lithonia will dedicate the Lithonia Vietnam Veterans Memorial to honor the sacrifices of these heroic young men. It is said, ``Poor is the nation which has no heroes. Poorer still is the nation which has them, but forgets,'' We will dedicate this memorial to remember, and to show our heart-felt appreciation to these young men for fighting for our country, and to say thank you to their families for their own sacrifices in the name of our freedom. 
   As I mentioned, this memorial will be dedicated on July 5, one day after we will celebrate July 4, our Independence Day. On July 4, 1776, the Continental Congress signed the Declaration of Independence in Philadelphia. In that powerful and historic document, the thirteen colonies declared themselves a self-governing body, and rightly stated that King George VIII had ``plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.'' 
   It strikes me that those words could have applied to many situations and many cruel and despotic rulers since 1776. I think of Hitler's Germany, I think of Vietnam, I think even of Bosnia and Kosovo. But because of the principals of our founding fathers and because of many great American presidents who have followed, the United States has been in a unique but sobering position to defend not only its own freedom, but the very concept of freedom across the globe. That was the case in 1967 when Specialist Collins was in Bien Hoe. That was the case in 1968 when Private First Class Scales was in Tay Ninh. That was the case in 1968 when Specialist Burnham was in Quan Nam. It is still the case today. 
   Three Georgians signed the Declaration of Independence in 1776. On July 5, we will unveil and honor the names of three Georgians. Winston Churchill described his concept of duty in this way, ``What is the use of living if it be not to strive for noble causes and to make this muddled world a better place for those who will have it after we are gone.'' Doug Scales, Floyd Eugene Collins, Jr. and Richard Floyd Burnham,  Jr. strove for noble causes and made this world a better place for us. My colleague and fellow Vietnam Veteran Senator JOHN KERREY described what he remembered most about his experience. ``The shared struggle to do more than survive,'' he said. ``And most of all to bestow honor on our service and to our friends who were lost.'' In this small way, we in Lithonia hope to bestow honor on our friends, our brothers, our sons and husbands who were lost. Not, we say, in vain.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a most outstanding and accomplished citizen of Georgia, Mr. Sam Harman, on the eve of his retirement from the public schools system. As an educator for 36 years, Sam Harman's work ethic, coupled with his goal of excellence at each of his schools has earned him the sincere respect and admiration of his Dunwoody, Georgia community. 
   Mr. Harman began his career as a math, social studies and science teacher. Later, he coached football and driver's education. His first administrative job was as principal of one of Georgia's largest middle schools, in Cobb County, Georgia. In 1987, he was named the principal of Vanderlyn Elementary in Dunwoody, Georgia, where he remains today. 
   Throughout his tenure at Vanderlyn, Mr. Harman has always put his duties to his school ahead of anything else to make this school an example of excellence not only in the community, but in the public school system at large. He arrives at school at 6 o'clock each morning and stays until 6 o'clock every night. He is a remarkable person with energy to spare. 
   Sam Harman's dedication to education and his contributions to the community are numerous. To really get an understanding of this wonderful man, you only have to look at his school's many accomplishments. Under his watch, Vanderlyn Elementary has expanded from 400 to more than 700 students. Scholastically, Vanderlyn ranks in the top five schools in Georgia. National test scores for the past five years show Vanderlyn students averaging above the 90th percentile in virtually every academic subject. Teacher transfer rates are extremely low while pupil and teacher attendance rates are among the highest in the country. These statistics are the direct result of Sam Harman's commitment to this school. 
   Mr. Harman takes a personal interest in every child in his school, and knows each by name. He visits each classroom daily, and supervises both lunchroom and bus duty both to reduce the work of his teachers and to interact with the children. Strong pride exists at Vanderlyn because students, parents and staff know that Principal Harman cares about them as individuals. 
   While his compassion for others is unique, he is also a firm mediator and strict disciplinarian. Mr. Harman has a rule that students must come to school to learn. Students are well aware that anyone who performs differently will be dealt with swiftly and directly. Simply put, Mr. Harman will not allow any students to disrupt the learning process. 
   After eleven years at Vanderlyn and 36 years in education, Mr. Harman has now decided to retire. Instead of rising at dawn to herd children, he will be getting up to herd cattle on his farm, where he hopes to spend much more time. 
   Mr. President, I warmly request that you and my colleagues join me in paying tribute to a most outstanding man, Mr. Sam Harman of Atlanta, GA. We have been richly blessed to find such a caring and dedicated school leader who has positively touched the lives of many. I thank him, as well as his family, for allowing us to occupy so much of his time for these past 36 years.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today both to pay tribute to and to thank the Government of the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) for their recent announcement to provide economic assistance to the Kosovar Albanian refugees. These funds, some $300 million, represent a very generous gift and will prove invaluable to the displaced people of Kosovo by helping them receive the food, shelter and clothing they need to survive in the refugee camps and later, when they return to their homes in Kosovo. Furthermore, the aid from Taiwan will provide emergency medical assistance to the refugees, educational materials for the displaced children and job training for those that need it. The government of the ROC is even making it possible for some refugees to receive short term accommodations and job training in Taiwan while they await the rebuilding of their homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals. 
   The generosity of the government of the ROC is a tribute to the thoughtfulness and caring of the Taiwanese people and serves as a wonderful example for the entire international community. The current president of Taiwan, Lee Teng-hui, typifies this compassion and I would like to personally thank him and his foreign minister, Jason Hu, who is a good friend of mine, for all they have done not only for the people of Taiwan but not for the people of Kosovo. Only through such generosity and compassion can the people of the Balkans begin to move past the horrors they have experienced over the past few months and build a better future for themselves and their communities.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to offer this amendment to S. 1059, The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000, which seeks to protect the men and women of our reserve military components. The 1998 National Defense Authorization Act provided health care coverage for Reservists and Guardsmen incurring injury, illness or disease while performing duty in an active-duty status. However, it overlooked those servicemen and women performing duty in ``inactive duty'' status, which is the status they are in while performing their monthly ``drill weekends.'' 
   This problem was dramatically illustrated recently when an Air Force Reserve C-130 crashed in Honduras, killing three crewmembers. One of the survivors was unable to work for over a year due to the serious nature of his injuries. While he was reimbursed for lost earnings, this serviceman was only eligible for military medical care related to injuries sustained in the crash. His family lost their civilian health insurance and was ineligible to receive medical from the military. Had he been on military orders of more than 30 days, both he and his family would have been eligible for full military medical benefits for the duration of his recovery. 
   My dear colleagues, this is unacceptable. We must plug this loophole so that these tragic circumstances are not repeated. 
   Why is it so important that we look out for our Guardsmen and Reservists? It is because our military services have been reduced by one-third, while worldwide commitments have increased fourfold, leading to a dramatic increase in the dependence on our reserve components to meet our worldwide commitments. Like their active duty counterparts, they are dealing with the demands of a high operations tempo; yet they must meet the additional challenge of balancing their military duty with their civilian employment. 
   Members of the Guard and Reserve have been participating at record levels. Nearly 270,000 Reservists and Guardsmen were mobilized during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Over 17,000 Reservists and Guardsmen have answered the Nation's call to bring peace to Bosnia. And, recently, over 4,000 Reservists and Guardsmen have been called up to support current operations in Kosovo. The days of the ``weekend warrior'' are long gone. 
   In addition to significant contributions to military operations, members of the reserve components have delivered millions of pounds of humanitarian cargo to all corners of the globe. Closer to home, they have responded to numerous state emergencies, such as the devastating floods that struck in America's heartland last year. The men and women of the Reserve Components are on duty all over the world, every day of the year. 
   Considering everything our citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines have done for us, we must not turn our backs on them and their families in their times of need. Please join me in supporting this amendment providing for those who provide for us.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, this dynamic legislative year has seen some monumental events. This body began the year by passing S. 4, the Soldiers, Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. With an overwhelming vote of 91-8, the United States Senate did not hesitate to show this great Nation that we appreciate the sacrifices and contributions of our service men and women. We also sent a message to the senior leaders of our military services that their pleas for assistance in stemming the flow of highly qualified service members from the military would not go unanswered. 
   The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 included a 4.8% pay raise, pay table reform, REDUX repeal, a thrift savings plan, and improvements to the current GI Bill. These GI Bill improvements included an increase in GI Bill benefits from $528 to $600 per month, elimination of the now-required $1200 service member contribution, permission to accelerate lump sum benefits and finally, authority to transfer GI Bill benefits to immediate family members. While the bill we are considering today addresses pay and retirement system reforms, it does not address the GI Bill enhancements. You, my distinguished colleagues, showed your support for these GI Bill enhancements earlier this year. I, and the members of our armed services--and their families, asks for your support again. 
   Since the end of the Cold War, our military services have been reduced by one-third, yet worldwide commitments have increased fourfold. Our forces are poised in Asia, standing guard in the Sinai, providing assistance in south America and Haiti, flying combat missions in Iraq, and engaged in war in Kosovo. They are providing invaluable humanitarian assistance to those who have been devastated by a number of natural disasters around the world. And, members of our Guard and Reserve components will be this country's sole providers of a ``Homeland Defense'' against the challenge of weapons of mass destruction presented by this uncertain world. 
   Sadly, these men and women who sacrifice so much for our country are bearing the brunt of these competing demands. By improving pay and benefits, as well as providing for increases in equipment upgrades, weapons procurement and replenishment, and spare parts funding, we can show America's brightest that we value their service and recognized their sacrifices. 
   In my opinion, improvements to the GI Bill may be the single most important step the Congress can take in assisting the recruiting and retaining of America's best. Data we are seeing indicate that education benefits are an essential component in attracting young people to join the armed services. As the costs of college tuition rise, we must remain in step by increasing in GI Bill benefits, or the benefits themselves will become less effective over time. The transferability option, under which service members would be allowed to transfer their GI Bill benefits to their spouse or children, is an innovative, powerful tool that sends the right message to those young people we are trying to attract into the military and those we are trying to retain. 
   This Nation changed dramatically, and for the better, under the original GI Bill. Now we have another chance to address future national needs by creating the GI Bill of the 21st Century. I ask that you join me as we choose the right path at this important historical crossroads.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am offering an amendment to create a Department of Defense (DoD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) collaborative demonstration research pilot for at least five sites nationwide. These funded projects would create and expand current telemedicine and telepharmacy research efforts. In these times of concern over health care resources, telemedicine and telepharmacy studies are crucial to determining the best use of health care clinicians. 
   My amendment would authorize $5 million a year for three years for five DoD/VA Telemedicine and Telepharmacy demonstration projects. Under my proposal DoD/VA researchers and clinicians will develop rigorous, outcome-oriented telemedicine and telepharmacy research projects that will benefit military and veteran study participants and potentially future servicemembers and veteran recipients of health care. 
   Telemedicine is technology's version of the ``doctor's housecall.'' Many recipients of care, such as the homebound, find making a visit to the doctor a very difficult and often painful experience. Health care outreach is needed in the home, remote deployment sites, rural clinics and other underserved areas. I also propose a telepharmacy project, which will study more efficient ways to bring drug and pharmaceutical expertise, as well as supplies, to the patient. For example, the Navy has reported its Battlegroup Telemedicine Program as cost-saving and groundbreaking in providing onboard ship medical treatment of military personnel, thus preventing unnecessary transport. 
   Support of collaborative endeavors between DoD and VA to reduce escalating health care costs and for more accessible, quality care has already been strongly advocated and discussed in the 1999 Report of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition assistance and endorsed by the Congress in the Cleland-Kempthorne Bill, S. 1334, which was made part of the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act (P. L. 105-261). 
   I urge my colleagues to support my amendment to further advance DoD/VA collaboration, to explore innovative ways of providing health care for veterans and members of the Armed Services and possible cost-reduction strategies, and to help military and veterans' health care set an example of quality health care.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I will vote against the pending conference report because I believe it, and the policy and process behind it, represent a shameful failure on behalf of our American servicemen and women now in harm's way in the Balkans. 
   This legislation before the Senate today displays exactly what's wrong with Washington, including the United States Senate. There is much in the pending conference report on Supplemental Appropriations which is urgently needed and which I support. American farmers need and deserve the disaster assistance included in this legislation. The Kosovar refugees need and deserve massive resettlement and reconstruction assistance, of which the pending measure provides at least a down payment. Our servicemen and women need and deserve the pay raise it provides and above all, those who are on the front lines in the Balkans and elsewhere in the world need supplies and equipment. 
   However, in spite of these positive features, I will be voting ``no'' because of the bill's funding for an expanded, open-ended war against Yugoslavia, which in my opinion, has not been adequately and appropriately considered by the Congress, and also because this important legislation has been used for petty provincial interests. In effect, our servicemen and women are being held hostage while the bill has been loaded up with narrow amendments to assist special interests, such as a gold mine in Washington state, a dormitory for Congressional pages, and reindeer ranchers. 
   While I have certainly observed this same game of special interest influence on the legislative process all too often since I have been in the Senate, this current case is particularly egregious  because of the boldness of the special interests and the apparent willingness of too many of our national leaders to allow those interests to be placed above consideration of the interests of our troops in the field. 
   Our troops deserve better from all of us. 
   I have spoken before my reservations about NATO's current policy in the Balkans and Congress' abdication of our Constitutional responsibilities with respect to war powers. To say the least, neither of those reservations have been alleviated in this conference report. 
   Our leadership, including both the Clinton Administration and NATO, have failed to clearly state what our mission is in the Balkans, what specific goals we intend to achieve, and how we will end this mission. 
   As perhaps the leading military analyst of the Vietnam War, Colonel Harry Summers, wrote in his excellent book ``On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Contest:''  
   The first principle of war is the principle of ``The Objective.'' It is the first principle because all else flows from it. ..... How to determine military objectives that will achieve or assist in achieving the political objectives of the United States is the primary task of the military strategist, thus the relationship between military and political objectives is critical. Prior to any future commitment of U.S. military forces our military leaders must insist that the civilian leadership provide tangible, obtainable political goals. The political objective cannot merely be a platitude but must be stated in concrete terms. While such objectives may very well change during the course of the war, it is essential that we begin with an understanding of where we intend to go. As Clausewitz said, we should not ``take the first step without considering the last.'' In other words, we (and perhaps, more important, the American people) need to have a definition of ``victory.''  
   Colonel Summers continues:  
   There is an inherent contradiction between the military and its civilian leaders on this issue. For both domestic and international political purposes the civilian leaders want maximum flexibility and maneuverability and are hesitant to fix on firm objectives. The military on the other hand need just such a firm objective as early as possible in order to plan and conduct military operations.  
   Mr. President, we've been here before, and speaking personally, I know all too well the kind of price that is paid by our men and women in uniform when our political leaders fail to lay out clear and specific objectives. More than thirty years ago, in Vietnam we also lacked clear and specific objectives. We attempted to use our military to impose our will in a region far from our shores and far from our vital national interests, and without ever fully engaging the Congress or the American people in the process. The result was a conflict where the politicians failed to provide clear political objectives, but intruded in determining military strategy, and where our policy was never fully understood or fully supported by the American people. 
   Too many Americans never came home from that war, and others came home unalterably changed in mind or body. I cannot in good conscience sit here and watch it all appear to be happening again. I will not support putting American ground troops into Kosovo, and I cannot vote for this conference report which, in my opinion, moves us further in that direction.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, Winston Churchill once said that we build our homes, then our homes build us. I can say happily that my home built me! I was fortunate to have had a great childhood--with two wonderful parents, a great church, and more than a few wise and supportive teachers throughout my school years. I grew up in Lithonia, Georgia, in a community that cared. Unfortunately, not all children growing up in America today are so blessed. Not all children have homes that shape and prepare them to deal with the culture of violence in the world today. 
   Back in the 50s, my action heroes were Roy Rogers, the Lone Ranger, and Gene Autry. They were the good guys, who righted wrong and always got the girl. A witness at a Commerce Committee hearing 2 weeks ago described today's action heroes: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, whose TV show, we were told, averaged 100 acts of violence every single episode. 
   When I was in school, the strongest drug around was aspirin, and the most lethal weapon was a sling shot. Last year, over 6,000 students were expelled for carrying a weapon to school--and most said they carried the weapon ``out of a need for protection.'' So far this year--and the year is only 5 months old--19 young people have met a violent death while in school. Our schools were once safe havens in this country, and there is something very wrong, as President Clinton points out, ``when kids are more worried about guns and violence than math and science.'' 
   The underlying fear of Littleton is that it is symptomatic of a broader pattern of youth violence in this country. Events at Columbine High echo the school shootings in Springfield, OR, when a student invaded the cafeteria, killed a fellow student, and wounded 22 others. It echoes events in Jonesboro, AR, where two Middle School students opened fire, killing five students all under the age of 13 and wounding 10 others. One of the young killers was reportedly angry over the breakup with his girlfriend. It echoes the West Paducah, KY murders in which a fourteen-year-old student stormed a prayer group meeting before school, killed three teenaged girls, and wounded five more students. It was reported that the teen killer may have been teased by members of the prayer group as well as members of the school's football team. 
   In interviews with the neighbors of the Littleton killers, each one--almost without exception--saw little sign of the tragedy that lay ahead. These are the words of one of those neighbors:  
   I turn on the news and I see their house, and I think, ``That's my house! . . . It's the exact same house, the same windows, same driveway, same trim, everything except the color. I lie in bed thinking: 200 feet from my bedroom is where the guy conceived this idea to destroy everything we thought we had. Everything you thought you knew about your neighborhood, your schools, your churches--all just shattered. Vaporized. We feel like we are at ground zero.''  
   What causes two seemingly ``normal'' teenagers to go on a killing rampage? Is it a change in our culture? Is it our marketing of violent movies like ``The Basketball Diaries'' and gory video games like ``Doom?'' Is it access to Internet recipes for building bombs? Is it the plight of ``latchkey'' kids who come home every day after school to an empty house? What is the WHY of Littleton? What are the toxic factors that are producing the alarming trend in this country where young people settle their grievances with mass murders?  
   I am proud to be a cosponsor of the amendment by Senator LIEBERMAN which would create a National Commission on Youth Violence. It will bring together religious leaders, educators, Cabinet heads, experts in parenting, in law enforcement, and psychology all focused on a single mission: To understand what factors conspire to create a Littleton and what actions we can take to address the possible causes of youth violence. The task will not be easy and the answers will not be simple. But this amendment is a critically important step in addressing the culture of violence that is pervading every segment of our society. 
   It is obvious to me that we are in a cultural war in this country for the hearts and minds of our young people. And in anything and everything we can do to help and strengthen our children through safe schools, through smaller classrooms, through greater adult interaction and support, we should absolutely do. This Congress has a role. And one of the things we can--and should do--is to adopt the Lieberman amendment. The national commission will seek answers to the perplexing questions of how we deal with the hearts and minds of our youngsters in this cultural war. And, sadly enough, like real war, there are casualties. Littleton, CO is an example of that. Our hope is that we can take some positive action that mitigates the death and destruction of the Columbine tragedy. 
   What is at stake is no less than this Nation's most precious resource, our number one asset--our children. As the writer James Agee said, ``In every child who is born, under no matter what circumstances, and of no matter what parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again.'' Mr. President, on behalf of America's children, I am very pleased that the Lieberman amendment has been accepted by both sides and is part of this important legislation.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an exeptional company based in Atlanta, GA. The Nationwide Companies proudly established its national headquarters in Atlanta just 7 years ago, and through the progressive, dynamic leadership of its founder and president, Bill Case, it has succeeded in the marketplace from coast to coast. 
   Success earns recognition, and Money Maker's Monthly, the prestigious business journal, recently awarded this ever-growing company the distinction as ``The Company of the Month'' in the United States. The front-page feature, appropriately titled, ``The Nationwide Miracle,'' meticulously describes the amazing progress of Nationwide, and applauds the company's founder and president Bill Case for his leadership and unquestioned integrity. Perhaps the best description of Nationwide as a uniquely American business is the conclusion in the feature that Bill Case and his company are ``revolutionizing the way the American public earns and saves money.''

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona, my dear colleague and friend and fellow Vietnam veteran, for pushing to make sure that this issue of war in Kosovo, war in Yugoslavia, war in the Balkans receives the time and attention from this great and august body that I think it truly deserves. 
   I am struck by the fact that in the earlier weeks of this year, all of my colleagues in the Senate gathered on a question of serious constitutional gravity: impeachment of the President of the United States. This is a serious matter equivalent to that, Mr. President, that is, sending young Americans into harm's way. It is a constitutional matter, one that I personally feel strongly about and one on which I am personally conflicted. 
   As the distinguished Senator from Arizona, I served in Vietnam. I cannot help but think back, on the presentation of this resolution, to the fact that some 35 years ago the Senate voted 88-2 in favor of the Tonkin Gulf resolution which authorized the President to ``take all necessary steps, including the use of armed forces,'' in Vietnam. The House approved that resolution unanimously, 416-0. 
   It is fascinating that my colleague, my friend, my mentor, Senator Russell, in those days chairman of the Armed Services Committee, and a great student of history, actually succeeded in attaching language which  gave Congress the right to terminate the authorization of the Tonkin Gulf resolution at any time by concurrent resolution. 
   Senator Russell, in those days, certainly spoke against open-ended conflict where the Congress gave wide open authority to the President. He tried to rein in the Executive and preserve the ability of the Senate, particularly, to exercise its constitutional authority and exercise its constitutional role. 
   But this vote on the Tonkin Gulf resolution served as an unchallenged congressional authorization of war until 1970, by which time, of course, we were deeply involved in the conflict, but no closer, unfortunately, to our political objectives. The way out was long and difficult. 
   The near unanimous votes in favor of war against North Vietnam in the mid-1960s reflected an apparent certainty of purpose and clarity of message to the President, our adversaries, the American people, and our service men and women. However, future events, as they unraveled, were to show that this hasty congressional action, done for the best of intentions, to display national unity, eventually produced exactly the opposite result--national disunity. And we gave an uncertain reaction to the service men and women--and I was one of those servicemen--who carried out the Government's policies and came back to a divided nation and a nation on its way out of war, not in it. But that process took 10 years, Mr. President. 
   Growing out of our Vietnam experiences, the Senator from Arizona and I have taken the Kosovo issue very seriously. For us, it is not an issue--it is a war, a war in which young men and women's lives are at stake. And we come to very different conclusions about what should be done in that war in terms of further military conflict. But we both believe the same thing in one sense, and that is, above all, the Senate must speak, the Senate must debate, the Senate must stand up and be counted in terms of the policy that we are to follow in the Balkans. 
   For that reason, Mr. President, I urge that the motion to table this resolution be defeated. I shall be voting against the motion to table. We cannot just table a war. We cannot just shunt aside the future lives of young men and women as they are risked at this hour. 
   It is fascinating how the resolution reads, the last sentence of which says that the President is authorized to ``use all necessary force and other means in concert with United States allies to accomplish United States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization objectives in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.'' ``All necessary force and other means.'' 
   Mr. President, to me, that is an echo, a strange ominous echo of the language in the Gulf of Tonkin resolution that passed this body overwhelmingly in the mid-1960s. This got us into deep trouble in Southeast Asia. I see too many similarities between that experience then and the war in the Balkans now. I see a similarity in an open-ended conflict--one with no real military solution in sight, a conflict with no real military strategy to win, and certainly a conflict in which we have no exit strategy from which to disengage ourselves from the war in the Balkans. 
   Instead, I see a greater Americanized war. I see a doubling of the warplanes--almost to 1,000 now--with the heavy majority of those airplanes being from the United States. I see 5,000 muddy boots on the ground in Albania, all of them American forces, up cheek to jowl, right across the line, with Serbian forces in tanks and dug into the mountains with armored personnel carriers and hand-held missiles, and a tremendous 
   capability of ground fire. God forbid if we launch the Apache helicopters into that forbidden zone. 
   I say to you, Mr. President, I support further debate. I will oppose the tabling motion, but I will also oppose this resolution on its merits. 
   I thank the President, and I thank the distinguished Senator from Arizona for the time to speak on this important matter. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. 
   Mr. McCAIN addressed the Chair.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to and honor the many accomplishments of Marianne Bond Webster, of Dunwoody, Georgia. By the age of 43, Marianne was a success by most yardsticks: happily married and the mother of two, tennis champion, gourmet cook, and a popular caterer. However, several events in Marianne's life sparked a midlife change which would cause her to re-examine her life and become more involved in our nation's political system. This realization spurred her to a more active role in WAND--the Women's Action for New Directions. 
   WAND is a national grassroots peace group emphasizing the role of women-- activists, legislators and community leaders--on issues related to the federal budget, the military, violence, and nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation. A nonprofit organization founded in the early 1980s, WAND has grown into a national organization headquartered in Boston, MA, with an advocacy office in Washington, DC, and a field office in Atlanta, GA, with chapters and organizational partners across the country. WAND's educational arm, WAND Education Fund, was started in 1982. 
   WAND's mission is to empower women to act politically to reduce violence and militarism and redirect excessive military resources to human and environmental needs. 
   In 1990, WiLL--the Women Legislators' Lobby, a program of WAND--was formed. WiLL is a powerful and unique membership network of progressive women state legislators. It is the only national multipartisan network of women state legislators from all 50 states working to influence federal policies and budget priorities. One out of three women state legislators is a member. 
   During the 1990s, it seemed Marianne Bond Webster was everywhere, doing everything for WAND and WiLL: lobby days, media workshops, a session on nuclear waste for junior high school students, a tour of the Savannah River Site, campaigning for Congresswoman CYNTHIA MCKINNEY, arranging benefit concerts with the Indigo Girls, and leading WAND both locally and nationally. 
   By 1998 Marianne had made two major decisions: to serve as WAND's National president, and to run for an open seat in the Georgia legislature. Caring, smart, honest, brave, and decent, I know she would have made a tremendous difference. 
   But, tragically, on April 17, 1998 she jumped on her bicycle to deliver her campaign leaflets. The bag holding her literature caught in the spokes, and she flew over the handlebars, breaking her neck when she landed. Marianne never regained consciousness. She died on June 11, 1998. 
   Family, friends, and WAND members maintained a constant vigil by Marianne's hospital bed and joined hands with those who could not through daily e-mail updates. She touched so many with her special magic. Her spirit lives on in all of us. And her work continues through Marianne's Fund. 
   Her family and friends developed the idea for a fund shortly after Marianne's death. And in 1999 WAND Education Fund established Marianne's Fund with the Atlanta Women's Foundation. WiLL and the other WAND programs, which had become so central in Marianne's life, will be beneficiaries of the Fund. 
   Marianne believed wholeheartedly that all women, if offered support and training, would contribute significantly to the political process. She recruited women state legislators to WiLL enthusiastically, and connected WAND activists with WiLL members nationally, to forge powerful alliances. With courage and intelligence, she took on WAND's complex issues, becoming an expert on the subject of nuclear waste. Marianne toured nuclear weapons facilities and test sites. She wrote passionately about the legacy of nuclear weapons, alerting her audience to the dangers and costs of continued nuclear weapons production. 
   Related programs of peace, justice, and protection of the environment identified by the Webster/Bond family will also be beneficiaries of Marianne's Fund. Marianne worked to increase the women's vote, strongly supported affirmative action for women in business and the professions, donated generously to battered women and children's causes, and contributed much to other grassroots organizations. 
   Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing and honoring the life of Marianne Bond Webster. Marianne was a wonderful and amazing person who positively touched the lives, and bettered the lives, of many Georgians and many Americans. Although her life was unfortunately too short, her memory and her work on behalf of our country and our political system will last forever.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, in support of the need for an initiative to help address the growing long-term care needs of Americans, I am pleased to introduce the Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999 in the Senate. 
   The Administration proposed a plan to offer long-term health care insurance to federal civilian employees. Under my bill, the administration's proposal is expanded to include federal civilian and uniformed services employees, as well as foreign service employees. This non-subsidized, quality private long-term care insurance option can then be offered at an affordable group rate. It is anticipated that 300,000 Federal employees and 200,000 uniformed services employees would voluntarily participate in such a long-term insurance plan. With such participation, the Federal government could truly serve as the model for employers for long-term care insurance. 
   The bill would make the following groups eligible for the long-term care insurance: Civilian employees after continuously working for the federal government for 6 months, Foreign Service employees, civilian annuitants upon retirement, members of the Armed Services, retired members of the Armed Services, and designated relatives, like parents and parents-in-laws. 
   The bill also offers: (1) portability of this benefit regardless of future federal or military employment as long as the monthly premium is paid on a time, (2) a choice of plans to meet the insurer's needs from up to three insurance carriers, and (3) a choice of cash or service benefits (such as expense-incurred or indemnity method). Costs for this program are anticipated to be no more than $15 million for OPM administrative expenses. 
   The price of long-term care is very expensive both in terms of the financial and emotional burden to families. In 1997, Medicare and Medicaid spent $15.4 billion providing home health care to Americans. In that same year, nursing home care cost American taxpayers approximately $16.9 billion. What I am proposing is legislating the ability to maintain self-reliance. The Federal Civilian and Uniformed Services Long-Term Care Insurance Act of 1999 is an important step to providing ``affordable, high-quality long-term care.'' I urge my colleagues to support it.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and salute the heroism and bravery displayed during the brave and daring rescue of Ivers Sims by Atlanta firefighter Matt Moseley, Georgia Department of Natural Resources pilot Boyd Clines, and his navigator, Larry Rogers on April 12, 1999. 
   Many Americans watched this frightening drama unfold on television, and all prayed for a successful and joyous rescue. Last Monday afternoon, as members of the Atlanta City Fire Department fought a raging fire throughout the historic Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill in southeast Atlanta, Ivers Sims, a construction worker, found himself trapped on top of a swaying, 250-foot crane above the raging fire that had erupted in the mill. Boyd Clines and Larry Rogers arrived on the scene and miraculously negotiated their helicopter through the menacing wind, smoke, and fire which emanated from the cotton mill, while Atlanta firefighter, Matt Moseley, dangled from a rope near the flames--all working together to save the life of Mr. Sims. 
   Thanks to dedicated teamwork, amazing heroism, courage and valor in risking their own lives, these three brave men rescued Ivers Sims from above the flames, and moments later, all four safely returned to the ground. When I think of these three heroic Americans and their brave actions I am reminded of the words of Theodore Roosevelt who once said, ``Americanism means the virtues of courage, honor, justice, truth, sincerity, and hardihood--the virtues that made America.'' These three men have brought pride and honor to the State of Georgia and to the entire Nation. Boyd, Larry and Matt are true examples of the courage, honor, justice, truth, sincerity, and hardihood that this Nation is built upon, and are indeed great Americans! 
   I would like to salute all Atlanta firefighters, police officers and Sheriffs deputies who diligently worked together in order to fight the massive fire that engulfed the historic cotton mill. I would also like to praise the fire fighters throughout the Nation who, like Matt Moseley, put their lives on the line every day to protect and serve our communities. Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing and honoring the heroism and bravery displayed by Boyd Clines, Larry Rogers, and Matt Moseley under the most dangerous of circumstances in saving the life of Ivers Sims.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, it is my privilege to speak on the question of Kosovo and our military and political goals there. In working with my staff to put together some background and understand the history of that region, I came across an interesting fact, because I value history. What is it Winston Churchill once said? How do you know where you are going unless you know where you have been? 
   I find it fascinating, after 146 B.C., the Roman Republic was the world's only superpower--that sounds familiar--following the destruction of its long-time superpower rival, Carthage. This Roman triumph created a tremendous expansion of Roman territory, wealth, and influence and, not coincidentally, an expansion of Roman involvement in local conflicts far removed from Italy. 
   One such intervention involved the Northern African kingdom of Numidia, where Rome became entangled in a seccession struggle in 112 B.C., with the Roman Senate declaring actually war against Jugurtha, the leading contender for the Numidian throne. What followed is fascinating. It is described in a book called the ``Anatomy of Error: Ancient Military Disasters and Their Lessons for Modern Strategists.'' 
   I think there are some lessons here for us, particularly as we view Kosovo today. 
   Viewed from a modern perspective, North Africa in the age of Jugurtha was in many ways Rome's Vietnam. The Jugurthine War is the story of the failure of the Romans to find a strategy that would determine the appropriate level of force needed to maintain sound and stable foreign policy.  
   The Romans should have learned to operate according to the rules that Clausewitz later laid out in his book ``On War'': that war is always to be regarded as the pursuit of policy by other means and that strategy is the art of using exactly the appropriate amount of force to accomplish the ends of the policy. The Romans never had a clear policy in Numidia.  
   This is something we have to avoid in Kosovo. We need a clear policy.  
   Thus the Romans never had a rational strategy for winning the war.  
   Another mistake we have to avoid.  
   As a result, they poured a massive amount of military force into the region and accomplished worse than nothing.  
   Mr. President, we can't accomplish worse than nothing in Kosovo. We have to accomplish something of which we can be proud. The horrifying scenes unfolding in and around Kosovo today are indeed a sad recap of many of the worst images of our 20th century: Massive refugee flight to uncertain futures, civilian casualties, large numbers of destroyed homes and shops and communities, ethnic intolerance, and hostilities fanned by demagogic political leaders. 
   The hearts of Americans and people around the world have been truly touched by the incredible tragic plight of the Kosovar Albanians who have been the primary victims of the incredible, reprehensible, so-called ethnic cleansing policies of Milosevic. 
   This is also a difficult situation. There are no easy answers, and any choice the President makes and, indeed, any choice the Congress makes is fraught with danger. Part of this, I think, is the world in which we live, not a new world order 
   but a new world disorder. 
   The post-cold-war order is one of disorder. The two administrations which have confronted the post-Soviet Union world, the Bush and Clinton administrations, have grappled mightily with the complexities of this new age in foreign places, much like the Roman Empire, foreign places like Iraq, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Somalia, Haiti, and now Kosovo. Almost every step in these areas has been subjected to questioning and controversy before, during, and even after the operation in question. 
   The decision to authorize the use of airstrikes against Serbia was one of the most difficult decisions I have ever had to make. I have felt in the weeks since much like President Kennedy described himself. He said he was an optimist with no illusions. I am an optimist. I am an idealist. I want to take the high ground. I thought that NATO and America needed to act, and act then, and airstrikes was our best option. Maximum impact on Milosevic, minimum impact on us. But it was a tough decision to make, and I am under no illusion that this is going to automatically get us to where we want to go in terms of our policies in the Balkans. 
   May I say that we have a major humanitarian interest in providing effective relief for the refugees and preventing further atrocities against civilians by the Milosevic regime. We certainly have a strong interest in stopping the spread of this conflict to the surrounding countries in this historically unstable region. 
   I find it interesting that the century opened in 1914 with a Serb nationalist assassinating Archduke Ferdinand and that led to the guns of August in 1914. We have to make sure that the current Milosevic-misled nationalism does not lead to the guns of 1999. 
   Unfortunately, I think that no real military, or so far diplomatic, approach we have come up with can really fully guarantee our goals in the Balkans. Despite my concern about our long-term policy in Kosovo and the Balkans, the Senate was asked to vote at a point when NATO had already united in favor of airstrikes. American troops were poised to embark on their mission and the credibility of American commitments was on the line.  
   Under these circumstances, I felt that we must not send a signal of disunity to Milosevic, to our NATO allies, to the President, to our own people. 
   While these circumstances dictated my vote for airstrikes, by no means--and I have made this clear--by no means does this indicate my giving a green light for an open-ended, ill-defined, deeper commitment of American military force in Kosovo, especially the introduction of American ground troops. 
   Mr. President, I was on the ground in Vietnam 31 years ago. I don't want this generation to repeat that experience. We do not need an open-ended, ill-defined commitment of American ground forces in the Balkans. I hope and pray that we can avoid that. 
   I hope and expect that any such future expansion of military might there would be thoroughly discussed and debated in our country and within NATO before it is undertaken, not after the decision has been already made. I oppose American ground troops in Kosovo. I think this would represent further intervention in that civil war within internationally recognized borders, Yugoslavia. I think it would be in pursuit of 
   objectives which are not vital to the United States or NATO and would do little, frankly, to secure the long-term interests that we do have in the Balkans--stability and economic prosperity. 
   The distinguished Senator from Kansas, Mr. ROBERTS, has often cited the following quotation from one of my personal heroes, Senator Richard Russell. It is an honor I cherish that I hold his seat in the Senate and his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. Senator Russell 30 years ago in this Chamber, while I was in Vietnam, said this:  
   While it is a sound policy to have limited objectives, we should not expose our men to unnecessary hazards of life and limb in pursuing them. As for me, my fellow Americans, I shall never knowingly support a policy of sending even a single American boy overseas to risk his life in combat unless the entire civilian population and wealth of our country--all that we have and all that we are--is to bear a commensurate responsibility in giving him the fullest support and protection of which we are capable.  
   Mr. President, it has been my honor to visit some of the troops and facilities in Georgia that are supporting our efforts in Kosovo and the Balkans and in western Europe, some of the troops in Fort Stewart, troops at Robins Air Force Base. I know what it means to be a troop out there committed on behalf of this country and to have this country divided. It is not fun. It is not what we want to repeat. And with air operations now ongoing, with Americans soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines in harm's way, our thoughts must turn to them as they tackle a very complicated and very risky mission. Our prayers are with them, and we pray for their safe return in every way. 
   As with every American military deployment, there are risks. That is why I have chosen to visit some of the places in Georgia that have sent young men and women into harm's way, 
   including the 93rd Air Control Wing of JSTARS Aircraft out of Robins Air Force Base; the 19th Air Refueling Group of KC135R Aircraft--which participated, by the way, in the rescue of our downed stealth fighter pilot--also out of Robins; and the 94th Airlift Wing of the C-130 transports out of Dobbins Air Reserve Base, not to mention the numerous other Georgia citizens serving in our deployed forces in the Balkans. 
   My primary purpose today is to look beyond the military phase at our Balkans policy and ahead to the elements which I believe we must consider if we are to have a truly successful exit strategy. I said today in our hearings that there is one thing a Vietnam veteran does not like to hear and that is ``no win.'' There is another thing and that is ``no exit.'' Put those together and that becomes a tragedy: ``no win, no exit.'' We can't have that situation in the Balkans. We need a successful exit strategy which produces a long-term, stable, and humane outcome, one which also will allow our service men and women to come home safely from the Balkans without having to return again. I believe we ought to have a full debate on our exit strategies now, and not just on exit strategies, but on what constitutes victory. I think we still have to nail that down. But certainly we ought to talk about not just how we get in and what we do there, but how do we get out. 
   Even while military operations are still underway, we must not repeat the mistakes the Romans made in the Jugurthine war, or the mistakes we made in the Vietnam war--pursuing both ``no win" and ``no exit'' at the same time. 
   In spite of substantial disagreements about the appropriate ways to go about our goals in the Balkans, I think there is some consensus in this country and in NATO regarding our ultimate goals: 
   1. An end to atrocities in Kosovo. 
   2. Effective relief for refugees. 
   3. A negotiated political settlement, in terms of the status of Kosovo. 
   4. Stability throughout the Balkans, including Kosovo, Bosnia, Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro. 
   Another important goal, it seems to me, is an end to the U.S. and other NATO country force deployments in the Balkans, in other than a legitimate peacekeeping rather than warmaking role. 
   Any effective exit strategy must indicate how we can achieve these ends, including the costs for doing so and also the costs for not doing so. Our involvement in Bosnia has cost us $10 billion already. I understand that the price tag, through October, for our involvement now in Kosovo will cost some $8 billion. We owe it to both the people in the region, as well as to our own service men and women, to determine what price we are prepared to pay in order to make their sacrifices in the military operations they are involved in worthwhile in the long run. Otherwise, we may actually ``win the war,'' but ``lose a peace'' by failure to pursue the nonmilitary policies necessary to attain our key objectives. 
   I think it is important for me to quote one of my heroes, Walter Whitman, who said about the Vietnam experience that the battles we fight we may win, but the battles we fight can't win the war. One of the things I fear most about Kosovo and further military action in the Balkans is that we win those battles, but those battles can't help us bring about the ultimate goals we seek. I am afraid there is a massive disconnect there between the two, and I am afraid that is going to pull us into a deeper 
   and more prolonged war. 
   In that spirit, I want to offer some preliminary ideas, some key elements that I believe must be part of an exit strategy. 
   First of all, we must develop a comprehensive, long-term plan for refugee relief and resettlement. I am not sure if I were a Kosovar Albanian that I would ever want to go back to that part of the world. I would certainly probably not want to go back as long as Milosevic was in power. It is one thing to announce the appropriate goal of the return of all the Kosovar refugees to their homes, but how many will really want to go back? Is it really possible to put Humpty-Dumpty back together again? Is it possible to put together Kosovo as it was before the war? It may not be possible. It is another thing to realize reality and put together a set of policies necessary to deal with the real life situation in which many--perhaps most--of the Kosovar Albanians exist today: 
   1. They don't have homes. 
   2. In many ways, they are dispossessed and don't have a country. 
   3. They don't have jobs. 
   4. They don't have functioning communities to return to. 
   While the European members of NATO and other nearby nations have a great stake in the refugee population resettlement, it is the greatest obligation we have here in the United States, too. We have a significant responsibility. I believe the administration and Congress must develop a substantial aid package now to demonstrate clearly that we are fully committed to successfully working on the refugee crisis. It may be years before that crisis is resolved. The sooner we get to work on it, the better. 
   Secondly, in terms of a successful exit strategy out of the Balkans, we must be prepared to address, as part of any lasting solution to the problems in Kosovo and the Balkans, the economic devastation which exists in much of the entire Balkan region, much of which has been brought about by Milosevic himself in making war on the Slovenians, the Croats, the Muslims, and now on the Kosovars. Much of this devastation has been at his  hands and under the barrel of his guns. This devastation is not something that can be overcome overnight. It is my view that there is little prospect for lasting reconciliation between the peoples and nations of the Balkans until there is some degree of economic recovery. People aren't going to return to homes that exist in communities that don't function. They are not going to return to places where there are no jobs, no schools, no education, and no hope. So much of the Balkans now is in that condition. 
   Given the depth of the problem, we are looking at a project which is almost certainly to be far more lengthy than the financially costly refugee problem. Again, Europe must take the lead, but the United States has to play a part as the international community leader, which it is. We have a stake in the stability of the Balkans, and this is one of the areas that we need to address. We need to begin now considering under which conditions we will offer economic reconstruction aid to the Balkans. 
   Third, in terms of a successful exit strategy, we have to begin laying the groundwork for an international conference to determine a mechanism for a final settlement not just of the Kosovo problem and allowing the will of the people in the 
   Balkans to determine their fate, but we have to do that for Bosnia as well. I think the only way out of our dilemma in the Balkans is negotiating a settlement acceptable to as many parties as possible. It is the only outcome I can see that would help us achieve some lasting peace in the region. 
   Fourth, in terms of a successful exit strategy, all of these efforts that, as I mentioned, revolve around Kosovo have to be applied to Bosnia as well. American forces have been enforcing an uneasy peace in Bosnia since 1996. Many of those refugees displaced in the Bosnia war have not returned to their homes. The costs continue to mount to this country and NATO, and no clear end is in sight. 
   I find it fascinating that the great powers of Europe, after World War I, in 1918, help set up the Balkans, help structure it as it is today. As a matter of fact, in terms of Kosovo, the Russians helped prevail upon the great powers of Europe to take Kosovo away from Albania and give it to Serbia. It is now part of Serbia. I think we need an international conference to resolve some of these dilemmas that have resulted from a century-old set of solutions that may not any longer apply. 
   Fifth, for any successful exit strategy, and for any settlement or resettlement to stick, Serbia must be reconciled to its neighbors and to the NATO countries. Clearly, the chief source of the most immediate problems in the Balkans, the massive human rights violation in Kosovo, is the Serbian regime led by Milosevic. He stands condemned before history and humanity. 
   I am confident that he will ultimately be held accountable for his actions--not just by an international tribunal but by the civilized world. However, we must be very careful that, in painting Milosevic as the enemy, we not demonize the Serbian people. After all, Serbia is the only part of the former Yugoslavia which fought as our allies in both of the world wars of this century. We must make a concerted effort to reach out to the Serbians to make it clear that our quarrel is not with them; it is with Milosevic and his actions. 
   Sixth, as a vital part, a key part of an exit strategy, we must thank those who fought the war. We must redeem our pledges to the men and women in our Armed Forces who are, once again, being asked to put their lives on the line to implement American foreign policy. Our service men and women, and their families, are, once again, the ones paying the price for the policies we make here in Washington. They are on the point of the sphere. If we policymakers are going to continue to put them in harm's way, surely we can appropriately provide for the men and women and their families who depend on them. 
   This body passed overwhelmingly S. 4, a marvelous measure to increase pay and improve pension benefits under the G.I. bill. I was proud to be part of that effort, and we need to make sure that the effort passes the House and is signed into law. 
   It is interesting, as we find ourselves exiting the 20th century and going into the 21st with another situation in the Balkans. Hopefully, we can a avoid the guns of 1999 and move towards a more peaceful resolution of our problems. Hopefully, we have learned some things through the years. But, interestingly enough, we have a new role going into the 21st 
   century and will face very few self-imposed restraints on our actions. Therefore, perhaps more than at any time in our Nation's history, it is imperative that both Congress and the executive branch focus clearly on defining our national interest and developing policies to effectively and appropriately protect and promote those interests. Even with our current unparalleled power and influence, I think it would be wise to heed the words of President Kennedy in 1961. He said about us in this country:  
   And we must face the fact that the United States is neither omnipotent or omniscient, that we are only 6 percent of the world's population, that we cannot impose our will upon the other 94 percent of mankind, that we cannot right every wrong or reverse every adversity, and that therefore there cannot be an American solution to every world problem.  
   Mr. President, I was laying on a beach in Miami getting ready to go to basic training at Fort Benning in the summer of 1963 and heard a marvelous speech on my little transistor radio. I can remember the technology in those days. That was high tech in those days. 
   I remember that President Kennedy spoke at American University on June 10, 1963, in a marvelous address. And he said, ``We don't want a Pax Americana.'' That is not what we want to look for as we enter the 21st century. We don't want a Pax Americana. We don't want America to keep the peace all over the world. It is not our role. It is not our job. And we have to realize that it is not necessarily an American solution to every problem in the world. 
   But the challenge for the post-cold war world for us is to learn from the Jugurthine War that, consistent with our national interests and our values, we ``find a strategy that would determine the appropriate level of force needed to maintain sound and stable foreign policy.'' 
   The post-cold-war world of disorder makes the development of a bipartisan national security consensus especially relevant. We have often said, and really meant, I think, that politics must stop at the water's edge. But we need more now. I believe we need to redouble our efforts to open real dialog here within the Congress and with the administration and with the American people to discuss the fundamental role of America's power in the world as we begin the 21st century. Kosovo challenges us to define that policy now. For the dialog to be meaningful, we must be sure that policymakers, including Members of Congress, have timely and sufficient information to actually allow us to make informed decisions before we get so deeply committed in a military excursion that challenges American credibility. 
   I had a hand last year in working with the wonderful Senator OLYMPIA SNOWE and PAT ROBERTS in some efforts to enact in the last Congress and to seek to require the administration, the President whenever the President committed some 500 troops abroad, or asked for money for a contingency force to be sent somewhere in the world, this requirement that Senator SNOWE and I put together and Senator ROBERTS put together in the appropriations bill and in the authorization bill, requires the administration, when they do those kinds of things, when they make those kinds of commitments, to come before the Congress up front and early and explain why we are committing our forces abroad, what the military application is, and what the exit strategy is. 
   Unfortunately, I am afraid these amendments went by the wayside and we don't have the kind of information up front and 
   early that we need. I will be working with Senator SNOWE and Senator ROBERTS to strengthen our legislation so that the Congress can get in, in terms of military commitment, on the take off as well as a potential crash landing. 
   Let me just say that we need to adhere to the basic dictum of Clausewitz that we must know in terms of military commitment, the last step we are going to take before we take the first step. If I had any one red-letter piece of advice to give our policymakers here in  Washington, that will be it. Let's make sure we fully understand the last step we are going to take before we take the first step. It is so easy to get into war; it is so difficult to get out. 
   There is, obviously, much more to be done in formulating an effective approach to defining the proper guidelines, objectives, and policies for American foreign policy in today's world. We must successfully resolve the debate about NATO's mission statement: Is it going to participate in more offensive operations, or is it going to continue to be a defensive alliance primarily? Are we going to admit more members? Is this a good idea, or a bad idea? 
   The members of NATO are coming to Washington in a few days. I think we ought to engage in that discussion with NATO, because we have to figure in the relationship with our friends and our allies, because those relationships affect our relationship with other countries. 
   Our relationship with Russia, for instance--Russia, for all of its troubles, is still the only nation possessing the means to really threaten our physical security. And China? What about China? China, I think, might pose perhaps the greatest policy challenge to us as we enter the 21st century. 
   Clearly, there is much work to do. But it all starts with the correct articulation of national interests--what is vital to our national interest and what is not, and particularly in terms of the commitment of American young men and women abroad. 
   For all the challenges and difficulties facing us today, I would like for us to consider the other words spoken by President Kennedy in that 1963 address, on June 10, at American University. He spoke during the height of the cold war. President Kennedy put it this way: 
   World peace, like community peace, does not require that each man love his neighbor; it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance, submitting their disputes to a just and peaceful settlement. And history teaches us that enmities between nations, as between individuals, do not last forever. However fixed our likes and dislikes may seem, the tide of time and events will often bring surprising changes in the relations between nations and neighbors. So let us persevere. Peace need not be impracticable and war need not be inevitable. By defining our goal more clearly, by making it seem more manageable and less remote, we can help all peoples to see it, to draw hope from it, and to move irresistibly toward it.  
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am pleased to offer an important piece of legislation designed to address a critical need of Georgia's veterans and their families. 
   One of the greatest honors our country provides for a veteran's service is the opportunity to be buried in a national cemetery. It is logical that a veteran's family would want to have the grave site of their loved one close by. They want to be able to place flowers or a folded American flag by the headstone of their father, mother, sister or brother. Georgia veterans' families deserve such consideration. The establishment of a new veterans national cemetery in the Atlanta metropolitan area is one of my highest legislative priorities. 
   The current veterans population in Georgia is estimated to be nearly 700,000, with over 400,000 residing in the Metro Atlanta area. One state currently has two cemeteries designated specifically for veterans, in Marietta and Andersonville. Marietta National Cemetery has been full since 1970, and Andersonville National Historic Cemetery is located in southwest Georgia, at a considerable distance from most of the states veterans population. 
   The large population of veterans' families in Metro Atlanta and North Georgia is not being served, and we need to change that. Abraham Lincoln once said: `All that a man hath will he give for his life; and while all contribute of their substance the soldier puts his life at stake, and often yields it up in his country's cause. The highest merit, then, is due to the soldier.' 
   We owe it to our veterans to provide a national veterans cemetery close to their home. 
   I have been pursuing this matter for over 20 years, since I was head of the Veterans' Administration, now called the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Nationally, there are over 300,000 vacancies in national cemeteries for veterans, but in Georgia, there are no such vacancies. The only option these veterans have in Andersonville, a national historic cemetery which is operated by the National Parks Service, not the VA, and is more than 100 miles away from the Metro Atlanta area. This deeply concerns me, especially when one considers that Georgia has the highest rate of growth in terms of military retirees in the Nation, and that the majority of these veterans reside in Metro Atlanta. We really must do better for our veterans. 
   In 1979, when I was head of the VA, our studies documented that the Atlanta metropolitan are was the area having the largest veterans population in the country without a national cemetery. Later that same year, I announced that Metro Atlanta had been chosen as the site for a new VA cemetery, which was to be opened in late 1983. The Atlanta location was chosen after an exhaustive review of many  sites, including consideration of environmental, access, and land use factors, and most importantly, the density of veterans population. Unfortunately, the Reagan Administration later withdrew approved of the Atlanta site. Over the years since then, Atlanta has repeatedly been one of the top areas in the United States most in need of an additional national cemetery. 
   Mr. President, the bill I am introducing today is simple. It requires the Department of Veterans Affairs to establish a national cemetery in the Atlanta metropolitan area. It also requires the VA to consult with appropriate federal, state, and local officials to determine the most suitable site. 
   I believe this bill is a necessary first step toward the eventual establishment of a national cemetery to meet the needs of Atlanta's veterans and their families. Admittedly, several factors must be resolved before the cemetery can be established. A site must be found and funding must be made available. However, we must move swiftly to resolve this problem so that a critical element of our commitment to the Nation's veterans can be met. 
   I am hopeful that the Senate will take favorable action on my bill during this Congress. I want to thank my colleague from Georgia, Senator COVERDELL, for joining me in this important effort, and Representative BARR for sponsoring the companion bill in the House of Representatives.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am delighted to have this opportunity to congratulate the Life University Running Eagle Hockey team on their remarkable season. Georgia fans all across the country have had the pleasure of watching this team take its third consecutive American Collegiate Hockey Association Division II National Championship. 
   Head Coach Dan Bouchard has, in only three seasons, led the Life ice hockey team to one national runner-up position in the 1995-96 inaugural year and two division II national titles in the two subsequent years. This season brought the Running Eagles an impeccable record with 20 wins, 1 tie and only 5 losses. Through pool play and the championship round, Life had 5 wins, no losses, and averaged 6 goals a game. 
   Life University is fortunate to have an individual of the caliber of Dan Bouchard coaching their hockey team. Not only are he and his assistant coaches teaching their players hockey skills, but important lessons for life--courage, stamina, tenacity and dedication. Although he has enjoyed great success throughout his coaching career, his achievements go far beyond his great talent in coaching. He was a second round draft pick for the Boston Bruins in the 1970 American Hockey League where he was the co-winner of the Happs Holmes Trophy which honors the top goalie in the AHL. Coach Bouchard moved to the National Hockey League in 1972 where he gained a number of honors. In 1976, he was chosen to play for Team Canada and in 1979 he co-founded the Atlanta Sports Carnival which fund raises for leukemia research at Emory University. I would be hard pressed to enumerate all of his magnificent life achievements and contributions to Life University, the Marrietta community and to all of the athletes whose lives he has touched. 
   In this year's championship game the team quickly jumped ahead with a 4-1 lead in the second period against Michigan State, thus setting the tone for defeat. With a final score of 6-2, they claimed their third national title. The Most Valuable Player award went to the Running Eagles' Mark Brodeur who scored 12 goals and had six assists for a total of 18 points. He led the tournament in scoring. 
   Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing and honoring the dedication and hard work of the athletes and coaches of the Life University Running Eagles. They have displayed their skills and dedication to excellence in hockey throughout this entire season and I extend my best wishes to them and congratulate the Life University Athletic Department on their continued success.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to say a word of gratitude and thanks to the distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia for several observations.  
   First of all, as the war clouds gather in the Balkans, hopefully this Nation and NATO will not be drawn into war. If we are drawn into war, I hope we will, as a country, keep in mind the axiom by Baron von Clausewitz that one must know the last step one takes in terms of war before one takes the first step. That should be fully debated here on the floor of the Senate. 
   The distinguished senior Senator from West Virginia had some wonderful observations about life itself and about spring. 
   I could not help but identify with his wonderful comments about his great granddaughter and his love for tomatoes and the things that grow in the spring. My father has a similar love for vegetable gardens and particularly for Better Boy and Big Boy tomatoes. I was very touched by Senator BYRD's comments about me, and I appreciate his thoughts immensely. 
   The last week or two has been fascinating in my life where I learned some things about my own experience in war that have, in effect, triggered a lot of the emotions of war and, hopefully, will lead to a deeper healing of the wounds I incurred there. 
   The story is in the Hill newspaper, and Senator BYRD was kind enough to enter that into the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD. I thank him personally for that, and it is an honor to be serving with him. He has been one of my personal heroes for many, many years. 
   I wanted to say those words, Mr. President, because we have an incredible human being with us in the Chamber, Senator BYRD, whose light and life continues to guide us all. 
   I yield the floor, Mr. President.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I want to first thank my dear friend and colleague, the distinguished chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Senator HATCH. His dedicated leadership on this important matter is unparalleled and, without it, we would not have been able to gain all of the support we have for this important legislation. I am proud to say that the resolution regarding the flag protection amendment Senator HATCH and I are introducing today has 57 original co-sponsors, and I am hopeful that we will be able to bring this important matter to a final vote in the Senate this year. 
   As I have stated many times before, I am a strong supporter of a Constitutional amendment to prohibit the physical desecration of the United States flag. The amendment we are proposing is simple. It simply vests Congress with the authority to protect the flag through statute. We need not fear that the states will create a hodge-podge of flag protection statutes. Instead, Congress can create one uniform statute for the entire nation. 
   I understand the concerns that others have about the impact on the First Amendment that this bill might have, and as a veteran who risked his life in Vietnam to protect the principles of freedoms that Americans hold sacred, I am a strong supporter of the First Amendment. However, I believe that an amendment to protect the flag is an acceptable limitation in order to protect the most sacred of American symbols. I strongly believe that the societal interest in preserving the symbolic value of the flag outweighs the interest in an individual choosing to physically desecrate the flag. The flag unites Americans as no symbol can. The flag is sacred. Those who would desecrate the flag would desecrate America and the freedoms that we hold inviolate. 
   I cannot presume to know the importance of the American flag for each individual American. But I can say without doubt, that it is the only unifying symbol that the vast diversity of this great nation has. No matter one's age, religion, culture, ethnicity, race, or gender--every American is represented by the United States flag and the flag undoubtedly bonds Americans together. 
   The tradition of the flag goes back to this country's birth. Indeed, it even inspired our national anthem. Until the Supreme Court struck down a state flag protection law in Texas versus Johnson in 1989, there have always been state and federal laws protecting the flag from acts of physical desecration. In fact, flag protection can be traced back to our founding fathers who strongly supported the government's protection of the flag. James Madison and Thomas Jefferson, who were instrumental in framing the Constitution, recognized that protecting the flag and preserving the First Amendment were consistent. They often spoke out against desecration of the flag and sought to protect the sovereignty interest in the flag. Both Madison and Jefferson considered that a defacement of the flag should be a violation of the law. In fact, Jefferson believed that such a violation should invoke a ``systematic and severe'' course of punishment for persons who violated the flag. 
   I do not profess to be a constitutional scholar. But I, like many Americans, do not agree with the Supreme Court's ruling in Texas v. Johnson, and United States v. Eichman which struck down  statutes protecting the United States flag as unconstitutional violations of the First Amendment right to free speech. I respect the wisdom of the Justices of the Supreme Court, yet I was saddened that we no longer were able to rely upon statutory authority to protect the flag. 
   I was especially saddened in light of the views expressed by some of the most learned scholars in American jurisprudence. Several Supreme Court Justices over the years have issued opinions recognizing the importance of protection of the flag, including Justices Harlan, Warren, Fortas, Black, White, Rehnquist, Blackmun, Stevens, and O'Connor. These Justices have each supported the view that nothing in the Constitution prohibits the states or the federal government from protecting the flag. Perhaps Chief Justice Rehnquist explained it best in his dissent in Texas versus Johnson which was joined by Justices O'Connor and White, when he said:  
   [t]he American flag.......throughout more than 200 years of our history, has come to be the visible symbol embodying our Nation. It does not represent the views of any particular political party, and it does not represent any particular political philosophy. The flag is not simply another `idea' or `point of view' competing for recognition in the marketplace of ideas. Millions and millions of Americans regard it with an almost mystical reverence regardless of what sort of social, political, or philosophical beliefs they may have. I cannot agree that the First Amendment invalidates the Act of Congress, and the laws of 48 of the 50 States, which make criminal the public burning of the flag. 
   Nonetheless, the current Supreme Court view stands. That is what brings us here today. In an attempt to protect the flag, Congress has been forced to enact a constitutional amendment. The House has twice overwhelmingly passed resolutions that would begin the formal process of amending the Constitution to protect the flag. Unfortunately, it has been the Senate that has blocked these efforts. However, the vote has always been close in the Senate and I am hopeful that we will succeed this year. 
   The will of the people in this matter is clear. The polls continue to show that more than 80 percent of the American people believe that Congress should act to protect the flag and that it is worth amending the Constitution to do so. The Supreme Court decision in Texas versus Johnson in effect invalidated the laws in 48 states and the District of Columbia that prohibited flag desecration. Since the Supreme Court's decision, 49 of the 50 State legislatures have adopted resolutions asking Congress to send the flag protection amendment to the States for ratification. I believe we ought to let the American people decide. Therefore, I lend my full support to efforts to send this initiative back to the States and American people for ratification. 
   Although support for government action to protect the United States flag comes from all sectors of the American public, I have been particularly moved by the voices of our veterans who have fought and died to defend the freedoms guaranteed to all Americans in the Constitution. The U.S. flag is a manifestation of those freedoms and holds particular significance to those who have risked their lives to protect this country and the flag which embodies them. In fact, in many cases the U.S. has presented the Medal of Honor to veterans for their uncommon valor in protecting the flag in times of war. As Justice Stevens said in his dissenting opinion in Texas versus Johnson:  
   The freedom and ideals of liberty and ideals of liberty, equality and tolerance that the flag symbolizes and embodies have motivated our nation's leaders, soldiers, and activists to pledge their lives, their liberty and their honor in defense of their country. Because our history has demonstrated that these values and ideals are worth fighting for, the flag which uniquely symbolizes their power is itself worthy of protection from physical desecration.  
   The military has always used the flag to honor those who fought and died to protect our freedoms. We honor the members of our armed forces by draping a flag over the coffin of a slain soldier, placing a flag near a soldier's grave, or displaying a flag on Memorial Day and Veterans' Day. To permit people to physically desecrate the flag diminishes the honor we bestow upon them and tarnishes its value and the brave service of those individuals who fought to defend it. 
   As Chief Justice Harlan once said, ``love both of the common country and of the State will diminish in proportion as respect for the flag is weakened.'' Perhaps my colleagues who do not agree with me upon this issue will believe that I have overly dramatized the meaning of the flag, but for me personally, who fought to defend the principles of freedom we hold sacred, the protection of the flag which represents them cannot be ignored. I believe we must use this opportunity to show the world that we reaffirm our commitment to the ideals the flag stands for and what so many Americans fought for.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, today I am addressing the Senate to express my view on the importance of maintaining a regulatory system that has resulted in a renaissance of the nation's rail freight railroads, which are so critical to the economic vitality of my state of Georgia. 
   In Georgia, we depend heavily on railroads to bring us raw materials and to carry our finished goods to market. Two major railroads, CSX and Norfolk Southern, operate more than 3,500 miles of rail line in Georgia, and service is provided over more than 1,000 miles of track by regional and local railroads. More than 3 million carloads of such commodities as coal, minerals, and pulp and paper are carried through Georgia every year, and more than 6,000 Georgians are directly employed in the rail industry. 
   The importance of railroads in my state reaches much deeper than the customers they serve and the citizens they employ, however. As a member of the Small Business Committee, I am particularly aware of the numerous small businesses throughout my state--including hundreds of logging and sawmill operations that produce crossties--which depend for their livelihood on railroads having the financial resources to undertake infrastructure maintenance and improvements. If the railroads do not have the resources for that investment, these small businesses--as well as rail shippers and employees--will suffer. 
   This financial strength has not always been there. Indeed, the rail industry has undergone a remarkable resurgence from the late 1970s, when much of the industry was in bankruptcy and facing nationalization. The foundation of this resurgence has been the statutory changes made under the Staggers Rail Act of 1980. This bipartisan legislation lifted much of the regulatory burden that was stifling the industry, and permitted the railroads to compete in the marketplace for business, make contracts with customers, and use differential pricing to support the enormous capital investment they require for safe, efficient operations. These are basic activities engaged in by businesses across the nation, activities which had been denied the railroads for nearly a century. 
   The results have been little short of amazing. A moribund industry has come back to life, investing $225 billion in its infrastructure, and providing good jobs to a quarter of a million employees. And, while the industry has had capacity constraints and other difficulties in some areas in providing the high level of service customers deserve, I believe the industry is committed to making needed investments and working with its customers to do better. 
   Despite the rail industry's gains, there are current efforts to turn back the clock and reimpose some of the destructive regulatory interventions which in the past hindered the railroads' ability to operate efficiently and price their services competitively. If we do so, we will be heading right back from where we have come: inefficient, poorly-performing railroads that were not dependable carriers of goods. We cannot afford that, if our nation's businesses are to grow and remain globally competitive. 
   Reauthorizing the Surface Transportation Board (STB), which administers the statute regulating the industry, is an important goal of the Senate Commerce Committee, and it is an objective that I endorse. Only by having a stable regulatory agency in place, can we ensure the continued application of the law in a balanced manner that takes into account the need to enable the railroads to earn enough to maintain their infrastructure, while ensuring fair rates for shippers. Indeed, the railroads are one of the most capital intensive industries in our nation, and despite their increased viability, they still fall short of the capital necessary to sustain and improve their plant and equipment. I support the current economic regulatory regime that has served the nation well by sparking this rail rebirth. At the same time, I intend to carefully evaluate issues brought to the Committee's attention by rail labor organizations as this review goes forward.  
   We must ensure that our railroads can operate in ways that allow them to maximize their growth and earn a sufficient rate of return. Our shippers and the businesses that supply the rail industry need dependable, economically sound carriers to transport their goods and to buy their products. Rail employees need a safe, fair and efficient system in which to work. These are mutually interdependent objectives, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to achieve sound policy determinations that satisfy these objectives.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge and salute the Georgia Historical Society, which on March 20, 1999 will celebrate 160 years of collecting and preserving our rich history for all Georgians. 
   The Georgia Historical Society was chartered in 1839 by the Georgia General Assembly and currently has more than 5,000 members from all across Georgia and the entire nation. As a non-profit organization, the Society remains the oldest cultural institution in the State of Georgia and is one of the oldest organizations in our country. For sixteen decades the Society has collected, preserved and shared Georgia's rich history with many Georgians through various educational outreach programs and research services. 
   The Georgia Historical Society's archives and library are operated in cooperation with the office of Georgia's Secretary of State. During my years as Secretary of State I relied on the Georgia Historical Society on numerous occasions for valuable information concerning our State's history, and I truly believe that the Society is a real treasure that all of us should use and enjoy.  The Society has the most extensive collection in the country of manuscripts, books, maps, photographs, newspapers, architectural drawings, portraits and artifacts related to Georgia's history that date back to the founding of the Colony and continue through the twentieth century. 
   The Georgia Historical Society stays in close contact with the citizens it serves so well. Since the founding of the Colony of Georgia at Savannah on February 12, 1733 by James Edward Oglethorpe, Georgians have celebrated this historical date. This year the Georgia Historical Society and the Savannah-Chatham County Public Schools continued this tradition by organizing and hosting the Georgia Heritage Celebration on Thursday, February 12, 1999. As part of the Celebration the Society honors Georgians who have made a positive impact on the state. This year's honoree was Peter Tonedd, who was a master carpenter and tavern owner. Previous honorees have included James Jackson, Revolutionary War hero, U.S. Representative, U.S. Senator and Governor of Georgia; Mary Telfair, philanthropist in the arts and medicine; Abraham Baldwin, signer of the Declaration of Independence; Juliette G. Low, Founder of the Girl Scouts; Andrew Bryan, a Baptist minister; and James Oglethorpe. 
   The Society also holds monthly lectures on a wide variety of historical topics and yearly conferences focusing on local communities, and conducts special tours at various historical locations across Georgia. The Georgia Historical Society also publishes books and a quarterly news magazine, Footnotes, on Georgia's history and genealogy, as well as The Georgia Historical Quarterly, a journal on Georgia's history that was established in 1917. 
   I would especially like to commend the Georgia Historical Society for diligently working on behalf of all Georgians in the historical preservation of our State's history. The Society provides a vast collection of records and artifacts to thousands of researchers and genealogists from around the world. 
   I applaud the Georgia Historical Society for preserving and teaching our State's history. We must not allow the pride and glory of our State and our Nation to be forgotten--it must be celebrated by all. The benefits of enriching the people of Georgia by promoting a better understanding of our past and who we are as Georgians must not be ignored. 
   Mr. President, I ask that you and my colleagues join me in recognizing and honoring the dedication and hard work of the Georgia Historical Society during the past 160 years. The efforts put forth by the Society have preserved and will continue to preserve our rich history by ensuring a future for Georgia's past.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill to rename the National School Lunch Act after Senator Richard Russell. I am pleased to have Senator COVERDELL as a original co-sponsor. 
   Having met Senator Russell over 30 years ago when I was an intern on Capitol Hill, I gained a deep respect and reverence for the ``Senator from Georgia'' Richard B. Russell. Since being elected to the Senate over two years ago, I have been looking for a way to appropriately honor and express my appreciation for the contributions of Senator Russell. Honestly, I, like many others, usually associate Senator Russell with military issues and the work he did to provide our nation with a strong national defense. However, in researching his history in the Senate, I noticed that, time and again, Senator Russell stated that he viewed his proudest achievement in the Senate as the School Lunch Act.  
   On February 26, 1946, speaking on the Senate floor, Senator Russell noted that the School Lunch Program, ``has been one of the most helpful ones which has been inaugurated and promises to contribute more to the cause of public education in these United States than has any other policy which has been adopted since the creation of free public schools.'' Strong words, not only about the school lunch program, but about Senator Russell's commitment to the same. 
   Starting the first grade in 1947, I, like some of you, have always considered myself to be a true product of the national school lunch program. The program has been woven into the fabric of the American family. Today, the National School Lunch Program operates in more than 95,000 public and nonprofit private schools and residential child care institutions throughout the country, providing nutritionally balanced, low-cost or free lunches to more than 26 million children each school day. The knowledge that every one of our children is ensured a healthy and affordable meal every school day provides us all with a great deal of comfort and satisfaction. The program is available in almost 99 percent of all public schools, and in many private schools as well. About 92 percent of all students nationwide have access to meals through the National School Lunch Program. As cited in several studies, a well fed child is more likely to do better in school and is less likely to misbehave--both highly desirable outcomes. 
   Senator Russell was a tireless champion for establishing a program to deliver a healthy meal to our nation's schoolchildren. Senator Russell began his campaign to make school feeding programs available in the mid 1930's by utilizing Section 32 funds of the Act of August 24, 1935. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Agricultural Appropriations, Senator Russell exerted a great deal of influence and was a vigilant advocate of directing the Section 32 food surpluses towards school feeding programs. In the early 1940's, Senator Russell introduced several bills authorizing a national school lunch program. And, after several unsuccessful attempts, Senator Russell sponsored and pushed through the National School Lunch Act in 1946. 
   Senator Russell's strong commitment to domestic agriculture production strengthened his support for the school feeding programs. In fact, Senator Russell's commitment to a strong national defense may have also played a role in his support for the program. As you know, Senator Russell served as a member, and later Chairman, of the Senate Armed Services Committee. During World War II and in post war hearings before the Armed Services Committee, testimony was provided by General Hershey and Surgeon General Parran and others indicating that a large percentage of men rejected from military service had diet-related health problems. This revelation resulted in the recognition by many that the school lunch program is a matter of national security. 
   As stated in a report I received from the Congressional Research Service, ``Senator Russell played a key role in the creation and formation of the national school lunch program. The historical record of Senator Russell's actions on behalf of this program in the 1930's and 1940's give him a strong claim to being regarded as the ``father'' of the national school lunch program, and make a strong case for renaming the 1946 Act after him.'' There have most certainly been several other members from the House and Senate, both past and present, who have played an irreplaceable role in developing and championing the cause of the school lunch program and I believe that all of these members should be commended for their dedication. This proposal is not meant to diminish the contribution of countless others, but simply to recognize that Senator Russell played a primary role in the passage of the National School Lunch Act. I am convinced that no other member was as significant as Senator Russell in seeing the National School Lunch Act enacted into law. I am pleased to have received the strong endorsement of the Georgia School Food Service Association in their Resolution of support on January 23, 1999. 
   Considering Senator Russell's vital role in making the school lunch program a reality and the passion he expressed for being its author, I believe that by renaming the School Lunch Act in his honor, we can fittingly memorialize his contribution, as well as call renewed attention to this vital national program. I ask for my colleagues support.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President. I rise today to address the important issue of campaign finance reform. As we begin the 106th Congress, campaign finance reform continues to be an important national need. Therefore, I am again introducing my Federal Election Enforcement And Disclosure Reform Act with the hope that this will be the year that Congress makes positive strides towards meaningful reform.  
   After participating in the Governmental Affairs Committee's extensive 1997 campaign finance hearings, it was apparent to me that there is a critical need for reform of our entire campaign finance system. What I witnessed, heard and read made me even more convinced that we must strengthen our campaign financing laws, and provide strong enforcement through the Federal Election Commission of these laws, or risk seeing our election process be swept away in a tidal wave of money. In spite of public support, and positive action in the House, the Senate failed last year to enact meaningful legislation addressing these problems, and we have now gone through yet another election cycle in which the abuses continued to persist. With the record high of $1 billion spent in pursuit of federal office in 1996--a 73 percent increase since 1992, I had hoped that the 1998 election would at least reflect a natural decline from the grossly inflated figures. However, post-election reports filed with the FEC show that spending in Senate general election campaigns went from $220.8 million in 1996, to $244.3 in 1998, an 11% increase. It has been estimated that if these trends continue, by 2025 it will take $145 million to finance an average Senate campaign. This absurd trend cannot continue. 
   Although the Senate failed last year to enact meaningful reform, I am hopeful that, with a new Congress, we will take up this important issue in earnest. The legislation I am re-introducing today, the Federal Election Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act, addresses one of the most serious problems with our current system, the inability of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to adequately enforce our existing campaign laws. I recently read a compelling article entitled ``No Cop on the Beat,'' which appeared in the January 23, 1999 issue of the National Journal. The author, Eliza Newlin Carney, perhaps summarizes best the current judgment on the effectiveness of the FEC when she states that ``[a] long-standing joke around town is that the commission is a government success story: It is precisely the weak and ineffective agency that Congress intended it to be.'' 
   The article was written following a December 1998 FEC hearing on the 1996 elections during which FEC auditors alleged that the national campaign committees of both major parties violated campaign finance rules with respect to broadcast advertising. Although party leaders maintained that the advertisements in question were legitimate ``issue'' ads appropriately paid for by millions of dollars in ``soft'' money, based on their investigation, the FEC auditors alleged that they were illegal ads which caused both major party Presidential campaigns to exceed the federal spending limit and, more importantly, allowed both campaigns to ``essentially bilk ..... the federal Treasury out of no less than $25 million.'' The auditors recommended that the campaigns repay the money. However, the commissioners unanimously rejected these recommendations and refused to specifically address the alleged grievous violations of federal campaign laws. 
   Although the author of the National Journal piece is very critical of the enforcement system, her criticism correctly does not end with the FEC. ``[T]he FEC isn't the only cop that seems to have deserted the beat.'' According to the author, the FEC's refusal to enforce the campaign regulations has also had a chilling effect on the Justice Department's willingness to complete thorough investigations of the abuses in the 1996 election cycle. Furthermore, she points out that last year Congress again failed to enact new campaign finance laws to help correct the problems. She concludes by mentioning the movement by some politicians to totally deregulate the system--``By default, the no-holds-barred camp seems to be winning. Their deregulation model is starting to look an awful lot like the system we have today.'' 
   As we can see in the preliminary preparations already underway, the 2000 election cycle is likely to be heading in the same direction and I believe that this is the optimal time for us to act in order to prevent such abuses. Although my bill will not address all of the campaign finance system problems, it will revitalize the Federal Election Commission to enable it to more effectively enforce current campaign finance laws, and to close some loopholes in current campaign disclosure requirements in order to provide the American people with more comprehensive and more timely information on campaign finances. 
   As I made clear last year, I do not intend my legislation to fix all of the problems with the campaign finance system. It is my understanding that Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD also intend to re-introduce their important legislation, which I intend to again co-sponsor. I continue to believe that enactment of McCain-Feingold or similar legislation is an essential step for the Senate to take this year in beginning the process of repairing a campaign finance system which is totally out of control. Banning soft money and imposing disclosure and contribution requirements on sham issue ads aired close to an election, as provided for under McCain-Feingold, are absolutely vital reforms, without which the campaign finance system will only grow less accountable, and more vulnerable to the appearance, if not the fact, of undue influence by big money. 
   However, I want to broaden the scope of debate, and to begin the process of seeking common ground on important reforms which go beyond the problems of soft money and issue ads. As previously discussed, one of the most glaring deficiencies in our current federal campaign system is the ineffectiveness of its supposed referee, the Federal Election Commission. The FEC, whether by design or through circumstance, has been beset by partisan gridlock, uncertain and insufficient resources, and lengthy proceedings which offer no hope of timely resolution of charges of campaign violations. 
   Thus, the first major element of my bill is to strengthen the ability of the Federal Election Commission to be an effective and impartial enforcer of federal campaign laws. Among the most significant FEC-related changes I am proposing are the following: 
   Alter the Commission structure to remove the possibility of partisan gridlock by establishing a 7-member Commission, appointed by the President based on qualifications, for single 7-year terms. The Commission would be composed of two Republicans, two Democrats, one third party member, and two members nominated by the Supreme Court. 
   Give the FEC independent litigating authority, including before the Supreme Court, and establish a right of private civil action to seek court enforcement in cases where the FEC fails to act, both of which should dramatically improve the prospects for timely enforcement of the law. 
   Provide sufficient funding of the FEC from a source independent of Congressional intervention by the imposition of filing fees on federal candidates, with such fees being adequate to meet the needs of the Commission--estimated to be $50 million a year. 
   A second major component of the Federal Election Enforcement and Disclosure Reform Act is to create a new Advisory Committee on Federal Campaign Reform to provide for a body outside of Congress to continually review and recommend changes in our federal campaign system. The Committee would be charged, ``to study the laws (including regulations) that affect how election campaigns for Federal office are conducted and the implementation of such laws and may make recommendations for change,'' which are to be submitted to Congress by April 15 of every odd-numbered year. As with the FEC, the Advisory Committee would receive independent and sufficient funding via the new federal candidate filing fees. 
   The impetus for the Advisory Committee is two-fold: (1) to build a ``continuous improvement'' mechanism into the Federal campaign system, and (2) to address the demonstrable fact that Congress responds slowly, if at all, to the need for changes and updates in our campaign laws. In both instances, the conclusion is the same: we cannot afford to wait twenty-five years or until a major scandal develops to adapt our campaign finance system to changing circumstances. 
   The final section of my bill seeks to enhance the effectiveness of campaign  contribution disclosure requirements. As Justice Brandeis observed, ``Publicity is justly commended as a remedy for social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants; electric light the most effective policeman.'' This is certainly true in the realm of campaign finance, and perhaps the most enduring legacy of the Watergate Reforms of a quarter-century ago is the expanded campaign and financial disclosure requirements which emerged. By and large, they have served us well, but as with everything else, they need to be periodically reviewed and updated in light of experience. Therefore, based in part on testimony I heard during the 1997 Governmental Affairs Committee investigation and in part on the FEC's own recommendations for improved disclosure, my bill will make several changes in current disclosure requirements. 
   Specifically, I am recommending two reforms which will make it more difficult for contributors and campaigns alike to turn a blind eye to current disclosure requirements by, first, preventing a campaign from depositing a contribution until all of the requisite disclosure information is provided; and second, requiring those who contribute $200 or more to provide a signed certification that their contribution is not from a foreign national, and is not the result of a contribution in the name of another person. 
   In addition, my legislation adopts a number of disclosure recommendations made by the FEC in its 1997 report to Congress, including provisions: requiring all reports to be filed by the due date of the report; requiring all authorized candidate committee reports to be filed on a campaign-to-date basis, rather than on a calendar year cycle; and mandating monthly reporting for multi candidate committees which have raised or spent, or anticipate raising or spending, in excess of $100,000 in the current election cycle. 
   It is easy to be pessimistic when considering campaign finance reform efforts especially after last year's inaction by the Senate. The public and the media are certainly expecting Congress to fail to take significant action to clean up the scandalous campaign system under which we now run. But ladies and gentlemen of the Senate, I suggest that we cannot afford the luxury of complacency. We may think we will be able to win the next re-election because the level of outrage and the awareness of the extent of the vulnerability of our political system have perhaps not yet reached critical mass. But I am confident that it is only a matter of time, and perhaps the next election cycle--which will undoubtedly feature more unaccountable soft money, more sham issue ads of unknown parentage, more circumvention of the spirit and in some cases the letter of current campaign finance law--before the scales are decisively tilted in favor of reform. 
   We will have campaign finance reform. The only question is whether this Congress will step up to the plate, and fulfill its responsibilities, to give the American people a campaign system they can have faith in and which can preserve and protect our noble democracy as we enter a new century.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, last week, after more than two years of negotiations, an agreement was finally reached to release funding for land acquisition on Cumberland Island National Seashore. Located off the coast of Georgia, Cumberland provides a unique experience for visitors by enabling them to view seemingly endless undeveloped beaches and dunes in pristine condition. The beautiful coastline is contrasted by marshes and vast forests of mixed hardwoods. The natural environment plays a critical role in habitat protection for several threatened and endangered species including the bald eagle, the loggerhead sea turtle and the manatee. 
   The Island also allows individuals to visit the incredible cultural and historical remnants which exist on the Island. The remarkable history of the island indicates human habitation dating back thousands of years. First occupied by the Spanish in the early days of the colonial period, the island was eventually claimed by the English in the mid-1700s. Cumberland also has historical connections to the Revolutionary and Civil Wars. One unique historical reference to the island--brought to my attention by the Senate's own resident historian, the distinguished Senior Senator from West Virginia, relays the story that after his duel with Alexander Hamilton on July 11, 1804, Aaron Burr fled to Cumberland Island in exile--only to eventually leave after being snubbed by the island residents. 
   With this agreement, we have not only preserved the Island in accordance with its designation as a National Seashore, but we have taken the critical steps necessary to restore and maintain the historic and cultural resources on Cumberland which had been seriously neglected for several years. The agreement also provides additional access to individuals wishing to visit the historic resources on the island. By releasing the monies for the land purchase and implementing these changes, we will be making the ultimate benefactors the future generations of Americans who will have the opportunity to experience the natural and historical treasures possessed by Cumberland Island. 
   I would like to take a moment to publicly recognize and express my sincere appreciation to Don Barger, Southeast Regional Director of the National Parks and Conservation Association (NPCA), for his assistance in resolving the issues on Cumberland Island National Seashore. Don has been with NPCA since 1992. Having once climbed Mount Rainier, Don transfers this same motivation and dedication to his work. He is an avid and passionate defender of preserving and protecting our National Park System. 
   Don played a vital role in crafting the Cumberland agreement by actively engaging and compromising with numerous interested stakeholders while at the same time fulfilling his duty to preserve the integrity of the Wilderness Act and the National Park System. His tireless effort and willingness to commit his time, energy and enthusiasm to this process reflect well upon him and on the National Parks and Conservation Association. 
   I would like to pay special thanks to Tavia McCuean, Georgia State Director of The Nature Conservancy, who vigilantly pursued the critical land acquisition funds for Cumberland. The Cumberland agreement would not have been possible without the generous commitment of The Conservancy to contribute $6 million for the land purchase. 
   There were certainly several occasions over the past two years in which Tavia and The Nature Conservancy could have lost all patience as repeated efforts to obtain the land acquisition funds were blocked. However, Tavia tirelessly and patiently focused her energy and that of her dedicated staff towards securing the release of these funds. Future generations visiting Cumberland Island will owe a great debt of gratitude for this experience to the efforts of Tavia McCuean and The Nature Conservancy. 
   President Theodore Roosevelt once said, ``The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired, in value.'' Both Tavia McCuean and Don Barger have done well in upholding this doctrine and truly represent the best of public spiritedness.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am proud to offer this amendment to S. 4, with my colleagues Senator JEFFORDS, Senator BINGAMAN, and Senator LANDRIEU, to give the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. 
   Members of the Guard and Reserve have been participating at record levels. Nearly 270,000 Reservists and Guardsmen were mobilized during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. Over 17,000 have answered the Nation's call to bring peace to Bosina. Members of the Guard and Reserve have delivered millions of pounds of humanitarian aid all over the world. And, closer to home, they have responded to numerous state and federal emergencies. Thousands of Reservists and Guardsmen are serving in communities across the country and around the world every day. 
   I firmly believe we should recognize the contributions the Guard and Reserve have made to our defense efforts over the years. 
   We should recognize those contributions by extending to members of the Guard and Reserve the same savings opportunity we are offering their active duty counterparts under S. 4. The Guard and Reserve are an integral part of our national defense strategy. We can't afford to overlook them.

Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to have this opportunity with my colleagues, Senators WARNER, LEVIN, ALLARD, and others--to support S. 4, The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. I strongly agree that this bill represents an excellent step toward providing the men and women of the military a clear signal that we the people of the United States and we the  members of the Congress of the United States value their contributions, understand their needs and concerns, and understand our obligations to provide for those who have answered the calling to defend our Nation. 
   The signal that we send to the people in the military and to the people of the United States should be one of hope and opportunity, and one that understands the critical needs of military members and their families. Twenty-five years ago Americans opted to end the draft and to establish an all-volunteer military force to provide for our national security. That policy carried with it a requirement that we invest the needed resources to bring into existence a competent and professional military. Currently, all services are having various but alarming difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified individuals. Seasoned, well-qualified personnel are leaving in disturbing numbers. Specifically, the Navy is not making its recruiting goals. The Army cites pay and retirement, and overall quality of life as three of the top four reasons soldiers are leaving. For the first time the Air Force is not expecting to make its re-enlistment goals, and the Air Force is currently 850 pilots short. The Marine Corps is hampered by inadequate funding of the pay and retirement and quality of life accounts in meeting its readiness and modernizing needs. All services, including the Guard and Reserve Components, are experiencing similar recruiting and retention problems. These shortfalls must be addressed if our Nation is to continue to have a highly capable, cutting edge military force. 
   In fact, if we do not address these critical needs correctly, we may well have missed our chance to properly provide for our National Defense in the 21st Century. 
   In light of our recent successful operations around the world, in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that we continue to recruit, train and retain the best of America to serve in our armed forces, which is the goal of this legislation. Equally important, this bill, for the first time in a long time, addresses the immediate family members of our brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 addresses the concerns of Secretary of Defense Cohen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress regarding recruiting a strong, viable military force for the 21st Century. It also significantly assists in retaining the right military personnel for the 21st Century. If we fail today to address these key issues, now when we have the combination of a strong economy, a relatively positive budget outlook, and a world which is largely at peace, we may well have missed a key window of opportunity. The bill we are introducing today goes a long way toward eliminating the deficiencies that we all have recently heard so much about from the Chiefs and a myriad of experts who are greatly concerned about the readiness of our military force, especially as we look a few years ahead. 
   Military experts, defense journalists, former Secretaries of Defense, former Service Chiefs, former theater Commanders in Chief, research and development specialists and even civilian industry leaders agree: the number one factor undergirding our superpower military status is the people of our Armed Forces. This critical ingredient means something different today than it did on the beaches of Normandy, in the jungles of Vietnam, or in fact even on the deserts of Kuwait. Today, the people of our miltiary are as dedicated, as committed, as patriotic as any force we have ever fielded. They are, in fact, smarter, better trained, and more technically adept than any who we have ever 
   counted upon to defend our Nation. Operation Desert Fox proved this fact. This flawless, but dangerous and stressful, operations involved 40,000 troops from bases virtually around the world. Over 40 ships performed around the clock strikes and support. Six hundred aircraft sorties were flown in four days, and over 300 of these were night strike operations. This massive efforts was carried out without a single loss of American or British life. And, this is but one operation that our military (active and reserve) are successfully conducting worldwide. 
   In contrast to this and other post-Vietnam successes, consider the problems which face the people in uniform. New global security threats and our strong economy each exert enormous pressures on the people in the military and their families. By some measures the pay for our military personnel lags 13 percent behind the civilian pay raises over the last 20 years. Yet, we ask our military to train on highly technical equipment, to commit themselves in harm's way, to leave their families, and to execute flawless operations. Sometimes these operations are new and different from any past military operations, but they can be just as dangerous. Meanwhile, some of our service members qualify for food stamps, do not have the same educational opportunities as their civilian counterparts, must deal with confusing and changing health benefits and/or can not find affordable housing. Something is badly wrong with this picture, and the Congress and the administration must work together to set things right. 
   Specifically, we need to recruit good people, continue to train them, and retain them in the military. This is difficult at best with the changes in our society, the rapidly changing threats to our security, and a prosperous economy. As I heard a service member say during a hearing I held at Fort Gordon, GA, last year, we recruit an individual, but we retain a family. 
   Some of the recruiting and retention problems of today's United States military are well documented. Others need to be more thoroughly explored. They all need to be addressed. The Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's, and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999 is but the first step. It is the beginning. I caution my colleagues that today's servicemen and women, and their families, are intelligent and are quick to recognize duplicity in the words and actions of our civilian and military leadership. Our military's most important assets--its people--are leaving the military, and many of America's best are not even considering joining the military. We must proceed expeditiously, with firm purpose and unified non-partisanship if we are to reverse these dangerous trends. 
   We must act now, but we must consider the time proven process of the United States Senate. We need to make sure that we have the proper hearings and discussions within the proper framework before we over-react to the critical needs facing our military Services. 
   This bill responds to current data which provide some insight into how we can more effectively respond to today's youth and their service in the military. This 106th Congress has a tremendous opportunity to respond to today's military personnel problems. We must keep our focus on current and future personnel issues, including recognizing and responding to the need to retain a family. This legislation is only a start. 
   Mr. President, the bill includes all three parts of the Department of Defense's proposed pay and retirement package. It incorporates some of the recommendations made by the congressionally mandated Principi Commission, and it provides some additional innovative ideas for addressing these key personnel issues, now and into the future. 
   First, the bill provides a 4.8 percent pay raise across the board for all military 
   members, effective January 1, 2000, and carries out the stated objective of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of bringing military pay more in line with private sector wages. This increase raises military pay in FY2000 by one-half a percentage point above the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI), and represents the largest increase in military pay since 1982. This plan would provide for future annual increase in military pay of one-half percent above the annual increase in the ECI. Although I believe we should support the Department of Defense on this issue, of providing one-half percent above annual increase in the ECI for FY2000 to FY2005, our chairman and others have chose to provide more. 
   Another of the Joint Chiefs' recommendations included in our legislation is the targeted pay raise for mid-grade officers and enlisted personnel, and also for key promotion points. These raises, amounting to between 4.8 percent and 10.3 percent, which includes the January 1, 2000, pay raise  and would be effective July 1, 2000. This is a powerful retention tool for our Service Secretaries. 
   The third part of our legislation is a revision in the Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986, which would provide an option at 15 years of service for a service member to return to the pre-Redux retirement system (50 percent basic pay benefit for military members who retire at 20 years of service) or to elect to receive $30,000 bonus and remain in the Redux retirement. 
   I am proud to say that in addition to the pay and retirement benefits package proposed by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs, our legislation includes several key recommendations from the recent report of the Congressional Commission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, also known as the Principi Commission. These provisions are specifically designed to assist the military services in their recruiting and retention efforts. 
   Information and data that we are seeing indicate that education benefits are an essential component in attracting young people to enter the armed services. This may be the single most important step this Congress can take in assisting recruitment. Improvements in the Montgomery GI Bill are needed, and our bill represents a vital move in that direction. 
   In keeping with the Principi Commission, our legislation would increase the basic GI Bill benefit from $528 to $600 per month and eliminate the current requirement for entering service members to contribute $1,200 of their own money in order to participate in the program. These changes should dramatically increase the attractiveness of the GI Bill to potential recruits, and give our Service Secretaries a powerful recruiting incentive. 
   This legislation also adopts the Principi Commission recommendations to allow service members to transfer their earned GI Bill benefits to one or more immediate family members. Mr. President, this idea is innovative, it is powerful and it sends the right message to both those young people we are trying to attract into the military and those we are trying to retain. CBO estimates that in the long run over 500,000 children of members or former members would use the educational assistance each year but that level would not be reached until about 2013. It is important that we continue to act on this piece of legislation. History tells us that these chances come only once, and this Nation changed drastically under the original GI Bill, and now we have the chance to address future issues with this education piece of this legislation. 
   This legislation includes a provision that would allow military members to participate in the current Thrift Savings Plan available to Federal civil 
   servants. Under this proposal, which adopts another recommendation of the Congressional Commission on Service Members and Veterans Transition Assistance, military members would be permitted to contribute up to 5 percent of their basic pay, and all or any part of any enlistment or reenlistment bonus, to the Thrift Savings Plan. 
   Mr. President, based on our initial estimates, it is my understanding that the provisions contained in this legislation will not require us to increase the funding for national defense above the levels in the President's FY2000-2006 Future Years Defense Plan. However, more precise costing will have to be done by the Congressional Budget Office over the next several weeks. 
   I know that all Members of the United States Senate are committed to the well-being of our service men and women and their families. They are doing their duty with honor and dignity. They are serving our country around the globe. They, along with their families, deserve our commitment. The bill we are introducing today is fair and will ensure that we continue to attract and retain high quality people to serve in our armed forces. It represents the beginning of a process to provide hope and opportunity to those who wear the uniform of our Services. The President has announced a very good plan, as has the distinguished majority leader. We must move forward, together, in addressing these important personnel and readiness issues. 
   In closing, I want to recognize the leadership of Senator WARNER, and Senator LEVIN, and the other members of the Armed Services Committee who are cosponsoring this legislation. We are all absolutely committed to the welfare of our service men and women and their families. They provide for us, and it is time for us to provide our obligation to them. I look forward to working with Senator LEVIN, Chairman WARNER, and all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in the months ahead so that we can honor those who have honored us.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am pleased to bring before the Senate my amendment to S. 4, the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999, which would extend key bonuses and special payments to the men and women of our armed forces for another three years. 
   Mr. President, the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Service Secretaries have all testified and stated for the record that recruiting and retention are the most important challenges facing our military today. 
   With a strong economy and the perception of a reduced military threat abroad, the incentives to leave the military, or to not enlist in the military, are greater than ever before. However, even with the end of the cold war, we have increased our military commitments around the world, in such places as Bosnia, Iraq, and Somalia. We are now facing a possible use of American forces in Kosovo. Those brave individuals, who are preparing to respond to our Nation's call deserve our every consideration and effort on their behalf. That is the whole reason of S. 4. 
   The amendment I am now offering seeks to correct an oversight in the pending bill: namely, an extension of the authority for the services to provide special pay incentives for positions which have been hard to fill. 
   The authority for many of these special pays and bonuses will expire in December 1999. My amendment would simply extend funding authority through the end of 2002. It would give the Services the certainty that these essential retention tools will continue to be available. 
   These incentives affect many positions within our military, ranging from bonuses for aviation officers to special pay for health professionals. Passage of this amendment will reinforce S. 4's message that we as a nation take seriously our commitment to give our military the ability to continue to recruit and retain the finest servicemen and women in the world. I urge my colleagues to further that objective by adopting this amendment. 
   Thank you, Mr. President.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to offer an amendment to S. 4 with my colleagues, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator BINGAMAN, and Senator LANDRIEU. Of course, S. 4 is the Soldiers', Sailors', Airmen's and Marines' Bill of Rights Act of 1999. This legislation will give the men and women of the National Guard and Reserve the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. S. 4 offers this benefit to their active duty counterparts. Our amendment will offer this to men and women of the National Guard and Reserve. 
   The Thrift Savings Plan is an excellent way for military families to save for the future. It is not meant to take the place of a retirement system. It is a tax-deferred savings plan that will grow while a service member is actually serving, unlike the delayed benefits of the military retirement system. Furthermore, the Thrift Savings Plan is a portable benefit that can be rolled over into a civilian 401(k) plan, in the event the service member, for whatever reason, must leave military service. 
   In my opinion, the men and women of the Guard and Reserve must be given the same opportunity to participate in this excellent savings pan as their active duty counterparts. Although the amount of money they will be able to deposit in the Thrift Savings Plan may not be substantial at first, every dollar counts. The Thrift Savings board themselves allows contributions ``as little as a dollar each pay period.'' 
   With the increase in worldwide taskings, Guardsmen and Reservists are participating significantly above and beyond their mandatory one-weekend-a-month and two-weeks-a-year duty, their contributions will grow 
   over time. While some Guardsmen and Reservists may have savings plans through their civilian employers, allowing them to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan allows them to contribute based on their military earnings. For many Guardsmen and Reservists, their military duty has become a second job. 
   Since the end of the cold war, the services have increasingly relied upon their Reserve components to meet worldwide obligations. The active duty force has been reduced by one-third, yet worldwide commitments have increased dramatically. 
   In recent years, thousands of Reservists and Guardsmen have supported contingencies, peacekeeping operations and humanitarian missions around the world: in the Persian Gulf, Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, and Kenya, 
   just to name a few. Guard and Reserve units responded immediately to requests for assistance after Hurricane Mitch, delivering over 10 million pounds of humanitarian aid to devastated areas in Central America. 
   Closer to home, Reserve and National Guard personnel answered the cries for help after devastating floods struck in our Nation's heartland. They braved high winds and water to fill sandbags, provide security, and transport food, fresh water, medical supplies, and disaster workers to affected areas. The Air Force Reserve's ``Hurricane Hunters'' routinely fly into tropical storms and hurricanes in specially configured C-130s to collect data to improve forecast accuracy, which dramatically minimizes losses due to the destructive forces of these storms. 
   As we transition into the high-tech 21st century, the Guard and Reserve will continue to take on new and exciting roles. The Guard and Reserve now have units performing satellite control and security functions in order to maintain our country's lead in space-based technology. And, because our country faces the increased threat of 
   chemical and biological weapons, the White House, the Department of Defense, and Congress have joined to develop a ``Homeland Defense'' policy designed to respond to threats against the United States. The Guard and Reserve will play a significant role in the implementation of the policy, because their knowledge of local emergency response plans and infrastructure is critical to an effective response. 
   The days of holding our Reserve Component forces ``in reserve'' are long gone. 
   Just who are these citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines? They are doctors, they are lawyers. They are farmers, grocers, teachers and small business owners. They have longstanding roots in communities across our great country. And, like their active-duty counterparts, they have volunteered to serve. Remarkably, they must balance their service with the demands of their full-time civilian jobs and families. 
   In September 1997, Secretary of Defense Cohen wrote a memorandum acknowledging an increased reliance on the Reserve Components. He called upon the services to remove all remaining barriers to achieving a 
   ``seamless Total Force.'' He has also said that without Reservists, ``we can't do it in Bosnia, we can't do it in the Gulf, we can't do it anywhere. 
   Giving the men and women who serve in the Reserve Components the opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan would carry on the spirit of Secretary Cohen's Total Force policy. This amendment has received the resounding support of the Reserve Officers Association, the National Guard Association of the United States, the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States, and other members of the military coalition representing 5.5 million active and retired members. 
   The Reserve Components face many of the same challenges and dangers as their active duty counterparts in this time of high operations tempo. We should give them the same opportunity to participate in the Thrift Savings Plan. It is important to send the right message to our citizen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines: that we recognize and appreciate their sacrifices. It's the right thing to do. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Gordon Sherman, of Dunwoody, Georgia, who after more than four decades of dedicated service to the Social Security Administration retired on December 31, 1998. He is an outstanding example to his family and friends, and has been an asset to the many communities that he has touched over the years. 
   Gordon has more than 40 years of combined military and civilian federal service. He began working for the Social Security Administration in 1958 and has served as the Southeast Regional Commissioner to the Social Security Administration (SSA) since October 1975. In this role, he has been responsible for supervision, coordination, executive leadership, and effective and efficient administration of the Social Security program in the eight southeastern states. 
   As a career senior governmental executive, he has received many awards in honor of his noteworthy accomplishments and outstanding leadership over the years. Several of Gordon's most prestigious awards are the U.S. Army Legion of Merit medal, two Presidential Meritorious Executive Rank Awards, the National Public Service Award from the American Society of Public Administration (ASPA) and the National Academy of Public Administration (NAPA), the coveted Ewell T. Bartlett National Award for Humanity in Government, and the national ``Making the King Holiday Award'' from the Martin Luther King, Jr., Federal Holiday Commission for his assistance in making this holiday a reality. 
   As a native of Alabama, he graduated from Auburn University with a B.S. degree and received J.D. and LL.M degrees, as well as an honorary LL.D from Woodrow Wilson College of Law and completed the Senior Managers in Government (SMG) program at the John F. KENNEDY School of Government at Harvard University. Gordon and his wife Miriam are also associated with several business, educational, professional, civic, service and volunteer organizations in the Dunwoody area. 
   Mr. President, I would like to honor and commend Gordon Sherman for his outstanding and innumerable contributions over the years to the State of Georgia and to our entire Nation, and ask you and my colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Gordon on his retirement. Gordon, you truly are a great American, and I wish you many more joyous years in the future.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that the reason we are here today, the reason the United States Senate is being asked to exercise what Alexander Hamilton termed the ``awful discretion'' of impeachment, is because of the wrongful, reprehensible, indefensible conduct of one person, the President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. Indeed, I believe it is conduct deserving of the censure of the Senate, and I will support such a resolution when it comes before us. 
   The question before the Senate, however, is not whether the President's conduct was wrong, or immoral, or even censurable. We must decide solely as to whether or not he should be convicted of the allegations contained in the Articles of Impeachment and thus removed from office. In my opinion, the case for removal, presented in great detail in the massive 60,000 page report submitted by the House, in many hours of very capable but  often repetitive presentations to the Senate by the House Managers and the President's defense team, and in many additional hours of Senators' questioning of the two sides, fails to meet the very high standards which we must demand with respect to Presidential impeachments. Therefore, I will vote to dismiss the impeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton, and to vote for the Senate resuming other necessary work for the American people. 
   To this very point, I have reserved my judgment on this question because of my Constitutional responsibility and Oath to ``render impartial justice'' in this case. Most of the same record presented in great detail to Senators in the course of the last several weeks has long been before the public, and indeed most of that public, including editorial boards, talk show hosts, and so forth, long ago reached their own conclusions as to the impeachment of President Clinton. But I have now heard enough to make my decision. With respect to the witnesses the House Managers apparently now wish to depose and call before the Senate, the existing record represents multiple interrogations by the Office of the Independent Counsel and its Grand Jury, with not only no cross-examinations by the President's counsel but, with the exception of the President's testimony, without even the presence of the witnesses own counsel. It is difficult for me to see how that record would possibly be improved from the prosecution's standpoint. Thus, I will not support motions to depose or call witnesses. 
   In reaching my decision on impeachment, there are a number of factors which have been discussed or speculated about in the news media which were not a part of my calculations. 
   First of all, while as political creatures neither the Senate nor the House can or should be immune from public opinion, we have a very precise Constitutionally-prescribed responsibility in this matter, and popular opinion must not be controlling consideration. I believe Republican Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine said it best during the only previous Presidential Impeachment Trial in 1868: 
   ``To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the conviction of the President on these charges, I reply that he is not now on trial before the people, but before the Senate ..... The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard it. The responsibility is not on them, but upon us. They have not taken an oath to ``do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws.'' I have taken that oath. I cannot render judgment upon their convictions, nor can they transfer to themselves my punishment if I violate my own. And I should consider myself undeserving of the confidence of that just and intelligent people who imposed upon me this great responsibility, and unworthy of a place among honorable men, if for any fear of public reprobation, and for the sake of securing popular favor, I should disregard the convictions of my judgment and my conscience.'' 
   Nor was my decision premised on the notion, suggested by some, that the stability of our government would be severely jeopardized by the impeachment of President Clinton. I have full faith in the strength of our government and its leaders and, more importantly, faith in the American people to cope successfully with whatever the Senate decides. There can be no doubt that the impeachment of a President would not be easy for the country but just in this Century, about to end, we have endured great depressions and world wars. Today, the U.S. economy is strong, the will of the people to move beyond this national nightmare is great, and we have an experienced and able Vice President who is more than capable of stepping up and assuming the role of the President. 
   Third, although we have heard much argument that the precedents of judicial impeachments should be controlling in this case, I have not been convinced and did not rely on such testimony in making my decision. After review of the record, historical precedents, and consideration of the different roles of Presidents and federal judges, I have concluded that there is indeed a different legal standard for impeachment of Presidents and federal judges. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that ``the President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article III, Section I of the Constitution indicates that judges ``shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.'' Presidents are elected by the people and serve for a fixed term of years, while federal judges are appointed without public approval to serve a life tenure without any accountability to the public. Therefore, under our system, impeachment is the only way to remove a federal judge from office while Presidents serve for a specified term and face accountability to the pubic through elections. With respect to the differing impeachment standards themselves, Chief Justice Rehnquist once wrote, ``the terms `treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors' are narrower than the malfeasance in office and failure to perform the duties of the office, which maybe grounds for forfeiture of office held during good behavior.'' 
   And my conclusions with respect to impeachment were not based upon consideration of the proper punishment of President Clinton for his misdeeds. During the impeachment of President Nixon, the Report by the Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry concluded that ``impeachment is the first step in a remedial process--removal from office and possible disqualification from holding future office. The purpose of impeachment is not personal punishment; its function is primarily to maintain constitutional government.'' Regardless of the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial, President Clinton remains subject to censure by the House and Senate, and criminal prosecution for any crimes he may have committed. Whatever punishment President Clinton deserves for his misdeeds will be provided elsewhere. 
   Finally, I do not believe that perjury or obstruction of justice could never rise to the level of threatening grievous harm to the Republic, and thus represent adequate grounds for removal of a President. However, we must approach such a determination with the greatest of care. Impeachment of a President is, perhaps with the power to declare War, the gravest of Constitutional responsibilities bestowed upon the Congress. During the history of the United States, the Senate has only held impeachment trials for two Presidents, the 1868 trial of President Johnson, who had not been elected to that office, and now President Clinton. Although the Senate can look to impeachment trials of other public officials, primarily judicial, as I have already said, I do not believe that those precedents are or should be controlling in impeachment trials of Presidents, or indeed of other elected officials. 
   My decision was based on one overriding concern: the impact of this precedent-setting case on the future of the Presidency, and indeed of the Congress itself. It is not Bill Clinton who should occupy our only attention. He already stands rebuked by the House impeachment votes, and by the words of virtually every member of Congress of both political parties. And even if we do not remove him from office, he still stands liable to future criminal prosecution for his actions, as well as to the verdict of history. No, it is Mr. Clinton's successors, Republican, Democrat or any other Party, who should be our concern. 
   The Republican Senator, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who ``looked down into my open grave'' of political oblivion when he cast one of the decisive votes in acquitting Andrew Johnson in spite of his personal dislike of the President, explained his motivation this way: 
   ``In a large sense, the independence of the executive office as a coordinate branch of the government was on trial.......If.......the President must step down.......upon insufficient proofs and from partisan considerations, the office of President would be degraded, cease to be a coordinate branch of government, and ever after subordinated to the legislative will. It would practically have revolutionized our splendid political fabric into a partisan Congressional autocracy.'' 
   While our government is certainly on a stronger foundation now than in the aftermath of the Civil War, the basic point remains valid. If anything, in today's world of rapidly emerging events and threats, we need an effective, independent Presidency even more than did mid-19th Century Americans. 
   While in the history of the United States the U.S. Senate has never before considered impeachment articles against a sitting elected official, we do have numerous cases of each House exercising its Constitutional right to, ``punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds expel a Member.'' However, since the Civil War, while a variety of cases involving personal and private misconduct have been considered, the Senate has never voted to expel a member, choosing to censure instead on seven occasions, and the House has rarely chosen the ultimate sanction. Should the removal of a President be subject to greater punishment with lesser standards of evidence than the Congress has applied to itself when the Constitution appears to call for the reverse in limiting impeachment to cases of ``treason, bribery and other high crimes or misdemeanors?'' In my view, the answer must be NO. 
   Thus, for me, as one United States Senator, the bar for impeachment and removal from office of a President must be a high one, and I want the record to reflect that my vote to dismiss is based upon a standard of evidence equivalent to that used in criminal proceedings--that is, that guilt must be proven ``beyond a reasonable doubt''--and a standard of impeachable offense which, in my view, conforms to the Founders' intentions that such an offense must be one which represents official misconduct threatening grievous harm to our whole system of government. To quote Federalist No. 65, Hamilton defined as impeachable, ``those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' As I have said before, I can conceive of instances in which both perjury and obstruction of justice would meet this test, and I certainly believe that most, if not all, capital crimes, including murder, would qualify for impeachment and removal from office. However, in my judgment, the current case does not reach the necessary high standard. 
   In the words of John F. Kennedy, ``with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds,'' I believe that dismissal of the impeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton is the appropriate action for the U.S. Senate. It is the  action which will best preserve the system of government which has served us so well for over two hundred years, a system of checks and balances, with a strong and independent chief executive. 
   In closing, I wish to address those in the Senate and House, and among the American public, who have reached a different conclusion than have I in this case. I do not question the sincerity or legitimacy of your viewpoint. The process itself pushes us to make absolute judgments--yes or no to conviction and removal from office--and the nature of debate yields portraits of complex issues in stark black-and-white terms, but I believe it is possible for reasonable people to reach different conclusions on this matter. Indeed, I recognize that, while my decision seeks to avoid the dangers of setting the impeachment bar too low, setting that bar too high is not without risks. I believe the House Managers spoke eloquently about the need to preserve respect for the rule of law, including the critical principle that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above that rule. However, I have concluded that the threat to our system of a weakened Presidency, made in some ways subordinate to the will of the legislative branch, outweighs the potential harm to the rule of law, because that latter risk is mitigated by: an intact, independent criminal justice system, which indeed will retain the ability to render final, legal judgment on the President's conduct; a vigorous, independent press corps which remains perfectly capable of exposing such conduct, and of extracting a personal, professional and political price; and an independent Congress which will presumably continue to have the will and means to oppose Presidents who threaten our system of government. 
   By the very nature of this situation, where I sit in judgment of a Democratic President as a Democratic Senator, I realize that my decision cannot convey the non-partisanship which is essential to achieve closure on this matter, one way or the other. Indeed, in words which could have been written today, the chief proponent among the Founding Fathers of a vigorous Chief Executive, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in 1788, in No. 65 of The Federalist Papers, that impeachments ``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide them into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the accused. In many cases, it will connect itself with the pre-existing factions, and will enlist all their animosities, partialities, influence and interest on side, or on the other; and in such cases there will always be the greatest danger, that the decision will be regulated more by the comparative strength of the parties than by real demonstration of guilt or innocence.'' 
   I have, however, in making my decision laid out for you the standards which I believe to be appropriate whenever the Congress considers the removal from office of an elected official, whether Executive Branch, or Legislative Branch. I will do my best to stand by those standards in all such cases to come before me while I have the privilege of representing the people of Georgia in the United States Senate, regardless of the party affiliation of the accused. I only hope and pray that no future President, of either Party, will ever again engage in conduct which provides any basis, including the basis of the current case, for the Congress to consider the grave question of impeachment.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to commend and congratulate Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. and MediaOne cable company for sponsoring a special educational event for students in the metropolitan Atlanta area commemorating Black History Month. 
   In recognition of Black History Month, Turner Broadcasting System, Inc., a Time-Warner company, and MediaOne cable company are hosting a special educational event on Wednesday, February 10, 1999 at the ``Magic'' Johnson Theater in Atlanta, Georgia. This event will serve as a venue to screen Turner Network's Original film, ``Passing Glory,'' and engage students in after-viewing discussion. 
   Inspired by a true story about two undefeated high school basketball teams in segregation-era Louisiana, ``Passing Glory,'' is a powerful study about the discovery of mutual respect which crosses racial boundaries. Father Joseph Verrett ignites the sparks of the Civil Rights movement in New Orleans when he organizes a game between his own undefeated African American team and an undefeated prep school team from a white community. Along with his star player, he must overcome the fears and prejudices of the city's residents, both black and white, to forever change the established social order. 
   Turner Broadcasting and MediaOne are sponsoring this local educational event during Black History Month to offer students the opportunity to discuss the themes of the film, such as tolerance, teamwork, diversity, and racism. The forum will provide a venue for students to question civil rights experts and renowned sports figures about the history of segregation and the role that sports has played in bridging the racial divide. 
   This type of forum will motivate students to explore the history of race relations in this country and encourage dialogue which will foster understanding, the identification of common ground and a genuine commitment to afford equal opportunity and civil rights for people of all races, religions and ethnic origins. It is the human rights of all mankind that underpins the dignity and humanity of all people and a worthy goal to which we must all continue to aspire. 
   Mr. President, I ask that you join me and our colleagues in recognizing and honoring Turner Broadcasting and MediaOne on many years of worthwhile work and achievements which have culminated with their most recent collaborative educational project on behalf of the many students of the Atlanta area in honor of Black History Month.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, on behalf of my fellow original cosponsors, I am proud to introduce legislation which will provide a valuable protection for America's small businesses. 
   This initiative would permit the Small Business Administration to use up to $15 million of existing disaster funds to establish a pilot program to provide small businesses with low-interest, long-term disaster loans to finance preventive measures before a disaster hits. 
   Across the nation, increasing costs and personal devastation associated with disasters continually plague communities. While it may be impossible to prevent disasters, we believe that this legislation makes it possible to limit the number of disaster victims. 
   In response to the financial and human toll caused by disasters, the administration launched an approach to emergency management that moves away from the current reliance on response and recovery to one that emphasizes preparedness and prevention. The Federal Emergency Management Agency established its Project Impact Program to assist disaster-prone communities in developing strategies to avoid the crippling effects of natural disasters. 
   Our legislation supports this approach by allowing the SBA to begin a pilot program that would be limited to small businesses within those communities that are eligible to receive disaster loans after a disaster has been declared. 
   Currently, SBA disaster loans may only be used to repair or replace existing protective devices that are destroyed or damaged by a disaster. The pilot program authorized by our proposal would allow funds to also be used to install new mitigation devices that will prevent future damage. We believe that such a program would address two areas of need for small business--reducing the costs of recovery from a disaster and reducing the costs of future disasters. Furthermore, by cutting those future costs, the program presents an excellent investment for taxpayers by decreasing the Federal and State funding required to meet future disaster relief needs. The ability of a small business to borrow money through the Disaster Loan Program to help make their facility disaster resistant could mean the difference as to whether that small business owner is able to reopen or forced to go out of business altogether after a disaster hits. 
   On behalf of my fellow cosponsors, I urge my colleagues to support this effort to facilitate disaster prevention measures. Upon passage of this legislation, the costs in terms of property, taxpayer dollars, and lives will be reduced when nature strikes in the future.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that the reason we are here today, the reason the United States Senate is being asked to exercise what Alexander Hamilton termed the ``awful discretion'' of impeachment, is because of the wrongful, reprehensible, indefensible conduct of one person, the President of the United States, William Jefferson Clinton. Indeed, I believe it is conduct deserving of the censure of the Senate, and I will support such a resolution when it comes before us. 
   The question before the Senate, however, is not whether the President's conduct was wrong, or immoral, or even censurable. We must decide solely as to whether or not he should be convicted of the allegations contained in the Articles of Impeachment and thus removed from office. In my opinion, the case for removal, presented in great detail in the massive 60,000 page report submitted by the House, in many hours of very capable but often repetitive presentations to the Senate by the House Managers and the President's defense team, and in many additional hours of Senators' questioning of the two sides, fails to meet the very high standards which we must demand with respect to Presidential impeachments. Therefore, I will vote to dismiss the impeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton, and to vote for the Senate resuming other necessary work for the American people. 
   To this very point, I have reserved my judgment on this question because of my Constitutional responsibility and Oath to ``render impartial justice'' in this case. Most of the same record presented in great detail to Senators in the course of the last several weeks has long been before the public, and indeed most of that public, including editorial boards, talk show hosts, and so forth, long ago reached their own conclusions as to the impeachment of President Clinton. But I have now heard enough to make my decision. With respect to the witnesses the House Managers apparently now wish to depose and call before the Senate, the existing record represents multiple interrogations by the Office of the Independent Counsel and its Grand Jury, with not only no cross-examinations by the President's counsel but, with the exception of the President's testimony, without even the presence of the witnesses' own counsel. It is difficult for me to see how that record would possibly be improved from the prosecution's standpoint. Thus, I will not support motions to depose or call witnesses. 
   In reaching my decision on impeachment, there are a number of factors which have been discussed or speculated about in the news media which were not a part of my calculations. 
   First of all, while as political creatures neither the Senate nor the House can or should be immune from public opinion, we have a very precise Constitutionally-prescribed responsibility in this matter, and popular opinion must not be a controlling consideration. I believe Republican Senator William Pitt Fessenden of Maine said it best during the only previous Presidential Impeachment Trial in 1868:  
   To the suggestion that popular opinion demands the conviction of the President on these charges, I reply that he is not now on trial before the people, but before the Senate ..... The people have not heard the evidence as we have heard it. The responsibility is not on them, but upon us. They have not taken an oath to ``do impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws.'' I have taken that oath. I cannot render judgment upon their convictions, nor can they transfer to themselves my punishment if I violate my own. And I should consider myself undeserving of the confidence of that just and intelligent people who imposed upon me this great responsibility, and unworthy of a place among honorable men, if for any fear of public reprobation, and for the sake of securing popular favor, I should disregard the convictions of my judgment and my conscience.  
   Nor was my decision premised on the notion, suggested by some, that the stability of our government would be severely jeopardized by the impeachment of President Clinton. I have full faith in the strength of our government and its leaders and, more importantly, faith in the American people to cope successfully with whatever the Senate decides. There can be no doubt that the impeachment of a President would not be easy for the country but just in this Century, about to end, we have endured great depressions and world wars. Today, the U.S. economy is strong, the will of the people to move beyond this national nightmare is great, and we have an experienced and able Vice President who is more than capable of stepping up and assuming the role of the President. 
   Third, although we have heard much argument that the precedents of judicial impeachments should be controlling in this case, I have not been convinced and did not rely on such testimony in making my decision. After a review of the record, historical precedents, and consideration of the different roles of Presidents and federal judges, I have concluded that there is indeed a different legal standard for impeachment of Presidents and federal judges. Article 11, Section 4 of the Constitution provides that ``the President, Vice President, and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from Office on Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Article III, Section I of the Constitution indicates that judges ``shall hold their Offices during good Behavior.'' Presidents are elected by the people and serve for a fixed term of years, while federal judges are appointed without public approval to serve a life tenure without any accountability to the public. Therefore, under our system, impeachment is the only way to remove a federal judge from office while Presidents serve for a specified term and face accountability to the public through elections. With respect to the differing impeachment standards themselves, Chief Justice Rehnquist once wrote, ``the terms `treason, bribery and other high crimes and misdemeanors' are narrower than the malfeasance in office and failure to perform the duties of the office, which may be grounds for forfeiture of office held during good behavior.'' 
   And my conclusions with respect to impeachment were not based upon considerations of the proper punishment of President Clinton for his misdeeds. During the impeachment of President Nixon, the Report by the Staff of the Impeachment Inquiry concluded that ``impeachment is the first step in a remedial process--removal from office and possible disqualification from holding future office. The purpose of impeachment is not personal punishment; its function is primarily to maintain constitutional government.'' Regardless of the outcome of the Senate impeachment trial, President Clinton remains subject to censure by the House and Senate, and criminal prosecution for any crimes he may have committed. Whatever punishment President Clinton deserves for his misdeeds will be provided elsewhere. 
   Finally, I do not believe that perjury or obstruction of justice could never rise to the level of threatening grievous harm to the Republic, and thus represent adequate grounds for removal of a President. However, we must approach such a determination with the greatest of care. Impeachment of a President is, perhaps with the power to declare War, the gravest of Constitutional responsibilities bestowed upon the Congress. During the history of the United States, the Senate has only held impeachment trials for two Presidents, the 1868 trial of President Johnson, who had not been elected to that office, and now President Clinton. Although the Senate can look to impeachment trials of other public officials, primarily judicial, as I have already said, I do not believe that those precedents are or should be controlling in impeachment trials of Presidents, or indeed of other elected officials. 
   My decision was based on one overriding concern: the impact of this precedent-setting case on the future of the Presidency, and indeed of the Congress itself. It is not Bill Clinton who should occupy our only attention. He already stands rebuked by the House impeachment votes, and by the words of virtually every member of Congress of both political parties. And even if we do not remove him from office, he still stands liable to future criminal prosecution for his actions, as well as to the verdict of history. No, it is Mr. Clinton's successors, Republican, Democrat or any other Party, who should be our concern.  
   The Republican Senator, Edmund G. Ross of Kansas, who ``looked down into my open grave'' of political oblivion when he cast one of the decisive votes in acquitting Andrew Johnson in spite of his personal dislike of the President explained his motivation this way:  
   ..... In a large sense, the independence of the executive office as a coordinate branch of the government was on trial ..... If ..... the President must step down ..... upon insufficient proofs and from partisan considerations, the office of President would be degraded, cease to be a coordinate branch of government, and ever after subordinated to the legislative will. It would practically have revolutionized our splendid political fabric into a partisan Congressional autocracy.  
   While our government is certainly on a stronger foundation now than in the aftermath of the Civil War, the basic point remains valid. If anything, in today's world of rapidly emerging events and threats, we need an effective, independent Presidency even more than did mid-19th Century Americans. 
   While in the history of the United States the U.S. Senate has never before considered impeachment articles against a sitting elected official, we do have numerous cases of each House exercising its Constitutional right to, ``punish its Members for disorderly behavior, and, with the concurrence of two-thirds expel a Member.'' However, since the Civil War, while a variety of cases involving personal and private misconduct have been considered, the Senate has never voted to expel a member, choosing to censure instead on seven occasions, and the House has rarely chosen the ultimate sanction. Should the removal of a President be subject to greater punishment with lesser standards of evidence than the Congress has applied to itself when the Constitution appears to call for the reverse in limiting impeachment to cases of ``treason, bribery and other high crimes or misdemeanors''? In my view, the answer must be NO. 
   Thus, for me, as one United States Senator, the bar for impeachment and removal from office of a President must be a high one, and I want the record to reflect that my vote to dismiss is based upon a standard of evidence equivalent to that used in criminal proceedings--that is, that guilt must be proven ``beyond a reasonable doubt''--and a standard of impeachable offense which, in my view, conforms to the Founders' intentions that such an offense must be one which represents official misconduct threatening grievous harm to our whole system of government. To quote Federalist #65, Hamilton defined as impeachable, ``those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or, in other words, from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated POLITICAL, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' As I have said before, I can conceive of instances in which both perjury and obstruction of justice would meet this test, and I certainly believe that most, if not all, capital crimes, including murder, would qualify for impeachment and removal from office. However, in my judgment, the current case does not reach the necessary high standard. 
   In the words of John F. Kennedy, ``with a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds,'' I believe that dismissal of the impeachment case against William Jefferson Clinton is the appropriate action for the U.S. Senate. It is the action which will best preserve the system of government which has served us so well for over two hundred years, a system of checks and balances, with a strong and independent chief executive. 
   In closing, I wish to address those in the Senate and House, and among the American public, who have reached a different conclusion than have I in this case. I do not question the sincerity or legitimacy of your viewpoint. The process itself pushes us to make absolute judgments--yes or no to conviction and removal from office--and the nature of debate yields portraits of complex issues in stark black-and-white terms, but I believe it is possible for reasonable people to reach different conclusions on this matter. Indeed, I recognize that, while my decision seeks to avoid the dangers of setting the impeachment bar too low, setting that bar too high is not without risks. I believe the House Managers spoke eloquently about the need to preserve respect for the rule of law, including the critical principle that no one, not even the President of the United States, is above that rule. However, I have concluded that the threat to our system of a weakened Presidency, made in some ways subordinate to the will of the legislative branch, outweighs the potential harm to the rule of law, because that latter risk is mitigated by: 
   An intact, independent criminal justice system, which indeed will retain the ability to render final, legal judgment on the President's conduct; 
   A vigorous, independent press corps which remains perfectly capable of exposing such conduct, and of extracting a personal, professional and political price; and 
   An independent Congress which will presumably continue to have the will and means to oppose Presidents who threaten our system of government. 
   By the very nature of this situation, where I sit in judgment of a Democratic President as a Democratic Senator, I realize that my decision cannot convey the non-partisanship which is essential to achieve closure on this matter, one way or the other. Indeed, in words which could have been written today, the chief proponent among the Founding Fathers of a vigorous Chief Executive, Alexander Hamilton, wrote in 1788, in No. 65 of The Federalist Papers, that impeachments ``will seldom fail to agitate the passions of the whole community, and to divide them into parties, more or less friendly or inimical, to the accused.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Major General William P. Bland, Jr., a native of Statesboro, Georgia, who after more than four decades of dedicated service to the State of Georgia and to this country as an officer in the Georgia National Guard, is retiring and coming home to the Savannah area. On January 31, 1999, Maj. Gen. Bland will be honored during a retirement ceremony at the 165th Airlift Wing's headquarters in Savannah, where he started his career with the Georgia Air National Guard in 1962. 
   General Bland began his military service with the 165th Tactical Airlift Group in Savannah and later served as Deputy Commander of the Air National Guard at Air National Guard Support Center at Andrews Air Force Base. During the past eight years he has served as the Adjutant General for Georgia during which time he and his staff responded to blizzards and floods, directed 15,000 National Guardsmen for Olympic security, beefed up training for Guard volunteers, upgraded the state's military capabilities and reorganized the state defense department. As adjutant general, Bland led the Georgia Department of Defense and commanded more than 12,000 volunteer and full-time members of the Georgia Army and Air National Guards. 
   Bill's most challenging year as adjutant general came in 1996. He supervised the largest relocation of an Air National Guard unit in history with the move of the 116th Bomb Wing, which included 1,000 people and eight B-1 bomber airplanes, to Robins Air Force Base near Macon. The bomb wing's move helps ensure Robins' future as a military base because the B-1 is one of the Air Force's newest bombers and will remain in active service for many years to come. Bland also oversaw the 48th Infantry Brigade's deployment to the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, and witnessed the deployment of two units of the Georgia Army National Guard to Bosnia. 
   However, the most demanding duty in Bland's career came with the 1996 Olympics in Atlanta when he organized 15,000 National Guard volunteers from 47 states to help with security. Most recently he restructured the state Department of Defense by changing the department's contracting system and placing the Army and Air Guard recruiting under one office. 
   General Bland has made a positive impact on the lives of many Americans and personifies the definition of a true and loyal American who sets the standard for all citizens to live by. He is an outstanding example to his family and friends, and has been an asset to the many communities, states and nations that he has touched over the years. 
   Mr. President, I would like to honor and commend Major General William Bland for his outstanding and innumerable contributions over the years to the State of Georgia and to our entire nation, and I ask my colleagues to join me in saluting and congratulating Bill on his retirement and in wishing him many more joyous and successful years to come.

    Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Benjamin H. Hardy, Jr., an outstanding Georgian whose insight and courage helped shape the course for U.S. foreign policy for decades and paved the way for the people of many nations to improve their lives. 
   On January 20th, 1949, precisely fifty years ago today, President Harry Truman gave his inaugural address to the nation and, in doing so, spelled out his four point plan for U.S. foreign policy. The first three points of the plan were consistent with President Truman's previous policies in support of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan and our NATO allies. The fourth point of the plan, however, was a ``bold new program'' to provide technical assistance to developing nations which subsequently became known as ``Point Four.'' The idea for the new assistance program was developed by Mr. Hardy, who, at the time, was serving as a public affairs officer in the Department of State. Mr. Hardy had seen the rewards of technical assistance while working in Brazil and knew that this type of assistance was the key to unleashing the potential of so many developing countries. 
   According to various accounts, Mr. Hardy risked his career to bring his brilliant proposal to light and, ultimately, assisted in drafting the foreign policy portion of President Truman's address. Responding to a White House request for new initiatives in foreign affairs, Mr. Hardy produced his plan. However, his plan was not received favorably by the upper levels of the State Department and was sent back for ``further review''--virtually killing the idea. Refusing to give up, Mr. Hardy bypassed the normal channels of bureaucratic red tape and policy review and went directly to a contact inside the White House. There, Mr. Hardy's development plan was greeted much more favorably and soon made its way to President Truman's desk and, later, into the President's State of the Union address. 
   Point Four received widespread acclaim and, soon after Truman's address, Congress created the Technical Cooperation Administration within the Department of State. Mr. Hardy went on to serve as chief of public affairs and chairman of the Administration's policy planning committee. On December 23rd of 1951 Mr. Hardy was killed in a plane crash along with the director of the Technical Cooperation Administration, Dr. Henry Bennet. Soon, the Technical Cooperation Administration was transformed into the agencies responsible for foreign aid but the Point Four idea, remains vibrant today. It survives in the U.S. Agency for International Development, the agency which works to develop, train, educate, and strengthen democracy in the most needy countries across the globe. 
   Were it not for the determination of Mr. Benjamin Hardy, these agencies, and their successes, may never have been realized. Benjamin Hardy is a wonderful example of one person making a difference in the world and I am honored today to recognize the indelible mark this distinguished Georgian has left upon the history of this nation and the people of the world.

   Mr. CLELAND. Mr. President, I am extremely pleased to introduce with my colleagues, Senators ROBB, LEVIN, KENNEDY, BYRD, BINGAMAN, LIEBERMAN, LANDRIEU, REED, and DASCHLE--The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999. I strongly believe that this bill represents an excellent step toward providing the men and women of the military a clear signal that we the people of the United States and we the members of the Congress of the United States value their contributions, understand their needs and concerns, and understand our obligations to provide for those who have answered the calling to defend our Nation. 
   The signal that we send to the people in the military and to the people of the United States should be one of hope and opportunity, and one that understands the critical needs of military members and their families. Twenty-five years ago Americans opted to end the draft and to establish an all-volunteer military force to provide for our national security. That policy carried with it a requirement that we invest the needed resources to bring into existence a competent and professional military. Currently, all services are having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified individuals. Seasoned, well-qualified personnel are leaving in alarming numbers. Specifically, the Navy is not making its recruiting goals. The Army cites pay and retirement, and overall quality of life as three of the top four reasons soldiers are leaving. The Air Force is currently 850 pilots short. The Marine Corps is hampered by inadequate funding of the pay and retirement and quality of life accounts in meeting its readiness and modernizing needs. All services, including the Guard and Reserve Components, are experiencing similar recruiting and retention problems. These shortfalls must be addressed if our Nation is to continue to have a highly capable, cutting edge military force. 
   In light of our recent successful operations around the world, in the Persian Gulf and elsewhere, we must redouble our efforts to ensure that we continue to recruit, train and retain the best of America to serve in our armed forces, which is the goal of the legislation I am introducing today. Equally important, this bill, for the first time in a long time, addresses the immediate family members of our brave Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines. The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999 addresses the concerns of Secretary of Defense Cohen, the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Congress regarding recruiting a strong, viable military force 
   for the 21st Century. It also significantly assists in retaining the right military personnel for the 21st Century. If we fail today to address these key issues, now when we have the combination of a strong economy, a relatively positive budget outlook, and a world which is largely at peace, we may well have missed a key window of opportunity. The bill we are introducing today goes a long way toward eliminating the deficiencies that we all have recently heard so much about from the Chiefs and a myriad of experts who are greatly concerned about the readiness of our military force, especially as we look a few years ahead. 
   Military experts, defense journalists, former Secretaries of Defense, former Service Chiefs, former theater Commanders in Chief, research and development specialists and even civilian industry leaders agree: the number one factor undergirding our superpower military status is the people of our Armed Forces. This critical ingredient means something different today than it did on the beaches of Normandy, in the jungles of Vietnam, or in fact even on the deserts of Kuwait. Today, the  people of our military are as dedicated, as committed, as patriotic as any force we have ever fielded. They are, in fact, smarter, better trained, and more technically adept than any who we have ever counted upon to defend our Nation. Operation Desert Fox proved this fact. This flawless, but dangerous and stressful, operation involved 40,000 troops from bases virtually around the world. Over 40 shops performed around the clock strikes and support. Six hundred aircraft sorties were flown in four days, and over 300 of these were night strike operations. And this massive effort was carried out without a single loss of American or British life! 
   In contrast to this and other post-Vietnam successes, consider the problems which face the people in uniform. New global security threats and our strong economy each exert enormous pressures on the people in the military and their families. By some measures the pay for our military personnel lags 13 percent behind the civilian pay raises over the last 20 years. Yet, we ask our military to train on highly technical equipment, to commit themselves in harm's way, to leave their families, and to execute flawless operations. Sometimes these operations are new and different from any past military operations, but they can be just as dangerous. Meanwhile, some of our servicemen and women qualify for food stamps, do not have the same educational opportunities as their civilian counterparts, must deal with confusing and changing health benefits and/or can not find affordable housing. Something is badly wrong with this picture, and the Congress and the Administration must work together to set things right. 
   Specifically, we need to recruit good people, continue to train them, and retain them in the military. This is difficult 
   at best with the changes in our society, the rapidly changing threats to our security, and a prosperous economy. As I heard a service member say during a hearing I held at Ft. Gordon, Georgia last year, we recruit an individual, but we retain a family. 
   Some of the recruiting and retention problems of today's United States military are well documented. Others need to be more thoroughly explored. They all need to be addressed. The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999 is but the first step. It is the beginning. I caution my colleagues that today's servicemen and women, and their families, are intelligent and are quick to recognize duplicity in the words and actions of our civilian and military leadership. Our military's most important assets--its people--are leaving the military, and many of America's best are not even considering joining the military. We must proceed expeditiously, with firm purpose and unified non-partisanship if we are to reverse these dangerous trends. 
   This bill responds to current data which provide some insight into how we can more effectively respond to today's youth and their service in the military. This 106th Congress has a tremendous opportunity to respond to today's military personnel problems. We must keep our focus on current and future personnel issues, including recognizing and responding to the need to retain a family. Our legislation does so. 
   Mr. President, the bill my colleagues and I are introducing today includes all three parts of the Department of Defense's proposed pay and retirement package. It incorporates some of the recommendations made by the Congressionally mandated Principi Commission, and it provides some additional innovative ideas for addressing these key personnel issues, now and into the future. 
   First, our bill provides a 4.8% pay raise across-the-board for all military members, effective January 1, 2000, and carries out the stated objective of Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs of Staff of bringing military pay more in line with private sector wages. This increase raises military pay in FY2000 by one-half a percentage point above the annual increase in the Employment Cost Index (ECI), and represents the largest increase in military pay since 1982. Furthermore, and also in keeping with DoD's current plans, we would provide an annual increase in military pay of one-half percent above the annual increase in the ECI in each year from FY2001 to FY2006. 
   Another of the Joint Chiefs' recommendations included in our legislation is the targeted pay raise for mid-grade officers 
   and enlisted personnel, and also for key promotion points. These raises, amounting to between 4.8 percent and 10.3 percent, which includes the January 1, 2000, pay raise and would be effective July 1, 2000. 
   The third part of our legislation taken from the DOD plan is a revision in the Military Retirement Reform Act of 1986, which would restore the 50 percent basic pay benefit for military members who retire at 20 years of service. 
   I am proud to say that in addition to the pay and retirement benefits package proposed by Secretary Cohen and the Joint Chiefs, our legislation includes several key recommendations from the recent report of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, also known as the Principi Commission. These provisions are specifically designed to assist the military services in their recruiting and retention efforts. 
   Information and data that we are seeing indicate that education benefits are an essential component in attracting young people to enter the armed services. This may be the single most important step this Congress can take in assisting recruitment. Improvements in the Montgomery GI Bill are needed, and our bill represents a vital move in that direction. 
   In keeping with the Principi Commission, our legislation would increase the basic GI Bill benefit from $528 to $600 per month and eliminate the current requirement for entering service members to contribute $1,200 of their own money in order to participate in the program. These changes should dramatically increase the attractiveness of the GI Bill to potential recruits,and give our Service Secretaries a powerful recruiting incentive. 
   Our legislation also adopts the Principi Commission recommendations to allow service members to transfer their earned GI Bill benefits to one or more immediate family members. Mr. President, this idea is innovative, it is powerful and it sends the right message to both those young people we are trying to attract into the military and those we are trying to retain. 
   The Military Recruiting and Retention Improvement Act of 1999 includes a provision that would allow military members to participate in the current Thrift Savings Plan available to Federal civil servants. Under this proposal, which adopts another recommendation of the Congressional Commission on Servicemembers and Veterans Transition Assistance, military members would be permitted to contribute up to 5 percent of their basic pay, and all or any part of any enlistment or 
    reenlistment bonus, to the Thrift Savings Plan. 
   Another section of our legislation extends for three years--through December 31, 2002--the authority for the military services to pay a number of bonuses and special incentive pays that are fundamental to recruiting and retaining highly skilled military members. The authority to pay these bonuses and special pay expires at the end of this year. By renewing this authority now through the end of 2002, we will provide military managers with these crucial retention tools. By acting now and for three years, the military members themselves will have greater confidence that these pay incentives will be available. 
   Mr. President, based on our initial estimates, it is my understanding that the provisions contained in this legislation will not require us to increase the funding for national defense above the levels in the President's FY2000-2006 Future Years Defense Plan. However, more precise costing will have to be done by the Congressional Budget Office over the next several weeks. 
   I know that all Members of the United States Senate are committed to the well-being of our servicemen and women and their families. They are doing their duty with honor and dignity. They are serving our country around the globe. They, along with their families, deserve our commitment. The bill we are introducing today is fair and will ensure that we continue to attract and retain high quality people to serve in our armed forces. It represents the beginning of a process to provide hope and opportunity to those who wear the uniform  of our Services. The President has announced a very good plan, as has the distinguished Majority Leader. We must move forward, together, in addressing these important personnel and readiness issues. 
   In closing, I want to recognize the leadership of Senator LEVIN, and the other members of the Armed Services Committee who are co-sponsoring this legislation. We are all absolutely committed to the welfare of our servicemen and women and their families. They provide for us, and it is time for us to provide our obligation to them. I look forward to working with Senator LEVIN, Chairman WARNER, and all of our colleagues on the Armed Services Committee in the months ahead to honor that obligation. I know I speak for myself and all of my co-sponsors in pledging to do our utmost to achieve that goal. 
   Mr. President, I now ask an unanimous consent that a summary and the text of the Military Recruitment and Retention Improvement Act of 1999 be printed into the RECORD.
