   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, within the next few days, I will cast my last vote as a U.S. Senator, and by the end of this year, I will conclude 36 years of public experience. 
   Permit me to reflect for a moment on this experience and share with you some observations. 
   The last decade of the 20th century has witnessed more change than any decade in human history. When I began my Senate service in January of 1989, the world was a very different place than it is today. The Soviet Union and the United States faced off in a cold war, a cold war that dominated global politics from the end of World War II. The ancient capitals of Eastern Europe were satellite appendages of the Soviet Union. There were two Germanys and a wall divided Berlin. The economic pundits were telling us that the Japanese economic model represented the wave of the future, and it was feared that America was in decline. 
   All of that has changed. The Soviet Union has imploded. It no longer exists. Eastern Europe is no longer a series of satellite states of the Soviet Union, but nascent democracies are developing in most of eastern Europe. The Berlin Wall has come down. Germany is reunited. And once again, Berlin is the capital of that country. The Japanese economy for the past decade has remained largely stagnant. And here at home, America enjoys the longest economic expansion in the Nation's history. 
   The way in which we live our day-to-day lives has experienced dramatic change as well, from the omnipresent cellular telephone to the advent of the Internet and the world of e-commerce. 
   What about the Senate, this place where we spend our 
   working hours. It has seen much change as well: The great debate that proceeded a resolution of support for operation Desert Storm was in the finest traditions of Webster and Calhoun--many have said that this was our finest bipartisan hour--the unpleasant duty of sitting in judgment of a fellow colleague and ultimately rendering the appropriate judgment; and the awesome responsibility of determining the fate of an American President, only the second Congress in our Nation's history to be so charged. 
   There have been moments of inspiration as well. None of us will ever forget listening in those joint sessions of Congress to Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel share with us their struggle to achieve democracies in their own countries. The democratic spirit may be suppressed but never extinguished. 
   In the history of the Senate, there have been 1,581 men and women who have served, only 23 of them from Nevada. It has been a great honor and privilege for me to be one of those and to represent the State of Nevada. How effectively I have discharged that responsibility awaits the verdict of history. 
   As a youngster, I dreamed of serving as Governor of my own State. It was my life goal. Serving in the Senate of the United States is like adding a little frosting to that cake. 
   I have thought often of my parents during these past 12 years. My father, like so many Nevadans of his generation, came from a poor family. His dream was to become a lawyer. But America was gripped in a great depression. This city and the patronage of Nevada's Congressman James Scrugham made it possible for him to achieve his goal. While attending law school in the Nation's Capital, he met my mother, a native Virginian. The following year, I was born in this city. So in a sense, I have been here before. 
   I spoke about change a moment ago. The Senate today is a very different institution than it was a decade ago; I fear in many respects a diminished institution. Those of us who seek election to the Senate today frequently denigrate it and seek public favor by demeaning it. This has taken a toll on the public esteem in which we are all held. A media that is appropriately critical of our shortcomings is not always able to find its voice in telling the American public of its successes. We are more partisan, more polarized than we were a decade ago. And for some, compromise has become a nasty word, forgetting our own heritage, because the Senate itself is a product of the great compromise of our Constitution--a Senate with equal representation for each State, and a House of Representatives based on population. 
   The role of money: Yes, it is fair to say that it has always been a factor in American politics, but today it has become too much of a dominant force. It consumes more of our time. It drives our schedule. It is a corrosive force that threatens to undermine public confidence in our institutions of government. 
   I believe there is a direct correlation between the decline of citizen participation in government and voting, to the public perception that politics is all about money. Most Americans feel they are excluded from this process. 
   Perhaps less visible to the public, the rules which have served this institution so well for decades and which govern the way in which we process legislation have broken down. 
   There is much that I will miss: My colleagues, who represent a broad spectrum of political views, who bring their varied experience to the Senate, dedicated men and women who labor mightily on behalf of the constituents they represent, 
   most especially my senior colleague with whom I have worked in this body, as well as the State legislature, and on issues affecting the State of Nevada for the last 37 years. 
   My personal staff, both here in Washington and at home--I have simply loved our working relationship. It has been a joy for me to come to work each morning. I have appreciated their hard work, the long hours, the personal sacrifice. Nevadans have been well served by their dedication. Without their support, any success I might have had would not have been possible. 
   The people who make our hectic lives a little more manageable--the elevator operators, the Capitol Police, the food servers, those who staff the Cloakrooms, our floor staff and many, many others. 
   This building in which we work, so rich with the history of our country--there has not been a single day in the past 12 years that I have not felt a sense of awe when coming to work. 
   And this city, with its magnificent cathedrals of governance that serve as the guardians of the American dream--I will miss that as well. 
   My wife joins me this morning in the gallery of this great Chamber. Nothing I have been able to do, nothing I have been able to achieve, would have been possible without her support, her personal sacrifice, and those of our three children, Richard, Leslie, and Blair, who have all been a part of my life and a part of public service in my life. Whatever I have become, whatever I am, is largely because of their support of my efforts to pursue my own dreams and goals. 
   I leave the Senate with a great sense of respect for this institution, which has been so much a part of my life for the past 12 years. It is troubled in many ways, as I have said. However, none of those problems is insurmountable. If we can resist the temptation to seek momentary partisan advantage, if we can restore civility in our public discourse as we debate the great issues and policy differences of our time, if we can apply the rules that govern the process by which we conduct the Senate's business fairly to all, and if we can work together for the common good, I am confident that the future of the Senate can be as bright as the past. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor for the last time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am now in my last days of serving the people of the State of Nevada as a U.S. Senator. It is a role in which I am proud and privileged to have had an opportunity to serve. I am also very proud of the opportunity I have had to serve as a member of the Finance Committee, the committee with jurisdiction over the Medicare program. 
   Having said that, I am greatly troubled by this body's failure to take action on several fronts as it relates to Medicare. I am disappointed that we failed to act on Medicare coverage for prescription drugs as well as the proposed payment changes in the so-called BBA relief bill, a piece of legislation that deals with provider payment enhancements to those services and companies that provide service to Medicare patients. 
   The impact of Medicare over the past 35 years cannot be overemphasized. Prior to enactment of Medicare in 1965, fewer than half the seniors in America had any kind of health care coverage at all. Today, as a result of Medicare's enactment, 99 percent do. As a result, health care for the Nation's seniors has been improved and the burden of health care costs for them has been greatly ameliorated. But a Medicare program without prescription drug coverage does not meet the promise we made to seniors in 1965. 
   In 1965, the Medicare program roughly paralleled what was available in the private sector. Today, as all of us know, prescription drugs play such a vital role, a greatly enhanced role in  terms of our own Medicare treatment. We had a historic opportunity this year to fulfill the promise of Medicare and to guarantee access to comprehensive prescription drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries. Yet we have squandered it. 
   There is no legitimate reason for the Republican leadership to have pushed meaningful prescription drug reform off for another year. The Finance Committee has spent the last 2 years considering prescription drugs. We have heard from experts on all sides of the issue. We have talked to our constituents. Many of us have worked diligently to put together legislation to provide a meaningful, comprehensive, affordable benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries. Yet the Finance Committee did not even hold a markup of a prescription drug benefit bill. By that I mean, for those who are not familiar with legislative language, we did not have the opportunity to vote on a Medicare bill in the Finance Committee, move it from the committee, and debate it on the floor. 
   I consider it a great tragedy that could have made a difference in the lives of our seniors. Our inaction will consign some 227,000 Medicare beneficiaries in my own State of Nevada and 39 million beneficiaries nationally to yet another year of spending an ever-increasing share of their fixed incomes on medically necessary drugs or trying to stretch their prescriptions by taking them every other day instead of every day or sharing them with spouses and friends or, worse, even going without. 
   We will be voting on the conference report to accompany the Agriculture appropriations bill this afternoon. The prescription drug importation provision is included in the conference report. I was pleased to join Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS in their amendment in July. I believe this amendment is an important measure that can be helpful. There is no credible reason, no defensible basis that only drug manufacturers should be allowed to reimport prescription drugs. 
   A well defined reimportation program could help to make drugs more affordable for American consumers. The majority of our seniors are often faced with the difficult choice of paying extremely high prices at retail outlets or forgoing medically necessary prescription drugs because they simply do not have the financial resources to pay for them. However, the best designed reimportation provision is not a sufficient answer to the millions of Medicare beneficiaries who lack prescription drug coverage. 
   I hope my colleagues will not hide behind this provision when they are asked by their constituents why the Senate didn't approve a Medicare prescription drug benefit this year. 
   Moreover, the important provision has been altered by the Republican leadership such that it is extremely questionable whether it will actually meet the goal Senators DORGAN and JEFFORDS and others desired--that of lowered prices. 
   One very basic problem with the provision is that a ``sunset'' date was added so that the importation system would end 5 years after it goes into effect. In order to assure the safety of the drugs being imported, laboratory testing facilities would be required. Distribution systems would also clearly be needed. I have serious doubts that the private sector investment to carry out this program will materialize if it is known that the program will only be in operation for 5 years. Why spend the money to develop the infrastructure for such a short-lived program? There is also a serious labeling problem that gives manufacturers the ability to shut down the program. 
   It is unquestionably and undeniably wrong that American citizens pay the highest prices for prescription drugs--particularly when many of these drugs are developed on American soil, by American companies who are receiving enormous tax breaks, patent protections and the benefit of billions of NIH research dollars. 
   I have been hoping to offer a germane amendment to the Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) legislation that would deny the export tax benefit to pharmaceutical manufacturers charging Americans at least 100 percent more than they charge foreign consumers for the same drug. This amendment, if I get the chance to offer it, and if approved, would have one of two positive effects for the American consumer and taxpayer: either, the price of prescription drugs would decrease, or if the manufacturer chooses to continue to exploit American consumers, at least the taxpayer would not be providing a tax benefit for doing so. 
   The prices of prescription drugs could also be lowered through the simple measure of providing more information to purchasers of prescription drugs. I introduced the Consumer Awareness of Market-Based Drug Prices Act of 2000 because purchasers today do not have any meaningful price information--and there is no way competition can work without information on prices. I believe in the free market, but we have to let it work. The availability of real market-based price information is critical to the ability of employers and insurers to negotiate lower prices for their employees and enrollees. 
   Under the current law, that information is denied to those who purchase prescription drugs on behalf of either their insureds or those who are part of their employee group. 
   Not only does the lack of price information keep prices artificially high, but it affects the Federal budget. Drug manufacturers have been able to manipulate the average wholesale price, which is a meaningless statistic, but it results in billions of dollars of Medicare overpayments. 
   My legislation would simply require the Secretary of HHS to make available to the public the market-based information on drug prices that she currently collects: the average manufacturer price for each drug, and the best price available in the market. These prices are already collected to implement the Medicaid prescription drug rebate system--so no new bureaucracy or administrative structures would be necessary. Legislation is necessary, however, because the Secretary is statutorily prohibited from disclosing this information. 
   Our legislation would simply lift that prohibition and make that information available. 
   A reimportation provision without the loopholes and the sunset provision could help to lower prices. There are also other ways to lower prices--by requiring manufacturers to treat American patients fairly if they want to receive generous tax benefits, and by disclosing prices--but we also must add an affordable, voluntary prescription drug benefit to the Medicare program. Anything less is an empty promise to our seniors who often go without much-needed drugs, or pay astronomical prices for them. 
   Earlier this year, I introduced the Medicare Outpatient Drug Act. Like the Vice President's proposal, this bill would provide prescription drugs as a defined, comprehensive and integral component of the Medicare program to ensure it is available and affordable for all beneficiaries. 
   The drug benefit must be a part of the Medicare program--if it is not, there is no guarantee to our seniors and those Medicare beneficiaries with disabilities that it will be available, no guarantee that is will be affordable, no guarantee that it will provide catastrophic protection, and no guarantee that it will be around the following year. 
   Only Medicare can ensure that it is guaranteed to be there, that it is affordable, that there is catastrophic protection, and that it will be there year after year. 
   The Democrats offer Medicare beneficiaries choices: the Medicare benefit is a voluntary one. If a person has drug coverage through an employer or some other source, he or she can keep that coverage. The beneficiary can choose to receive the drug benefit as a part of the traditional fee-for-service program, or through a managed care plan. 
   So there are three choices that are available here: either not to accept it, or to have either a fee-for-service program, or a managed care program. 
   The GOP proposal, in Congress, and as promoted by Governor Bush, gives the choices to the insurers. The insurer can choose whether or not to offer prescription drug coverage--there is no requirement. The insurer can choose the level of the deductible, and the amount of the coinsurance the beneficiary must pay for each prescription. The insurer can choose whether or not to offer catastrophic coverage. The insurer can choose to limit those drugs  that are covered to a select few--either by limiting the diseases that qualify for treatment, or by limiting the number of prescriptions that may be filled each month. The insurer can choose to keep the benefit the same from year to year, or the insurer can choose to change the benefit each year or to discontinue coverage. 
   The Democrats have tried to pass a bill this year that would provide choices for beneficiaries, while our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have advocated a bill that would provide choices for insurers. 
   Given the cost of a prescription drug benefit, it is critical that we spend those federal dollars in a way that will ensure that the benefit and the choices are going to the Medicare beneficiaries--not to the insurers. 
   I am also deeply troubled by the way the majority leadership is allocating federal dollars in the ``BBA-relief'' bill. While members of the Finance Committee have not been allowed to participate in the development of this package, I understand that about $10 billion out of a total of $28 billion is to go to Medicare HMOs over the first 5 years. That is over one-third of the money in this package, when only 16 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare HMOs. 
   The HMOs tell us that they need this level of funding to ``stabilize'' the market, and that without it they will have to withdraw from the program, or reduce benefits. But we know from the General Accounting Office that we are already overpaying the HMOs--by nearly $1,000 per enrollee. 
   And yet, our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not requiring any accountability on the part of the managed care plans in exchange for this huge influx of funding. They don't require them to stay in the market, and they don't require them to commit to a benefit package. 
   Managed care plans should be provided a reasonable portion of the funds in this package. But the majority has provided funds for HMOs at the expense of reducing beneficiary cost-sharing for preventive benefits and outpatient visits, at the expense of expanding health options for legal immigrants, at the expense of patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, at the expense of uninsured children, and at the expense of persons with Alzheimer's disease. 
   This is too great an expense. 
   I have a letter signed by 23 senior groups opposing this large payment of funds to Medicare+Choice HMOs.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, finally, let me conclude by saying that the administration has indicated the President may veto this legislation because of the heavy tilt toward managed care plans, the lack of accountability, and the lack of provisions that would directly help Medicare beneficiaries--our intended audience. I would support that veto. 
   I thank the Presiding Officer. I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this morning's Washington Post features an article entitled ``Iverson's Bad Rap Is Well-Deserved.'' 
   It is a story about one of the Nation's high-profile National Basketball Association stars who is about to release a rap CD that encourages gun violence, degrades women, and blatantly bashes people because of their sexual orientation. The National Basketball Association, the Philadelphia 76ers, his team, Mr. Iverson's record label, his coach, and every fairminded person should condemn this kind of so-called entertainment for the trash that it is. Clearly, these are not the kind of messages that one of the NBA's leading and most talented players should be sending to tens of thousands of kids who watch him play and may idolize him. 
   I fully respect Mr. Iverson's first amendment rights, but clearly the message he is sending encourages violence and implicitly condones it, hardly the kind of conduct one would expect from a celebrity whose conduct is admired by many of the Nation's youth. 
   What makes this particularly objectionable is the fact that Mr. Iverson and many of his other incredibly talented colleagues in the NBA are specifically marketed by the NBA itself as superheroes to our kids. The NBA is ultimately in a business to make money, and that is fine. They use their stars to promote their teams. But one would hope the NBA would exercise good judgment in choosing the athletes they select to promote because many of these athletes use their stardom to, again, promote themselves and to use that same kind of marketing appeal. And when the message, as in this case from Mr. Iverson, is both hateful and dangerous and is absorbed by all too many of our 
   Nation's youth, it is a vicious cycle that the NBA should end immediately. 
   The NBA has the power to pick and choose which athletes they are going to market and promote. They should exercise sound judgment and discretion before encouraging this kind of promotion and the reprehensible message it sends. 
   A few weeks ago I joined with many of our colleagues, both in committee and on the floor, in condemning some of the media produced in Hollywood, some of the videos, some of the violence that so often invades the Nation's television audience. We should also condemn this kind of conduct as well. When the NBA promotes these  questionable athletes, they assist them in their quest to become wealthy media darlings, and that only helps other media outlets such as record companies and movie studios to exploit their now already famous personalities. In fact, Mr. Iverson's record company is apparently planning to use the NBA's very well publicized All-Star weekend to release the uncensored--and one could only conclude even more objectionable--version of his soon-to-be-released CD. 
   Again, it is ultimately going to have to be up to the NBA as to who they promote and market and who they do not. But they need to realize if they continue to promote and market athletes who use their league-endorsed celebrity to promote or incite violence or the degradation of more than half the Nation's population, they will continue to bear a great deal of responsibility for the consequences of these actions. 
   I find it somewhat incredible that the Philadelphia 76ers' own coach has said, according to the Washington Post article, that he does not have a problem with Mr. Iverson's CD. That is nothing more than a cheap copout, and the NBA, the Philadelphia 76ers, and his coach should immediately condemn this outrageous, dangerous, and hateful message. 
   Let me give an example of one of the lyrics that is on this CD. Mr. Iverson says on his CD if someone is ``man enough to pull a gun/Be man enough to squeeze it.'' 
   In addition, he also advocates the murder of gay men on his new CD. 
   I am told that a wire report has been circulated this afternoon indicating that Mr. Iverson has apologized to gay men and to women for the hateful language contained in his CD. I call upon Mr. Iverson to do more than that; to ask, as a responsible American, as a role model, which he styles himself to be: Let's not issue this CD. Let's recall it. That would be the kind of conduct we should ask and expect of Mr. Iverson. 
   There are many athletes in America who do provide the kind of role model all Americans can endorse--the Cal Ripkens and the Tiger Woods in the World. These are the kind of people who send a very positive message about the value of the work ethic and the commitment to standards. All of us admire that kind of conduct. If Mr. Iverson is deemed to be a role model for America's youth, I suggest that the youth of America is in serious trouble. 
   Michael Wilbon also had a very interesting response to this subject in the Post this morning. I commend it to my colleagues as well.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, again, let me urge the NBA and the Philadelphia 76ers to step forward and be heard.  They will say: Look, we cannot control Mr. Iverson's conduct. That may be true. But they have an obligation, a responsibility to speak out and to condemn such conduct, even if they are unable to control it. So far, either they have, by silence, acquiesced, or they have to acknowledge that they find nothing wrong with the CD. 
   I find that both troubling and tragic if that is the standard we are to follow. 
   Again, the NBA, the Philadelphia 76ers, and their coach ought to speak out loud and clear and indicate this is not the kind of conduct they expect from one of their star athletes and to be as critical of it as I know Americans are in general. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. I believe some of our other colleagues have reserved time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the leader. I specifically thank the chairman, Senator SHELBY. We have worked to put this authorization bill together. It could not have happened but for his cooperation and the cooperation of a number of others of our colleagues on the Intelligence Committee. I thank them for their cooperation, the chairman in particular. I thank the majority leader and Senator DASCHLE as well. Again, I acknowledge the leadership of my chairman. He has been most helpful in working through this bill. I thank him, the majority leader, and our colleagues. 
   My remarks will echo many of the points made by the distinguished chairman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator SHELBY. Those who are not familiar with the workings of the Intelligence Committee may find it odd that members from different parties have such agreement on the substance of this legislation. Most of my colleagues, however, know that the committee has a long tradition of bipartisanship and I am proud to say that under Senator SHELBY's leadership we have upheld that tradition. We have confronted difficult policy issues and budget choices, and the chairman has gone out of his way to ensure that the committee addressed these in a fair and nonpartisan way. I appreciate the courtesies he has shown me as vice chairman. I think we have produced a good bill that focuses on several critical areas of intelligence policy. 
   This important legislation authorizes the activities of the U.S. intelligence community and seeks to ensure that this critical function will continue to serve our national security interests into the 21st century. The community faces momentous challenges from both the proliferation of threats facing America and from the rapid pace of technological change occurring throughout society. How we respond to these challenges today will affect our ability to protect American interests in the years ahead. 
   Some have argued that the end of the cold war should have significantly reduced our need for a robust intelligence collection capability. In fact, the opposite is true. The bipolar world of the Soviet-United States confrontation provided a certain stability with a clear threat and a single principal adversary on which to focus. We now face a world with growing transnational threats of weapons proliferation, terrorism, and international crime and narcotics trafficking, and multiple regional conflicts which create instability and threaten U.S. interests. While we, of course, must continue to closely monitor Russia, which still possesses the singular capability to destroy our country, these emerging threats demand increasing attention and resources. 
   A decade after the collapse of Soviet communism, the intelligence community continues its difficult transition, from an organization which confronted one threat to one which now must focus on a variety of threats, each unique in its potential to harm the United States. At the same time, the community has been buffeted by the information revolution, which provides tremendous opportunity for intelligence collection, but threatens to overwhelm our ability to process and disseminate information. These twin challenges--new and qualitatively different threats, coupled with an information and technological explosion--threaten the community's ability to serve as an early warning system for our country and a force multiplier for our armed services. 
   Unfortunately, the intelligence community has often been too slow to confront these challenge and to adapt to these new realities. To make this transition will require the following: 
   First, the intelligence community must get its budget in order. Although I believe the community probably needs additional resources, the Congress first must be convinced that existing resources are being used effectively. 
   Second, the various intelligence agencies must begin to function ore corporately--as a community, rather than as separate entities, all with different and often conflicting priorities. This has been a topic of debate for some time. And yet, the passage of time does not seem to have brought us much closer to this objective. 
   Third, the intelligence community must do a better job of setting priorities. That means making hard decisions about what it will not do. Resources are stretched thin, often because community leadership has been unable to say no. The result is that agencies like the National Security Agency are starved for recapitalization funds necessary to keep pace with technological changes. 
   Fourth, the community must streamline its bureaucracy, eliminating unnecessary layers of management, particularly those that separate the collector of intelligence from the analyzer of that intelligence. 
   Finally, the community must revamp its information technology backbone so that agencies can easily and effectively communicate with one another. 
   These steps will not be easy but are essential if the intelligence community is to stay relevant in today's world. Good intelligence is more important than ever. As we deal with calls for military intervention in far flung locales, intelligence becomes a force multiplier. We rely on the intelligence community to keep us informed of developing crises, to describe the situation prior to any U.S. intervention, to help with force protection when U.S. personnel are on the ground, and to analyze foreign leadership intentions. Solid intelligence allows U.S. policymakers and military commanders to make and implement informed decisions. 
   Maintaining our intelligence capability is difficult and sometimes expensive but absolutely essential to national security. The committee has identified a few areas that we think are priorities that need additional attention. One area of particular concern is the need to recapitalize the National Security Agency to assure our ability to collect signals intelligence. Collecting and deciphering the communications of America's adversaries provides senior policymakers with a unique source of sensitive information. In 1998, and again this year, the committee asked a group of highly qualified technical experts to review NSA operations. The Technical Advisory Group's conclusions were unsettling. They identified significant shortcomings which have resulted from the sustained budget decline of the past decade. With limited available resources the NSA has maintained its day-to-day readiness but has not invested in needed modernization. Consequently, NSA's technological infrastructure and human resources are  struggling to meet emerging challenges. 
   The NSA historically has led the way in development and use of cutting edge technology. This innovative spirit has helped keep the United States a step ahead of those whose interests are hostile to our own. Unfortunately, rather than leading the way, the NSA now struggles to keep pace with communications and computing advances. 
   There is, however, some reason for optimism. The current Director of NSA, General Hayden, has developed a strategy for recovery. He has undertaken an aggressive and ambitious modernization effort, including dramatic organizational changes and innovative business practices. These changes and the rebuilding of NSA's infrastructure will, however, require significant additional resources. The committee decided that this situation demands immediate attention, but the intelligence budget faces the same constrained fiscal situation as other areas of the Federal budget. We have, therefore, realigned priorities within existing resources in order to reverse this downward trend. This was not an easy process and we were forced to make some painful tradeoffs, but ensuring the future of the NSA is the committee's top priority. We cannot stand by and allow the United States to lose this capability. We have taken prudent steps in this legislation to make sure NSA will continue to be the premier signals intelligence organization in the world. 
   The bill also attempts to address an imbalance that has concerned the committee for some time. We have argued that our ability to collect intelligence far exceeds our ability to analyze and disseminate finished intelligence to the end user. We spend a tremendous amount of the budget developing and fielding satellites, unmanned aerial vehicles and all manner of other senors and collection platforms. These programs are important but too often new sensors are put into place without sufficient thought to how we will process and distribute the additional data. No matter how good a satellite is at collecting raw intelligence, it is useless if that intelligence never makes it into the hands of a competent analyst and then on to an end user. 
   This imbalance has been particularly acute at the National Imagery and Mapping Agency. At the request of Congress, NIMA has identified projected processing shortfalls associated with its future sensor acquisition plans. NIMA also outlined a three phase modernization to address these shortfalls. Unfortunately, the future year funding profile creates a situation that will force the intelligence community to either cut deeply into other programs or abandon the modernization. The committee has rejected that approach and has realigned priorities in order to avoid this budgetary squeeze in the out 
   years. It makes no sense to purchase expensive collection platforms when the rest of the system cannot handle the amount of intelligence produced. 
   Beyond the questions of resource allocation, this legislation also address several policy issues, including the problem of serious security breakdowns at the State Department. Over the course of the last 2 1/2 years the Department has been beset by seemingly inexplicable security compromises, the latest being the disappearance of a laptop computer in January of this year. This incident, still unexplained, follows closely on the heels of the discovery of a Russian listening device planted in a seventh floor conference room. Subsequently we learned that there was no escort requirement for foreign visitors, including Russians, to the State Department. Finally, I must mention the 1998 tweed jacket incident. In this case an unidentified man wearing a tweed jacket entered the Secretary of State's office suite unchallenged by State Department employees and removed classified documents. No one knows who he was. 
   The only conclusion that I can draw is that the State Department culture does not place a priority on security. Despite Secretary Albright's efforts to correct procedural deficiencies and to emphasize the need for better security, we have not seen much progress. The authorization bill contains a provision requiring all elements of the State Department to be certified as in compliance with regulations for the handling of Sensitive Compartmented Information. This is the most highly classified information and is controlled by the Director of Central Intelligence. If a component of the State Department is not in compliance with the applicable regulations, then that office will no longer be allowed to retain or store this sensitive information. It is unfortunate that this provision is necessary, but we must make it clear to individuals who handle classified material that we are serious about enforcing security rules. 
   A broader but related area of concern is the ability of the U.S. Intelligence community to meet the counterintelligence threats of the 21st Century with current structures and programs. We can no longer worry only about the intelligence services of adversaries such as the old Soviet Union, North Korea, or Cuba. We must deal with ever more sophisticated terrorist organizations and international crime syndicates capable of launching their own intelligence and counterintelligence efforts. We also face challenges from friendly states seeking access to economic data and advanced U.S. technology. 
   All of these changes argue for a major retooling of a U.S. counterintelligence apparatus designed for the cold war. The Director of Central Intelligence, the Director of the FBI, and the Deputy Secretary of Defense have undertaken an effort, referred to as CI-21, to design the structures and policies that we will need to cope with cutting edge technology and with the emergence of threats from nontraditional sources. I have been encouraged by the early progress made on the CI-21 effort. We have chosen not to include legislative provisions in the bill with the hope that the agencies involved will reach agreement and finalize the CI-21 plan. The report accompanying the bill strongly encourages them to do so and I reiterate that encouragement. 
   One provision in the bill that has created a bit of controversy is the section that closes a gap in existing law related to the unauthorized disclosure of classified material. This provision will make it a felony for a U.S. government official to knowingly pass classified material to someone who is not authorized to receive it. I say that this provision closes a gap because many categories of classified information are covered by existing statutes. This includes nuclear weapons data and defense information. Unfortunately much sensitive intelligence information does not fall into one of the existing definitions. Disclosure of this information could compromise sensitive sources and in some cases endanger peoples lives. The provision in the bill has been carefully crafted to avoid first amendment concerns and the chairman and I will offer a technical amendment incorporating suggestions made by the Attorney General. It is my understanding that she 
   supports the provision as amended. 
   Another provision which merits further explanation is the section dealing with treaty implementing legislation. This language provides that future criminal laws enacted to implement treaties will not apply to intelligence activities unless those activities are specifically named in the legislation. On its face this could be interpreted as exempting our intelligence community from the law regardless of the nature of the activity. In fact, this only applies to activities which are otherwise lawful and authorized. Intelligence activities are subject to an extensive set of statutes, regulations and presidential directives. These rules try to balance our need for intelligence to protect our national security with the American sense of values and ethical behavior. 
   Intelligence gathering--spying--is an inherently deceitful activity. To protect our military forces, thwart terrorist acts, or dismantle drug trafficking organizations, we gather information through surreptitious means. We either convince people to betray their country or cause, or we use intrusive technical means to find out what people are doing or saying. This may make some people uncomfortable, but it is absolutely essential to protecting American interests. Treaties that proscribe certain kinds of behavior should not inadvertently restrict these intelligence activities. If the Congress intends to apply treaty implementing legislation to intelligence activities,  then we should say so explicitly. We want to be precise and ensure that intelligence operatives in the field understand what we expect of them. Ambiguity and uncertainty are more likely to create problems. This provision will put the burden on Congress to make the determination of which treaty restrictions we want to apply to intelligence activities. 
   I have served on the Intelligence Committee for almost 8 years now and I have had the privilege of serving as vice chairman since January. During that time I have made a few observations that I would like to share. Since I am leaving the committee and the Senate at the end of this year, I have no vested interest other than my continuing belief in the importance of the committee's work conducting oversight of the intelligence community. 
   My experience leads me to the conclusion that excessive turnover is seriously hampering the effectiveness of the Intelligence Committee--a committee the Senate relies upon and points to in reassuring the American people that the intelligence community is being appropriately monitored by their elected representatives. Because of the 8-year limitation, member turn-over can be, and often is dramatic. For example, when the 107th Congress convenes next January, 5 of the 7 currently serving Democrats will have departed the committee. At the end of the 107th Congress, 5 of the 8 currently serving Republicans will leave the committee. 
   Over time, this brain drain diminishes the committee's ability to discharge its responsibilities. For example, in 1994 the committee dealt with the Aldrich Ames espionage case, arguably the most devastating counterintelligence failure of the cold war. The committee produced a report extremely critical of the CIA in this case and of the way the CIA and FBI dealt with counterintelligence in general. The Ames debacle led to a major restructuring of our national counterintelligence system with significant legislative input. Yet today, there is only one member on the majority side who served on the committee during that period, and at the end of this year there will be no members on the Democratic side. This lack of corporate memory greatly reduces the committee's effectiveness. 
   This committee deals with sensitive and complex issues, and much of the committee's business involves the technical agencies such as the National Security Agency and the National Reconnaissance Office. To understand these issues a Senator must invest significant time to committee briefings and hearings. There is no outside source to go to stay abreast of developments in the intelligence community. Just about the time members are beginning to understand these issues they are forced to rotate off the committee. This makes no sense. 
   The rationale behind the term limits was two fold. First, it was feared that the intelligence community could over time co-opt permanently serving members. In fact, new members who have little experience with the workings of the intelligence community are more dependent on information provided by the intelligence agencies. SSCI members are no more likely to be co-opted by the intelligence community than the members of other authorizing committees are likely to be co-opted by the Departments and agencies they oversee. The second reason term limits were enacted stemmed from the understandable view that the SSCI would benefit from a flow of fresh ideas that new members would bring. But because of naturally occurring turnover, new members have regularly joined the committee, irrespective of term limits. Since the SSCI was created 24 years ago, approximately sixty Senators have served on the committee. Members have served an average of just over 5 years--and approximately 60 percent of committee members have served on the committee less than 8 years. This historical record confirms that vacancies will continue to occur regularly on the SSCI, thus allowing the new faces and fresh ideas. At the same time, however, members who have a long-term interest in the area of intelligence should continue to serve and develop expertise. 
   My second observation relates to the committee's authority but also to a larger issue that is the question of declassifying the top line number for the intelligence budget. It is difficult to conduct a thorough and rationale debate concerning intelligence policy without mentioning how much money we spend on our intelligence system. Declassifying the top line budget would allow for a healthy debate within the Congress about the priority we place on intelligence. I would provide greater visibility and openness to average Americans, whose tax dollars fund these programs. Disclosure of the overall budget would provide these benefits without damaging U.S. national security. DCI Tenet declassified the budget numbers for top past budgets with no adverse effects, but has declined to continue this practice. I hope that the Congress and the next administration will revisit this issue and left this unnecessary veil of secrecy. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank the staff of the Intelligence Committee for the work they do and for the support they have given me as vice chairman. The committee is staffed by professionals dedicated to ensuring that the intelligence community enhances U.S. national security and does so in strict compliance with the intent of Congress. The staff is unique in the Senate in that the vast majority are nonpartisan and go about their business without regard to any political agenda. The four members of the staff with partisan affiliations, the staff directors and their deputies, approach their work with same spirit of bipartisanship that always has been a hallmark of the committee. Let me single our Bill Duhnke and Joan Grimson, the majority staff director and deputy for their excellent cooperation and the courtesy they have extended this year. I should note that Joan is not here today because she is off on maternity leave. I extend my congratulations to her and her husband on the birth of their first child, Jacqueline Anna. I also thank Melvin Dubee, my deputy minority staff director. Melvin brings a wealth of experience to the job, and it has been reflected in the sound advice I have come to depend on him to provide. Vicki Divoll, who joined the committee staff as counsel in January, also has been invaluable to me during the preparation of this legislation and in dealing with other legal issues. 
   Finally, I would have been lost as vice chairman without the guidance and advice of Al Cumming, the minority staff director. Al kept me well informed and helped me focus on issues that will have a lasting impact on the functioning of the intelligence community. The staff has done superb work on this legislation.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if I may respond to the excessively generous comments of my chairman, my colleague, and my friend, the reality is that working with him has been a pleasure. Without his cooperation and, obviously, trying to work in a bipartisan way to process this piece of legislation and other things we have done since the two of us have been privileged  to serve as chairman and vice chairman, we would not be here today with this bill. 
   I acknowledge his leadership. The good citizens of Alabama have a fine Member here and a person with whom I have been privileged to work for the last 12 years I have been in the Senate, and most especially this last year when we have served in our respective roles on the Intelligence Committee. I thank him publicly.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor the Prescription Drug Price Anti-Discrimination Act and I commend my colleague, Senator LEVIN, for his leadership on this initiative. 
   This bill would require drug manufacturers to treat American patients fairly--a manufacturer must have a policy in place that states that it does not discriminate against U.S. wholesalers by charging them more than it charges foreign wholesalers. If the company does not have this policy in place, then a 10 percent discriminatory profits tax would be imposed. 
   The reason for this bill is abundantly clear: American patients are being charged significantly higher prices than are patients in foreign countries for the exact same drugs. Is there any reason why our citizens--44 million of whom are uninsured and faced with paying these high prices--should be forced to make the choice between going without much-needed prescription drugs or paying 50, 100, or even 300 percent more for their drugs than do citizens in Canada, Great Britain, and Australia? Of course there isn't. 
   Today, patients without drug coverage in the United States are not treated fairly by U.S. manufacturers. I was shocked to discover the enormous price disparities that exist for some of the most commonly used drugs. For example, Prevacid, which is used to treat ulcers, is 282 percent more expensive in the United States than in Great Britain. Claritin is used to treat all allergies--as we all know thanks to frequent television commercials--and is 308 percent more expensive when purchased by American patients than when purchased by Australian patients. And Prozac, which can help millions of Americans suffering from depression, is out of reach to many as it is 177 percent more expensive in the United States than in Australia. 
   Our Medicare beneficiaries deserve a prescription drug benefit, and all of our citizens deserve the assurance that U.S. manufacturers will not charge them significantly more than they charge foreign patients. 
   This bill will not harm the drug industry. They can choose to accept the tax penalty, or they can lower prices to American consumers to the levels they charge foreign consumers. Either way, they will remain a very profitable industry: 
   Fortune magazine recently again rated the pharmaceutical industry as the most profitable industry in terms of return on revenues, return on assets, and return on equity. 
   Drug companies enjoy huge tax benefits relative to other industries: their effective tax rate was 40 percent lower than that of all other U.S. industries between 1993-1996. Compared to certain industries, the drug industry's effective tax rate was even lower--for example, it was 47 percent lower than that for wholesale and retail trade. 
   Additionally, higher drug prices for American patients simply aren't justified in the face of soaring marketing and advertising budgets: the industry spent almost $2 billion in 1999 on direct-to-consumer advertising, and more than $11 billion on marketing and promotion to physicians. 
   I don't have an argument with large profits--but American patients should not be charged more than patients in other countries for the same drugs. Moreover, American taxpayers should not be forced to underwrite highly profitable corporations that exploit American consumers. 
   Although many of us are still hopeful that we can pass a meaningful Medicare prescription drug benefit before the close of this Congress, at the very least we should require fair pricing for American patients.  
   I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill. 
   Mr. SHELBY (for himself, Mr. COCHRAN, and Mr. BOND):

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr President, the Speaker of the House of the Nevada State Assembly is one of Nevada's treasures and he happens to be a very close personal friend of mine. 
   I have been privileged to know Joe Dini since I first served with him in the state assembly during the 1969 legislative session and I continue to value his friendship. 
   Joe Dini was born and raised in the small town of Yerington, NV, he attended the University of Nevada and returned to the community of his birth to work along side his father in the family business. 
   In 1966 he was elected to the Nevada State Assembly, the first of his 17 terms; a record unrivaled since our state entered the union in 1864. 
   As a legislator, he has become the legislature's leading authority on western water issues. He served on the Western States Water Council and chaired the Water Policy Committee of the Council of State Governments-West. 
   In 1973, he was selected by his colleagues to serve a Speaker Pro Tempore and the following session, in 1975, as Majority Leader. 
   During his long and distinguished tenure, the State of Nevada has undergone dramatic changes. The state's population has increased by more than five fold. Nevada has become more urban and most of the state's population growth has been in Southern Nevada which now accounts for two-thirds of the state's population. 
   Not only is Joe Dini the longest serving member of the Assembly, but he has also been elected by his peers as the Speaker of the Nevada State Assembly an unprecedented eight times. Another record unparalleled in our state's history. 
   This extraordinary accomplishment is even more remarkable when one considers that rural Nevada, Joe Dini's political base, today represents just 15 percent of the state's over all population. He is a Nevada treasure, the likes of which we will surely not see again. 
   Now in the twilight of his career of public service, he is being showered with the honors and recognition he so richly deserves. 
   As with so many of us who have pursued a life of public service, Joe's family, his wife and his children have sacrificed much to make his service possible. Nevadans owe a debt of gratitude to Joe Dini's family as well. 
   I am pleased to join with Joe's many friends in paying my respect, to my friend--the much loved and respected, and Pizen Switch's number one citizen, Joe Dini.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this legislation would plunge the dagger into the back of Nevada's principal industry and would accomplish no useful purpose. Ninety-eight percent of the sports betting in America is conducted illegally outside of the State of Nevada. There is no logical way in which you can conclude that by eliminating sports betting that occurs in my own State, that is licensed, that is regulated--you have to be 21 years of age --you address a legitimate problem, which is illegal gambling on college campuses. 
   It is misdirected, it is ill-conceived, and it would be the dream of every illegal bookie in America if this legislation passes. I am pleased to join with my colleague in objecting to this legislation.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in a very few hours we will, each of us, be returning to our respective States for the summer recess. Most of us will have town hall meetings or other fora in which we will have a chance to interact with our constituents. 
   Much that occurs on this floor, although very important, does not connect with the American people. Some of it seems pretty esoteric, pretty dry stuff. I am going to be discussing this afternoon an issue that does connect with the American people. Whether you live in Maine or California or Washington State or Florida or, as I do, the great State of Nevada--and which I am privileged to represent--people are talking about the price of prescription drugs. 
   The reason for that is that the marvels of modern medicine have made it possible, through prescription drugs, to address a number of the maladies that affect all of us as part of humankind. The cost of those prescription drugs are literally going through the ceiling. I will comment more specifically upon that in a moment. 
   For literally millions of people in this country, the cost of prescription drugs has been so prohibitive that medications that would address a medical problem that those individuals face are simply beyond the pale. So for many, it is fair to say, the choice is a Hobson's choice. 
   Do they eat in the evening, or do they take the prescription medication that has been prescribed by their physician? It would be my fondest hope and expectation, before this Congress adjourns sine die--that is, at the end of this legislative year--that we could enact prescription drug legislation. That would be my No. 1 priority. But I think all of us recognize there are some things we can do as part of whatever plan we might subscribe to, and Senator GRAHAM and I this afternoon are offering a piece of legislation entitled the Consumer Awareness of Market-Based Drug Prices Act of 2000. 
   This is a piece of legislation that deals with the price of drugs. We know what the cost is, but we are talking about the price. We have a lot of information on the cost. We know, for example, that we are spending on drugs in this country, prescription medications--in the last available year, 1999--almost $122 billion. We also know quite a bit about how much we in the Federal Government are spending for prescription drugs. 
   For example, the States and the Federal Government spent $17 billion in fiscal year 1999 for drugs, just under the Medicaid program alone. Those costs are going to escalate rather dramatically. What is missing, however, is some critically important information--information that would be important to consumers and those who negotiate on behalf of consumers, because what we don't know, what we don't have much information about is drug prices. The reason for that is some statutory prohibitions I am going to talk about and which this legislation specifically addresses. 
   So the questions are: What do consumers know about drug prices today? What do employers who purchase prescription drugs on behalf of their employees know about prices? What do health plans negotiating on behalf of their enrollees know about prices? What do physicians who prescribe drugs for their patients know about prices? 
   The answer is simply, very, very little; almost nothing. What little is known is essentially worthless information. We have the average wholesale price, but this is a truly meaningless figure.  
   During the course of my discussion this afternoon on the floor of the Senate, we are going to be talking about three kinds of prices: The average wholesale price, average manufacturer price, and the best price. 
   Just talking about the average wholesale price, that is a public list price set by manufacturers, the pharmaceutical industry; that is neither average nor wholesale and is a price set by the pharmaceutical companies. The best analogy I can give you is that it would be analogous to the price that appears as the sticker price on the window of a new car. Nobody pays that price. It really is not very helpful in terms of what you need to know when negotiating to purchase a car. And now there are a number of web sites and publications and manuals--a whole host of things that tell consumers this is what the manufacturer paid, these are the hold-backs by the dealers, these are the discounts and the commissions; here is the price on which you want to focus your attention. You can get that information if you are purchasing an automobile, and you can get that information when you purchase a whole host of other things. But that information is not available if you are talking about finding out the price of prescription drugs, and that is because 
   of some statutory limitations. 
   It is somewhat analogous to the statement Sir Winston Churchill made in 1939 in describing the Soviet Union. He went on to say: ``A riddle, wrapped up in a mystery, inside an enigma.'' That is a pretty fair characterization of what we know about the prices of prescription medications as sold by the manufacturer. 
   There are many different approaches as we deal with this prescription drug issue and want to extend it as either part of Medicare or some alternative approach. I have been privileged to serve on the Finance Committee, which has been the vortex for this debate and discussion. I listened closely to my colleagues wax eloquently on the subject of prescription drugs, and, whether you are to the left or to the right of the political spectrum, or whether you consider yourself in the mainstream, a moderate, all of us worship at the shrine of competition. Everybody says what we need to do is to inject more competition into the system. I happen to subscribe to that because I do believe that by allowing the synergy of the free marketplace to work, it will be the most efficient and the most cost-effective way to deliver services. But there is an impediment to the operation of the free marketplace. 
   What does the free marketplace need to work? How do we ensure competition? Well, some of you may recall that course from school, Econ. 201; that is what it was called at the University of Nevada where I was enrolled. Basic economic theory dictates that the availability of real market-based information is critical to a free market and that price transparency is necessary. That is precisely what we do not have in this system we have created today. 
   The market today lacks market-based price information. A market simply cannot work without the availability of that price information. I emphasize the availability of that information. The information that is available to the public verges on the absurd. There is a complete void of useful information about prices. So, in effect, the employers and health plans negotiating on behalf of consumers are negotiating in the dark. They are at a serious disadvantage. It is as if they are blindfolded going into that negotiating arena. They don't know where the end of the tunnel is. They do not know what the real prices are. So one can fairly ask, how can even the most conscientious, effective employer or health plan operator negotiate good prices on behalf of consumers if they don't have the most basic information about market prices? They undoubtedly pay higher prices than they otherwise would, and ultimately these higher prices are translated into higher prices to the consumers; they are passed on. That is the nature of the system. 
   So what type of price information would be available, or should be available, that would be useful and helpful information? The average manufacturer price for a drug would be a useful thing for purchasers to know; that is, the average price at which a manufacturer sold a particular drug. That is what is actually paid for retail drugs. By law, by act of Congress, that is kept confidential, and that is one of the changes this legislation seeks to accomplish. That is confidential. You can't get that information. 
   The average price actually paid to a manufacturer by a wholesaler is supposed to be similar to the average manufacturer's price, but, in point of fact, it diverges widely. The average wholesale price, to refresh your memory, is a list price that is meaningless, a price assigned by the pharmaceutical industry. In theory, these prices should be tracking; in point of fact, they widely diverge. So it is the average manufactured price, the price that is actually paid, that is what we really want to know, and that is what we don't know. 
   The other price we don't know, and also by law is kept confidential, is the best price. That is the lowest price available to the private sector for a particular medication--whether it be Mevacor, Claritin, or any one of the other medications so many of us use today. That information is not available. So the average wholesale price--an utterly meaningless number, a fiction, if you will--is available. The average manufacturer price is not; nor is the best price. 
   Knowledge about the average manufacturer price and the best price would certainly enable us to have lower prices for health plans, lower prices for employers, and lower prices for the consumers. But the public is denied this information. 
   Let me emphasize--because a number of you might be thinking: There we go again with a vast new bureaucracy to collect this data with all of the burdens that are imposed upon the free market and the limitations that would be generated. 
   My friends, that is not the case because under the law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services currently collects the average manufacturer price and the best price. 
   In other words, we have this information. It is not something we don't know about, or we have to create some new mechanism to gather. We have that information. It is there. But we are precluded by law from sharing that information with those who negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry to negotiate the best possible price for employees, members of health plans, or other organizations that provide prescription drugs to their clients, patient customer base--however you characterize it. There is good information. All purchasers could use it to benefit those for whom they negotiate. 
   It is clear that we need to increase the level of knowledge consumers have about drug prices in today's marketplace. Transparency--that is the ability to see what these prices are and promote the fair market--will lower prices. 
   That is why my colleague, Senator GRAHAM, and I are introducing this legislation. We are not talking about mandating negotiated prices. We are simply talking about making the data that is collected available to those who are negotiating for prescription drugs. It would simply require the Secretary, who already collects this information, to provide the average manufacturer price of drugs and the best price available in the market. 
   These prices are collected to implement the Medicare prescription drug rebate system. The rebates are based on those prices. But because Medicaid is prohibited by law from disclosing the average manufacturer price, or the best price, the market doesn't get the advantage of this information, and we are prohibited from knowing the price that Medicaid pays for each drug. 
   Let me say say parenthetically that it is generally agreed that the price Medicaid pays is in point of fact the best price. So this would be a very relevant piece of information. We can't say for sure even with respect to a federally funded program what we are spending on a particular drug. We don't know what Medicaid pays for Claritin, Mevacor, or Prilosec. We just do not know that. We know the total price we are paying for drugs generally, and what we are spending for drugs. But we do not know what we are paying for them separately. This information needs to be made available because making price information available will help purchasers and consumers alike. 
   Today, anyone can get on the Internet to find the lowest price available  for a given airline flight. I think the question needs to be asked: Why shouldn't the public have access to price information on something that is so critical and that may be necessary to save one's life, or to prevent the onset of some debilitating disease, or to ameliorate its impact, the information with respect to the average manufacturer price and the best price? 
   The bottom line is today there are no sources of good price information for consumers and purchasers, thus keeping prices artificially higher than they would otherwise be. 
   The legislation which we introduce today would be extremely helpful in correcting this. The market-based price information this bill would provide would help all purchasers, employers, and pharmacy benefit managers who are at a disadvantage without true price information. 
   Employers are struggling with increasing premiums. In large part, premiums are increasing because of rising drug expenditures. And, yet, employers don't have the information they need to assess whether the premium increases are appropriate. The answer to that is because without knowing the prices and the rebates that the pharmacy benefit managers are negotiating, they are not able to determine if the pharmacy benefit managers are passing along the rebates to them in the form of lower costs and lower premiums. 
   Further, neither the PBMs nor the employers know if the drug companies are being candid with them. When they try to negotiate lower prices with the manufacturer, they are told, no, we can't give you that price because it is lower than the best price. The employers and the PBMs have no way of knowing in point of fact whether it is true. The battleground is really a negotiation of what these prices are. That is the information we don't know. In effect, those who negotiate with the pharmaceutical industry go into that combat with one arm tied behind their backs and blindfolded as to what the average manufacturer price and the best price is. 
   Let me say that this piece of legislation is going to provoke an outcry. You don't have to have a degree from Oxford. You don't have to have a Ph.D. from some of our most distinguished institutions in America. Who would one think would dislike this information? My friends, the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to know. 
   Undoubtedly, the provision that is in the law today was crafted for their benefit. It certainly was not crafted for the benefit of employer groups, or health care providers who negotiate pharmaceutical benefits. It certainly was not put in to protect consumers. It is not in their best interests. 
   I am sure we are going to have a predictable outcry that some horrendous draconian thing will occur if we make these prices available. 
   My view is that transparency is essential. Make the prices available, and let this free marketplace that we all talk about that has produced such an extraordinary standard of living for us be the envy of the world. Nobody is suggesting that the free market could not, nor would, in my judgment, provide some of the dynamics that would help to keep the costs down. Let an honest negotiating process occur. 
   The lack of market-based information has an effect on the Federal budget--not only for consumers in terms of the medications they pay for but all taxpayers. 
   Whether in Congress--and I profoundly hope we will in fact--makes that prescription drug benefit a part of Medicare, or a subsequent Congress, this is an idea whose time has come. It will occur. It may not occur in my time. I leave at the end of this year. But it is going to occur. There are dramatic cost implications. Without the benefit of this information, it will be very difficult indeed. 
   Let's just talk for a moment in terms of prices, 
   information that is made available, and the generic formulas that we use for reimbursement. 
   Although the average wholesale price is not a true market measure price--this is set by the industry--it is used to determine Medicare reimbursement for the few drugs that are currently covered by Medicare. 
   The prescription Medicare benefit is very limited. I would like to see the Medicare prescription benefit extended through Medicare as an option, as we have a voluntary option under Part B. I don't want anybody to be confused, but there are some drugs that are covered in concert with the physician's prescriptions. 
   The average wholesale price minus 5 percent--what is wrong with that? What is wrong with that is this average wholesale price is a fix. It means nothing. It is the price that the drug companies get together and tell us is the average wholesale price. Yet that is the reimbursement mechanism that is used for Medicare. 
   Medicaid, which is a program, as we all know, that involves participation by the Federal and the State governments and made available to the poorest of our citizens, represents a rather substantial cost to the taxpayer. 
   My recollection is that cost is in the neighborhood of about $17 billion a year. 
   Here is how that formula worked. This is the Medicaid benefit: The average wholesale price minus 10 percent. Remember, this is a price set by the pharmaceutical industry; it is not a market-driven price. Multiply that times the units--whatever the number of prescriptions, say an allergy drug or a drug for elevated cholesterol level--times 15.1 percent of the average manufacturer price. This is the one we are precluded from knowing. Or take the average manufacturer price, minus the best price. This information we don't know, and we should be able to get this information. 
   What can happen with respect to the Medicare reimbursements--because the physicians who prescribe this medication get the average wholesale price minus 5 percent, we do not know what the physicians are actually paying the pharmaceutical industry for the drugs. According to the Justice Department, the Health and Human Services Office of the Inspector General, and our colleague in the other body who chairs the Commerce Committee, the average wholesale price has been manipulated in order to reap greater Medicare reimbursements. 
   The way that works, the doctor prescribes something covered by Medicare and reimburses the average wholesale price minus 5 percent. In point of fact, your physician may be paying much, much less to the pharmaceutical industry. So the spread is the physician's profit, and there is potential for abuse. 
   I am not suggesting in any way that a physician should not be compensated for his care. I am proud to say my son is a physician, a cardiologist. But you ought not to be able to manipulate the wholesale price--which is this fiction we have talked about--and then allow the physician to seek payment from the pharmaceutical industry at a price that is substantially less than what Medicare is paying. That gouges the American taxpayer. That is the issue that concerns us. 
   As I have indicated, drug companies have artificially inflated this average wholesale price, which results in these inflated Medicare reimbursements to physicians, and the manufacturer then in turn provides the discounts, and the physicians can keep the difference. If the average wholesale price of the drug is $100, minus 5 percent would be $95, and if the physician actually only pays $50, the physician is getting $45 as part of that spread. That is much less than he is actually paying. Medicare, conversely, is reimbursing the physician at a far greater price than the physician is actually paying for that medication. 
   The need for better information has never been greater. Medicare drug benefit is critical and should be enacted this year. I truly hope it will be. Accurate market-based price information will ensure the best use of the taxpayer dollars financing this benefit and the lowest possible beneficiary coinsurance; that is, the amount, the coinsurance, the beneficiary has to pay. 
   This should be an easy call. Transparency promotes a fair market. We are all for that, I believe. Price information leads to price competition. I think we are all for that. That 
   competition leads to lower prices for employers, for health plans, and for consumers. I think we are all for that. 
   So at a time when drug prices are increasing at two to three times the rate of the overall rate of inflation, referred to as the Consumer Price Index, at a time when the same drugs prescribed by veterinarians, for use by pets--the identical medication--are priced lower than the same drug prescribed by prescriptions for doctors' use for people,  at a time when the primary information consumers have about prescription drugs is through the $2 billion annually spent by the industry on direct-to-consumer advertising, and those ads never mention price --these are the things we are bombarded with on television; we see full pages in the leading newspapers in the country--at a time when Americans are traveling to foreign countries--to Canada and Mexico, in particular--to obtain lower prices, why shouldn't we be doing whatever we can to encourage competition in the United States and to lower the price of drugs sold in this country? 
   I think it is a no-brainer. I think we should set the market forces in action. We simply need to allow the public to have access to readily available market-based information. This is commonsense, easy-to-understand, easy-to-implement legislation. We should pass it this year. There is no new bureaucracy created. We can have the information at HHS. All this legislation would do is require it be made available. The potential benefits are enormous. 
   It will be interesting to see how this debate unfolds on this legislation because my colleagues have not heard the last of me on this issue. This makes a lot of sense, whether we do or do not succeed this year in extending a prescription benefit as part of Medicare. We ought to do it. We can do it. We should do it. I hope my colleagues will join me in a bipartisan effort to do so. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, earlier today, the Senator from Kansas, Mr. BROWNBACK, took to the floor and argued on behalf of a piece of legislation that would affect only my State and affect it in a very profound and negative way. The ostensible purpose of the legislation I think all of us can agree upon. I wish to put the discussion in context as I see it. We are talking about the illegal wagering on college sports, particularly wagering by underage college students, including student athletes. I think there is no disagreement that there is a serious problem and one that we recognize ought to be addressed in a very serious way. 
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) testified before the Commerce Committee, as they did before the National Gambling Impact Study Commission (NGISC), that there are illegal student bookies on virtually every college campus in the country, including some individuals with links to organized crime. I do not disagree with that assessment. The matter is so serious that some students have actually been threatened with bodily harm to collect gambling debts owed to illegal student bookies. I do not disagree with that assessment. 
   The NCAA has known at least since the three-part investigative series published by Sports Illustrated in 1995 that the illegal gambling problem on America's college campuses was widespread and growing. A recent University of Michigan survey found that nearly half of all male student-athletes nationwide--45 percent--gambled illegally on college and professional sports. A nationwide survey of NCAA Division I male basketball and football student-athletes conducted for the NCAA by a University of Cincinnati research team found that over one-fourth gambled in college sports. Sadly, a small number in each survey gambled on games in which they played. They were wrong. 
   Beyond the broader issue of the extent to which student-athletes, and students generally, gamble on sports illegally, there are the troubling cases of improper influence being exerted on student-athletes by those who seek financial gain from placing sports wagers on ``fixed'' games. This reprehensible conduct has reared its ugly head on occasion since at least the 1940s, particularly in the context of college basketball. 
   While the NCAA's recent rhetoric leaves the impression that such ``point-shaving'' or ``fixing'' of games is rampant, we can be thankful that the record belies the rhetoric. The two recent scandals of this type (those at Northwestern University and Arizona State University) took place over five years ago in the mid-1990s. The integrity of virtually all those who compete in college athletics is verified by the fact that there were a handful of such scandals in the 1990s out of the thousands of games played. While not a single sports bribery scandal should be tolerated, we need to know why they occur and by what means. The record is clear for those student-athletes who have violated the trust of their teammates and school by engaging in illegal sports wagering. As a result of their illegal wagering, they put themselves in debt to the point where they committed heinous acts of betrayal to pay off those debts to illegal bookies. 
   If merely passing laws prohibiting unregulated sports gambling were enough to stop it, the practice would not be so widespread today. Sports gambling has been illegal for decades in almost every state, and Congress acted in 1992 to prevent states from adding sports-based games to their state lotteries. The same statute, the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, also prohibits persons from engaging in sports-based wagering schemes, contests, and sweepstakes. 
   Similarly, wagering on sports of any kind, college or professional, is already a 
   violation of NCAA bylaw 10.3. A review of the NCAA's publicly available computer database of rules infractions cases indicates that, as of 1998 (the last year for which cases are posted), enforcement of bylaw 10.3 is infrequent and spotty at best. 
   The database reveals that the NCAA brought only 23 enforcement actions against student-athletes from 1996 to 1998, even though the University of Michigan and University of Cincinnati studies indicate that thousands of violations occurred. In some of the 23 cases, the violations centered on such routine practices as students wagering team jerseys with each other. In the face of organized student bookmaking operations with links to organized crime handling large sums of cash wagers, such an enforcement ``strategy'' is at best misplaced. 
   Against this backdrop of a serious national problem with illegal sports gambling, the legislation to which I referred, S. 2340, takes the very peculiar approach of targeting the only place in America where sports wagering is legal, regulated, policed, taxed, and confined to adults over age 21--the State of Nevada. Furthermore, the facts are that legal wagering in Nevada amounts to only about one percent of all sports gambling nationwide, 99 percent of which is already illegal. The  NGISC estimated that illegal sports wagering in the United States ranged from $80 billion to $380 billion annually. In contrast, legal sports wagering in the State of Nevada last year totaled approximately $2.5 billion, with roughly a third of that amount bet on college sporting events. 
   The central question then, which supporters of the legislation fail to answer adequately, is how does preventing adult tourists and conventioneers from placing sports wagers in Nevada affect what happens on and off college campuses in the other 49 states. Each of the attempted answers to this central question is completely unpersuasive. 
   First, the central premise underlying this legislation is that eliminating the small amount of legal sports wagering in Nevada will cause newspapers across the country not to publish betting lines or point spreads, thereby curbing illegal gambling activity. This notion is further evidenced by the committee report accompanying S. 2340, the Amateur Sports Integrity Act, which states that ``......point spreads are generated for no other reason than to facilitate betting on college sports.'' It is important to note that neither the Commerce Committee nor the NGISC took testimony from newspapers to determine if in fact they would cease publishing betting lines if sports gambling were made illegal in Nevada. Similarly, no testimony was taken to determine whether illegal sports wagering would be reduced even if newspapers ceased publishing this information. I made the point at the time of the hearing on S. 2340 that it's not too much to ask that such due diligence be conducted before a legal industry and its employees are legislated out of existence 
   Just recently the Newspaper Association of America broke their silence and shared their thoughts on this legislative proposal, and, not surprisingly, they completely refuted the primary argument put forth by the sponsors of this amendment. I'd like to share with my colleagues the content of their letter to the House Judiciary Committee. 
   This is a letter, dated June 7 of this year, addressed to the chairman and ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee. Let me read the operative provisions: 
   If Congress prohibits gambling on college sports, NAS believes newspapers will continue to have an interest in publishing point spreads on college games, since point spreads appear to be useful, if not valuable, to newspaper readers who have no intention of betting on games. 
   That is a pretty clear statement that this association, representing America's newspapers, believes, notwithstanding any legislative prohibition, that newspapers in America will continue to publish these point spreads on games. 
   The letter goes on to point out: 
   According to a national Harris Poll survey of 1,024 respondents conducted during April 7-12, 70 percent of respondents who read or look at point spreads on college sports do so to obtain information about a favorite college team and to increase their knowledge about an upcoming sporting event. Only 11 percent of the respondents said that they read or look at point spreads on college sports to place a bet with a bookmaker. NAA believes that publication of point spreads provides useful information to millions of newspaper readers, of whom 96 percent are 21 and over (MRI Spring 2000 Study). 
   Second, pointing the spotlight on published point spreads in newspapers fails to acknowledge that an individual can obtain point spreads on college games through many different sources. These sources include sports talk shows on radio and television, magazines, toll-free telephone services and the Internet. Illegal bookies on college campuses and in the general population will continue to set the betting lines independent of any published point spread. Anyone who is intent on placing bets on games can and will obtain point spreads, even if they are not published in the newspaper.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the NCAA has threatened for years to deny NCAA-sponsored tournament press credentials to newspapers that publish lines, but they have never done so. These hollow threats are further evidence of the futility of this exercise. 
   Secondly, we have been told that this legislation, while admittedly no panacea, will ``send a message'' to students and others that sports gambling is illegal. Again, there is a complete absence of any empirical evidence or fact-based testimony that America's college students, or adults for that matter, will heed such a so-called ``message.'' By this logic, we should reinstate Prohibition on serving alcohol to adults over the age of 21 to ``send a message'' to minors about drinking and to reduce binge drinking by underage students on college campuses. The absurdity of such an approach is self-evident, and it applies with equal force to this legislation. 
   The real message that this legislation will send is that shirking responsibility and pointing fingers at others is the appropriate manner in which to handle a serious national problem. Everyone should agree that a problem so pervasive on college campuses should  be addressed comprehensively and with a serious commitment from the NCAA and its member institutions, including federal requirements enshrined in appropriate legislation. 
   While we heard considerable rhetoric at our Commerce Committee hearing concerning what the NCAA intends to do about illegal gambling on college campuses, there was very little testimony concerning what concrete steps at NCAA has taken to date. For example, the chairman of the NCAA's executive committee testified that during the ten years he has served as president of his university, he could not recall a single case of a student being expelled or otherwise disciplined for illegal gambling, even though he acknowledged there are illegal student bookies on his campus. 
   We are repeatedly told by the sponsors of this legislation that the NCAA has plans to set up its anti-gambling initiatives. The facts belie the accuracy of those assurances. For example, the NCAA's total operating revenue for 1998-99 was $283 million. Within the overall budget, there was a line item for ``sports agents and gambling'' that equaled $64,000. Similarly, the line item for 1999-2000 is $139,000 out of revenue of $303 million. Only three of nearly 300 NCAA employees are assigned to gambling issues, and those persons have other responsibilities in addition to illegal sports gambling. 
   The NCAA's own presentations to the NGISC and in other venues indicate that there are many other important steps that should be taken, beyond what this legislation would do, to address the problem of illegal gambling on college campuses. The NCAA and its members have failed to follow through on the very steps they recommended to the commission just one year ago. For example, much was made at our hearing about the NCAA's use of a new public service announcement during the telecast of the men's basketball tournament. There was little evidence that this PSA was shown either frequently or during times of maximum audience exposure. Furthermore, there is no indication that the NCAA followed the recommendation of the NGISC and specifics PSA commitments be written into the NCAA's television contracts. A $6 billion, 11-year deal for the television rights to the men's ``March Madness'' basketball tournament was signed by the NCAA with CBS Sports after the NGISC made this recommendation in its Final Report. 
   There is a serious need for a combination of enforcement, education, and counseling initiatives to address illegal gambling by high school and college students. Unfortunately, the Commerce Committee took no testimony from those individuals on campus, in our states, and at the Federal level who are charged with enforcing the laws that already make this activity illegal. Similarly, we heard very little from professionals whose job it is to educate students about the dangers of gambling abuse and to counsel those who suffer from such problems. 
   Finally, while this bill directly impacts Nevada, let me suggest to my colleagues we should be alarmed by the precedent that would be established if this bill becomes law. For over 200 years the Federal Government has deferred to the State to determine the scope and type of gaming that should be permitted within their borders. The Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act preempted that authority as it relates to sports wagering, but only prospectively. If Congress sees fit to overturn Nevada's sports wagering statutes that have been on the books for many decades, it sets a dangerous precedent that should be cause for concern for the other 47 States with some form of legal gaming operations. 
   We all agree as to the serious nature of the problem. Unfortunately, the legislative proposal will do nothing to address that issue. 
   As I have said during my testimony before the Commerce Committee, this legislation is an illegal bookie's dream. 
   I yield the floor.

   Let me respond in turn. I have been privileged and honored to serve in that committee with him as chairman. We have worked on many, many issues, not only the athletic issues which we have addressed, but both of our respective jurisdictions are going to enjoy expanded air service as a result of his leadership, providing nonstop service to the Nation's Capital from our respective States. So I assure him my comments are in no way intended to be personal to him. It is a difference of opinion. The Senator from Arizona, who is a tenacious advocate and fearless defender of his own State, can understand the Senator from Nevada obviously has serious concerns. They are honest differences of opinion with the Senator from Arizona. I wanted to state that for the RECORD.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, this amendment would reduce the amount of money in a program that loses the American taxpayers a great deal of money--some $2 billion over the period of 1992 to 1997--and transfers $15 million into a program to help prevent forest fires in those areas which interface with the urban base. So we have State and local governments and the Forest Service all needing more money for planting. 
   This is totally different from the amendment the distinguished Senator from New Mexico offered which deals with reducing fuels that cause fires--a totally separate issue. This one is a winner for the American taxpayer, and it is a winner for the other people who live in those areas that can be affected by forest fires. 
   I urge the adoption of the amendment.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment with my colleague from Illinois that is a win-win for the American taxpayer and for those communities that reside near our National Forests. 
   The Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment will cut $30 million from the Forest Service's money losing timber program and shift $15 million to needed fire planning and preparedness activities. 
   Thee is a crucial need for increased fire planning on our National Forests. 
   Our amendment responds to the findings of a recent internal Forest Service report that found that the agency was violating its own National Fire Management Policy due to the lack of ``Fire Management Plans'' for each national forest. 
   The report indicated that fire management planning has not been a priority within the Forest Service, with less than 5 percent of the National Forests having current, approved fire plans. 
   The Federal Wildland Fire Management Policy calls for ``every area with burnable vegetation [to] have an approved Fire Management Plan.'' 
   The Wildland Fire program protects life, property, and natural resources on the 192 million acres of National Forest System lands as well as an additional 20 million acres of adjacent State and private lands that are protected through fee or reciprocal protection agreements. 
   In my home state of Nevada, we have a multi-jurisdictional firefighting organization known as the Sierra Front, which is comprised of federal, state, and local fire management agencies. 
   I might say, parenthetically, in my experience both as a former Governor and as a member of this body, the Sierra Front has done an extraordinary job in terms of coordinating and preparing its own activities and is relied upon by local, State, as well as national forest administrators for a coordinated effort. 
   There are similar organizations in other States, and all of these organizations depend heavily on Federal fire preparedness funds for necessary training and organizational planning activities. 
   The amendment we offer will provide an additional $15 million for the Forest Service to enhance its capability to prevent, detect, or take prompt, effective, official suppression action on wildlife fires. 
   There is a financial benefit, a cost-benefit analysis that needs to be considered. I bring my colleagues' attention to an internal Forest Service report issued earlier this year entitled ``Policy implications of large fire management, the strategic assessment of factors influencing the cost.'' I think our colleagues will be interested to know that this report concludes that estimates have shown that for every dollar of appropriated preparedness dollars received, there is a savings of $5 to $7 in fire suppression and emergency rehabilitation funds spent. 
   The point that needs to be made is, a little fire management planning goes a long way to reduce and to minimize the overall impact when fire comes because of the training, the planning, and the preparedness activities that go on as a result of that. That is a dollar savings to the American taxpayer and, in my judgment, is a very prudent expenditure of Federal dollars. 
   Unfortunately, notwithstanding this assessment, the myth that commercial logging is the best method of fuels reduction is driving some of my colleagues to appropriate more funds for the timber program at the expense of needed fire plans for national forests, increased education for residents on wildland boundaries, and on fire preparedness activities. In fact, to the contrary, it is widely recognized in the scientific community that past commercial logging and associated roadbuilding activities are the prime culprits for the severity of many of our wildfires. 
   Commercial logging removes the least flammable portion of trees--their main stems or trunks, while leaving behind their most flammable portions--their needles and limbs, directly on the ground. Untreated logging slash can adversely affect fire behavior for up to 30 years following the logging operations. 
   According to the Sierra Nevada Ecosystem Project report, issued in 1996 by the Federal Government,  
   timber harvest, through its effects on forest structure, local microclimate and fuel accumulation, has increased fire severity more than any other recent human activity. 
   In addition, a recent GAO report stated that:  
   Mechanically removing fuels through commercial timber harvesting and other means can also have adverse effects on wildlife habitat and water quality in many areas. Officials told GAO that, because of these effects, a large-scale expansion of commercial timber harvesting alone for removing materials would not be feasible. However, because the Forest Service relies on the timber program for funding many of its other activities, including reducing fuels, it has often used this program to address the wildfire problem. The difficulty with such an approach, however, is that the lands with commercially valuable timber are often not those with the greatest wildfire hazards.  
   Logging causes adverse changes in forest composition--intensive thinning and clearcutting dry out soils and leave behind debris that becomes tinder dry in open clearcuts. 
   Congress should invest in proactive fire planning and non-commercial hazardous fuels reduction projects as the best means of avoiding the high costs to taxpayers, damage to ecosystems, and risk to firefighters from reactive, unplanned, emergency fire suppression actions. 
   This bill contains $250 million for the administration of the timber sale program, which is more than $30 million above the Administration's budget request. 
   These expenditures for a money losing timber program are an enormous drain on the Treasury. 
   In their most recent Forest Management Program Annual Report, July, 1998, the Forest Service admits to losing $88.6 million from their timber program in FY97. 
   This was the second consecutive year that the Forest Service reported a loss.  
   In addition to the reported loss, the $88.6 million figure excludes a full accounting of all costs associated with logging. 
   In past fiscal years, independent analyses estimate the loss from below-cost timber sales are far greater than those reported by the Forest Service. 
   The General Accounting Office estimated that the timber program cost taxpayers at least $2 billion from 1922 to 1997, and in recent testimony they indicated that ``[t]he Forest Service is still years away from providing the Congress and the public with a clear understanding of what is being accomplished with taxpayer dollars.'' 
   Our amendment would reduce funding for the Forest Service's timber program by $30 million to the level requested by the Administration. 
   In spite of the fact that our National Forest supply a mere 4% of our nation's annual timber harvest, this bill continues to reflect the dominance of the timber program at the expense of other programs designed to improve forest health and enhance the public's enjoyment of our national forest. 
   Over 380,000 miles of roads criss-cross the national forests--that is over eight times the distance of the Federal Interstate Highway System--and, in addition, there are an additional 40,000 miles of univentoried roads. 
   The Forest Service estimates that over 80% of these roads are not maintained to public safety and environmental standards. 
   As a matter of public policy, I would argue that it makes more sense to maintain the roads we already have than to spend money building new roads we don't need for a logging program that costs taxpayers millions of dollars each year. 
   I urge my colleagues to support the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment to cut wasteful subsidies for the commercial timber industry and to enhance the Forest Service's ability to combat the devastating wildfires confronting many of our communities in the West. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will be very brief. I must say I have difficulty following the arguments of my friend from Idaho. First, I have no objection to--in fact, I am very supportive of it--the amendment offered by Senator DOMENICI last week. That has to do with hazardous fuels reduction, $120 million going to the Forest Service, $120 million going to BLM. I am for that. 
   As the Senator knows, that is a separate budget category entirely than the issue of the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment. That is a subcategory of fire operations. What we are talking about is preparedness money, a totally different concept. 
   The issue is not whether Lake Tahoe could be harmed. Lake Tahoe does not have a commercial harvest timber program as such. It is minimal. We are talking about the money that is necessary to do the hazardous fuels reduction. The Senator from Nevada is very supportive of that. The Senator from Nevada wants to see more money set aside for preparedness and planning which is cost effective. 
   Let me, by way of an additional comment, point out that the program which the Senator from Nevada supports is cost effective; that is, it saves taxpayers dollars. It is a savings. The argument that the Senator from Idaho made refers to a program that has cost taxpayers, between 1992 and 1997, $2 billion. We are subsidizing them. I do not think that is a particularly good value. 
   But even though I might not think it is a particularly good value, I have not sought to eliminate that program. That program would be funded, if the Bryan-Fitzgerald amendment were offered, for $220 million. That is what the President recommended. 
   So what we are simply trying to do is to reprogram some of that money into an area that would be cost effective, in terms of planning and preparedness--something that all of the agencies that interface with the urban, forest, local, State, and Federal support and favor--and simply reduce, by the amount of $30 million, the amount that would go into a timber harvest program that has been found, by the GAO, and other internal reports, to be cost ineffective in a substantial subsidy. 
   So the issue is not, as my colleague from Idaho suggested, whether you favor timber harvest in the national forests--that is not the issue we are debating today; maybe he wants to make that the issue--but the question of where you allocate the funds.

   Mr. BRYAN. I am not sure I would agree with the Senator from Idaho. Clearly, the hazardous fuels reduction program, in which we have provided, as you pointed out, 120 million additional dollars, would be the program that would address that issue, in my judgment. 
   I know other colleagues need to speak.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I preface my comments this afternoon by praising the distinguished public service of the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, the very able and distinguished senior Senator from New York, Mr. MOYNIHAN. Senator MOYNIHAN is not only a treasure for his own State; he is a national resource. This institution and this country will greatly miss his public service. 
   His years of experience have provided context and perspective for many of the policy debates in which we have been engaged since I have been a Member of this body and, more specifically, since becoming a member of the Senate Finance Committee and having had the opportunity to meet with him. He always acts in a gracious way, with much charm and considerable Irish wit and humor that makes every meeting of the Senate Finance Committee something special because of his wisdom, his insight, and the manner in which he presents his case. 
   I am pleased to be supportive of the alternative marriage penalty relief measure of which he is the prime architect, and I will discuss that more in just a moment. 
   My purpose in coming to the floor this afternoon is to oppose the legislation before us today. I do so with regret because it is my view that it would be possible for us to craft a bipartisan measure which would accomplish the result sought by those of us who believe the marriage penalty is unfair and should be eliminated. 
   Unfortunately, this measure will pass. It will do so on a partisan vote, and, most assuredly, the President will veto this measure and we will, in effect, have missed an opportunity to 
   alleviate a burden that millions of Americans endure, that is unfair, and that we could correct before this session of the Congress concludes. I regret that very deeply, and I am hopeful we may extricate ourselves from the situation we face. 
   This measure is described as providing relief from a marriage penalty. Let me say that it sails under false colors. No. 1, it does not provide the relief its advocates contend. No. 2, it provides substantial tax relief to those who are not facing a marriage penalty, who enjoy a marriage bonus, and to at least 29 million others who are not married at all. 
   Providing relief in these two other categories may be an area of legitimate debate and concern, but it could  hardly be argued that this is providing relief from an onerous marriage penalty. I much appreciate the support of our distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee to provide relief to taxpayers who are currently paying the penalty. As I said, this does much more and, I think in doing so, diminishes our effort to solve the problem. 
   My own view is that as a result of the surpluses that have accrued, we ought to be paying down the national debt and taking care of the Social Security and Medicare problem that is longstanding and that threatens to engulf us in those outyears as more and more people become eligible for that program. We ought to be providing a prescription drug benefit as part of Medicare and, yes, we ought to be providing some tax relief, but we ought to do so in a very targeted fashion. I believe that appropriately one of those targets is eliminating the marriage penalty, and I will talk more about the specifics of the proposal in just a moment. 
   The proposal before us not only is not targeted and is misdirected, in my view, it is also enormously costly. Although we are debating this matter in the context of reconciliation, a concept that I suspect is lost on most Americans who may be watching the proceedings of the Senate this afternoon, that is in a 5-year constraint. In point of fact, what we are talking about is a 10-year bill and a 10-year cost. 
   The proposal the majority advances would cost $248 billion. In my view, we squander much of the surplus that could be devoted to these other priorities and yet fail to achieve what the majority says is its priority, and that is to eliminate the marriage penalty. 
   Let me talk for a moment about what the marriage penalty is because not everybody perhaps understands it. Because of certain anomalies in the Tax Code, when millions and millions of married couples in which both are wage earners--a situation that has become increasingly frequent in recent years--combine their incomes, some married couples pay a penalty, and that is wrong and we ought to correct that. It is indefensible and, indeed, one can even argue that it is morally improper as well. 
   Twenty-five million Americans pay a marriage penalty, and that is the target to which I want to address my comments. 
   Because of the anomalies in the Tax Code, another 21 million Americans receive a marriage bonus; that is, they benefit by reason of the provisions of the Tax Code. In my view, that is not what the target ought to be. Those married couples will, under the provision of the Republican plan, receive a bonus on top of a bonus, and that, it seems to me, ought not be where our priorities are focused. 
   Let me point, if I may, to the chart to my right. The total cost of this plan, as I indicated, is $248 billion over a 
   10-year period of time. Note that 40 percent of those who will be beneficiaries under the plan--40 percent receive 40 percent of the $248 billion; 60 percent of that $248 billion goes to those who are in the bonus category; and 23 percent do not have any penalty at all, no impact by virtue of the marriage penalty. 
   Of the total amount we are providing in the form of tax relief, only 40 percent--substantially less than half--actually is targeted to the marriage penalty. That is on what we ought to be focusing our attention. Sixty percent of the tax relief provided in this measure has nothing to do with the marriage penalty at all. 
   Moreover, under the bill that is offered by the majority, we have individuals who will be affected. Some 5 million additional taxpayers will be caught up under what is referred to as an alternative minimum tax. The Republican proposal does not reduce the tax rolls of the AMT, or the alternative minimum tax; it greatly expands it. That is why I have called this proposal something that masquerades as marriage penalty relief because it is much more than that and, at the same time, much less. 
   The proposal the majority has advanced in terms of its ostensible claim of providing a marriage penalty relief is, at best, a half trillion dollars. 
   Earlier in my comments, I praised the ranking member of the Finance Committee, the able Senator from New York. His approach, it strikes me, does what we are trying to accomplish: It eliminates the marriage penalty, but it does so in a very targeted and specific way, and that ought to be the guiding principle. If we are serious about eliminating the marriage penalty and providing relief for those taxpayers, 25 million in America, that ought to be the focus. It is simple and is more targeted. 
   The reconciliation bill before us relies on a complex scheme of bracketed extensions, deduction increases, and allowance of personal preference. 
   One would have to have a Ph.D. from MIT to figure how the calculations are made. I thought, in the waning days of the 106th Congress, if there was one thing on which we could agree--both those on the other side of the aisle and those on our side of the aisle; those who find themselves to the right of center, to the left of center, and the moderates--we ought not to do anything to make the Tax Code more complicated. 
   Each summer, as I know a number of my colleagues do, I spend the entire recess doing townhall meetings across my State. Not surprisingly, there are different views as to what we ought to be doing. But no one has argued: You know, what you need to do, Senator, is, return to Washington and try to make this Tax Code more complicated. 
   May I say that the proposal advanced by the majority will add dozens--maybe hundreds--of new pages of regulations. By contrast, the Democratic alternative provides simplicity. 
   Taxpayers would be allowed a choice, not a difficult concept for us in America: If you benefit under the Tax Code, as a married person, by filing as a single person, that is your option, and you can do so--no ifs, ands, or buts. And conversely, if you benefit as a married person by filing a joint return, that is your choice as well. It is that simple. Whatever fits your individual need. It is tailored, it is specific, and it is simple. 
   That is what we are talking about. And I believe that is what we should be all about. Moreover, it is far less expensive than the proposal offered by the Republican majority--much less expensive. 
   It leaves monies to deal with the priorities I have outlined that I think most Americans support: Providing extended solvency to Social Security and Medicare and a prescription drug benefit, and, yes, to pay down that enormous national debt that exploded during the 1980s and early 1990s. 
   Moreover, the proposal that we advance, the one that Senator MOYNIHAN has so ably crafted, completely wipes out the marriage penalty--completely wipes it out--without irresponsibly awarding cash bonuses to those who already receive a break under the Tax Code. 
   While the majority's proposal only addresses a grand total of three marriage penalties in the entire Tax Code, the proposal that we offer would address every single one of the 65 marriage penalties in the Tax Code. It is understandable, it is simple, it is targeted, and it is comprehensive. It does the job. 
   I will illustrate this point of simplicity with an example, if I may. 
   I have asserted that under the plan the majority has advocated, it does not wipe out the marriage penalty relief for many. This chart I have here shows an example. Under this example, a married couple--wife and husband--each earn $35,000 a year. Their joint return reflects $70,000 in joint income. 
   As individuals, they would pay a tax of $8,407. But if they were filing a joint return, they would pay $9,532. Under the current law, they must file jointly. That is the marriage penalty. That is what we are talking about, probably not a situation that is too dissimilar for thousands of married couples--perhaps hundred of thousands. By virtue of being married, they pay $1,125 more than two single individuals with the identical incomes--the woman earning $35,000, the man earning 
   $35,000, who are able to file individually as opposed to a joint return. 
   Under the bill before us, only $443 of relief is provided. That is only 39 percent of the penalty. So to those couples who are in the situation of being led to believe that if the bill that has been advocated by the majority is passed, they are going to get relief, they are going to be very disappointed because they are not getting all the relief; they are only getting 39 percent. 
   Under the Democratic plan, crafted by the distinguished Senator from New  York, Mr. MOYNIHAN, 100-percent relief is achieved, the full $1,125. And how is that done? Not through a convoluted approach of either compressing or enlarging the brackets, or adjusting the deductions, or from some other kind of incantation in the Tax Code, with which we are all so familiar making our Tax Code such a complicated burden for the average citizen to fill out. By the simple provision--one line in the Tax Code--it is your choice. You may file individually or you may file a joint return. 
   Obviously, this couple would choose to file individually and in so doing would reduce their tax liability by $1,125. That is real relief. That is targeted relief. That is what our proposal is all about. It is easy to understand. It provides the virtue of simplicity. It does the job, and it is targeted. 
   I am going to conclude because I know the distinguished Presiding Officer has other matters to attend, and this Senator does as well. 
   I am hopeful that we can extricate ourselves from this abyss into which we are about to fall. Most of us in the Chamber agree that the marriage penalty is fundamentally wrong. We can solve it with a bipartisan approach, less expensively, simply, and completely by adopting this choice. I certainly hope that we do so. 
   I pledge to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I look forward to working with them and hope that we can accomplish it. The course of action that we are pursuing is a collision course. The wheels are going to come off this train. This proposal will not become law, nor should it, because it does not provide complete relief from the marriage penalty, but it does provide extraordinary tax relief to those who are unaffected in any way by it, for those who already receive a bonus. That is not the kind of targeted tax relief we ought to be providing. 
   Mr. President, I think from a parliamentary point of view, all I need to do is yield the floor, and under the previous unanimous consent agreement, we are in adjournment; am I correct?

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Virginia. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague from Virginia in offering a Medicare drug program. 
   For the 223,000 Nevadans who are Medicare recipients, no legislation we will debate in this Congress is more important for them. Two-thirds of them have either no prescription drug coverage at all or inadequate coverage--this at a time when prescription drug prices are increasing at a rate of nearly 20 percent a year. 
   I will talk about what this measure will do. First, it provides guaranteed and universal access to prescription drugs. Unlike some of the other proposals being debated, this benefit will actually be available because it is offered as an integral part of the Medicare program. Second--and this is important--the benefit is comprehensive and defined, simple. It is understandable. Beneficiaries understand what the coverage is, and it will not change from year to year or month to month. Moreover, this is the only proposal to offer complete coverage after the deductible. There are no gaps or limits. The bottom line: All seniors will be guaranteed access to affordable drugs and will have the peace of mind knowing that full coverage is provided for any and all expenses above $4,000. Any expenses for prescription medication above $4,000 are completely handled under this program. Third, this benefit is affordable for all beneficiaries. Those with the lowest incomes are provided the most assistance. 
   Finally, and critically, this proposal maximizes competition and provides choices. All of us who have been privileged to serve on the Finance Committee and to study this issue recognize the element of competition and choice as being an essential reform. This is not a one-size-fits-all program. Multiple private businesses are used to administer and deliver the benefit so there is competition at two levels: first, in terms of who are being chosen to provide the benefit and, second, those who are chosen compete and try to sign up beneficiaries for that program. So there is both competition and choice. 
   In sum, this amendment gives beneficiaries what they need most--long overdue coverage of prescription drugs--and it also injects competition into the program and provides choices for beneficiaries. It is the first proposal to offer universal, guaranteed, affordable, fully-defined comprehensive coverage, no limits, no gaps, no gimmicks. This proposal is for real. Beneficiaries will know what they are getting, and they will know without a doubt that the benefit will actually be provided. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the proposal of the distinguished Senator from Virginia. The time to act is now. 
   I yield the remainder of my unused time to the Senator from Virginia.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my colleagues in unveiling this important bipartisan legislation. Our proposal to offer a prescription drug benefit for all Medicare beneficiaries is sound, comprehensive, and workable. 
   We are introducing this bill for a very simple reason: the majority of Medicare beneficiaries lack meaningful prescription drug coverage, and we have an historic opportunity to do something about. 
   The inadequacy of the current Medicare benefits package is clear. It simply does not make sense for a health insurance program to exclude coverage of one of the most critical components of health care. 
   In 1996, 90 percent of Medicare beneficiaries had at least one chronic condition; drugs are frequently the best way to manage those conditions. Why offer hospitalization and physician visits to treat high blood pressure, heart problems, and depression, but not one of the most effective treatment options? 
   Many Medicare beneficiaries are faced with the choice of paying extremely high prices at retail outlets--much higher than the prices paid by those with coverage--or going without medically necessary prescription drug. 
   With bipartisan support and unprecedented budget surpluses we can give our seniors and those with disabilities another choice: to enroll in a Medicare prescription drug plan that is guaranteed to be accessible and affordable. 
   What should this plan look life? The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act contains several important provisions: 
   First, it provides prescription drugs as a defined, comprehensive and integral component of the Medicare Program. We need to be able to say exactly what we are promising seniors, and we need to make sure they will get it--the only way to do that is to include it in the basic Medicare benefits package along with everything else. 
   Relying on private insurers to offer this benefit ``would result in a false promise'' to use the words of the President of the HIAA. 
   Second, our bill provides the greatest help to those with the greatest need--beneficiaries with the lowest incomes and the highest drug expenditures. 
   We do that by providing additional subsidies for those with the lowest-incomes, increasing the government's share of coinsurance as the beneficiaries out-of-pocket costs increase, and income-relating the premium for high-income beneficiaries. 
   The bottom line: all seniors will be guaranteed access to affordable drugs, and will have the peace of mind of knowing that full coverage is provided for any and all expenses above $4000. 
   Third, ``The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act'' encourages maximum competition to achieve the greatest discounts, and uses the private sector to deliver and manage the benefit. 
   Finally, it is consistent with the need to strengthen and modernize the Medicare program overall. Providing drug coverage is the first step, but more work is needed. We will be introducing legislation soon that takes the next steps. 
   The bill we are offering today bridges the gap between the proposals offered by the President and the House GOP. 
   It gives beneficiaries what they need: long-overdue coverage of prescription drugs, and also injects competition into the program and provides choices for beneficiaries. 
   This is the first bill to offer universal, guaranteed, affordable, fully-defined comprehensive coverage--no limits, not gaps, no gimmicks. 
   Beneficiaries will know what they are getting, and they will know without a doubt that the benefit will actually be provided. 
   ``The Medicare Outpatient Drug Act'' is not a tough call. It will accomplish our goals of providing affordable, accessible coverage, and it will work. 
   This is legislation that Congress should enact this year. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to ensure that we do just that.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I realize this debate has raged on for some period of time this afternoon. I will simply make a couple of points in support of the motion to instruct conferees. 
   Fuel economy affects Americans in a very practical way. We have seen in recent weeks the escalating prices of gasoline, prices that have caused Americans who come to the gas station real sticker shock. These are some of the numbers we have seen: $1.54 a gallon on the east coast; in my own part of the country, $1.59. Those numbers appear to be going up. 
   The effect of this is to require American families who are dependent upon automobiles for transportation--that is most of the people who live in a western State, such as my own in Nevada --to have less spendable income for other family needs and requirements. If it is possible to reduce the amount of money they spend by increasing fuel economy--that is, getting more miles to the gallon--it makes sense for every family, not only in my own State, but across the Nation. 
   We are proposing lifting the gag rule, to strip the blindfold off, to unplug our ears, and simply allow the Department of Transportation to examine the technology of the past 25 years--because it has been 25 years since we have applied new fuel economy standards in America--and see if we can't get better fuel economy and still leave a full range of vehicle choice to American consumers. 
   I find it hard to believe that is not a win-win for everyone. It is a win for the consumer. It is a win for the American automobile industry. It is a win for the economy. Not only do we get better fuel economy and save costs for the American motorist, but we can also help to reduce our dependence 
   on foreign oil. 
   We are held vulnerable and hostage to a certain extent. We see that every time OPEC tweaks up or tweaks down the production quotas with an instantaneous response in the market. That is what has happened with respect to these increases. 
   OPEC recognizes how vulnerable we are. We import 54 percent of the oil consumed in this country; 40 percent of that is attributable to the automotive sector. OPEC knows, because of our dependence on imported oil, if they can get their own act together to impose some production restraints, they reduce their production, the cost to the consumer who is filling up his or her car with gasoline is going up. If we can be a little less vulnerable by reducing the amounts of oil we import, won't that be a good thing? 
   That is precisely what occurred in the 1970s. We were vulnerable then, as we are now, to events that occurred. We had the embargo, the fall of the Shah of Iran, and our economy was sent into a tailspin. Indeed, economically, the 1970s were a very difficult time for our country, as people who lived during that era will recall. 
   By passing the CAFE legislation of 1975, we reduced the amount of oil we consumed each and every day by some 3 million barrels. We are suggesting fuel economy standards are beginning to decline. 
   If one looks at the recent numbers, one will see that after two decades of progress, fuel economy averages are declining. In 1975, we got less than 14 miles per gallon on average. That peaked during 1988, 1999, and it has declined. The reason it is declining is that Americans are choosing to purchase trucks and sport utility vehicles. That is their choice. Light trucks and sport utility vehicles make up nearly 50 percent of the market. 
   Shouldn't we be able to look at the technology of the last 25 years and apply that and see if we might not get fuel economy that would make it possible for Americans to drive light trucks, sport utility vehicles, and get better fuel economy? Is there anything wrong with that? I am hard pressed to come up with an argument in opposition to that. 
   Here is what we have. From the time I was a child, I have been infatuated with the automobile. I have shared on this floor on many occasions the excitement I experienced as a youngster each new model year, going down to  the local dealership, peering in the dealership, and wondering what that year's model was going to be. 
   If I have been improvident in terms of my expenditures, probably in no area is that more evident than I have loved automobiles. I have purchased them, and I love them. So I do not speak as a Senator who has an antipathy to the automobile. I love my cars. I am very dependent, and I recognize most Americans are as well. 
   I say with great respect that this is an industry that has almost a Pavlovian response when it comes to suggestions that technology ought to be applied to improved fuel efficiency or some aspect of technology. 
   The auto industry had fought us for decades on airbags. I am privileged to join the distinguished Senator from Washington on this issue. He and I were instrumental in the conference of the reauthorization of the highway bill a decade ago to get that legislation requiring airbags. Today, many Americans survive auto accidents, and of those who have had injuries, their injuries are much less than might have been expected but for airbags. 
   The industry resisted catalytic converters and the industry resisted tenaciously in the 1970s this legislation that we called Corporate Average Fuel Economy. 
   I realize that is ancient history, but is it? One gets a sense of deja vu on the floor when one listens to the arguments against even permitting the examination of new CAFE requirements. The motion to strike simply deletes reference to a rider that has been added to the Transportation appropriations bill each and every year since 1995 that says that the Department of Transportation may not consider moving forward on new fuel economy standards. 
   The sponsors of this action do not seek to establish a numerical standard but simply to say let the Department of Transportation examine the technology and see if a new standard could be imposed that would enable us to apply technology, reduce the number of gallons of gas we need to operate our vehicles, save consumers money, reduce our dependence on imported oil, and also to clean up our air. 
   These are public policy issues. One is reducing our dependence on foreign oil. Another is reducing the trade imbalance, which every economist will tell you is a point of vulnerability in an economy which has extraordinarily performed in 112 consecutive months of economic expansion--without precedent in American history. But continued trade deficits of this magnitude are a problem. About a third of those trade deficits are attributable to the amount of oil we import. We could reduce our dependency. 
   There is not an American city of any size that is not concerned about air pollution. Most scientists will tell you, whether or not they have fully subscribed to the global warming theory, that it is not a good thing for us to continue to pump as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere as we are. With better fuel economy, we would reduce those emissions as well. 
   What is the response? Unfortunately, the industry has chosen to invoke scare tactics. In farm country they are telling America's farmers they may not be able to get and use a pickup truck. For those recreationists who tow vehicles, whether they are boats or horse trailers, they are saying they may no longer be able to participate in this particular avocation--whether it is boating or horseback riding--because we are not going to be able to build a vehicle that will pull a trailer, that will allow them to transport their boat to the lake, or their horse to an event where they want to race or show that horse. 
   They are telling others it will be impossible for us to produce the sport utility vehicles that they love, whether they love them for comfort, convenience, or to get out on the back trails of America and do a little off-road driving. They will not be able to do that as well. 
   Does this sound familiar? Those arguments, cast in the context of the 1970s, were the arguments that were advanced by the auto industry then. I must say, if the past is prologue, this would be a classic example. 
   In the testimony on the CAFE legislation in 1974, the Ford Motor Company testified as follows, referring to CAFE, which would have and did ultimately double the fuel economy that automobiles get, from less than 14 to more than 27 miles per gallon, in a decade.  
   This proposal would require a Ford product line consisting of either all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles--  
   Ford's smallest vehicle in the 1970s--  
   or some mix of vehicles ranging from a sub-sub-compact to perhaps a Maverick.  
   That was a small vehicle as well, slightly larger than the Pinto. That was 1974. All one need do is change the words ``sub-Pinto-sized and Maverick,'' and add in there ``light trucks and sport utility vehicles,'' that we would not be able to offer those if this proposal were advanced, and we would have the contemporary argument, the argument that is made in the year 2000. 
   Chrysler Motors said:  
   In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines and car models, including most full-size sedans and station wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing sub-compact-size cars. .....  
   Does the resonance sound familiar to any of us? It was a pretty familiar line of argument. 
   And General Motors said:  
   This legislation would have the effect of placing restrictions on the availability of 5- and 6-passenger cars.  
   Nobody wanted that. Those were all tactics that the industry employed to frighten the American public. I am sure 
   none of the sponsors, in 1974--and I was not a Member of this body--intended to deprive Americans of vehicle choice. I do not think anybody had in mind to prevent American families from purchasing station wagons or four-door, full-size, six-passenger sedans. I can assure you, the distinguished Senator from California, Mrs. FEINSTEIN, and the distinguished Senator from Washington, Mr. GORTON, we do not. We do not preclude or attempt to preclude it. In fact, some of us own sport utility vehicles and we want the element of choice. All we are saying is please give us an opportunity to look at the technology that would be available. Those owners of those sport utility vehicles, if we could get 4 or 5 or 10 miles per gallon more, would pay a lot less when they go to fill up at the gas pump. 
   I say to my colleagues, whether you believe there is a precise number you can achieve, in terms of increased fuel economy--and some have indicated we could double that once again--or whether you believe improvements more incremental and modest are possible, under the current legislation, it will be impossible for us to do so because of a rider that restrains our ability to do so. That simply does not make much sense. 
   So all we are asking for is an opportunity for the Department of Transportation to examine that technology. One would have to be a neo-Luddite to believe that in 25 years, a quarter of a century in which more technology advancements have occurred than in any 25 years of recorded history, of recorded civilization, that somehow the auto industry is not able to take advantage of some of those technology improvements. 
   So we simply ask for this opportunity. I hope my colleagues will support our position. I know as I speak, there are some discussions occurring off the floor that may lead to a compromise. I hope such a compromise will be possible. But it is a compromise that ought to let the technology, not the politics of scare and fright, dictate what a public policy for America ought to be. If we can improve that, and reduce the cost that motorists have to use their cars for work or recreation, if we can make America less dependent on imported oil, if we can ease the balance of payments that creates a potential threat to future economic expansion, if we can reduce the amount of carbon dioxide that goes into the atmosphere, would that not be a good thing? Wouldn't Americans--Democrats, Republicans, Independents, libertarians--embrace that concept? Wouldn't the far left and the far right move to the political center and say, yes, that makes sense? 
   I believe it is possible. All we seek is the opportunity to let American technology try. I suppose, if I have a quarrel with my friends in the auto industry, it is that they have less confidence than I do in themselves and their ability. Let me say, what they did from 1975 to 1987 was extraordinary. They doubled fuel economy--doubled it. And they doubled it at the same time they provided a full range of vehicle choice.  
   By the early 1990s, the largest automobile built by the Ford Motor Company--the largest automobile--got better fuel economy than the smallest Ford automobile produced in 1975, the little Pinto. That is something about which to rejoice. I say congratulations. 
   I am proud as an American that that kind of technology was possible, and I simply say to an industry that in 1974 believed it could accomplish nothing: Have confidence in yourself. Let all of those entrepreneurial juices flow, and we know, when given a chance, American industry produces technological marvels that are the envy of the world; give us that chance. That is what we ask of our colleagues. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time, as we are working on negotiations. How much time remains on each side?

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a matter that will be before the body tomorrow. That is a motion to instruct conferees on an issue we have debated last year and in previous years dealing with corporate average fuel economy, CAFE. That is an acronym that many Americans are not familiar with, but it is something that can have a profound and important impact on their lives. Perhaps a little background will be instructive. 
   In the early 1970s, our economy was sent into a convulsion as a result of our dependence on imported oil, primarily from the Middle East. The OPEC oil embargo, followed by the fall of the Shah of Iran later in the decade, sent fuel prices skyrocketing, plummeted the economy into a situation known as ``stagflation,'' and the effect was devastating. 
   Congress responded in 1974 with a piece of legislation designed to make the U.S. less dependent upon foreign oil and to provide for better fuel economy, thereby saving American consumers millions of dollars each year in fuel costs and improving the quality of the air and reducing our trade deficit. 
   In 1974, before these CAFE or fuel economies were established for the first time, the average fuel economy of all vehicles in America was 13.8 miles per gallon. As a result of those CAFE standards adopted in 1975, the current average is 28.1 miles per gallon. That is slightly more than twice the average economy in 1974. The effect of that has produced each and every day a savings of 3 million barrels of oil that would otherwise have been consumed. 
   That issue was not an easy issue for the Congress to deal with in 1974 because testimony before the congressional committees suggested if such standards were required, and they were set on an incremental basis to be expanded over the course of a decade, it was asserted that terrible things would happen in terms of consumer choice and size of the vehicle. In 1974, the Ford Motor Company testified this proposal for the fuel economy standards, which ultimately doubled fuel economy, would require a Ford product line consisting of either all sub-Pinto-sized vehicles--some may recall that was the smallest automobile that Ford made at the time--or some mix of vehicles ranging from a ``sub-subcompact'' to perhaps a Maverick. The clear thrust of the testimony is, if these fuel economy standards are imposed upon the industry, a full-sized four-door vehicle would be impossible to produce. 
   Let me skip for a moment to the present. Today, the largest automobile--I am not talking about a sport utility vehicle--that Ford makes has better fuel economy than the smallest produced in 1974. There is, indeed, a full range of vehicle choice available to American consumers. 
   Chrysler Motors also joined in with the Big Three and made this statement in 1974:  
   In effect, this bill would outlaw a number of engine lines and car models, including most full-sized sedans and station wagons. It would restrict the industry to producing sub-compact-sized cars--or even smaller ones.  
   That was the testimony by Chrysler. 
   General Motors went on to say:  
   This legislation would have the effect of placing restrictions on the availability of 5 and 6 passenger cars--regardless of consumer needs or intended use of vehicles.  
   Once this legislation was enacted, the automotive industry, with 
   some of the best and brightest engineering minds anywhere in the world, went to work. Indeed, astonishing technological developments occurred and today Americans enjoy a full range of automobiles in terms of size and choice. We have been successful in saving 3 million barrels of oil each and every day, reducing to some extent our dependence on imported foreign fuel and alleviating, in part, the trade deficit. 
   Unfortunately, no new fuel requirements have been enacted since 1975. Once again, the auto industry is suggesting that if, indeed, new fuel economy standards are required, that customer choice, size of vehicle, and a whole host of safety concerns, will place the American public at risk. 
   I am not sure what it is. I happen to be an automobile buff. I am of the age that I can recall the excitement of the introduction each year of the new models, the changes and the configuration of lights, the chrome, the fins, all of the things that in my generation were pretty exciting stuff. And I love automobiles today. 
   So I come to the floor as a Member of this body not with any antipathy toward automobiles. I freely acknowledge both my dependence and my love of the American automobile. However, I must say there is something that  must be part of a corporate culture in the auto industry which has resisted over the years virtually any significant technological improvement dealing with fuel efficiency, safety, or air pollution. 
   For decades, the automobile industry resisted the introduction of airbags. It took my colleagues, Senator GORTON and I, a decade ago to get that language changed. Today, Americans have a choice in their safety. Many lives have been saved as a result of that. But the auto industry strenuously resisted that effort. 
   Indeed, when catalytic converter technology came online, even though the engineers acknowledged its significance, there was great resistance to requiring the introduction of catalytic converters. Our air is cleaner, our tailpipe emissions substantially less. Some of the major cities of America that still struggle with pollution now have perhaps twice as many vehicles on the road, but their air is cleaner than it would have been but for these technological advancements. 
   There must be something in the corporate culture of the automobile industry that resists this technology. These are remarkably able and talented engineers, the best and brightest. I wish they had more confidence in themselves. 
   We are placed in an anomalous situation wherein none of the technology that has been available for the past quarter of a century, 25 years, that might have enabled us to move forward and to improve fuel economy, to reduce our dependence on imported oil, has been used to help improve quality. 
   Since 1975, a rider has been added in the other body to this appropriations bill that prevents the Department of Transportation from even considering, even looking at any technological changes. In effect, it is a provision that requires us all to be deaf, dumb, and blind to any technology that has been developed in the last quarter century. I need not remind my colleagues and the American public that the last 25 years has been the most remarkable quarter of a century since human history was recorded in terms of technological advances; 25 years ago all but a handful of people would have been totally mystified if the term ``Internet'' was used. E-commerce was not a part of our conversation. Nobody discussed e-mail or m-commerce. Indeed, most Americans had never heard of cellular telephones. I just cite but two of the more obvious and more dramatic technological changes that have had a profound impact upon our economy. 
   Here are the facts that we confront today. Unfortunately, once again in America we are becoming increasingly dependent on foreign oil. Mr. President, 54 percent of the oil consumed in America is imported. 
   That leaves us vulnerable to the vicissitudes of foreign policy considerations, instabilities, and political crises in the other parts of the world. Our thirst for fuel continues. Now, even more timely, we are seeing the price of gasoline rise to record levels. Earlier in the year it achieved a high point, then dropped down, and now, with the onset of the heavy driving season in the summer, we are seeing those prices increase. So Americans are beginning to get hit in the pocketbook. About 40 percent of all the oil we consume in America is consumed by automobiles and light trucks or the sport utility vehicles. 
   So we have an opportunity to consider a number of public policy issues. No. 1, is it possible to achieve improved fuel economy, still leaving us a range of choice in selection of our vehicles? Would anyone argue that would be a bad result if it could be achieved? Fuel costs are responsible for roughly a third of the enormous trade deficit we generate each year in this country, the one economic indicator--in a field which otherwise has nothing but bright horizons in front of us--that is troubling to us economically. We cannot long sustain those kinds of trade imbalances, not for an indefinite period of time. 
   So we have the opportunity, by a policy initiative, to perhaps reduce at least the one-third of that trade deficit that is attributed to the foreign oil we import each year. Would anyone argue it would be a bad policy for us to be less dependent and, therefore, to reduce our trade deficit to an extent by improving fuel economy? I think not. 
   I believe this past winter was the warmest on record in the Northeast. There is no question dramatic changes are occurring to our climate. Not everyone will agree those are attributable to global warming, but I think there is a growing consensus in the scientific sector that global warming is for real, that there is an impact that is occurring. One of the elements that contributes to that global warming is carbon dioxide emissions. With improved fuel economy, we reduce those emissions. 
   So there are three public policy initiatives that could all benefit if we could improve fuel economy. We would reduce the amount of fuel we consume in the automotive sector; we could reduce our trade imbalance; we could improve the quality of air; and as Americans are increasingly concerned about the price of filling up at the gas station, we could save Americans millions and millions of dollars each year. 
   Notwithstanding all those positive public policy potentials, we are left with a situation that the legislation before us will preclude the Department of Transportation from even looking at the possibility that an increase could occur. So the purpose of the motion to strike, which Senator GORTON and Senator FEINSTEIN and I and others will be offering tomorrow, is not to set a standard at a precise or numerical number--that was done in 1975--but simply permitting the Department of Transportation to examine the technology that has been developed in the last 25 years. 
   I believe it is almost impossible to argue that in a quarter of a century there is not new technology that could be applied to automobile efficiency that would not enable us to improve fuel economy. To resist that argument is akin to saying, as some did in the early part of the 19th century, we ought to lock up the U.S. Patent Office and close it down because everything that can be invented has already been invented; there are no new inventions. That is utter folly. We know the technology of the last 25 years has been remarkable, 
   extensive, and pervasive in its impact. 
   So our plea tomorrow as we go to the floor will be: Unmuzzle, unshackle, allow us to remove the blindfold and look at the technology in a way we can improve fuel economy, in a way that will produce real benefits for consumers, reducing the amount they have to pay, helping clean up the environment, reducing the trade deficit, and reducing our dependence on foreign oil. 
   These are public policy issues that we ought to be able to examine without the restrictive riders that have been added each year since 1995. I look forward, as part of a bipartisan effort, to continuing this discussion and argument tomorrow as we further process this legislation. My purpose today is simply to alert my colleagues that this debate will occur sometime tomorrow and ask them--indeed, plead with them--to simply allow us to look at the technology. 
   We are not mandating anything. We are not setting any standards. We are not making any policy judgments or pronouncements other than let's take a look at what the technology of the last quarter of a century might make possible and see if we cannot get better fuel economy, particularly on the sport utility vehicles and light trucks that today make up such a substantial part of the product mix that Americans are purchasing for their personal transportation. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I do not believe any of my colleagues seek recognition. I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, as well as the distinguished ranking member, for agreeing to accept this critical amendment relating to full-time manning for the National Guard. Both of these leaders have been strongly supportive of our efforts, past and present, to ensure that the National Guard has the resources it needs to perform its dual missions, and I want to express my personal gratitude for their leadership and support of the National Guard over the course of several years. 
   As co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, there is clearly no higher priority for the National Guard in this fiscal year than the need to provide sufficient resources for full-time operational support. These full-time personnel are the backbone of the National Guard, and make no mistake about it, if we fail to provide sufficient full-time support, there will be a noticeable and precipitous decline in the ability of the National Guard to fulfill its mission both to the states and as part of the National Force Structure. 
   The amendment we are offering today will authorize $38 million to provide an additional 526 AGRs and 771 Technicians for the Army National Guard. Frankly, Mr. President, I would have liked to have gone further, and provided the Guard with the personnel they need to achieve the minimal personnel levels identified by the National Guard Bureau of 23,500 AGRs and 25,500 Technicians. But like the incremental increases that were provided last year, this amendment represents an important step towards achieving that overall goal. 
   Our amendment has well over 60 cosponsors from both sides of the aisles. Not many issues attract this much support from across the ideological spectrum, and I interpret that as a Senate endorsement of the critical missions the National Guard performs, ranging from providing important emergency and other support services to their states, to participating in international peacekeeping missions across the globe, including Bosnia and Kosovo. It should be noted that both the Senate majority leader and the Senate minority leader are original cosponsors, as are the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The amendment is also supported by the National Guard Bureau, the National Guard Association of the United States, the Adjutants General Association of the United States, and other organizations. 
   The National Guard represents 34 percent of our Total Force Army Strength and 19 percent of our Total Air Force Strength. Nearly half a million Americans serve in the National Guard, playing a critical complementary role to their active duty counterparts, and we have an obligation and a responsibility to make sure every Guard unit and armory across the country has the support personnel it requires to function efficiently and effectively. 
   I am hopeful that with such broad, bipartisan support from the members of the Senate and the Armed Services Committee, we can continue to provide the resources required by the National Guard that will allow these dedicated Americans to perform their mission in support of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I want to thank my fellow co-chairman of the Senate National Guard Caucus, Senator BOND, for his authorship and leadership on this amendment. Senator BOND continues to demonstrate an impassioned commitment to the National Guard, our reserve components, and all of our Armed Forces. I also wish to recognize and thank Mr. James Pitchford and Ms. Shelby Bell of Senator BOND's staff for their hard work on this successful, bipartisan effort.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, the quality of education in this country is of enormous concern to the American people, and is a defining issue in Congress this year. I believe that few priorities are more important than the future of our Nation's youth. When Americans lack education and skills, demands on Government support rise, and the long-term financial costs to the Nation are enormous. Our primary goal during this debate is to find the best way to bring every one of our students up to a high level of academic performance, in order that they may be successful, contributing members of the national and global economy. 
   As a former Governor of Nevada, I believe that education is first a State and local responsibility. Creative and innovative education programs have been initiated by many governors at the state level, and the local school districts who interact with students and families in their communities on a daily basis are better positioned than federal bureaucrats to identify their schools' specific needs, and to target the appropriate resources to meet these needs. 
   The primary purpose of the New Democrat amendment to the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, introduced by Senators LIEBERMAN and BAYH and of which I am a cosponsor, is to deliver better educational results by helping states and local school districts raise academic achievement for all children. The amendment recognizes that the Federal Government has an important role to play in working with states and localities on education. It also calls on the Federal Government to work with states to strengthen the standards by which states and local districts are held accountable for increased student achievement, and at the same time, to give states the flexibility to choose the programs that work best for their districts and schools. 
   The Federal Government has assumed the specific responsibility of ensuring that all students, especially those students who face significant disadvantages, receive a quality education, thereby preparing them to function as successful adults and to lead fulfilling lives. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment fulfills this responsibility by setting clear national goals. These goals are to increase targeting to schools with highest poverty concentrations; to consolidate professional development and teacher training initiatives to improve teacher, principal and administrator quality; to help immigrant students become proficient in English and achieve high levels of learning in all subjects; and to stimulate ``High Performance 
   Initiatives'' by giving states money to choose what programs work best for raising the academic achievement of their students. States can use this ``High Performance Initiatives'' money to focus on priorities they deem necessary to the education of their students; priorities such as innovative school improvement strategies, expanding after-school and summer school opportunities, improving school safety and discipline, and developing technological literacy. These are all important goals. 
   More specifically, the Lieberman/Bayh amendment operates under the philosophy that getting money to those students who need it the most is crucial, and it strengthens our national commitment to targeting aid to disadvantaged students and schools. Under title I, the New Democrat alternative's formula sends 75 percent of new money to states and local districts with the highest concentrations of poverty. The amendment also distributes teacher quality money based on poverty and student population, and distributes money to help immigrant students become proficient in English and achieve high levels of learning by targeting aid to states with high concentrations of student with limited English proficiency. 
   Within the parameters of the Lieberman/Bayh amendment, states and localities get flexibility to choose what programs and strategies work best to raise their students' achievement. The amendment strengthens the decisionmaking authority of state and local officials by eliminating some of the strings that come attached to federal dollars. Under this new approach, states develop their own academic standards, their own assessments for measuring annual progress in student achievement, and their own goals for improving school performance. States also choose which initiatives and programs are of priority, and which will work best to raise academic achievement. 
   At the same time that states have this new flexibility, national interests and federal goals are protected and advanced, both fiscally and educationally. The new Democrat alternative does this by holding states accountable  for meeting the standards they set. Money is not enough to raise student achievement. Along with the added money and flexibility in the amendment, states and districts are given the responsibility of setting performance goals for their students, and of demonstrating clear progress towards these goals. 
   Not all currently funded educational programs produce the great results we are looking for. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment sets measurable standards so that 
    states and local districts can evaluate the programs they are using, and see what is and what is not raising their students' academic achievement. The states have the flexibility to choose the programs that work best for their student populations, but the Federal Government, under the Lieberman/Bayh amendment, holds them accountable for raising student achievement. 
   Under the new Democrat alternative, there are real consequences for chronic failure. For the first time ever, states that fail to meet the performance objectives under any title would be penalized. After 3 years of failure, a state's administrative funding would be cut by 50 percent, and after 4 years of failure, programming funds to the state under the ``High Performance Initiatives'' title would be cut by 30 percent. The Lieberman/Bayh amendment also requires states to impose sanctions on local school districts that fail to meet annual performance goals, and rewards states who exceed their goals by receiving even greater flexibility in using their program funding to meet their own specific priorities. In this way, Federal funding is directly linked to the performance of schools in meeting the goals the schools themselves have set. 
   In summary, the new Democrat alternative was written with the underlying philosophy that state and local officials are better positioned than Federal bureaucrats to identify their specific needs, and to target the appropriate resources to meet these needs. At the same time, the amendment sets clear national goals and holds states responsible for producing progress toward these goals. The current system is far less fiscally responsible than the Lieberman/Bayh approach because it does nothing to ensure that taxpayer dollars are getting a real return on their investment. In the Lieberman/Bayh amendment, the Federal Government maintains control and plays a role in setting national priorities in education. It also strengthens our national commitment to target aid to disadvantaged students and schools, and holds states accountable for producing results in exchange for the flexibility. In conclusion, I would like to express my support for the new Democrat alternative amendment, introduced by Senators LIEBERMAN and BAYH, because I believe it will significantly and positively reform the current education system, while successfully raising the academic achievement of all students.

   Mr. BRYAN. I yield myself 20 minutes. 
   The proponents of this legislation, who would have us override the Presidential veto, proclaim this is an environmental savior. In point of fact, this legislation is an unenvironmental travesty. It represents the most cynical assault to date on the environment. 
   I will respond to a general criticism frequently made. That is, that the deadline for the opening of a permanent repository in 1998 as contemplated in the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, enacted in 1982, has been breached. There is no permanent repository that will be opened for any time within the foreseeable future, in my judgment. The reason is that politics, not science, has been involved in this process, including proponents of nuclear power and, more specifically, the nuclear industry itself, and its advocates who appear on the floor. 
   Let me briefly, as I have on many occasions over the past 12 years of my Senate tenure, give a little bit of history. In 1982, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted by the Congress. It sought to search the entire country for three sites to be studied. Those would be sent to the President of the United States, and the President himself would select one of those sites as the repository location. It was contemplated there would be regional equity in balance, and indeed, some of the promising geologic formations in upper New England, the formations of granite, would be examined. We would look at the salt dome locations in the southeastern part of our States, and, yes, the geology of Nevada would be considered, as well, what was referred to as welded tuff. 
   That was a fair and balanced approach. Let science look throughout the country for the best sites. Those sites would be recommended. That did not occur. It did not occur because politics, not science, dictated the conclusion. No sooner had the act been signed into law in January of 1983 by then-President Reagan than the Department of Energy made a unilateral decision it would not look at the granite formations because the people in that part of the country would strongly resist the location of a permanent repository in their State. Is that science? Of course not. It was politics. 
   Then in the 1984 Presidential campaign, President Reagan assured those in the Southeast that the salt dome formations would not be considered. Was that science? Of course not. It was politics. 
   Then finally in 1987, legislation, which is infamously known in my State as the ``Screw Nevada'' bill, the  whole concept of the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act to search the country and truly 
   try to come up with the right science and the right location, all of that was cast into the ash bin because politics, not science, dictated only one site would be studied. 
   When I hear the lamentations about the delays and all the money that has been spent, it is politics that has caused that, and politics that interfered with the science of the process. 
   Today we have the most recent cynical political attempt to manipulate the process. In that 1982 legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency was selected as the agency to establish health and safety standards. Who better than the Environmental Protection Agency? For more than a decade, that was not questioned. 
   Then in 1992, there was, in the Energy Act of that year, an attempt to inject another aspect of the equation. The National Academy of Sciences was asked to review the process and come up with a range of recommendations. Make no mistake, the distinguished predecessor chairman to the distinguished Senator from Alaska has been debating as a great advocate of nuclear power and was advocating a position sought for the nuclear power industry. It was his hope and expectation that the National Academy of Sciences would somehow cast an aspersion and question the credibility of the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed regulations when they were issued. 
   We have the regulations now. Let me describe them briefly. This chart expresses the recommendations or the regulations proposed by the EPA in terms of the millirems of radioactive exposure per year per person. That is one of the standards involved. The EPA has proposed a standard of millirems. That is 15 millirems and is the only reason we are on floor today debating the veto override of the President. That is the EPA's proposed standard. 
   Now what does National Academy of Sciences say the appropriate standard should be? Remember, they expressed that in a range. NAS refers to the National Academy of Science. They are saying the range should be between 2 and 20 millirems; 15, by any standard, is in that mid-range. S. 1287 in its original iteration--not the bill before the Senate, but in the original iteration--proposed a standard that was nearly twice the rate of exposure per person per year, a 30 millirem standard. That is what the nuclear industry desires, the 30 millirem standard. The NRC has come up with a standard of 25 millirems. WIPP, a waste isolation facility in the State of New Mexico which currently houses transuranic nuclear waste, the standard set by EPA not objected to, 15 millirem. 
   Why the difference? Why are we debating this? Because the nuclear power industry does not want a 15 millirem standard; they prefer a 30 millirem standard. The legislation ultimately submitted by the President interferes with the Environmental Protection Agency in moving forward with that and seeks to delay the final rule of 15 millirems. 
   My friend from Alaska has pointed out his responsibilities as the chairman of this committee. I understand that. 
   I respect that and I respect him. But let's talk about what we are trying to do. We are trying to jury-rig, to skew this standard so that under every circumstance Yucca Mountain will meet the scientific criteria. The only way they can do that is to move the goalposts, and that is what the Senator from Alaska has indicated is his primary purpose. What he wants is to ``make sure that the measuring,'' referring to radioactivity, ``is under a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca Mountain.'' 
   That says nothing about safety--safety for millions of Americans, safety for several hundreds of thousands of people who would live within the affected vicinity, the 2 million people who live in Nevada. That is what we are talking about, health and safety. We are not talking about whether nuclear power is good or bad. That debate can be had another day. We are talking about health and safety. That is why many of us have become energized. 
   It is fair to say there are different ways in which these accidents have occurred, but I wish to illustrate the magnitude of the problem. With radioactivity, we are talking about something that is lethal, deadly, not for generations, but thousands of years--not only a few generations, but thousands of generations. We are not talking about a mistake we could make today and correct in the next Congress or the next decade or even in the next century; and we are talking about something that is lethal. 
   Our friends advocating on behalf of this legislation do not like us to point this out, but let's talk a little bit about the history, since history has been mentioned. In the dawn of the nuclear age, between 1945 and 1968, some 23 years, there were a series of accidents involving nuclear reactors and nuclear power. Some six people were killed as a consequence. I am not suggesting the circumstances are identical to what would be involved with the storage of high-level radioactivity, but I point out this is not just an academic discussion. We are talking about things that cause people to die--not get sick and then get well, but die. That is a very final medical judgment: Death. 
   In the Soviet Union, in 1957, a container of nuclear waste exploded and nearly 11,000 people were evacuated. We don't know how many people may have died as a consequence of that. Theirs is a society, unlike our own, that is closed. We don't get as much information as we would like. 
   In 1961, at Idaho Falls, ID, an explosion occurred within a reactor vessel that resulted in the individuals who were at the reactor site being impaled with a spent fuel rod. Two men were killed. To give you some indication of how lethal, how deadly this is, the remains of those two men who were tragically killed in that accident, by virtue of their contact with the spent fuel rod--and that is what we are talking about with the civilian reactor waste--by virtue of their contact, their bodies themselves had become high-level nuclear waste. It is a rather unpleasant thought but it is true. So in making the arrangements the relatives had to make, they were not only talking about selecting something that might be at the local undertaker's home; they had to design a facility that protected against high-level nuclear waste because the victims themselves had become high-level nuclear waste. That is why health and safety is such a critical concern for us. 
   We could go on and on. We had the Three Mile Island tragedy. Fortunately, that situation did not result in any loss of life. 
   Let me comment on Chernobyl for a moment, because, yes, I have referred to this legislation as the ``mobile Chernobyl.'' I do so because it involves some very serious issues. Last week, in the Washington Post--and I will yield in a moment to my colleague from California who has rejoined us on the floor, but let me finish this thought, if I may--the United Nations released an assessment of the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown that occurred 14 years ago, saying the worst health consequences for 7.1 million people may be yet to come. Then, in making the contrast my colleague from Nevada and I tried to make on so many occasions, in explaining in Chernobyl, at least 100 times as much radiation was released by this accident as by the two atomic bombs we dropped in World War II on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Then this article goes on to say:  
   The number of those likely to develop serious medical conditions because of delayed reactions to radiation exposure will not be known until 2016 at the earliest.  
   Yes, this is about health and safety; and do I get mad? You bet I do, because we are talking about the health and safety, not only of millions of Americans, but 2 million people who live in my own State. Do we want science and not politics to be the way in which these standards are set? The answer is you bet we do. I am greatly offended and outraged the suggestion would be made on the floor of the Senate that we should let politics dictate this health and safety issue because we want to make sure that, whatever the cost, we have to make sure Yucca Mountain qualifies. That was not the concept and spirit of the 1982 legislation, and it should not be the spirit that activates us today. 
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my colleague from California be recognized and, upon the completion of her remarks, I might again be recognized to take the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, for the remaining 5 or 6 minutes, let me just complete my thoughts on the issue of health and safety because I think this is the overriding issue. 
   EPA has proposed a standard of 15 millirems, consistent with what was done in New Mexico. S. 1287, in its original form, doubled this. We are debating this issue today because the nuclear utilities do not want the 15-millirem standard. That is what we are talking about. 
   One can have a difference of opinion as to whether or not nuclear power is good or bad or whether Yucca Mountain is or is not the proper scientific site. I might say, parenthetically, no one has ever made a determination that Yucca Mountain will meet the suitability standards. That remains to be seen. 
   But how in God's world can we say we ought to change a health and public safety standard, one that is set by independent agents? 
   Let me point out that the history of matters nuclear has indicated that we have underestimated the risk and danger to public health. In the immediate aftermath of World War II, we exposed military veterans at Bikini and Eniwetok to levels of radiation exposure that today would be absolutely a crime. In my own youth, while growing up in Nevada, watching the detonations at Frenchman's Flat, where they dropped nuclear bombs out of B-29s, we were told it is ``absolutely safe, don't worry about a thing.'' Today, we know that nobody in his or her right mind would suggest that anyplace in the world. Indeed, the tragedy is that people downwind from that died of cancer and have suffered from other mutations. 
   There are literally hundreds of thousands of people in this country who helped us in America prevail in the cold war, working in our nuclear weapons production facilities, in the nuclear testing program in Nevada, who were told the diseases that they suffered from and the suffering and the death that families had endured had nothing to do with radiation. Today, to the great credit of this administration and the Secretary of Energy, Mr. Richardson, we now acknowledge that it was wrong, that people did become ill, and people did die because of radiation. 
   Every person in this Chamber will recall in his or her own personal life how, and today, when you get an x ray at your dentist, or a chest x ray, the amount of radioactive exposure you have is much less than it was earlier because we are fearful of what the consequences of this exposure over a period of time can mean. Many will recall going to the local shoe store and getting on a fluoroscope; you could see the bones in your feet and your mom or your dad would look at that just to see whether or not you had the correct fitting. That was exposure to radioactivity. There is no place in the country where that would be tolerated today. What did we learn? We learned the risk of radioactivity is much greater than we had originally thought. 
   To conclude this aspect of my discussion today, the whole history of radioactivity exposure, in terms of its impact upon us as human beings, has been that the standards ought to be increased in terms of safety. We have done that in the private sector; we have done that publicly. Now this legislation would suggest that we abandon that, and that in the name of helping out nuclear power industries--utilities particularly--we should reject the health and safety standard. It was good enough for our friends in New Mexico, and I support that, but never objected to. We simply say, look, what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander. Fifteen millirems is within the range of the National Academy of Sciences. To do anything less is a cynical and cavalier disregard for the public health of citizens in America generally, and Nevadans particularly. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. In my 12 years in the Senate, I have to say this is the most unfocused debate we have had on this issue. We are not here today to debate whether or not nuclear power is good or bad for the Nation. We are not here today to debate whether interim storage is an appropriate response. We are not here to debate whether or not France has no pollution, as some have suggested, because they have nuclear reactors. I must say, parenthetically, I am not aware that France propels its automotive fleet through nuclear power. But perhaps we can discuss that at some other date. 
   Very simply, what we are here to talk about is a piece of legislation which the President of the United States has courageously vetoed that would alter the health and safety standards for the Nation. That is the issue. Every American--regardless of his or her politics--should be proud of the President's position. 
   Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have taunted our colleagues who support the position that my colleague from Nevada and I have been advocating, as well as the distinguished Senators from California and New Mexico today, saying: What are you going to tell your constituents when you return home? The answer that every Member can give, with a straight face, in responding to that question is: Look, I voted to uphold the health and safety standards of the Nation. I was not prepared for any industry, even though I might support nuclear power, to reduce the health and safety standards for millions of people in this country. I will not do it for nuclear power. I will not do it for anything else. I will not be beholding to a special interest. I am voting in the best interests of my constituents and the Nation in upholding public health and safety. 
   That is the answer. That is the most powerful response that can be given. 
   May I inquire how much time I have left.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I yield myself 10 minutes. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois because he has encapsulated the essence of this argument. This is not about science. This is about politics, as he reminds us. Because the time is short, I will respond to some of the issues that have been raised. 
   First of all, we have heard many paeans to the nuclear power industry. Whether you are for or against nuclear power is not the issue. I might say, parenthetically, there is nothing preventing any community that wants to establish a nuclear reactor from doing so. That is a matter of community choice. The fact that for 20 years no community has chosen to do so may tell us the concerns people have about their health and safety. 
   We have heard the Kyoto agreement discussed and interim storage. None of those are the issues. We have talked about why Paris apparently has less pollution than the United States because of nuclear power. All of these things have no relevance. 
   Here are the issues--and the only issues. The question is one of health and safety. Who is going to make that determination? Is it going to be the Environmental Protection Agency, which, by law, for 20 years has provided that standard? 
   What this is all about, when striped to the bare bones, is an attempt to circumvent the standard proposed by the EPA of 15 millirems. That is what we are talking about today. 
   My friend from Illinois is so right. They want to put this off until next year, hoping that a new political process, with a new President, might change the results in a measure far more favorable to the nuclear power industry. That is politics. 
   We hear over and over again the deadline of 1998 has been missed. It is true that the deadline for accepting the waste was missed in 1998. And where does the fault lie? It lies right here in the Congress. It is politics. Because the original nuclear waste bill said that we would search all over the entire country and look for the best geology, the best site. That was the science in 1987, when the legislation focused on one site and one site only. That was politics. The geology of that site is immensely complex. We will not know for some years whether or not that is scientifically suitable. 
   We are told about the costs that are incurred by utility ratepayers. Indeed, there have been costs incurred. But for more than a decade this Senator and this administration has said to each  utility that incurs costs as a result of not having a 1998 permanent repository open that we will reimburse them for the cost. 
   If in this legislation we said, look, take title and eliminate the potential liability that the reactor utility sites would have and compensate the utilities for any expenses they have incurred because of the delay, this Senator would support that legislation. 
   What is involved here is not compensation or reimbursement or delay; it is to change the basic science. Health and safety is the issue. 
   Let me say to my friend from Alaska, with whom I agree on many other issues, the area depicted by the photo, when he repeatedly made reference to Yucca Mountain, is 25 miles from Yucca Mountain. That is the Nevada Test Site. We are talking about an area that is totally geographically removed. 
   Let me talk about the issue that the nuclear utilities run all of these full-page ads, that rather than 101 sites--we heard today 80 sites--how about a single site? Just have a single site in Nevada. That is a bogus issue, a red herring. 
   So long as each nuclear reactor continues to generate power, there will be a nuclear waste site at that reactor. As those spent fuel rods are removed from the reactor, they are placed in pools about which the senior Senator from North Carolina talked. That has nothing to do with whether Yucca Mountain is established or not established. That is the way these spent fuel rods are first addressed. There will be storage at those sites for years to come if Yucca Mountain were determined tomorrow to be suitable. 
   The proposed site contemplates that, if approved, there will be a 25- to 30-year period of shipments. So the notion that somehow this legislation will establish a single site is a bogus argument. 
   Let me talk about transportation for a moment because that has been treated very lightly, in my judgment, by colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Transportation is a legitimate issue. We are talking about 43 States. We are talking about 51 million Americans who live within a mile or less of these sites. 
   This map shows the highways in red, the rail in blue, going through all of the major cities, particularly in the eastern part of the United States. 
   What about the accidents? The Department of Energy itself says over the lifetime of this disposal process, one could expect 70 to 310 accidents. 
   Each year in America there are 2,000 derailments. Each year there are approximately 200 collisions. We are talking about shipments of a magnitude that we have never seen before: 35,000 to 100,000 shipments over this 25-year period of time. 
   Although these casks have been described as having fallen from the heavens, in point of fact, the casks that the Department of Energy would like to use are much larger than any that have been previously tested. There have been no tests conclusively done with respect thereto. They are an earlier model. 
   What does this all really amount to? It amounts to congressional irresponsibility, to yield to the pressure of a special interest group that wants to change the rules that are designed to protect 270 million Americans. 
   Finally, I would say the answer to the question that the Senator from Alaska propounded--how do you explain, as a Senator, your vote to sustain the President's veto?--that ought to be a proud moment for every Senator. Because every Senator could stand up and say: I resisted the pressures of a special interest lobbying group, the nuclear utilities in America. What I voted for was what was right for the country and that is to protect the health and safety of the American public--270 million of us who rely upon the Environmental Protection Agency standard, a standard that was unchallenged for 20 years that exists with respect to the nuclear repository in New Mexico, the so-called WIPP site, at 15 millirems. 
   Remember, the original version of S. 1287--we tend to forget that is the bill before us, which admittedly has been modified--would have set health and safety standards where the American public--each citizen--could be exposed to twice the amount of radiation that the EPA has said is safe for us. 
   Is that what we really want in America, to set health and safety standards to accommodate the interests of the special interest groups, the nuclear utilities, or should we not as Senators, Democrats and Republicans, from the Northeast to the Southwest, from Seattle to Tampa, be saying that we ought to support the health and safety standard that protects the American public? 
   We can debate energy policy in America. That is a debate for another day. However, as Americans, how can we provide less safety, less protection than the Environmental Protection Agency? Every Senator on this floor knows, as do I think most Americans who follow the issue, the only reason we would propose to change the standards--not sites, as my friend from Illinois reminds us --is that it is politics, with the hopes that perhaps in November there may be a new administration that is beholden to the nuclear power industry and will make it easier, at the risk of public health and safety, to site nuclear waste somewhere in America. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to make a point one more time on the issue of transportation. This has often been characterized as an issue of Nevada versus the entire country. As more and more people around the country are aware of the implications for their families and their own security in terms of health and safety, we are beginning to get the attention of the public. Just this past week, the Deseret News in Salt Lake City, UT, strongly supported the President's veto. That publication does not have a long track record of being supportive of this administration and particularly this President. But it indicates the nature of the concern. 
   Here again, take a look at the routes that are involved in the transportation. This will occur around the clock for 25 to 30 years: 30,000 to 100,000 shipments. It is said that, gee, we have had transports before and nothing has happened. That is true; we have had no fatalities as a result, but we have had 58 accidents. I suppose before the disaster of the Challenger we could talk proudly about our space program and the shuttle launches that never had a fatality. 
   It is not a question of what the history has been as to whether or not there has been a fatality. We are talking about something of a magnitude many times greater, and I think our colleagues must look at that. There are many States--43 States and 51 million Americans. But it has been said repeatedly that we have to do something. The deadline has been missed, there is no question. But as I pointed out a moment ago, this Congress bears the responsibility. 
   It politicized the action. Had we let the Nuclear Waste Policy Act unfold as it was originally contemplated back in 1982, we might very well have had the solution to the permanent repository issue. 
   This health and safety standard ought to anger every American watching. It is cynical for a political and a special interest purpose--this is what this bill is all about, special interest legislation--to change a health and safety standard that is designed to protect the Nation. 
   Finally, just a reference that comes up again and again. We were told by someone obliquely that if we don't do something, somehow the waste will pile up and we will not be able to generate nuclear power. 
   Twenty years ago this summer, the same argument was advanced by the distinguished chairman's predecessor--that if we did not get, what was then referred to, away from an active program on line, we would soon have to shut down nuclear reactors around the country. It was not true then, and it is not true now. No reactor waste is exposed because of space. There is dry cask storage available, it is licensed, and approved for up to a period of 100 years. 
   Let's do this right. Let science and not politics prevail. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation for the leader's forthrightness in indicating that we have tried to accommodate each other in terms of the time. I recognize that, as the leader, he has a difficult schedule to maintain. This is an issue that for Senator REID, for me, and for Nevadans is of paramount importance. We think it is important for the country. I appreciate the spirit of the Senator's response. I appreciate the spirit in which the chairman of the Energy Committee has conducted this debate. We disagree, but he, as well, has been courteous and very responsible in the exchange. 
   I thank three members of my staff who have done an extraordinary job: Brock Richter, Brent Heberlee, Jean Neal, and previously Joe Barry; they have worked on this issue for many months, some for the past 12 years. I acknowledge and thank them for their efforts. Again, I thank the leader for his commitment. I yield the floor.

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Knights of Columbus of Nevada, which will be celebrating their 90th anniversary on May 10, 2000. 
   The history of the Knights of Columbus stretches back 118 years, when Father Michael J. McGivney founded the fraternal order in New Haven Connecticut on March 29, 1882. Since the order's founding, the Knights of Columbus have promoted the Catholic faith and have practiced the principles of charity, unity and fraternity. 
   When Father McGivney passed away in 1890, there were 5,000 Knights of Columbus located in 57 councils in New England. Today, the Knights of Columbus are the largest Catholic lay fraternal organization in the world and has 1.6 million members in the United States and twelve other nations around the world. Members of the organization and their families donate over $100 million to charities in addition to the 50 million hours of their own time that they volunteer each year. 
   Since May 10, 1910 in the State of Nevada, the Knights of Columbus have been committed to the highest ideals and principles of humanitarianism, and it gives me great pleasure to congratulate them on nine decades of volunteer service that has certainly enhanced and improved the quality of life for all Nevadans. 
   Mr. President, the members of the Knights of Columbus of Nevada, are truly deserving of recognition for their nearly century-long dedication to promoting the teachings of the Catholic Church, and for living those teachings by serving those in need in their community. I hope my colleagues will join me in offering congratulations to the Brother Knights and their families on the occasion of their 90th anniversary, and in wishing them continued success.

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senators LINCOLN CHAFEE, PAUL SARBANES, and FRED THOMPSON as an original cosponsor of the State Children's Health Insurance Program Preservation Act of 2000, and I thank Senator CHAFEE for his leadership on this bill. 
   This important legislation provides that Federal funds allotted to States under the state children's health insurance program for each of fiscal years 1998 and 1999 will remain available to the states through fiscal year 2002. 
   The enactment of the 1997 Balanced Budget Act's state children's health insurance program (CHIP was a seminal event in addressing the problem of uninsured children in this nation. The $24 billion funding reflected the seriousness of the national commitment to ensuring children will have access to health care services. It provided my state of Nevada and the nation with an incredible opportunity to address a most stubborn problem--the increasing number of children who have no health care insurance. 
   States were provided three options to provide child health care services through the federal funding allotments: to expand Medicaid coverage under enhanced Medicaid matching rates; to create or expand separate child health insurance programs; or to use a combination of the two. All options, rightly I believe, require the States to spend some of their own funds as a condition of participating in the program. 
   The choices states face under the CHIP program reflect the flexibility they wanted to tailor these programs, within federal guidelines, to the specific needs of each state to reduce the number of uninsured children. 
   Nevada's CHIP program--``Nevada CheckUp''--was approved by HCFA in August 1998 and began operating in October 1998. The program is separate from the Medicaid program, but the two are coordinated in the application process to ensure those children eligible for Medicaid are enrolled in that program. The Nevada CheckUp program covers applicants up to 200% of the federal poverty level, and children up to age 18. 
   Since its October 1998 beginning, Nevada CheckUp has enrolled over 9,000 children, representing almost 60% of the anticipated total eligible children. But there are approximately 6,000 children in Nevada who thus remain uninsured, who need health care coverage, and who must be found and covered. We can and must do better. 
   It took the state some time to develop its program, create a state plan, get state and federal approval, hire and train the staff and begin the marketing outreach and enrollment activities. In the one and one-half years the program has been operating, the state has learned what has worked successfully, and what has not worked. They are in the process of developing a new marketing plan, which will allow us to reach more uninsured Nevada children. The new proposal will use more media and broadcast tools to target the low income population. 
   The CHIP program is still in its infancy, and states are still learning how best to develop programs to provide children with much-needed health insurance. I am hopeful as this program matures, we will see a most successful effort to cover our nation's children, and ensure their health care needs are met into the next century. 
   Allow the states to keep their federal allotment for an additional two years should provide Nevada, and other States, the opportunity to reach the total number of eligible children, and increase the number of children with health insurance. 
   I sincerely hope Nevada will find the means to make its full match, so our state can draw 100 percent of its available federal funds. Wise use of these Federal funds, with a continued commitment to our children, and with a 100-percent effort by our state will get the job done. Our children simply deserve no less than a fully-funded effort.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the amendment offered by Senator ROBB, the effect of which would be to tie the consideration of any tax cut to enactment of legislation to provide a prescription drug benefit under the Medicare program. 
   For many in the viewing audience, this process may seem obscure and convoluted, but the budget is really an opportunity for us as a party and as individuals to make the case in terms of our priorities. We have a fundamental philosophical difference with our friends on the other side of the aisle who have offered a majority resolution which, in my judgment, does not reflect the priorities of the country. 
   In my view, our priorities ought to be to reduce the national debt. We have made enormous progress in the last 3 years. We have an opportunity to continue that progress. 
   Parenthetically, virtually every economist, as well as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, has made the case to us in the Finance Committee, on which I am privileged to serve, in the Banking Committee, and generally before other committees in this Congress, that the most important thing we can do is to reduce the national debt. But I believe it is entirely  appropriate to take some of that surplus and provide a prescription drug benefit. 
   The budget resolution before us offered by the majority would dedicate 98 percent of that surplus to finance tax cuts. In my view, that is not an appropriate priority. The priority, in my judgment, is to provide a Medicare program with prescription drug benefits. 
   In 1956, when Lyndon Johnson and Congress enacted Medicare, 
   it reflected a comparatively contemporary program. Prescription drugs were not a major part of the health care of Americans. Today, nobody would argue, if we were adopting Medicare, that it should exclude prescription drug benefits. Older Americans deserve the same benefits of modern science the rest of us enjoy. 
   Prescription drugs are frequently the best and indeed the only way to treat many of the diseases faced by the elderly. They have become an integral part of the health care system--every bit as important as doctor visits, hospital stays, and other health care services. Yet many seniors don't have prescription drug coverage, and most of those who do often have inadequate coverage. Thirty-four percent have no coverage at all--more than one-third of those on Medicare have no prescription drug coverage at all. And another 42 percent lack meaningful coverage. By that we mean the benefit is so modest, it still requires a substantial amount of out-of-pocket dollars to purchase the prescriptions which their physicians have prescribed for them. 
   Many beneficiaries have chosen managed-care plans for access to drug coverage. What is occurring is most destructive: 325,000 beneficiaries lost their HMO coverage this past year. For those who have not lost it in its entirety, many are left with very skimpy plans. Seventy-five percent of Medicare HMOs will limit coverage to less than $1,000 this year, and 32 percent have imposed caps of less than $500. That is not meaningful coverage. 
   With 22 million beneficiaries spending more than $500 annually on prescription drugs, and drug costs topping $9,000 for those seniors with cancer or chronic diseases such as diabetes and heart disease, the current HMO coverage can hardly be considered adequate by any standard. 
   Retiree coverage and Medigap are frequently no better. Retiree coverage is declining dramatically, and Medigap policies are out of reach for many seniors, with premiums averaging $1,360 a year. Indeed, in some States premiums greatly exceed that. For example, a 75-year-old Mississippian faces a Medigap premium of $2,379. That is a lot of money. Most beneficiaries do not have the ability to pay that. 
   Over half of the Medicare beneficiaries without prescription drug coverage are in the so-called middle class. I think it is important to note what we are talking about by ``middle class.'' That is a couple earning greater than $17,000 annually. I don't think anyone would conclude that $17,000 of total annual income for a couple is adequate, and few I think would consider themselves securely entrenched in the middle class if they were making $17,000 a year combined. This is yet another reason we need universal coverage--a policy that is affordable with Medicare prescription drug benefits. 
   Medicare is an extremely popular program. Prior to 1965, seniors faced a great deal of uncertainty when they needed medical care. The private sector had not responded by providing adequate, affordable insurance options, and indeed almost all of the elderly in America in 1956, 35 years ago, before the enactment of Medicare, had no coverage at all. They were uninsured. 
   With the creation of Medicare, we made a promise to our seniors that they would have affordable, adequate health care coverage. 
   While the program has been immensely successful, Medicare 
   today is in need of reform both to strengthen and to modernize the program. We have fallen behind in our commitment to those promises. We are once again faced with a situation in which the private sector has not provided adequate, affordable insurance options for prescription drugs, and three-fourths of the Medicare beneficiaries lack meaningful drug coverage. 
   The addition of an affordable, universal Medicare prescription drug benefit is only one step necessary in reforming the program, but it is a crucial step. Medicare prescription drug coverage is necessary to update the program and to keep pace with the times. It is critical to keep our promise--access to necessary care and protection from financial ruin--to the Nation's Medicare beneficiaries. 
   If we were creating Medicare today, no one would suggest we should create a program without a prescription drug benefit. Anyone who votes against this amendment will need to explain to his or her senior constituents why we, as Senators, have a prescription drug benefit but the more vulnerable seniors among us do not. 
   It is critically important for this Congress to provide prescription drug benefits. We have the opportunity to do so. We have the circumstances with respect to the budget that will permit us to follow our priorities of reducing the national debt and providing a prescription drug benefit as well. We should do so, and we should do so this year. 
   I thank the Chair. 
   I yield the floor.

Mr. President, as Vice Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, it is my great pleasure to congratulate the men and women of the U.S. Department of Energy, Nevada Operations Office, the National Laboratories, and affiliated contractors who celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Underground Nuclear Weapons Testing Orientation Program this year. This proliferation training course based at the Nevada Test Site has trained over 500 U.S. Government policy makers and analysts from the arms control, intelligence, and defense communities since its inception in 1980. 
   This course provides briefings by subject matter experts from DOE and the Labs, to include an overview of how the U.S. historically conducted atmospheric and underground nuclear weapons tests and effects tests, the basis for diagnostic experiments, the challenges of stockpile stewardship, and the process for executing subcritical experiments. Through lectures, discussion, and orientation visits to underground facilities, control rooms, former ground zeros, equipment yards, and nuclear test artifacts, the course provides hands-on experience that goes to the core of nuclear weapons testing. The course also provides essential information suitable to contrast with foreign nuclear weapons testing programs. 
   The efforts of the DOE staff in Nevada are to be commended. It is their dedication in the planning and execution of this course that will train the next generation of intelligence analysts, collectors, managers, consumers and policy officials with responsibility for nuclear programs, proliferation, arms control, and related disciplines. It is my hope that they will continue this essential training course for many years to come.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I express my appreciation to a very distinguished and fair chairman and the ranking member for accommodating this Senator. 
   I rise in strong support of the Senior Citizens' Freedom to Work Act, bipartisan legislation to repeal the Social Security earnings limit. 
   For a number of years, I have joined with my colleague, Senator MCCAIN, in efforts to repeal this unfair penalty. In my judgment, this legislation is long overdue. The earnings limit has unfairly penalized Social Security recipients who have chosen to continue to work and discouraged others from remaining in the workforce and contributing to our country's economic growth. 
   It is confusing to beneficiaries and it is difficult to administer. It is time to repeal the earnings limit and thus allow Social Security recipients who continue to work to do so without a reduction in their benefits. 
   It becomes very clear that the time has come to revoke this unjustified policy when we consider why it was imposed in the first instance. The Social Security earnings test was a Depression-era policy, originating nearly 70 years ago as a mechanism to cope with the high levels of unemployment. Our country now faces a very different dilemma--a tight labor market in many areas, including my own State of Nevada, which makes it difficult to recruit qualified employees. 
   It is simply illogical to prevent those who are willing and able to do so from joining the economy by working in areas that desperately need their talents. While many people choose to retire from their jobs at the traditional age of 65, or earlier, more and more workers want to continue working well into their late sixties and into their seventies. 
   One of the incentives, of course, for working beyond retirement age is the greater financial security that their additional income provides. However, for people between the ages of 65 and 70, the financial benefits of staying in the workforce are diminished by the unjustified earnings limit. Too many seniors, especially those with high medical bills, struggle on their very limited incomes. The last thing they need is a Government-imposed penalty. 
   Currently, for every $3 a worker aged 65 to 70 earns above $17,000, the worker's Social Security benefit check is reduced by $1. That is quite a disincentive to working. At a time when we put great emphasis on all Americans joining the workforce, it makes little sense to discourage employment for a large, experienced, and valuable segment of our population. 
   It is also important to note that the repeal does not adversely affect the long-term financial health of the Social Security trust fund. Eventually, the Social Security Administration would actually save money because it would not have to administer the complicated earnings test. 
   This, then, is a win-win situation for all involved. Seniors can continue to work and earn income without their 
   previously earned Social Security benefits being unfairly reduced while the Government is minimally affected. 
   Our colleagues in the House of Representatives have recently voted unanimously to pass this legislation. It is now our turn to do so, and I hope the Senate will act swiftly to enact this legislation to repeal this unfair penalty. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Reserving my right to object, and I assure my colleague I will not, I wonder if my colleague would be amenable to a unanimous consent request that following the 10 minutes the Senator is requesting, I be permitted 10 minutes as well. I make that request because unless I do so, at 11:30 I might be precluded.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair. 
   I hardly know where to begin because so much misinformation has been uttered about this piece of legislation. This is clearly a legislative vessel that is flying under false colors. There is absolutely nothing in this bill that says, look, it is going to be Yucca Mountain as opposed to anything else. That decision, in terms of studying it, has already been made. I regret that, but it doesn't alter the fact that only Yucca Mountain is being considered and that process goes forward. The bill has nothing to do with whether or not Yucca Mountain is going to be the site that is going to be considered and studied over the next few years, absolutely nothing. So vote against this bill. 
   With respect to the compensation issue, we have agreed for more than a decade, and this Senator has personally offered legislation to compensate the utilities. That is not an issue. We agree. This bill would pass by unanimous consent if that was the only provision that was in there. This Senator would be among the first to say that is fair. 
   What this is all about is trying to game the standards. That is what we are talking about. By and large, in its original form, this bill stripped out EPA. Now, games are still being played. Somehow it is suggested that EPA is being unreasonable. EPA has set a standard of 15 millirems, the same one set at WIPP, the transuranic for nuclear waste. In 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted, Congress thought 
   EPA ought to be the one to make that determination. Now, is it a fair, reasonable standard? Somehow this crazy myth has been spilled out all over the floor that this is an unreasonable standard. The National Academy of Sciences--and this is not a Nevada-based group; the ``N'' stands for National, not Nevada--has looked at the standards and said, look, the range should be between 2 and 20 millirems, and it is 15. 
   Any Member of this Senate can defend a ``no'' vote on this legislation on the basis that Yucca Mountain is going forward in the study process. Nothing changes that. All we are saying is, in the interest of fairness, don't play politics with the standards. And that is what is occurring. All we are asking is that the health and safety of Nevada be accorded the same protection that the good citizens of New Mexico and every other place in America enjoy. So by moving this into the next year, they are trying to play politics. Do you know what. The very perverse result of all of this is that it is going to result in a further delay, and that would be as a result of this legislation being enacted. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts. 
   I wish to respond to the gracious statement by the chairman of the Energy Committee. Although we have had strong differences on this issue, the differences have been professional, not personal. He has been very professional in the way in which he has handled this matter. He has extended us every courtesy. I appreciate that. I think his conduct and deportment reflect the highest traditions of the Senate. I publicly acknowledge that. Even though, in combat, we were forceful in our advocacy, as was he, this is something that is intensely personal to us. The Senator understands that. But I do thank him very much for his graciousness and professionalism. 
   I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Massachusetts.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I acknowledge that this piece of legislation, as it has worked its way from the committee to the floor, is better than its original form. But the old adage that you can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear is applicable to this piece of legislation. It represents exceedingly bad policy. 
   I am bemused by my friends who are advocating on behalf of this piece of legislation in that laced throughout their comments is the suggestion that somehow those of us who oppose this legislation are ``playing politics.'' I think it is important, once again, to recite a little of the history. 
   In 1982, when the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was enacted into law, Congress made a judgment. I think it was a sound judgment. Congress concluded that it lacked the expertise to set public health and safety standards. They chose the Environmental Protection Agency, which is responsible generally for setting health and safety standards, as the appropriate agency to serve that function. 
   I think that was a sound policy judgment. It was to use the language I frequently have heard on the floor, responsible. It was good science. It was responsible then and it is responsible now. 
   Had that 1982 piece of legislation gone unchanged, it would have set in motion a chain of events that would, in fact, have at least been, at the outset, predicated upon science and not politics. 
   As I have said before in this Chamber, I think that piece of legislation was a balanced approach. It would search the entire country and look for the best possible geological formations. We would have had regional equity so no one part of the country would bear it all; that three sites could be studied. Once they met the scientific criteria, they would be submitted to the President of the United States. The President would select one. I think that is fair. I think that is balanced. I think it is good science. 
   Let me respond to this issue of politics because I am both bemused and frustrated. 
   The first example of politics is the Department of Energy's own decision to eliminate one particular section of the country from any consideration at all in terms of being considered. That was the Northeast. The Department of Energy, in their internal documents, said: The political resistance will be too strong. We will never be able to get a site established in that part of the country, even though granite may be an acceptable geological material in which to place a repository. 
   What was that? Was that science? Was that responsible? It was politics--not politics played by the Senators from Nevada or the good people of my State but politics by the Agency. 
   As I stated yesterday, in 1984, we had a Presidential election. During the course of that election, the then-incumbent President said: Look, we're going to eliminate the folks in the Southeast. Salt dome formations will not be considered. 
   Was that science? Was that responsible? It was politics--not politics by the Senators representing Nevada at that time, nor politics by the people in our own State. 
   What occurred? In 1987, the law was changed so that only one site would be studied at Yucca Mountain. I have expressed my strong opposition to that. I do not like it. Was it science? Of course not. Was it responsible? Of course not. That was naked politics--naked political aggression visited upon my State. You have heard me characterize that legislation as the ``Screw Nevada Bill,'' as it is known throughout my State. That is politics--politics played by the Senate and the House of Representatives and the President in offering what was originally a balanced piece of legislation. There is not a scientist in the country who would argue that those changes were made in the interest of science or that they could be categorized as anything else other than a political decision. 
   My point is, this process, that was set out in the 1982 Nuclear Waste Policy Act, is self-executing. It sets forth the process as to how we ultimately make this determination. 
   What has occurred over the years is the injection of politics--originally on a regional basis and now, as we debate it on the floor, with the nuclear utility industry. 
   I suspect there are very few people who are listening to this debate who can define a millirem or tell us the difference between a millirem and a kilowatt. I confess that I am not a scientist. So let me try to categorize this as best I can in terms of what we are doing. 
   In the location of the transuranic waste storage facility in New Mexico, the Environmental Protection Agency, then as now, is charged with the responsibility of setting a health and safety standard. 
   These are the basic principles involved: A geologic repository designed to isolate radioactive waste from humans and the environment. That is  what is occurring at Yucca Mountain. I don't like it, but that is what is occurring. That is going forward. This notion that there is an overriding necessity to enact some new piece of legislation is simply not true. This process continues. Sometime at the end of this year, perhaps, there will be a finalized environmental impact statement, and a couple or 3 years down the road there will be a recommendation for site selection. None of that has occurred at this point. It may occur down the road. It has not yet occurred. No reason to act other than that the nuclear utility industry, in the middle of this ballgame, wants to move the goalposts because they cannot be sure the guaranteed outcome they seek, irrespective of public health and safety--namely, opening the repository at Yucca Mountain--can occur if, indeed, public health and safety considerations are allowed to prevail. 
   So we have essentially a geologic repository designed to isolate radioactive waste. The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant and Yucca Mountain share the same. The possibility of widespread contamination of both food and water sources and the human population likewise is a concern of the WIPP facility and Yucca Mountain. Radiation standards are to be established by the EPA to protect human health and the environment; that is true with WIPP, and those standards had been set at 15 millirems, and Yucca Mountain. 
   So I think the question has to be asked: Why should Yucca Mountain be treated any differently? Is there a scientific reason? The answer is no. It is a political reason: to accommodate a nuclear utility industry which exercises enormous power and influence in the Halls of Congress and, frankly, wants to change the rules of the game in midstream; not to protect public health and safety but to get rid of nuclear waste irrespective of the consequences. 
   We could talk about background radiation and all of that sort of thing forever and ever. I think this is the most important issue: Is the standard that was set for the WIPP fair and reasonable? I assume that it is. There was no controversy attached to that. Nobody said we ought to take the EPA out of that; we ought to put in the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. There was no objection to it. It moved forward. 
   Is the EPA being reasonable and responsible and scientific? I think the answer is clearly yes. The 1992 energy bill, which has been referenced in this debate, had inserted a provision which said the National Academy of Sciences needs to take a look at whatever the EPA standard is to see if it is reasonable and within a recommended range. They have done that. Here is what the National Academy of Sciences' recommended range. This is the millirems we are talking about, which simply means the amount of radioactive exposure an individual can have in a given year from this source. What was proposed at WIPP? Fifteen millirems. The EPA proposes 15 millirems at Yucca Mountain. 
   Now, S. 1287 in its original version, not the bill we are now debating, had a 30-millirem standard. What does the National Academy of Sciences say? I confess, I don't know the difference between 2 millirems and 3 millirems. I suspect if my colleagues are as forthright as I am, they couldn't tell the difference either. 
   The point that needs to be made is, the National Academy of Sciences--these are scientists; they are not politicians--says 
   that is a reasonable standard. They say the standard, to be reasonable, could be as little as 2 millirems or as great as 20. That is a reasonable standard. 
   What did the EPA come up with? Fifteen millirems. Why is this debate occurring? It is all about politics--not politics in Nevada but politics by the nuclear power industry because they want a standard that is less protective in terms of public health and safety. That is what this issue is all about: public health and safety. We would not be on the floor debating today if the nuclear power industry was not pushing and driving to weaken that standard the EPA has proposed. That is a fact of life, my friends. 
   Let us talk about the 4-millirem standard for water for a moment. I know my good friend from Alaska is privileged to be from an absolutely magnificently beautiful State. I have been to his State. I love it, perhaps not with the same passion and conviction he does, but it is a gorgeous State. The State of Alaska, unlike the State of Nevada, is fortunate that nature has been more bountiful in terms of the amount of water it has. Nevada is the most arid of the 50 States. Las Vegas, with a metropolitan population of more than 1.3 million, is the most arid of all of the major population centers in America. 
   When we talk about this 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water, it has been suggested that somehow that water would have to be extracted from the aquifer--that is the underground formation in which water is situated--and would be capable of being consumed at that very minute. That is simply not true. All the 4-millirem standard deals with is the amount of radiation. That water may have other contaminants--arsenic. It may have to be subject to a whole series of processes, whether it is a reverse osmosis process, which sometimes we have to use in southern Nevada, adding chlorine to it, or whatever else might have to be done to make it fit for human consumption. But what we do not want to do is to damage a water resource which a growing State such as Nevada will need in the future. 
   The notion that somehow we can cavalierly dismiss the notion of a standard to protect us in terms of safe drinking water is somewhat outrageous. Perhaps if nature had been more bountiful, we could say maybe that aquifer isn't all that important. Maybe we don't need to be concerned about it because we have water all over the place. 
   In point of fact, Nevada has marvelous geography. It is a State for which I have great passion, and I am eager to return at the conclusion of this year and the end of my term. But the one thing we do not have is a lot of water. 
   I think Mark Twain once hit it right on the head when he came to Nevada as a young man. He came believing there was a position as an assistant to his brother, who was the secretary of state during Nevada's territorial period of time. He wrote a book about those experiences. He talked about water. He said: Whiskey is for drinking, and water is for fighting. 
   In the arid West, water is life itself. Water is a resource that we protect because it is vitally important to us. This aquifer needs the protection, and the EPA, the agency which Congress chose, has said that a 4-millirem standard for safe drinking water is reasonable and is good science. That is science. 
   What is occurring here is a political effort to divert that standard from going into effect. I appreciate the candor of my friend, the chairman of the committee. We want to make sure that the measuring is under a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca Mountain. 
   That says nothing about health and safety. And as a Nevada Senator, that energizes me. It angers me. It makes me very angry and I don't like the process that has occurred. I do not like the fact that Nevada was designated in a ``screw Nevada bill'' as the only site to be considered. I don't like that. 
   I am opposed to that. But if it is going to occur--and that is the state of the record--that Yucca Mountain is the only place to be studied, why? And by what conceivable rationale, if there is any public morality at all, would we suggest that somehow the people of Nevada ought to be subject to a lower public health and safety standard than our good friends from New Mexico in the WIPP facility--15 millirems and 4 millirems for the safe drinking water? 
   As I have said, is it somehow that Nevadans are subcretins, less human? I am outraged at that suggestion or notion. As offended as I am by the process by which Nevada was selected--by politics, not science--the ``Screw Nevada Bill''--at least the people in our State, as this process moves forward, ought to be entitled to the basic minimum health and safety standards of the EPA. 
   Let me be clear. The EPA was not established by some left-wing, radical, commie sympathizer group of folks. This agency was brought to life during a Republican administration--the administration of Richard Nixon. In 1982, there was essentially a Republican Senate, and a Republican President made the determination in this piece of legislation--the Nuclear Waste Policy  Act--that the Environmental Protection Agency was the appropriate place for the determination to be made in terms of public health and safety standards. 
   So I submit that you don't have to know a lot about millirems, or about aquifers, and you don't have to know a whole lot about this issue to understand that the one agency that is charged by law with providing public health and safety, the Environmental Protection Agency, was charged with that responsibility 18 years ago in this act, and has exercised that responsibility with WIPP, and there was not a murmur--no suggestion--that that was somehow radical, that it was political, not science. 
   We are simply asking for no more and demanding that there be no less protection for us. That is really all you need to know about this argument. It is simply an attempt to reduce those standards. And somehow to suggest that unless we pass this piece of legislation, this process that began back in the early 1980s to locate a permanent repository cannot go forward, that simply is not true. This process continues. 
   We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars studying that Yucca Mountain facility to see whether or not it is suitable, and that is ongoing. That would continue, much to my regret, as I have indicated, if this piece of legislation had never been conceived or seen the light of day. 
   What is involved here is the nuclear utilities. Yes, sure, they would like the American Society for Nuclear Engineers to make the judgment. It doesn't give me, as a citizen, great comfort that crowd is going to be more concerned about my health and safety, that of my children and grandchildren--two of whom live in Nevada--but the EPA has a pretty decent track record, and it was not challenged previously--not challenged. 
   So what this is all about is to kind of bump this standard over into next year. Presidential politics. We know we are going to have a new President, and the hope of the nuclear utility industry is that a new President will say to the nuclear utilities, look, you can have whatever standard you want. I hope and pray to the good Lord that does not occur, but that is what this is all about. It is not necessary. It is not scientific, and it is not responsible to proceed on the course 
   of action that we are asked to follow in this piece of legislation. 
   I appeal to my colleagues in the name of fairness. All we are asking is to have the same measure of protection that is accorded to the good people of New Mexico with respect to their nuclear facility, which the Nevadans will be entitled to if Yucca Mountain is ever determined to be scientifically and suitably situated for the receipt of that waste. That is not an unreasonable premise. It is not an unreasonable request. We are not asking you to repeal the ``Screw Nevada Bill,'' much as I object to the political way in which our State was savaged for it. That is a fight for another day. 
   Having had that piece of legislation shoved down our throat, we certainly ought to be entitled, as human beings who happen to live, as I do, within 90 miles of that site, to the protection of the agency that is charged by law with protecting the health and safety recommendations, and that an independent oversight group, the National Academy of Science, says is within the recommended range. 
   What is wrong with that? The answer is, nothing is wrong with that except the politics that the nuclear industry would visit upon this Chamber and say: Look, you have to help us out; I am not sure we can make that standard. Reduce it, dilute it, kick it over until next year, and maybe we will get a new President who will be less responsive to the concerns of public health and safety. 
   I ask my colleagues, when we vote on this at 11 o'clock tomorrow, to reject this ill-conceived piece of legislation. It will be vetoed by the President and opposed by the EPA, opposed by the Council on Environmental Quality, and by every environmental organization of which I am aware. 
   It is said that this is an important piece of environmental legislation. Let me correct the RECORD. This is not an important piece of environmental legislation. If this is allowed to occur, this is an environmental travesty. I hope my colleagues will not allow that to occur. 
   I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, as is so often the case when it comes to debating the various legislative proposals related to nuclear waste that have been advanced since I have been a Member of the Senate, the issues generate more heat than light. With all due respect to the distinguished chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, much of what he had to say was utterly irrelevant to the situation we confront today. The chairman would have us believe that unless this legislation is enacted, nothing will occur with respect to going forward and siting a high-level nuclear waste repository. 
   Let me be clear. The process that was used to select that site is one to which I am strongly opposed. But in reality, if this legislation never leaves this Chamber--and it is my view it will never become law--the process by which Yucca Mountain is to be studied--or the scientific term, ``characterized''--goes forward. The time line that has been laid out is that sometime next year there will be a site recommendation; sometime in the year 2002 there will be an application for license; sometime thereafter there will be a construction authorization; and ultimately licensure will be approved if, indeed, all of the scientific questions that have been raised are satisfactorily resolved. 
   That is a process that began its course back in 1983. We continually revert to the history of this process to illuminate those who have not followed it and lived with it as long as I and my fellow Nevadans have, to try to explain the context in which this debate is occurring. 
   In 1983, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was signed into law by President Reagan. It contemplated--and I must say I think the scientific approach was reasonable--that we would search the Nation; that we would look for various kinds of geological formations in which high-level nuclear waste might be buried; that we would balance the burden, in terms of the storage of the nuclear waste, with some sense of regional equity. Three sites would be studied, or characterized, those three sites would be presented to the President of the United States, and the President would make that decision. 
   I was a newly elected Governor in 1983, and I believe the broad outline of that process, the approach, was reasonable; that is to say, a national search would be conducted, and among the geological formations that were uppermost to be considered were granite formations in the northeastern part of the country, salt dome formations in the Southeast, and in our part of the country the so-called welded tuff. 
   That was a piece of legislation that, by and large, sought to deal with this issue. I think, to use the chairman's terminology, that was a responsible approach. That was an inquiry that, although we in Nevada were apprehensive about it because welded tuff was being considered, nevertheless represented science, it represented a fair approach, and it represented some regional balance and equity. 
   May I say, from that point on, what has occurred with respect to the siting process should be referred to as an antiscience approach. It is blasphemy to discuss any kind of scientific orthodoxy in terms of what has occurred. Let me remind my colleagues what occurred that in no sense of the word could be justified as in the interest of science. 
   Early on, some of my colleagues expressed concern they did not want it to go to the northeastern part of the country. I 
   fully understand that. That had nothing to do with science, everything to do with politics. I have been in  the business a while. I understand that. And what occurred? The Department of Energy, in its own internal documentation, unilaterally decided we ought not to look at the Northeast. 
   Was that science? Was that responsible? I think any person who had an associate of arts degree in some area of science would conclude by no standard could that be considered a scientific approach. It was politics. 
   In the 1984 Presidential election, the issue came up as to those salt dome formations in the Southeast. What was said at that time? The President said: Look, not to worry, not to worry; we will not site it in a place where the salt dome formations are. 
   Does that have anything to do with science? Not even to look at it? To, in effect, blind ourselves and say we ought not to look at the salt dome formation? We ought not to look at granite? Of course not. And no sensible person and no scientist worthy of being called a scientist would ever assert for a moment that that had anything to do with science. Was it responsible? Of course not. Was it political? Yes, indeed. 
   Then 1987 comes along, and a bill which shall live forever in the infamy of congressional actions in our own State--the so-called ``Screw Nevada'' bill. Let's call it what it is. Remember, I indicated the original legislation contemplated there would be three sites that would be studied or characterized? What occurred in 1987? 
   In 1987, a decision was made to look only at one site, Yucca Mountain--exclude any other consideration in any other region of the country. Was that science? Was that responsible? You do not have to have a political science degree from Oxford to recognize that is politics--politics, not science. So when I hear this great paean to science and responsibility, I am compelled to revisit the history of this process which has been corrupted and perverted in every stage in the process where science ought to have prevailed. In every instance, it has been politics that prevailed. 
   So if I speak with some energy and if I speak with some anger, it is because we have been victimized, not by a scientific process but by a political process in which Nevada has been victimized, and I strongly object to that as a Nevadan, as a citizen. I hope my colleagues will reflect in a broader sense that what has occurred to us could occur to them in another context. 
   Having said that, the reality in which we deal today is that Yucca Mountain is being considered. This process we have talked about, these milestones, continues forward. So all this talk about nuclear waste piling up and responsibility, we have to do something--hopefully, we will do the responsible thing; hopefully, we will do the scientifically prudent thing. But in no sense is this legislation necessary for this process. I do not like its origin, in terms of the ``Screw Nevada'' bill, but it is going forward. That is, currently, as we are debating on the floor of the Senate, the steady process goes forward. The final environmental impact study is being finalized--not yet final. 
   Sometime late next year, we are going to have a site recommendation and sometime in the year 2002, or thereafter, an application for a license. 
   I say to my friends, no decision has been made at this point that, in fact, Yucca Mountain is suitable. That decision is yet to be made. Hopefully, it will be made not in the political way in which other decisions have been made, but it will be made in a scientific way. 
   The first thing I want to disabuse my colleagues of and those listening is that somehow there is a compelling necessity to have this piece of legislation enacted, that if it is not enacted, somehow this process I have described to you will stop. That simply is not true. From a Nevada perspective, I am not happy with that process, but it is going forward and will continue to go forward. 
   Let me, as a sidebar, try to address the red herring that is raised every time that somehow there is going to be some insurmountable problem in providing onsite storage. That simply is not the case. Those utilities that need to provide additional onsite storage can do so in a manner which is consistent with what the scientific community acknowledges, with a dry cask storage system, will be available. 
   In terms of dealing with the equities, about the ratepayers who have paid a lot of money, yes, they have paid a lot of money. That is not the fault of people in my own State. That is part of a process which has been very difficult, and I must say, rather ineptly handled by the Department of Energy over a number of years. 
   It is true, as the chairman pointed out, that 1998 was promised as the date in which a permanent repository or a waste dump would be opened. We have passed 1998. It is now 2000. That permanent repository, the dump at Yucca Mountain, will not, as I indicated in these guidelines, be available if ever--if ever--for some years to come. 
   Early on, as a new Member in the Senate, I recognized there was an equity argument, that to the extent ratepayers would have to pay for additional storage as a result of the permanent waste dump not being opened in the year 1998, there ought to be some kind of relief and compensation. I introduced legislation that said, in effect, to the extent that such delays occur, if they do, and if, indeed, as a result of those delays additional storage is required, the dry cask storage system is required, that whatever those expenses are ought to be deducted from the amount of money the ratepayers are required to pay into the nuclear waste fund. It strikes me as being fair. 
   That is where we begin to scratch the surface and find out that what is really involved in that kind of discussion is not fairness or equity, but the nuclear energy industry, through the Nuclear Energy Institute, has a very different agenda because, incredibly, they oppose that legislation. 
   Let me repeat that. For those who are listening who are ratepayers in States that have nuclear utilities, I was prepared and remain prepared today and agree with those parts of the bill that provide such compensation to any ratepayer who has been subjected to additional expense as a result of the permanent waste dump not being available ought to be compensated in some way, and the compensation should be reducing the amount of money the ratepayers are required to pay into the nuclear waste fund by an amount equal to the expense they have incurred. 
   That is equity. That is fairness. Let me repeat, that is 
   not what the nuclear industry is all about. They have no interest in that. 
   We have heard a good bit about responsibility and science. What we want is the best science, we are told. I do not believe that is what they want at all. Let me try to frame the issue and let me use the chairman's own words. 
   The chairman has said--and I appreciate his candor; we disagree very strongly about this, but I want to make it clear to him and others that this is not a matter of personal acrimony; it is a major policy difference. This is what the chairman said in the last go-round we were about to have. This is an article that appeared in the Las Vegas Sun, December 6, 1999:  
   What we want is to make sure that the measuring is under a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca.  
   ``What we want is to make sure that the measuring is under a regulation that allows waste to go to Yucca.'' 
   Not one word is expressed about public health and public safety, and that is precisely what they want. As my colleagues know, I will not be a Member of this august body this time next year, but I predict that if the nuclear utilities feel they need more legislation, they will be attempting to reduce the standards further.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
   Mr. President, and my colleagues, when we are talking about the financial institutions and affiliates and nonaffiliates, and international banking transactions, those are concepts which most of my constituents, and I daresay most of the constituents of all of my colleagues, see as having very little relevance to their lives. There are not too many people in the country whose lives are intimately involved, on a day-to-day basis, with affiliate sharing of information or involved in major financial transactions. 
   Most of us have an insurance policy or two, and increasingly--about 50 percent--American families now have stock ownership in some form or another. Most of us have bank accounts, and that is probably the extent of the average American family in terms of financial information. So I think it may be instructive if I put some context into this debate we are having. 
   We have experienced, in the decade of the 1990s, an extraordinary rapidity of change, if you will, in the way in which financial services--banking, insurance, and stock securities--are handled in this country. 
   We have also seen an enormous number of mergers across the board in American business. To some extent, it is almost a sense of deja vu because at the end of the last century, in the 1890s, we saw a tremendous consolidation of industry in the country. Many will recall that was a period of time in which we had vast industrial cartels and trusts. So there was an enormous concentration of wealth and power in some of these large industrial concerns that were just taking shape in the latter part of the 19th century. 
   In a sense, as the 20th century is coming to a close, that pace has quickened. The critics would say we are experiencing a sense of merger mania or merger frenzy. So many of the major financial institutions in the country are participating in that. 
   Just a couple of examples: Citibank and Travelers have come together; NationsBank and Bank of America--and I could point out countless hundreds. 
   What impact does that have on the average citizen in this country? I think it is fair to say, none of us really know. 
   The advocates for these mergers and consolidations are saying: Look. We will provide new convenience to the American public, we will have one-stop shopping for insurance and banking and securities; that it will be less expensive; that more options will be provided. That may, in fact, be the case. I think none of us know for sure. 
   The critics raise the specter that this concentration of power, this enormous business combine that is taking place across the whole range of financial services, may not be good for the country; that that kind of concentration of wealth, as we learned a century ago, may be bad for the public. I have not reached a judgment on that. 
   I was fully prepared to support this legislation because I recognize another reality. Historically, from the 1930s, banking, insurance, and securities were separated in three discrete and separate categories: If you wanted to have a banking transaction, you went to the bank; if you wanted to get insurance coverage, you went to an insurance company; if you wanted to dabble in the stock market or wanted to buy stocks or bonds, you went to a stockbroker. 
   That is the way most Americans have historically dealt with the financial services industry. That was as a result of legislation enacted after the great financial collapse of the Great Depression to protect against this consolidation of power that many thought was a contributing factor to the collapse of the financial industry in America in 1929. It is called Glass-Steagall. So if that name comes up, that is what that means. 
   I think that reality and fairness would dictate that the model which regulates those industries as three separate and discrete industries has no longer relevance in America today. Whether it should, whether we wish that was still the case, in point of fact several things have occurred. 
   Court decisions, decisions by administrative agencies, have, in effect, torn down those walls of separation. Increasingly, we are having a lot of those services, the banking and the insurance and the securities functions, kind of merged together. As a result of that, I think it is fair to say--and the advocates have made this point--the financial regulatory structure that emerged as a consequence of the Great Depression, the Glass-Steagall Act, no longer comports with the reality of the marketplace. That is fair and that is true. 
   So we need a new regulatory model, a new framework. This legislation has much to commend it. And it provides that regulatory framework. Essentially, we are saying in this legislation: Look, if you are providing an insurance service, you ought to be regulated by the same regulator, whether you are a small independent insurance office in Winnemucca, NV, or whether you are operating in the ionosphere of some of the major Wall Street concerns in the financial center of our country in New York City. That is called functional regulation. 
   So that is the background. 
   As I said, I had hoped to be able to support this legislation. I recognize it has been worked on for many years. The reality of this also has to be tempered by another reality, and that is the right of privacy. For more than a century, we have recognized in America the right of privacy. That right of privacy, as we know it today, is threatened and endangered. It is threatened and endangered by some of the marvelous technologies of our time. 
   Let's talk about financial services for a moment in terms of that technology. It was not too long ago that when you went to a bank, if you were going to make a bank deposit, you saw a teller, and he or she, by hand, posted, entered--there was kind of a carbon  sheet--the deposit in the record. 
   If you were applying for insurance, you manually filled out papers; your insurance agent compiled all of this, and he kind of kept a carbon copy. Twenty years ago, when we got into Xerox capability, he had duplication capability. The same thing was essentially true for securities. 
   What has changed all of that? Some very positive and powerful forces: Computerization. As a result of some software programs, it is possible to gather data and profile it, whether you are a bank depositor, whether you are an individual who is an insurance customer, or whether you are a stock and bond owner and you have your account with a securities firm. Just a stroke of the key now can bring that data up. What does that mean? 
   It means that if I am a marketer and I want to get a profile of somebody who, say, has an average bank account balance of $50,000, no longer would it be necessary for some poor devil in a green eye shade laboring in some dimly lit corner of some financial company to go through and pull the records manually. Today, a sophisticated software program can simply, with a key stroke, bring up that information. That information is very valuable. It is very comprehensive. Today, most Americans have an enormous amount of their personal financial data, the kind of thing that is very personal--their bank account, what checks they are writing and to whom, what kind of insurance coverages they have, their application indicating any health problems they might have--as part of a database. It is on a computer disk drive. What kind of stocks and bonds they have, what kind of certificates of deposit they may own and when they may come up--that database is there. 
   I think most of us have this vague concept that when we are dealing with our bank, when we are dealing with our insurance company, when we are dealing with our stockbroker, that stuff is confidential. Isn't it? Isn't that similar to talking with your lawyer about a legal problem or your doctor about a medical problem or even sharing with your local pastor, your rabbi, your minister, your religious advisor? Isn't there a privilege there? It is kind of confidential. Certainly you, as an individual, think it is confidential. You certainly do not have the expectation that that information is going to be shared. If that was your expectation, I regret to tell you that you are wrong because today that information, even without this legislation--and I will talk about that--is freely exchanged. 
   It is big money. It is big money in the sense that individuals who share that information--financial companies--share that information because they make substantial amounts of money as a result of that. 
   Let me give an indication in terms of what the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency has said: Most large national banks--this is without this legislation--sell customer account information to marketing companies. Those are the lovely people who call you at home during the dinner hour frequently or who inundate your mailbox with some type of solicitation.

   Mr. BRYAN. OK. We will try to do this quickly. 
   Let's talk about the expectation of what people think in terms of their privacy. I think this is an interesting number. The Wall Street Journal did a poll on what our expectations are and what we fear will happen most. Which one or two concerns are you most concerned about in the next century? Loss of personal privacy, 29 percent. This is not done by some do-gooder, ultraliberal social think tank; this is done by the Wall Street Journal, which is the voice of American business. And 29 percent fear loss of personal privacy. 
   When you ask people, ``Would you mind if a company you did business with sold information about you to another company?'' 92 percent say yes. Yes, they mind. The American people care 
   very much about that. They may not know the difference between an op-sub and an affiliate, or what a unitary thrift is, what a ``whoopie'' is. Those are all terms we have debated here. But they sure know what privacy is about. 
   ``In the future, insurance companies and investment firms may be able to merge into a single company. If they do, would you support or oppose these newly merged companies internally sharing information?'' That is what this bill permits. 
   Eighty-one percent say no. 
   Here are some headlines across America: ``Banks Sell Your Secrets,'' USA Today. Los Angeles Times: ``Privacy? Don't bank on it.'' Los Angeles Times: ``Your Privacy Could Be a Thing of the Past.'' 
   Let's talk about the bill because the bill provides minimal protection. First of all, it tells you the banks are required to post a policy of what their privacy policy is. Here is an existing web page with an existing bank in the country today:  
   Question 4: If I request to be excluded from affiliate sharing of information, what information about me and my products and services with you will and will not be shared within your affiliated family of banks and companies?  
   That is the question. Here is the answer:  
   Answer 4: Even if you request to be excluded from affiliate sharing of information, we will share this other information about you and your products and services with each other to the extent permitted by law.  
   This web page would be perfectly appropriate and legal under the new law. All that is required is a posting of the policy. Now, if anybody in America thinks that is an adequate protection for your privacy, I would like to talk about a little piece of property I have in New York called the Brooklyn Bridge, and we would like to talk about you buying it from me. Utterly absurd. That is what is happening. 
   Now, there is absolutely no provision--none, zippo, nada, zero, nothing--that prevents the sharing of information from affiliate to affiliate. No privacy at all. That is freely exchanged; it is freely exchanged. 
   With respect to the third party, the nonaffiliate, we are told, yes, there is an opt-out provision; that is, you can let people know you want that not to be done. OK, that sounds fine, except there are two major, glaring exceptions. Those are marketing agreements and joint marketing in which those provisions simply do not apply. So if the third party itself has a company that is involved in telemarketing, there is absolutely no prohibition against that information being shared. So in point of fact--and the USA Today, I think, has made a very telling commentary on that by pointing out that these provisions simply provide very little. I quote the October 28 edition:  
   A consumer's right to opt out of data-swapping arrangements is severely restricted. Consumers would not, for instance, be able to stop banks from sharing information with third parties that market a bank's own products; nor could we block data-sharing deals that involve products sold under joint agreements.  
   Further, it goes on to point out there is no protection against banks sharing information with financial or insurance companies they own. In fact, since the law would encourage such cross-ownership, a consumer's chance of stopping widespread information sharing likely would be minimal. 
   I simply say for colleagues interested in privacy, receive no comfort, my friends--none--that these very transparent and illusory privacy provisions really provide much at all. They provide virtually nothing, no protection at all with respect to affiliate sharing. 
   I think the protection with respect to a transfer to a third party with those two gaping loopholes--gaping--any attorney who has taken a single course in any kind of securities would easily be able to craft a loophole for his client that would make that activity perfectly permissible. 
   The bottom line of all of this is that those of us on the committee who offered an amendment which would have simply said, look, you have to provide every customer with the right to opt out; that is, to be notified that: Look, you have a right to opt out if you don't want this to occur, we are told, no, that would destroy the dynamics, the synergy of the marketplace; it could not happen. 
   Let me tell you, these very American companies--and they are premier companies and wonderful companies and successful, and as Americans we are vicariously proud of them--do business in Europe. 
   But in doing business in Europe, the European Union requires the opt-out provision. And the same companies that say American citizens should not have that privacy, that it would destroy their opportunities in the market and the synergies of the marketplace to provide those same protections that those of us in committee sought to add to the European counterparts--you will recall the U.S. bank situation. The attorney general of Minnesota took them to task. Guess what. As part of a settlement agreement that they entered into, they agreed as part of that settlement agreement to do what? To inform customers of the bank's privacy policy and to provide notice of customers' rights to opt out of the sharing of information with bank affiliates. 
   Think about that. U.S. banks as part of a settlement said they could do it and it would not compromise their ability to take advantage of the dynamics and the synergies of the marketplace. The largest and most successful financial companies in America that do business daily in Europe have agreed to be bound by those provisions, but they will not be bound by the provisions in this country. 
   So Americans have a very much depreciated right of privacy compared to their counterparts in Europe. I would simply say, Why? Why? I don't know what the answer is.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I will wind this up because the Senator from Alabama has shared this fight with the Senator from Nevada in committee and  in conference. I thank him for his leadership and his support. 
   The point I was trying to make is this is not an unreasonable request. If one of the largest banks in America, as part of a settlement with the attorney general of Minnesota, can agree to the opt-out provisions which a number of us on the committee sought to add, every bank can live with those provisions. 
   If the major banks in America that do business in Europe every day of the week can live with those provisions, I think we have to ask ourselves why would these companies not be prepared to provide the same kinds of privacy protections that either they have agreed to in a consent decree when they have been taken to court by the attorney general--in this case the attorney general of Minnesota--not be willing to provide the same kinds of protections provided to Europeans to people in America? 
   There was some debate in the committee. ``We don't want to impose upon the American economy the European model.'' No; I don't either. None of us did. The question is not do we want to impose the European model. The question that has to be framed is, why should Americans be entitled to less protection as to their right to privacy from the same company that is doing business in Europe and providing those protections to their European customers? 
   I must say that it was because of these overarching concerns--we have seen the examples; I believe they are simply the iceberg of examples today--the potential for abuse in terms of violating your fundamental right of privacy and the 
   most sensitive information about your personal life will be widely shared and disseminated. I think if you look at it very carefully, there is no protection at all in the affiliate area--none. A sister company can freely exchange that information with banks, insurance, stock brokerages, and the companies which those affiliates own. 
   With respect to third parties, the so-called nonaffiliate, if you look at those marketing and joint agreement exceptions, I have to tell you there is not much there. What you get, in fact, is the whole of the doughnut. That is not much protection. 
   My able colleague from Alabama and I and others, the distinguished ranking member of the committee, fought the good fight for this in the committee. We just believe those protections are inadequate. 
   I thank my colleague for yielding me the time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding the floor. I wish we were in a position to be discussing how we can protect Social Security, I think that is something the American people are very much concerned about; how we could extend the solvency of Medicare and provide a prescription drug benefit; campaign finance reform; minimum wage. I think those are the things the American people would like to see this Congress act upon. I regret to say this legislation is pure, naked, special interest legislation, and I want to give some historical perspective, since my friend from Alaska recited some of the history itself. 
   In 1982, the Congress of the United States passed the Nuclear Waste Policy Act. The original concept of that act was an attempt to deal with a difficult issue but in a fair and balanced way. In essence, what the act provided was that different geological formations in the country that might be suitable for waste--granite in the Northeast, salt domes in the Southeast, welded tuff in parts of the West--would be considered and studied; three sites would be referred to the President of the United States after the study, or, as the technical term is used, ``characterization'' is completed, and the President of the United States would select one of those. 
   The concept was there would be some geographical balance as well. And that is important, it strikes me, for us to understand. That carefully crafted and I think somewhat thoughtful approach was corrupted almost immediately by the political process. No sooner had the bill gone into effect than there was an effort, politically, to exclude certain regions of the country. The Northeast with the granite formations made it very clear, the Department of Energy records reflect, that because of the opposition from that part of the country, the Department of Energy, in effect, withdrew or abandoned any serious efforts to look at that. That had absolutely nothing to do with science or logic or balance or fairness. 
   Then, shortly thereafter, some of our colleagues from the Southeast raised concerns during the 1984 Presidential campaign, and lo and behold, assurances were given by the top levels of the then-administration that, indeed, the Southeast would be taken off the list. 
   In the 1982 Act, the Environmental Protection Agency was charged with the responsibility of a permanent repository health and safety standard that would be promulgated by the Environmental Protection Agency, something that was of overarching importance because the high-level nuclear waste we are talking about is not just messy stuff, unpleasant stuff; it is deadly, lethal, for tens and tens of thousands of years. So this is a major public health and safety concern, and the Congress chose the Environmental Protection Agency, created during the Nixon administration, to be, in effect, the agency to set that standard. 
   My friend from Alaska posed the question, rhetorically: Why Yucca Mountain? Let me respond to that, if I may. In 1987, an infamous piece of legislation known throughout my State as the ``Screw Nevada Bill'' was passed in the Congress. Unlike the 1982 Act, which said we will look across the country and develop three sites and have the President judge--in 1987 the ``Screw Nevada Act'' said we will look only at Yucca Mountain, no other place. That was not science. That was not logic. That was not fairness. That was not balance. That is the sheer force and 
   impact of naked political power inflicted upon a State with a sparse population and a small congressional representation in the Nation's Capitol. 
   But even in 1987, at the request of the nuclear utility industry, which drives  this debate, there was no attempt to change the health and safety standards. Then, 1992 comes along, the energy bill. There was nothing debated in committee or in the floor amendments--but in conference. As my colleagues fully understand, but our friends who are listening to this at home may not, a conference report cannot be amended. In the conference report there was an attempt--it succeeded--to place a provision that sought to somehow weaken those public health and safety standards, and the National Academy of Sciences was introduced for the first time. They were to look at the public health and safety standards, make some recommendations, and the Environmental Protection Agency would have to conform its decision within the range of standards proposed by the National Academy of Sciences. 
   Make no mistake, the primary intent of doing that was to weaken health and safety standards. The proposal originated within the highest corporate board rooms in the nuclear power industry in America. I objected, as some of my colleagues did. Nevertheless, it became law. 
   That brings us to a somewhat contemporary point in time. I am not going to discuss the flaws of the interim storage proposal. When Congress passed this legislation back in 1982, they fully understood if an interim storage was located that would, in fact, become de facto the permanent nuclear waste dump. It makes no sense then. It made no sense when it was proposed in the last Congress. That is why the President of the United States very appropriately and responsibly said: I will veto that if it ever gets to my desk. 
   I have some sympathy for my friend from Alaska. He, as his predecessors, as chairman of the Energy Committee, has a responsibility to accommodate the requests of the nuclear power industry. My friend began the debate by saying, in effect: Look, we have a decision in which we have a decline in the industry. The industry is struggling. We are out of capacity. What are we going to do with all of this? Long before this Senator from Nevada arrived in the Chamber, those very words were heard by the then-chairman of the Senate Energy Committee, in 1981, when there was a proposal to develop what was then known as an away-from-reactor proposal; that is, move the waste away from the reactor site. 
   Then, in 1981, it was stated that nuclear plants would have to close down, there would be electrical brownouts in America. That was 18 years ago. No nuclear utility in America has closed down. No brownout has occurred because of the absence of storage issue. There is an answer, and it is the same that those who were our adversaries proposed for us in Nevada; and that is dry cask storage onsite, and many utilities have done that. 
   It is suggested in the course of this debate there is some need to take urgent action. We have to do something. Let me say, I do not like the idea that Nevada got the shaft in the 1987 legislation. But the current law, if nothing occurs with respect to nuclear waste in this Congress, is that Yucca Mountain is going to be studied. And ultimately, if a determination is made as to suitability--and that determination has not yet been made; let me emphasize, no determination has been made that Yucca Mountain is suitable and there are a host of problems with that site. I will not get into extended comment on that today to keep my remarks somewhat abbreviated--but that process goes forward. 
   So, what is the circumstance? The circumstance today is that nuclear energy is an energy dinosaur. 
   There have been no new reactors ordered in America for more than two decades, and I suspect that even the most persuasive and articulate Members of this Chamber would have a very difficult time trying to persuade their community, look, what we need--I see the distinguished occupant of the Chair, perhaps a new city in her State--is a nuclear reactor right next door. It is not going to happen. 
   Why is it not going to happen? Because people, understandably, are very apprehensive and scared because they have seen some circumstances that have occurred around the world, and they are very much troubled by this. 
   This is a move by the nuclear utility industry that, in effect, has several flawed provisions I want to discuss ever so briefly. 
   With respect to the concern raised by my friend from Alaska that the tax ratepayers paid into this nuclear waste trust fund and that, indeed, the 1998 deadlines have not been met, the Senator from Alaska makes a fair point. They have not been met. There are many who say the nuclear utilities in 1982 forced upon the Department of Energy an unrealistic timeframe. Indeed, that has been the history of these various deadlines contained in some of the oversight by the Department of Energy over the intervening years. 
   I recognize the utilities have incurred additional expense because a permanent repository was not available in 1998 and will not be for some years ahead, even assuming Yucca Mountain. That is a red herring. That is not the issue. This Senator from Nevada and my colleague offered legislation as far back as 1990 saying: Yes, we have to compensate the utilities because there is no site available in that they are going to have to construct, in some instances, onsite storage in dry cast. That cost the ratepayers. We recognize it is fair to reimburse the utility for that expense. 
   The utilities would have no part of that because that is not their concern, that is not the agenda. They have something much different in mind, and they would like to shift the entire responsibility of this program, in effect, to the American taxpayer and not to the ratepayer. 
   This legislation proposes to compensate the nuclear utilities. I do not have a problem with that. It proposes the Federal Government take over the title. Whether that is good or bad is an issue on which I do not care to comment. 
   What it does that violates every sense of public health and safety and fairness and public policy is it moves the public health and safety goalposts in midcourse. Let me point this out. 
   The Environmental Protection Agency did, in fact, come with its recommendations as to what is an appropriate public health and safety standard. That is not just for Nevadans, but that is for Americans because although my friend from Alaska points out, yes, some nuclear waste has been transported across the country and there have been no major catastrophes, let us go back more than 20 years ago. The nuclear industry in America could say there has been no serious accident with respect to nuclear reactors in this country. But guess what. Three Mile Island occurred. 
   Nobody can make that contention today. I suppose the old politburo in the Soviet Union could have said at one point a bit more than 10, 15 years ago: Look, we have never had a serious nuclear reactor accident in the Soviet Union. But that was 
   before Chernobyl, one of the biggest environmental disasters of our time. Radiation contaminated vast areas around the nuclear reactor site. Yes, my friend from Alaska suggests reprocessing and mixing this stuff is somehow a new elixir of life. I suppose the Ministry of Energy in Japan might have said a few months ago: We have never had a problem with that. They cannot say that anymore after the very serious accident which occurred in Tokyo and, indeed, tragically--I hope this is not the case--we are likely to see several fatalities as a result of that because of lethal doses. 
   ``It has never happened, it is plenty safe, and do not worry about all this.'' We are talking about tens of thousands of shipments, 77,000 metric tons. 
   My friend from Nevada, my senior colleague, wants to speak in a moment as well. Should the majority leader bring this up for debate, I assure my colleagues we will have extended debate for a week, if not longer, in which we will explore each of these things in some detail. That would be unfortunate because it would make it impossible for us to consider a whole host of legislation that is pending that many people in the Chamber, myself included, believe has a far greater priority than a special interest piece of legislation in which only the utilities are interested. 
   Public health and safety ought to be of concern whether you are for nuclear energy, against nuclear energy, or ambivalent. Here is what is involved: The Environmental Protection Agency proposes to establish a 15-millirem-per-year standard. That is the State rate of exposure on an annual basis--15 millirems. That, we are told, is outrageous, as if somehow the standard is  if we cannot build it, then let's reduce health and safety standards. That is fairly outrageous. We are talking about something that kills people. It is deadly, lethal. I would think everybody would say: Look, I have never agreed with you before on some of these things, but when they are trying to screw around with health and safety standards, that affects every American. This is the EPA proposal. 
   You will recall I talked about how the nuclear utilities thought they were going to game the system with the 1992 Energy bill. They got the National Academy of Sciences involved. The National Academy of Sciences looked at it and said: We recommend the millirem standard--that is the rate of exposure per year--be between 2 millirems and 20 millirems. The EPA standard is right in the middle. The NRC standard--and we know they are friendly with the industry--recommends 25 millirems. The legislation that may be considered goes to 30. That would double it. 
   Why are they doing that? They are trying to game the system. Remember, if nothing passes, Yucca Mountain continues to be studied and may, indeed, prove to be suitable. I hope not. I think not. But nevertheless, that process is in place. 
   Let me point out what we are dealing with with other EPA public health and safety standards. Some years ago, when I first came to the Senate, we were debating the WIPP facility, the waste isolation project. We set standards for them that dealt with lifetime cancer risk per 10,000 individuals. That standard was set at 3. That is what the EPA essentially is proposing for us as well. 
   Look what S. 1287, the bill the Energy Committee has processed, would do. It would be more than triple what we did for WIPP, taking it to 10 lifetime cancer risk per 10,000--a serious erosion of public health and safety. 
   What possible reason or why would anyone want to suggest that the good folks in Nevada, whether it is your favorite State or not, would not be entitled to the same health and safety protections provided to the good citizens of New Mexico? Why do we do that? It simply makes no sense at all. 
   One can look at Superfund standards, hazardous air pollutants--all of those are within this range, which is within the National Academy of Sciences' findings. Look how far S. 1287 is outside the envelope or protection that the National Academy of Sciences recommended. 
   Remember, the nuclear industry fully expected the National Academy of Sciences would have come up with a standard much more favorable to their point of view which, frankly, is minimal health and safety standards. Whatever it takes to get that site built, they could care less, in effect, about the public health and safety of folks who could be impacted by this. 
   Pretty outrageous: 10 versus about 3--pretty outrageous. 
   So when we are talking about some of the fatal flaws in this legislation, I simply take the time this afternoon in joining my friend from Alaska in debate to point out something about which every American ought to be concerned. This is nuclear waste. 
   What industry comes to the Congress next year and says, we can't meet the standard that is set for public health and safety? You all, last year, did something for the nuclear power industry. Can you do something for us? In effect, what we would establish is a public policy precedent that would unravel public health and safety standards if the industries that are regulated do not like those standards. That is extraordinarily dangerous. 
   I say to my colleagues: Don't get stampeded on this piece of legislation. If nothing occurs, the characterization of study of Yucca Mountain--much to my dismay, but it is the law--will continue. This legislation is dangerous. It is enormously bad public policy. It is an incredibly bad precedent. And it is unneeded. To bring it up at this late hour in this session, when we are trying to wrap things up in the next couple of weeks, it seems to me, says something about our priorities here in the Congress. 
   I hope the distinguished majority leader does not bring this up. But I can assure him--and I do so with great respect--that it will be the only issue we will be discussing for some extended period of time because for Nevada this is a life or death proposition. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I would like to accommodate the distinguished Senator from Arizona, the chairman. The Senator from Nevada would like to use 2 minutes of his time at this point and reserve the remainder. 
   I rise in opposition to the amendment offered by our distinguished colleague from Virginia. I do so because the effect of his amendment would leave us with the perimeter rule unchanged. 
   Very briefly, the perimeter rule is a rule enacted by statute by the Congress of the United States which prohibits flights originating from Washington National to travel more than 1,250 miles and prohibits any flights originating more than 1,250 miles from Washington National from landing here. 
   The General Accounting Office has looked at this and has found that it is anticompetitive. It tends to discriminate against new entrants into the marketplace, and it cannot be justified by any rational standard. 
   As is so often the case, a page of history is more instructive than a volume of logic. The history of this dates back to 1986 when there was difficulty in getting long-haul carriers to move to Washington Dulles. At that point in time, the perimeter rule, which was then something like 750 miles, was put into effect to force air service for long-haul carriers out of Dulles. As we all know, that is no longer the case. Dulles has gone to a multibillion-dollar expansion and the original basis for the rule no longer exists. 
   The effect, unfortunately, of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senator from Virginia is to leave that perimeter rule in place unchanged. The Senator from Arizona has recommended a compromise. He and I would prefer to abolish the rule in its entirety. Yielding to the reality of the circumstances, he has provided a compromise to provide for 24 additional slots: 12 to be made available for carriers that would serve outside of the perimeter; that is, beyond the 1,250 miles, and 12 within the 1,250 miles. 
   This is a very important piece of legislation, and I urge my colleagues to defeat it on the basis that it is anticompetitive, unnecessary, and no longer serves any useful purpose. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in what has become one of the more unpleasant annual rituals here in the Senate, the majority leader has once again put the Senate on notice that we may soon consider legislation related to the disposal of high-level nuclear waste at the Yucca Mountain site in Nevada. 
   Since the Senate last considered this subject, the sponsors of this legislation have realized that the Senators from Nevada, and the Clinton administration, will never yield to the outrageous and dangerous--in my view very dangerous--demands of the nuclear power industry. 
   This year, it appears that the industry and its advocates here in the Senate have finally conceded defeat, and dropped their misguided attempts to require ``interim'' storage of high-level nuclear waste in Nevada. 
   We have been fighting the ``interim'' storage proposal since 1995, and its demise is a major victory not only for Nevadans, but for millions of other citizens, and taxpayers across the country. 
   Some of what remains in the current nuclear waste proposal, S. 1287, is reasonable. 
   In particular, I have long supported providing financial relief to utilities, and their ratepayers, who are financially damaged by the Federal Government's failure to begin removing waste from reactor sites in 1998. 
   Under the leadership of Secretary Richardson, the administration has offered to work with the utilities to provide such financial relief, and several of the provisions of this legislation are intended to give the Secretary the legal authority he needs to carry out this proposal. 
   If financial relief for the utilities was all we were talking about, I believe we could pass a bill today. 
   Other provisions of the bill, will, I expect, continue to draw a veto threat from the White House. 
   Should the Senate actually attempt to move to the bill in the coming months, I will have a lot more to say about the unsafe and irresponsible changes this legislation would make to the Federal high-level waste program, but today I want to focus briefly on one particular provision that in my view is threatening and dangerous and that is the attempt to lower the radiation protection standard to be applied to a potential repository site at Yucca Mountain. 
   The starting point for any fair evaluation of a potential repository is a fair and protective radiation release standard. 
   Since it is against this standard that the predicted performance of a repository is measured, the health and safety of the public depend on a strict and comprehensive standard. 
   The legislation reported by the Senate Energy Committee, if enacted, would emasculate current law and the Environmental Protection Agency's effort to establish a fair Yucca Mountain standard by shifting the responsibility for setting the standard to the NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and establish, by legislative fiat, a standard far less protective of the public and the environment. 
   Since its creation by President Nixon nearly 3 decades ago, the Environmental Protection Agency has been the Federal agency charged with developing radiation release standards. 
   The EPA was created for a sound reason, which still holds true today: to  consolidate the Federal Government's effort to protect the environment in one Federal agency. 
   As the lead Federal Agency for environmental protection, the EPA has, for many years, set standards for a wide variety of pollutants, including radiation, to be applied by a wide variety of Federal agencies and regulatory bodies. 
   In addition to its general authority to set radiation standards, the EPA was specifically charged, by statute, with setting standards for high-level waste disposal by the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982. 
   Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, the EPA is charged with setting the standard, the NRC is charged with implementing the standard, and the DOE is charged with characterizing and building a repository. 
   When the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was amended in 1987, numerous changes were made, but the EPA's role as the standard setting agency was left untouched. 
   In 1992, the Nuclear Waste Policy Act was amended once again, and over my objections, this time the statute relating to the standard was changed. 
   In an effort by the nuclear power industry to influence the outcome of the EPA's work, the National Academy of Sciences was instructed to make recommendations to the EPA regarding the standard, and the EPA standard was required to be consistent with the NAS recommendations. 
   In 1992, Congress nevertheless was still unwilling to set the dangerous precedent of taking the standard setting authority away from the EPA. 
   To the disappointment of the nuclear industry and its supporters, however, this attempt in 1992 to have legislative changes to modify the law in an attempt to prejudice the EPA's work backfired--the industry was unhappy with the NAS's 1995 study, and renewed its effort to jerryrig a legislative standard that gutted the EPA provisions in the original Nuclear Waste Policy Act. 
   Recently, after years of work, and numerous delays, the EPA issued a proposed radiation release standard for Yucca Mountain. 
   The EPA is currently accepting comments on the proposed standard, and will continue to work with all parties interested in developing a final standard in the next few years. 
   But supporters of the industry's efforts to target nuclear waste for Nevada do not want a fair standard. They want a standard so low that Yucca Mountain, or any other site, simply could not fail. 
   The industry wants a standard that will provide a path around the many failings of the site, irrespective of the effects on public health and safety. 
   Although the radiation release standards are technical in nature, and quite complicated, the major issues of contention between the EPA, the NRC, and industry, however, are not. 
   First, what is the maximum increase in exposure to radiation Nevadans should be expected to bear due to the operation of the repository? And the second question is, should we protect a major aquifer that lies underneath the proposed repository site? 
   On the first subject--the level of protection--the report prepared by the National Academy of Sciences provides some helpful guidance. 
   This exhibit, as reflected in the chart, reflects that range. The white brackets here indicate the standard range from 2 to 20. The NRC standard, as one can see, in S. 1287, the current legislation, is far beyond the parameters of what the NAS, the National Academy of Sciences, has recommended. The EPA standard, on the other hand, set at 15 millirems, is well within those standards. So that is consistent with what the 1992 legislative changes mandated. 
   The exposure levels suggested by the NAS and the EPA were not simply plucked out of thin air. Both agencies relied heavily on similar standards established in the United States and by other countries. As this chart indicates, again, at the top is S. 1287, 30 millirems, which is far beyond the standard of most other countries; EPA at 15, the United Kingdom at 2; Switzerland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and Finland at 10. 
   Once again, the EPA standard lies well within the midrange of standard practices around the world, while the standard included in S. 1287, as I indicated, lies at the extreme upper end of the range of existing practice. 
   More technical, but just as important, is the issue of what population the standard is measured against. 
   For the EPA proposal, the standard will be applied to the group of people most likely to be harmed--using reasonable assumptions regarding distance from the repository, and average eating and other personal habits, the EPA standard protects the ``maximally exposed individual.'' S. 1287 would apply the standard to an ``average'' member of what could be a very large group of individuals--leading to the possibility of very large exposures to members of the group who are at greater than ``average'' risk from the repository. 
   Proponents of gutting the radiation release standard, and of taking the EPA out of the process, claim that Nevadan's concerns are meaningless, and that natural variations in background radiation between regions render our concerns with an increased millirems a year meaningless. 
   That argument shows a blatant disregard for the health and safety of the people of Nevada. 
   We all live with whatever background radiation we may be exposed to; there is nothing we can do about that. 
   What we can do, as a matter of sound public health policy, is limit the amount of radiation exposure we add to background from manmade sources. 
   An ordinary chest x-ray--something we all subject ourselves to when necessary, but certainly don't consider a desirable event to occur on a regular basis--results in an exposure of about 5 millirems. 
   Under the legislation reported by the Energy Committee, Nevadans would be subjected to the equivalent of at least 6 additional, and unnecessary, chest x-rays each and every year. 
   We don't really know what the full health related effects of this type of exposure can result in, but I doubt that any member of the Senate would volunteer to subject his or her state, or family, to that type of risk. 
   Even under the EPA's proposed standard, individuals could expect to be subjected to future exposures equivalent to three chest x-rays a year--a proposal which, while more suitable than the alternatives offered by the nuclear power industry over the years, provides little comfort to Nevadans. 
   The second major issue which has raised such outrage by the nuclear power industry, the NRC, and their supporters here in Congress is the EPA's insistence upon requiring compliance with a separate groundwater standard. 
   Under the EPA's proposed standard, the repository would need to be in compliance with the goals of the Safe Drinking Water Act, which, in effect, limits radiological contamination of the groundwater to 4 mrems. 
   The proposed Yucca Mountain site lies over a major, if largely untapped, aquifer. 
   Water from the aquifer is currently a source of drinking water for several small communities in the vicinity of Yucca Mountain; it could, in the future, provide a drinking water source for several hundred thousand people. 
   While it is clearly not now a cost-effective source of drinking water on a large scale, it is incomprehensible to someone from the desert Southwest to intentionally contaminate such a large potential source of drinking water. 
   The EPA has been charged with protecting our nation's drinking water sources, and it takes that 
   responsibility very seriously. 
   It has established standards to protect drinking water sources in a wide variety of regulatory programs, including those related to hazardous-waste disposal, municipal-waste disposal, underground injection control, generic spent nuclear fuel, high level waste, and transuranic radioactive waste disposal, and uranium mill tailings disposal. 
   All of these, and other, EPA standards and programs work together to protect groundwater resources throughout the nation, and the Yucca Mountain standard is merely another piece of this important regulatory framework. 
   The bottom line is simple: the groundwater under Yucca Mountain needs to be protected.  
   The standard proposed earlier this year by the NRC, and the standard included in S. 1287, encourage the intentional contamination of a potentially important aquifer running under the proposed repository site. 
   The EPA is duty bound to protect this aquifer, and has done so in its proposed standard. 
   It would be unconscionable for Congress to step in and reverse course on what has been a nearly 30 year effort by the EPA, and numerous other federal, state, and local governmental agencies, to protect and preserve our valuable natural resources. 
   While the Yucca Mountain standard is controversial, this is not the first time the federal government has gone through the exercise of setting radiation release standards. 
   Most recently, the EPA established standards for the Waste Isolation Pilot Project in New Mexico. 
   Like the proposed Yucca Mountain standard, the EPA's WIPP standard provides a maximum exposure of 15 millirems/year, and includes a separate 4 millirems groundwater standard. 
   It is not unreasonable for Nevadans to expect the same level of protection offered the citizens of New Mexico--and that is exactly what the EPA has proposed. 
   Fair treatment of Nevadans, of course, is not something that appears on the nuclear power industry's list of priorities. 
   Unfortunately for Nevadans, the nuclear power industry does not care much about the justification behind the EPA proposed standard. 
   For the industry and its supporters, the EPA is nothing more than an impediment to their ultimate plan to ship high-level nuclear waste to Nevada, no matter what the cost. 
   For the nuclear power industry, the test of whether or not a standard will be acceptable is not how protective it may be of the public health and safety, it is whether or not it allows a repository to be licensed. 
   Instead of focusing its attention on whether or not the Yucca Mountain site can meet a fair radiation release standard, the nuclear power industry is attempting to rig the standard to comport to what is being found at Yucca Mountain. 
   This cynical approach to public health and safety has led the industry along a strategy that seeks to undo decades of federal 
   environmental protection policy, and to ask Congress to establish a very dangerous precedent of ``forum shopping'' for environmental protection standards and regulation. 
   Mr. President, Nevadans have the most at stake with the development of the Yucca Mountain standard. 
   The health and safety of future generations of Nevadans depend on a fair, protective standard. 
   There are, however, broader issues at stake here as well. 
   The integrity of our system of federal environmental protection is at risk. 
   The fundamental reason the EPA was created was to consolidate and coordinate federal environmental protection in a single agency. 
   Reassigning important standard setting authority to a more sympathetic agency on the whim of a particular industry could well mark the unraveling of decades of progress in protecting our environment. 
   Should the nuclear power industry have its way with Congress, and succeed in its efforts to undermine the EPA's long standing authority to set standards, who is next? Should we start down a path of returning to the days before 1970, when environmental protection was a hit or miss proposition for the federal government, leading to events such as 1969 fire near Cleveland, where sparks from a passing train actually ignited the polluted Cuyahoga river? I hope not. 
   Some in Congress continue to claim that Nevadans' concerns are foolish, that the shipment and burial of 80,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste are nothing to worry about. 
   Anyone subscribing to that line of reasoning should talk to some of the downwinders suffering genetic and cancer effects from our atmospheric nuclear testing; or the thousands of children suffering thyroid and other problems due to the 1986 Chernyobl accident; or the thousands of DOE workers at the Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, Kentucky, now agonizing over the effects of 40 years of mismanagement and coverup. 
   As Secretary Richardson has said about the situation in Paducah ``we weren't always straight with them in the past.''. 
   Mr. President, the Senate has plenty of work to do this fall. 
   Only one Appropriations bill has been signed into law, and the fiscal year ends this week. 
   Inportant measures that most of us agree need to pass, such as the Bankruptcy bill, or the FAA reauthorization, sit on the calendar awaiting action. 
   The nuclear waste bill reported by the Energy Committee is an environmental travesty which stands no chance of being enacted, and I hope the Majority leader will come to the conclusion that we should not waste any more of the Senate's time on this irresponsible special interest legislation.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about two important components of the legislation before us today that would severely impact the state of public housing both in my home state of Nevada and throughout our nation. 
   The distinguished chairman and ranking member of the subcommittee have undoubtedly worked hard to provide the needed funding for a number of critical programs in the VA-HUD appropriations bill. I commend them for their efforts. Nevertheless, I am forced to say that I am disappointed that this bill falls far short in continuing our commitment to provide affordable, quality housing to low and moderate income families. 
   Of particular concern, Mr. President, is the lack of funding for any new section 8 housing vouchers despite the considerable demand and need for such assistance in communities throughout the nation. 
   The section 8 program provides vital assistance to American families. 
   In 1998, 1.4 million Americans were receiving assistance under this program and countless more have been on waiting lists for months and sometimes years for this needed assistance. 
   Who receives assistance under the Section 8 program? According to CRS, recipients of section 8 vouchers are typically single-parent households with children under the age of 18. Most participants have income well below the poverty level, and the average household income of a recipient is well below $10,000. 
   Mr. President, we are all aware that the American economy has been roaring for the last few years, and we are all delighted that inflation and unemployment numbers are at record lows and job growth and housing starts are at record highs. But lost in this economic expansion and prosperity are millions of Americans who continue to struggle to make ends meet and adequately provide for their families. 
   The section 8 program has historically served as a lifeline to low income households, providing needed assistance to those American families seeking to raise their children in quality, affordable homes in safe, livable communities. 
   Last year we were successful in providing almost 100,000 new section 8 vouchers to address the substantial shortage in affordable housing, the first new vouchers in five years. 
   As my colleagues will recall, the authorizing legislation passed by the Senate last year authorized 100,000 new section 8 housing vouchers for the upcoming fiscal year. 
   And yet the legislation before us provides no new vouchers despite the growing gap between the public housing assistance needed and assistance available. 
   As an example of how disconcerting this issue has become in my own state of Nevada, low and moderate income families in Las Vegas, Reno and numerous other communities currently have to wait for a period of over 8 months for public housing--8 months, Mr. President.  
   The wait for section 8 vouchers in Nevada is even worse. That delay is over 50 months, Mr. President. Over four years for a section 8 voucher. And yet the legislation before inexplicably does not provide any additional funding for section 8 housing vouchers despite this substantial increase in demand. 
   It is my understanding that there will be an amendment to this bill to provide additional vouchers along the lines of the administration's request and I look forward to supporting that effort. 
   Let me address another issue that I believe was inadequately addressed in the bill and that I regret to say in my view is a setback. 
   I was also disappointed to learn that the underlying legislation before us today seeks to zero-out HUD's highly effective Community Builders Program. 
   Let me say parenthetically that during the recently concluded August recess my staff and I had the chance to visit with some of the community builders to learn about their effectiveness, and in the very short time that this program has been in existence I have heard considerable feedback from local officials, community leaders, and others throughout our State in praise of the Community Builders Program. 
   By way of example, the eight community builders working in HUD's Las Vegas regional office have been able to bring HUD officials and community leaders together to solve local problems by developing strategies that draw resources from a multitude of Federal programs. All who are familiar with the Federal bureaucracy know it can be very difficult to bring together all the various programs with all of their intricacies and requirements and to meld those together to develop an effective program for the housing needs of our communities. 
   During the brief existence of this program, we have witnessed a number of success stories in both the southern and northern parts of Nevada. Let me share some recent accomplishments of the program in the Las Vegas area. Community builders in Las Vegas have partnered with southern Nevada's local office of the Bureau of Land Management to facilitate the conveyance of a large tract of vacant BLM land to the city of Las Vegas for the development of affordable housing for low-income and moderate-income residents. 
   Community builders are working with several housing partners to develop two to four units of single-family detached housing using technologically advanced materials and building processes to show how technology can reduce the cost and improve the quality of single-family housing. 
   Community builders are undertaking the first phase of development of a new 400-unit mobile home park in Pahrump, NV. Pahrump, NV, is located in my county and one of the 10 fastest growing counties in the entire country. This is being done at the same time by streamlining housing code compliance to ensure safety and yet also to reduce the cost. 
   Community builders in Las Vegas are working to develop a lender certification program designed to assist in the extension of mortgage programs and products to an increased number of low- and moderate-income families and individuals. These success stories in the southern part of our State have also been mirrored in northern Nevada. 
   For example, when BHP Copper Mine in Ely shut down mining operations, more than 400 individuals representing 12 percent of the area's workforce were laid off, dealing a devastating blow to a struggling community. The community builders in Reno immediately went to work, joining with local officials in organizing a community partnership forum with community leaders and representatives from many Federal, State, and nonprofit agencies. This effort resulted in the development of an action plan that identified solutions and opportunities for mitigating the adverse economic and housing effects caused by these massive layoffs. This initiative is being held up as a model throughout rural Nevada for rural communities to develop comprehensive local strategies responsive to economic downturns in the mining industry and the longer-term need for greater economic diversification. 
   I might add as an aside, we learned from two of our counties, Humboldt and Lander Counties, two counties I visited and spent time in with their county commissioner and citizens in August, those counties have also been affected as a result of a series of layoffs in the mining industry. They, too, are buffeted by worsening economic conditions. 
   Once again, the community builders are being called into action to assist community leaders in finding ways to stabilize rural economies and housing markets in the face of falling gold prices in the global market. 
   In sum, the Community Builders Program strikes me as a smart and cost-effective way to do business. By breaking down the old bureaucratic hurdles that often hinder customer service and working at the grassroot levels with communities ranging from the sprawl of Las Vegas to a rather small community such as Ely, NV, the Community Builders Program has proven highly effective in finding solutions to critical challenges facing our urban and rural communities. 
   It is my hope that before this legislation is passed by the Senate, these two critically important and highly successful programs are addressed in a way that will allow the Federal Government to continue its commitment to providing affordable housing to the millions of Americans who depend upon such assistance and to allow the Community Builders Program to continue its work in building successful partnerships within our communities to solve local problems. 
   I yield the floor.

Do I understand the thrust of the Senator's argument is not to advocate some new standards for CAFE but simply to permit those who are charged with that responsibility to make a basic inquiry as to whether or not there is room, based upon science, safety, and other considerations, to consider an increase in fuel economy standards?

   Mr. BRYAN. I enjoyed the Senator's reference to the steam engine in the 19th century. The younger members of my staff say they are not familiar with this reference, but as the Senator from Washington will recall, the Industrial Revolution was born in Great Britain. Just as then, seemingly now, there are those fearful of progress. 
   The first manifestation of the Industrial Revolution was when we changed the textile production from a cottage industry to the floors of the factory, and machinery and technology made that possible. I know the Senator from Washington State, who is in my generation, will recall this reference. But a group of people called Luddites went about the country breaking up the machines, trying to prevent progress, fearful of the consequences. It seems to me--perhaps the Senator might want to comment--that in a very modern-day sense, we have neo-Luddites who are fearful of the consequences of what new technology might make possible, and in my view, the improvement of technology throughout the vast expanse of history has improved a lot for mankind. Does the Senator agree with that observation?

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, if the recollection of the Senator from Nevada is correct, in the mid-1970s, the distinguished Senator from Washington was the attorney general of that State. As the attorney general, he was a leading advocate on behalf of consumer issues in his State. Perhaps the Senator will recall when the legislation, referred to as CAFE, the corporate average fuel economy standard, was offered on the floor of the Senate and in the other body. Those from the automobile industry said at the time: if these CAFE standards are imposed upon us, everybody in America will be driving an automobile smaller than a Pinto or a subsized Maverick. 
   That was at a time when fuel economy for passenger vehicles averaged less than 14 miles per gallon. As a result of the Congress taking that action, fuel economy, from 1973 to 1989, doubled. 
   Does the Senator recall the essence of the testimony offered by one of the automotive manufacturers? I wonder if he might want to comment on what actually occurred over those intervening 16 years when we were supposed to be driving around in Pintos and subsize Maverick automobiles.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, may I inquire further of the distinguished Senator, my friend from Washington, with another question. 
   Has the Senator had an opportunity to see this morning's issue of Congress Daily? On the back, there is an ad designed to uphold the thoughtful and well-considered resolution which the Senator from Washington, and our able  colleague, the distinguished Senator from California, I, and others are going to be offering for consideration. But the text of the ad says:  
   We work hard all year so our family can go fishing and camping together. We couldn't do it without our SUV--  
   Sport utility vehicle. It shows the man leaning on the hood of the SUV. 
   I guess my questions to the Senator would be twofold: No. 1, before the automobile manufacturers developed the sport utility vehicles, was it not possible for families in America to enjoy fishing and camping? Perhaps the Senator might be able to respond to that question.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank my able colleague from California for her thoughtful and well-considered statement. I associate myself with her observations and the conclusions she makes. 
   This issue has been framed on a false premise, that somehow Members, including the able Senators from California and Washington who support this amendment, are interested in depriving the American public of their choice of automobiles. 
   I know firsthand, having seen the vehicles of my colleague from California--she is the proud owner of a sport utility vehicle--she would defend as vigorously as would I her right to own such a vehicle. 
   This has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not the American public chooses to purchase a minivan, a light truck, or a sport utility vehicle. My son and his wife and our first grandchild are in the Nation's Capital today. As a family, they have chosen a sport utility vehicle. I defend his right as vigorously as I defend the right of my colleague from California. 
   This is not what this debate is all about. That is a false premise. I think some Members are not only offended by the intellectual dishonesty of this kind of advertising that suggests the senior Senator from California and I somehow seek to deprive American families of their opportunity to go fishing and camping. That is just ludicrous. That defies any kind of rational argument.

   Mr. BRYAN. It shows two angelic children sitting on the hood of a sport utility vehicle. Strapped to the top of that vehicle looks to be a canoe, a boat of some type. Now we see a gentleman, perhaps the father of these two children, leaning on the hood. He is saying to them, ``You know, we work hard all year as a family so our family can go fishing and camping together. We couldn't do it without our sport utility vehicle.'' Then the tag line is: ``Say yes to consumer choice. Say no to a CAFE increase.'' 
   I was explaining before my colleague's thoughtful question, the implication is that those who advocate simply taking a look at the standards, simply allowing those within the Department of Transportation to take a look at the standards--and I will comment later in my remarks as to the criteria involved--that somehow we are opposed to this family's right to camp and to go fishing. That is outrageous. It is not true. This Senator is greatly offended by the text of that ad.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from California is absolutely correct. She has the clarity of expression that sometimes escapes those who had the misfortune to go to law school. We get caught up with acronyms. CAFE means nothing to the average person. We are trying to get greater fuel efficiency. 
   In my colloquy with our colleague from Washington State, it was pointed out that this is a win-win-win for the American public. 
   The Senator from California and I represent two States that currently are experiencing enormous increases in the cost of gas. That takes money out of the pocket of America's families. That means less discretionary income. In the Senator's State as well as my own, an automobile is virtually a necessity to move from one place to another, to go to work, to enjoy the recreational opportunities we want to have with our family, to do the sort of thing that is part of our lifestyle in America. 
   If we can improve the CAFE standards for jeeps, sport utilities, minivans, and light trucks, we put more dollars in that family's pocket; we clean up the air, as the Senator from California pointed out; we reduce our dependence on foreign oil--it currently is about 50 percent; it drives some of the geopolitical policy debates in which the good Senator from California has taken a lead--and we help to reduce the trade deficit. 
   Our economy is performing magnificently, but one of the areas of concern to everyone is the mounting trade deficit. About $50 billion of that annual trade deficit is attributed to what we as Americans pay for oil that we import from around the world to fuel our economy, a good segment of which is transportation.

   Mr. BRYAN. That is, as the Senator from California knows, an argument that has been raised. It is a specious argument. 
   The Senator from California hails from a jurisdiction which has been on the cutting edge of so much of the technology of the post-World War II era. Because of the Senator's own interest in technology and moving her own economy forward in California, I know she is deeply committed to that. 
   The Senator from California and many of our colleagues reflect that great confidence that the ingenuity and the entrepreneurial spirit of the American business community responds to challenges. But now there is a disconnect. The automobile industry didn't think they could ever do anything to improve economy. We couldn't suggest they look at that--somehow that would deprive us of our choice. 
   As the Senator from Washington responded to my question, these arguments were made back in 1974 when a representative at that time from the Ford Motor Company, testifying in opposition to the first fuel economy standards, said--without in any way belying the Senator's own youthful appearance, I think she may recall 1974, as the Senator from Nevada does. At that time, one of the leading automobiles that Ford produced was what I call a pint-sized Pinto. The Senator I am sure will recall that. 
   This is what the auto industry was arguing in 1974, should the first CAFE standards be enacted:  
   That the product line [referring to the product line for automobile manufacturers in America] would consist of either all sub Pinto sized vehicles or some mix of vehicles ranging from a sub sub compact to perhaps a Maverick.  
   That statement was made in this century--in fact, the latter quarter of the 20th century. 
   This is a tribute to the industry and its ingenuity. The Lincoln Town Car, if not the largest automobile produced by the Ford Motor Company, gets better fuel economy today than the Pinto did in 1974. That is technology. It does not deprive one of choice. It seems to me for some reason the industry has created this facade that they cannot do these sorts of things. 
   We are saying--and I believe the Senator from California would agree--let's just take a look and see if we can't achieve these benefits we have just talked about.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the senior Senator from California for her very thoughtful comments and excellent presentation. 
   Mr. President, I rise in support of the Gorton-Feinstein-Bryan amendment that would permit the Department of Transportation to consider whether fuel efficiency for SUVs and light trucks should be improved. The vote on this amendment will be one of the key environmental votes of this Congress. I think it is helpful for our colleagues to understand the context in which this debate occurs. 
   In 1995, the House of Representatives inserted an antienvironmental rider in the Department of Transportation appropriations bill that prohibited, that is precluded, the Department of Transportation from even considering whether an increase in automobile fuel efficiency made sense. That environmental rider has been added to each of the appropriations in years 1996, 1997, 1998, and currently we face the same situation. 
   I think the important thing to emphasize is that those of us who support the resolution are not arguing for a specific numerical standard. We are simply saying shouldn't the people who have the ability to make these judgments, under very carefully considered circumstances, have the opportunity to even inquire? In effect, what the rider accomplishes is a technology gag rule. It precludes consideration. So our amendment is an effort to show there is substantial support in this body that we should not prejudge the issue and,  instead, let the experts study the issue and decide what is in the Nation's best interests. 
   A bit of history may be instructive. Fuel efficiency standards are known, in the jargon of the Congressional and Federal professional bureaucracy, as CAFE standards, the acronym standing for corporate average fuel economy. Those standards have been on the decline in recent years, as automakers build bigger and bigger gas guzzlers. 
   This chart will be instructive. Prior to the enactment in 1974 of the fuel economy standards, the average fuel economy for a passenger vehicle in America was slightly less than 14 miles per gallon. As a result of the enactment of that legislation, over the intervening 15 years, fuel economy doubled to 27.5 miles per gallon. This chart reflects that. 
   What has occurred, in the late 1980s and 1990s, is the vehicle mix has shifted dramatically. We have seen a decline in overall fuel economy. Not that the vehicles referred to as ``passenger vehicles'' are less fuel efficient, but the American public, by choice, has included in its purchase agenda light trucks, sport utility vehicles, and minivans. These were not terms that were familiar in America in 1974, and millions of families have chosen light trucks or sport utility vehicles and minivans. As I indicated in my colloquy with the distinguished Senator from California, my own son and his family have such a vehicle in Nevada. A daughter and a son-in-law have such a vehicle in upstate New York. So nothing in this debate is in any way about limiting choice. But we cannot ignore the reality that the fleet mix has changed. 
   Today, nearly 50 percent of the vehicles sold in America for family use are sport utility, minivans, or light trucks. That reflects the percentage. If the chart went 1 more year, they would reflect basically about 50 percent of the vehicle mix. 
   When the legislation was enacted in 1974, there was a different standard for light trucks, which included minivans and the sport utility vehicle. So what this debate is all about is simply permitting--it is permissive. It in no way mandates, dictates, directs, commands; it simply is permissive. I think it may be helpful to read the language of the resolution itself. This is a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. The resolved paragraph says:  
   It is the sense of the Senate that,

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from Washington. 
   Mr. President, I understand that in the most famous debating institution in the world, and in the history of civilization, differences of opinion can arise on matters of public policy. That is what this place is all about. But I have to tell you, I find the amount of hysteria engendered by this issue to be absolutely astonishing. 
   In a series of ads put out by the industry, we have one now that talks about: ``Farming's tough enough with healthy-size pickups. Imagine hauling feed barrels around in a subcompact.'' That implies that this amendment we are proposing will be antithetical to the best interests of America's farmers. 
   We have an ad involving the soccer moms and dads: ``This picture is brought to you by a fantastic soccer team and a minivan just big enough to handle them.'' The clear inference is, if we allow the Department of Transportation to examine these standards, some soccer moms are not going to be able to take their kids to soccer games. 
   Then we have an ad: ``As a small business owner, my truck and I are joined at the hip. An increase in CAFE would put both of us out of business.'' 
   May I say, with great respect to our friends on the other side of the aisle, many of whom are good friends I greatly respect, this is utter nonsense. This is just plain nonsense. 
   I will repeat, as I did earlier, the thrust of what this resolution does. It mandates no standard, no increase. The resolution simply says the issue of CAFE standards should be permitted to be examined by the Department of Transportation so that consumers may benefit from any resulting increase in the standards as soon as possible. It is permissive only; it mandates nothing. 
   During the time 1989 to 1995, when this technology gag rule was not in effect, during those 6 years, there was no increase in CAFE standards for automobiles, and with respect to light trucks it was 1 percent. So I think that is a pretty clear indication that nobody is going to rush to judgment. 
   The other thing that needs to be understood, it seems to me, is the Department of Transportation has some very comprehensive guidelines they must consider in any review. Among those factors are: Is it technically feasible? Is the technology there? The economic practicability, the effect of other Federal motor vehicle standards on fuel economy, and the need of the Nation to conserve, all of which would be open to the rulemaking process in which the industry and their supporters would have an ample opportunity to respond. 
   Let me try to respond briefly to the safety issue. And my friend from Michigan has indicated to me he would allow me to engage him in a colloquy for a couple questions. I appreciate his courtesy, as always. 
   From 1970 through 1999, the highway fatality rate in America has gone down. At the same time, fuel economy is up. That is at the same time that many more vehicles are on the highway, with a great amount of additional traffic congestion. The average motorist is driving more each year. 
   So the notion that somehow this is anathema to health and safety standards simply, in my judgment, does not bear out scrutiny. 
   Indeed, an objective study by the General Accounting Office concluded that the unprecedented increase in the proportion of light cars on the roads since the 1970s has not increased the total highway fatality rate. 
   I think the safety issue is somewhat of a red herring. We are all concerned about safety. Nobody on the floor is going to advocate that the industry make and sell a product which is unsafe, and one would have to assume that the industry itself would not put such a product on the market. 
   Let me also point out that with respect to the fuel achievements we have had in terms of increased efficiency from 1974 to the 1989 timeframe, 86 percent of those improvements were as a result of new technology. This information comes to us from the Center for Auto Safety. It seems to me the clear and compelling evidence is that safety and fuel economy standards are not mutually exclusive. We can do both. 
   All we are saying is that those who choose to purchase sport utility vehicles, my son and daughter-in-law being two, should have the same right as other motorists who select other passenger vehicles to derive the benefits of improved technology. I have great confidence in what the industry can do, notwithstanding the prophecy of doom they forecast in 1974 that everybody would be driving around in a sub-subcompact or a vehicle the size of a Maverick or a Pinto. Indeed, the industry did some astonishing things and doubled the fuel economy. Today's Lincoln Town Car gets better fuel economy than the smallest product that the Ford Motor Company manufactured in 1974. 
   If I could engage my friend from Michigan in a couple of questions. He is a distinguished lawyer, a graduate of Harvard Law School. I ask him: Is there anything in this resolution, in the opinion of the distinguished Senator from Michigan, that in any way mandates an increase in these standards. We may disagree in terms of whether the technology is available.

   I point out to my friend and colleague from Michigan that we had precisely the situation in 1989 to 1995. The technology gag rule was not in effect and, indeed, no increase was made during that period of time with respect to automobile standards. And only a very modest increase was made with respect to the light truck standards. 
   I hope that will give some comfort to him and to those who have raised some concerns that this is not a mandate but simply permissive in nature.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, let me compliment the Senator from Oregon for his leadership in helping craft this very carefully balanced and I believe very modest amendment. Although the Senator from Illinois has left the floor, I want to compliment him for the clarity of his comments. I think he has put this debate in the proper context. 
   The Senator from Idaho has framed the issue as being for or against harvesting timber for commercial sales on the national forests. That is not the issue before the Senate today. This amendment does not deal with that issue. This amendment reduces the amount of money allocated for the commercial timber sales program back to the amount the President recommended in his budget and the Forest Service, the professional managers, recommended, which was $196 million. 
   That commercial timber program has been subject to much criticism over the years. It is, in my judgment, one of the vestiges of corporate welfare that still exists in the Congress of the United States. Courageously, on a bipartisan basis, both parties worked to reform the welfare system. We have already seen enormous benefits as a result of that bipartisan action. For reasons that are not altogether clear to me, we have had much less success in removing the vestiges of corporate welfare. It is for that reason that such responsible organizations as the Concord Coalition as well as the National Taxpayers Union are strongly in support of the Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment. 
   The commercial timber sales program has been widely criticized because it is a subsidy. The Forest Service itself has acknowledged that fact. In the most recent fiscal year in which data is available, they have acknowledged that it is an $88.6 million loss to the taxpayer. The General Accounting 
   Office, reviewing the data from 1992 to 1997, concluded the American taxpayers have lost some $1.5 billion as a result of this program. The Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment is an attempt to bring some balance to the program. 
   My friend from Idaho has suggested that somehow this commercial sales program deals with forest management. We should be candid: It deals with commercial sales. We are subsidizing some of the largest logging companies in America. To do so, the appropriators, in changing the President's recommendation, have stripped money from some of the most important accounts in the Forest Service. 
   Regarding the road maintenance account, we have in the neighborhood of 380,000 miles of roads in the national forests. That is more miles than we have on the National Interstate Highway System. Each one of those miles of new roads that are cut in requires a substantial amount of ongoing maintenance to prevent environmental damage. The Forest Service estimated it would require $431 million annually to begin to address the environmental consequences of some of these roads that have been cut through the national forest. The backlog is some $3.85 billion. Yet in the bill that the appropriators present to the floor, they have stripped about $11.3 million out of this road maintenance program. 
   From firsthand experience, based upon our experience in Nevada and the Tahoe Basin, that is a major contributing factor to erosion and degradation of the ecosystem. Yet in terms of priorities, the appropriators would set as a priority increasing the timber sales program and reducing the amount of money available for the road maintenance program. 
   In addition, they have cut substantial amounts of money out of the fish and wildlife accounts. 
   Putting the National Forest System in some perspective, only 4 percent of the timber harvested in America comes from the National Forest System. However, it is not the only use that the national forest has. The national forest, as my colleague from Illinois noted in citing his own personal experience, provides an enormous recreational opportunity for millions of people. Yet the programs which they depend upon--the fish and wildlife accounts to make sure the habitat is there, that the fishery is not devastated as a consequence of some of these practices--those accounts have been substantially reduced. The funding that goes to those accounts is an investment in the Nation's 63 million wildlife watchers, 14 million hunters, and 35 million anglers who spend approximately 127.6 million activity days hunting, fishing, and observing fish and wildlife annually on the national forests. 
   Those who oppose the amendment have cited some of the economic circumstances that have affected the logging industry. Let me suggest with great respect, those are consequences of changing technology. Those jobs, I regret to say, will never come back because we harvest differently. The technology is more efficient. It is less manpower intensive. 
   On the other hand, the moneys that we invest in these programs that deal with fish and wildlife directly result in local community expenditures of billions of dollars, in over 230,000 full-time equivalent jobs. 
   One out of every three anglers fishes the national forest waters nationally, and two out of three anglers in the West fish the national forest waters. 
   So what my colleagues from Oregon and Illinois have put together is a carefully crafted balance: Maintain the timber harvest program at a $196 million level but do not increase it, because of the massive subsidy involved and the damage that has been done to the national forest system; put money back into the road maintenance account to help address that backlog, which is a major contributor to the environmental degradation that the ecosystem, according to the National Forest Service, is experiencing; restore money to the fish and wildlife accounts so we can help those who use the national forests for recreational purposes and address their needs. 
   I think as evidence of how balanced this effort is, the editorial support is not confined to any particular region. The Chattanooga Times expresses its support for it, as does my own hometown newspaper, the Las Vegas Sun, the Pittsburgh Post Gazette, and the San Francisco Chronicle. All who looked at this recognize this subsidy needs to be limited. What we have done is provide a carefully balanced response to that. I urge my colleagues to  support the Bryan-Wyden-Fitzgerald amendment. 
   I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, today I am offering an amendment with my colleague from Illinois and my colleague from Oregon that is a win-win for the American taxpayer and the environment. 
   Our amendment reduces the subsidy for the below-cost timber program administered by the Forest Service and for the construction of logging roads in our national forests. 
   In addition, our amendment reallocates needed monies to those Forest Service programs underfunded by the committee, such as road maintenance, wildlife and fish habitat management, and threatened and endangered species habitat management. 
   Each year, the American taxpayers spend millions of dollars to subsidize the construction of roads needed for logging on national forest lands. 
   The appropriations bill before us today contains over $37 million for the Forest Service to assist in the construction and reconstruction of timber roads in our national forests. This assistance is in the form of contract administration, construction oversight, and engineering, planning, and design work performed by the Forest Service for the logging companies which are merely left with the task of building the roads to extract the timber. 
   Our amendment would reduce this subsidy by a modest amount, $1.6 million, which is the amount the program was increased above the administration's budget request. 
   Similarly, this bill contains $228.9 million for the administration of the timber sale program, which is more than $32 million above the administration's budget request. 
   These expenditures for a money losing timber program are an enormous drain on the Treasury. 
   In their most recent Forest Management Program Annual Report, dated July 1998, the Forest Service acknowledges losing $88.6 million from their timber program in fiscal year 1997. 
   This was the second consecutive year that the Forest Service reported a loss. 
   In addition to the reported loss, the $88.6 million figure excludes a full accounting of all costs associated with logging. 
   In past fiscal years, independent analyses estimate the loss from below-cost timber sales are far greater than those reported by the Forest Service. 
   The General Accounting Office estimated that the timber program cost  taxpayers at least $1.5 billion from 1992 to 1997. 
   Our amendment would reduce funding for timber sale management by $32.015 million to the level requested by the administration. 
   In spite of the fact that our National Forests supply a mere 4 percent of our nation's annual timber harvest, this bill continues to reflect the dominance of the timber program at the expense of other programs designed to improve forest health and enhance the public's enjoyment of our national forests. 
   More than 380,000 miles of roads criss-cross the national forests. This is a more extensive road network than the National Interstate Highway System. 
   The Forest Service estimates that over 80% of these roads are not maintained to public safety and environmental standards. 
   As a matter of public policy, I would argue that it makes more sense to maintain the roads we already have than to spend money building new roads we don't need. 
   Many scientists have found that road building threatens wildlife because it causes erosion of soils, fragments intact forest ecosystems, encourages the spread of noxious weeds and invasive species, and reduces habitat for many animals needing refuge from man. 
   It has been found that when roads wash out they dump rocks and soil on lower slopes and into streambeds, and even when they remain intact, roads act as channels for water and contribute further to the erosion of lands and streams. 
   Scientists say that the overall effect is that the streams and rivers fill with silt and the shallower waters mean degraded fish habitat and more flooding. 
   In my home state of Nevada, the road network throughout the Lake Tahoe basin has been identified as a major contributor to the degradation of water quality and decline in clarity of Lake Tahoe. 
   An important component of the Forest Service's road maintenance program involves the decommissioning of old logging roads. 
   This program has been essential to efforts in the Lake Tahoe basin to improve erosion control and the overall water quality of the lake. 
   The bill before us today cuts the administration's request for road maintenance by $11.3 million. 
   The Forest Service has indicated that their annual road maintenance needs total $431 million per year, and that their backlog for deferred maintenance totals $3.85 billion. 
   The bill before us today provides less than a quarter of the funding the Forest Service requires to address their annual road maintenance needs. 
   Addressing this need would have considerable environmental benefits, such as reducing erosion from roads and storm proofing existing culverts. 
   It is important to remember that the timber industry's responsibility for maintaining logging roads ends with the end of the timber sale, leaving all future maintenance costs to the taxpayer. 
   Our amendment adds $5.3 million for important road maintenance projects throughout our national forests. 
   The National Forests include nearly 200,000 miles of fishable streams and more than 2 million acres of lakes, ponds and reservoirs that support hundreds of inland fish species with important recreational, commercial, and ecological values. 
   The inland fisheries habitat management program allows the Forest Service to protect and restore inland streams and lakes, along with the fish and aquatic life they support. 
   The bill before us today cuts the administration's request for this program by $7 million. 
   Our amendment proposes to restore $3.115 million in funding for this program. 
   This additional funding would allow the Forest Service to enhance or restore several hundred miles of stream and over 400 additional acres of ponds, lakes, and reservoirs. 
   The National Forests also provide critical spawning and rearing habitat for Pacific, Great Lakes, and Atlantic stocks of anadromous fish, such as salmon, sturgeons, and lampreys. 
   These stocks contribute significantly to the quality of life, recreational and commercial fishing, and the economy of local communities. 
   The Interior bill cuts the administration's funding request for anadromous fisheries habitat management by $6.4 million. 
   Our amendment proposes to restore $1.6 million for this program. 
   This funding will enable the Forest Service to complete critical work on over 100 additional miles of anadromous streams and 1,000 acres of additional acres of anadromous lakes and reservoirs, complementing the efforts of our state, federal, and tribal partners. 
   The wildlife habitat management program of the Forest Service for fiscal year 2000 will focus on prescribed burns to improve wildlife habitat. 
   It will help to develop and protect wetlands and water sources in arid habitats for waterfowl, quail, and wild turkey, in addition to restoring riparian habitat that benefits big game. 
   The subcommittee cut $5 million from the wildlife program. 
   Our amendment would restore $1.6 million in funding for this program. 
   This funding would provide for an additional 8,000 acres of important habitat improvement, which would benefit both game and nongame species, and result in enhanced opportunities for wildlife-related recreation. 
   The activities of the threatened, endangered, and sensitive species program serve to achieve recovery goals for threatened and endangered animals and plants. 
   The Forest Service has indicated that this program continues to be essential to the mission of their agency. 
   The committee cut the endangered species program by $5 million. 
   Our amendment would restore $2 million for this program, which would allow the Forest Service to pursue conservation strategies to prevent the need for listing, thereby avoiding the loss of management flexibility and increased operating costs once listing occurs. 
    Mr. President, the $20 million our amendment adds to wildlife, fisheries, and rare plant habitat management programs would enable the Forest Service to increase Challenge Cost-Share partnerships with organizations throughout the country, enabling the agency to leverage funding, better serve the public, and improve vital habitats for fish and wildlife. 
   This funding is an investment for the nation's 63 million wildlife watchers, 14 million hunters, and 35 million anglers who spend approximately 127.6 million activity days hunting, fishing, and observing fish and wildlife annually on national forests. 
   This result in local community expenditures of billions of dollars and over 230,000 full-time equivalent jobs. 
   One out of every three anglers fish national forest waters nationally, and two out of three anglers in the West fish national forest waters. 
   That is why our amendment is supported by groups like Trout Unlimited, the American Sportfishing Association, and Wildlife Forever. 
    Mr. President, I would urge my colleagues to join a strong coalition of environmental, hunting, fishing, and taxpayer organizations in support of the Bryan-Fitzgerald-Wyden amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, during the course of the debate, the Senator from Idaho propounded to the Senator from Nevada a query as to how I could be supportive of this amendment and then made reference to the fact of Lake Tahoe, with all the problems we have in Tahoe. My own previous statements on Tahoe indicated the extent of the devastation that has been caused with dying trees and timber. 
   To suggest that somehow increasing the commercial harvesting of timber would in any way ameliorate the problems we face at Tahoe would be a totally spurious argument. The problems at Tahoe are compounded because we had a 7-year drought, the most protracted in recorded memory, and as a result, the forest became very vulnerable to infestation from beetles that ultimately killed vast amounts of trees in the Tahoe Basin. 
   So adding to the commercial harvest would in no way help. 
   Secondly, with respect to Tahoe, we are reaping a whirlwind of practices that involve the extensive cutting of road network to the Tahoe Basin. The clarity of the lake is declining rapidly. This is a lake that Mark Twain rhapsodized about. John C. Fremont, on Valentine's Day in 1844, was the first European to see Lake Tahoe, and perhaps that date has some significance because those of us who live in Nevada have had a love affair with Lake Tahoe ever since. 
   The problem in Tahoe is exacerbated because of this road network that was built throughout the basin during a period of intense harvesting in the last century. The timber at Tahoe was used for the great mining activities of Virginia City. But it is instructive and helpful because the primary contributing factor to the erosion that is causing the deterioration of waters and clarity is the runoff from these old roads, and road maintenance is what we need so desperately. 
   So I say that my friend from Idaho confuses the issue when he talks about the problems at Tahoe and the thrust of the Bryan-Wyden amendment, which is simply to take about $32 million from the commercial timber operations and reprogram those into some accounts that include road maintenance and fish and wildlife management. 
   Let me make the point about road maintenance, if I may, again. The Bryan-Wyden amendment does not eliminate commercial timber sales in the national forests. My friend from Alaska referenced that we should allow professionals to make the determination as to how much harvesting should occur. That recommendation is included by the managers of the Forest Service, and they recommended a number of $196 million. That was in the President's recommendation. 
   Now, what the appropriators did was, they stripped out $34 million from road maintenance and fish and wildlife accounts and added that back into the timber sales to bring that number up to about $228 million. My friend from Arkansas was talking about the need for forest health and to do a lot of things. Those are totally different accounts. We are talking, on the one hand, of reducing to the level of the President's recommended appropriation the commercial timber sale account of $196 million and to add $32 million to that account. What the appropriators did was to reduce by $11 million the road maintenance account. 
   It is the road maintenance account that helps to alleviate the erosion and the other adverse environmental consequences that attach to the neglect of that maintenance. The testimony is that the Forest Service would need $431 million a year for road maintenance alone, that there is a total backlog of $3.85 billion in road maintenance. By rejecting the Bryan-Wyden amendment, you make that backlog even longer because the appropriators have stripped $11 million from that account. 
   Now, every mile of new construction adds to that backlog because under the law, once the harvesting operation has been completed, the timber harvester has no responsibility for the maintenance of that road. That, then, is left to the Forest Service and the American taxpayer. We already have 380,000 miles in the National forests. As I commented in my opening statement, that is more mileage than we have on the interstate system in America. 
   The things my friend from Idaho was talking about, in terms of fire burns and removing dead timber, have nothing to do--absolutely nothing--with the commercial timber sale account. 
   Those activities are included in other accounts, such as the Wild Land Fire Management Act. So I think we have a confusion here as we debate these issues. 
   The Bryan-Wyden amendment would simply reduce to the level of the professional managers' recommendation in the Forest Service the commercial timber sale account of $196 million and would restore, essentially, to the environmental accounts and road maintenance accounts much of that money that was taken out. That is where the management practices need to be addressed. That is the focus. That is where the environmental problems are --road maintenance and fish and wildlife habitat. 
   In effect, what the appropriators did is to strip those accounts and reduce them substantially to add to the timber sale account. There is no benefit to the environment at Lake Tahoe by increasing the commercial timber sale accounts. That simply does absolutely nothing for us at all. So I wanted to clarify the RECORD where my friend from Idaho has confused it. The Senator from Nevada is being absolutely consistent. 
   I might just say, in terms of the broad public policy, the General Accounting Office concluded that, from 1992 to 1997, the commercial sales in the national forests have cost the American taxpayer $1.5 billion. So there is another issue out here to be debated in terms of the public policy. The Bryan-Wyden amendment does not eliminate but simply reduces to the level of the Presidential recommendation in terms of the appropriation. 
   If the Senator from Idaho were interested in seeing the problems more adequately addressed, he would favor reducing the amount of the commercial sales and restoring the $11 million that was stripped from that account. We need far more dollars in the road maintenance account, in which the backlog is over $3 billion. 
   So every attempt to reduce the amount of the road maintenance account and add money to the new construction account makes the situation much worse. I argue that the more prudent and rational public policy is to deal with neglected road maintenance and provide additional money in that account rather than to add to the commercial sale account. I wanted to make that point for the record. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. WYDEN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. BRYAN. Madam President, I thank the floor manager for an opportunity to respond. 
   When one looks at the totality of problems, they are tall: Runoff, the erosion control, and the declining clarity. These are the primary, but not the exclusive, problems in the basin. 
   The roads that were cut through many decades ago are in the road maintenance account. As the Senator understands, there is a new construction account; there is a road maintenance account. The appropriators removed $11.3 million from the road maintenance account. From our perspective, that is the most serious account reduction that would impact what we are talking about. The road maintenance money account has a backlog: $3.85 billion has been discussed by the Forest Service, or $431 million. I think it is a matter of priorities. Our priority is to get back the road maintenance account money. 
   Indeed, with respect to some of the prescribed burn and other forest practices the Senator talks about, I think we are in agreement that clearly there are things that need to be done to thin out some of the underbrush. Those are taken care of in other accounts such as wildlife fire management and a forest land vegetation program. 
   There are a host of programs that are line item. The two I just mentioned, the wildlife fire management account and the forest land vegetation management program, are where some of the controlled burns and thinning occur. Those are the programs, from our point of view, that have a priority over the Senator's priority which would lead to an increased commercial operation. 
   That is where the Senator from Nevada comes from.

   Mr. BRYAN. If I can respond briefly--I don't want to get into a semantic game--it is a reduction over what the President recommended, I think the Senator will agree. It is a reduction of $11.3 million over what the President proposed. It may very well be, as the Senator indicates, an increase over what was approved for the last program.

   Mr. BRYAN. I think I did use the term ``cut.'' What I meant to say, and what I stand by, is the appropriators, in effect, cut this money from the original appropriation of the President. That represents a difference in priorities, the $431 million annual backlog, with a total backlog of $3.85 billion. It would be the priority of the Senator from Nevada that the President's recommendation not be reduced as the appropriators did, and I appreciate the chance to clarify that point.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the amendment offered by the distinguished Senators from Florida and Wyoming, Mr. GRAHAM and Mr. ENZI. This is an amendment that prevents the Interior Department from implementing new regulations that seriously threaten the rights of States to regulate gaming activities within their borders. 
   This amendment reinstates the prohibition on the Secretary of the Interior, which expired on March 31, from approving casino gaming on Indian land in the absence of a tribal-State compact. A similar provision was adopted unanimously by the Senate as part of the fiscal year 1998 Interior appropriations bill as well as the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill. 
   As many of my colleagues are aware, the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act enacted in 1988 divides Indian gaming into three categories. The amendment offered for consideration on the Senate floor today addresses the conduct of class III gaming; that is, casino gaming, slot machines, video poker, and other casino-type games. 
   Under IGRA, the Congress very clearly intended to authorize Indian tribes to enjoy and to participate in gaming activities within their respective States to the same extent as a matter of public policy that the State confers gaming opportunities generally to the State. 
   There are two clear extremes. In one case, we have the States of Utah and Hawaii. Those are the only two of the 50 States that I am aware of that permit no form of Indian gaming. It is very clear that because those two States as a matter of public policy confer no gaming opportunities upon its citizenry, Indian tribes in Utah and Hawaii have no ability to conduct gaming activities within the class III description, the so-called casino-type games. 
   Equally clear at the other end of the spectrum is my home State of Nevada. Nevada has embraced casino gaming since 1931. It is equally clear in Nevada law that the Indian tribes in my own State are entitled to a full range of casino gaming. Indeed, compacts have been introduced to accomplish that purpose. 
   Under IGRA, the class III gaming activity is lawful on Indian lands only if three conditions are made: 
   No. 1, there is an authorized ordinance adopted by the governing body of a tribe and approved by the Chairman of the National Gaming Indian Commission; 
   No. 2, located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity--I want to return to that because that is the key here--located in a State that permits such gaming for any purpose by any person, organization, or entity. 
   No. 3, are conducted in conformance with a tribal-State compact. 
   As I know the distinguished occupant of the Chair fully understands, the implementation of IGRA requires that compact be negotiated and entered into between the Governor of the State and the tribe within that State that is seeking to conduct class III activity. When IGRA was enacted in 1988, Congress was careful to create a balance between State and tribal interests. One of the fundamental precepts of IGRA is that States and tribes must negotiate agreements or compacts that delineate the scope of permissible gaming activities available to the tribes. 
   Again, the intent of IGRA is clear and I support its concept. Very simply stated: To the extent that a State authorizes certain gaming activity as a matter of public policy within the boundaries of that State, Indian tribes located within that State should have the same opportunity. There is no fundamental disagreement about that. 
   However, a situation has arisen in a number of States in which Indian tribes have tried to force Governors to negotiate extended gaming activities that are not authorized or permitted by law within that State; for example, a State that may authorize only a lottery might be pressed by a tribe to permit slot machines--clearly something that IGRA did not contemplate. It is in that area that we have had some very serious disagreements. 
   The new Interior Department regulations destroy the compromise that is reflected in IGRA. It is in my view a blatant attempt by the Secretary to rewrite the law without congressional approval. The rule that has been promulgated allows the Secretary to prescribe ``procedures'' which the Interior Department characterizes as a legal substitute for a tribal-State compact, in the event a State asserts an 11th amendment sovereign immunity defense to a suit brought by a tribe claiming a State has not negotiated in good faith. 
   The effect of this rule for all intents and purposes nullifies the State's constitutionally guaranteed sovereign immunity by allowing the Secretary of the Interior to become a substitute Federal court that can hear the dispute brought by the tribe against the State. Ironically, the new rule permits a tribe to sue based on any stalemate brought about by its own unreasonable demands on the State, such as insisting on gaming activities that violate that State's law. 
   I support this amendment because I believe, as do the Governors and the States Attorney General, that the Secretary does not possess the legal authority he has sought to grant to himself under this rule, and that statutory modifications to IGRA are necessary in order to resolve a State's sovereign immunity claim. 
   In a letter to the majority leader and the Democratic leader, the Nation's Governors stated they strongly believe that no statute or court decision provides the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior with the authority to intervene in disputes over compacts between Indian tribes and States about casino gambling on Indian lands. In light of this strongly held view, the States of Florida and Alabama have already filed suit against the Secretary to declare the new rule ultra vires. 
   The most troubling aspect of the new rule is that the Secretary of the Interior grants himself the sole authority to provide for casino gaming on Indian lands in the absence of the tribal-State compact. 
   As a former Governor, I appreciate the States' concern with the inherent conflict of interest of the Secretary in resolving a major public policy issue between a State and Indian tribe while also maintaining his overall trust responsibility to the tribe. 
   I ask my colleagues to consider the Secretary of the Interior would in effect be the arbiter where a dispute arose between the tribe and the Governor in which the tribe was asserting a claim to have more gaming activity than is lawfully permitted in the State. The Secretary of the Interior, who  holds a trust responsibility to the tribe, would in effect be making the determination in that State as to what kind of gaming activity would be permitted. 
   I cannot imagine something that is a more flagrant violation of a State's sovereignty and its ability, as a matter of public policy, to circumscribe the type of gaming activity permitted. The States have asserted a wide variety of these. Some States, as I indicated earlier, provide for no gaming activity at all. Others provide for a full range of casino gaming, as does my own State. Other States permit lotteries. Still others authorize certain types of card games. Others permit a variation of horse or dogtrack racing, both on- and off-track. 
   So a State faces the real possibility, under this rule, if it is not invalidated--and I believe legally it has no force and effect, but we want to make sure this amendment prohibits the attempt of the Secretary to implement it--in effect, the Secretary of the Interior would have the ability to set public policy among the respective States as to what type of gaming activities could occur on Indian reservations within those States. We are talking now about class III casino gaming. Even though a State Governor and the legislature and the people of that State may have determined, as a matter of public policy, that they want a very limited form of gaming--a lottery or racetrack betting at the track as opposed to off-track--the Secretary would have the ability, when a tribe asserted more than the State's law permitted, to, in effect, resolve that. I cannot think of anything that is more violative of a fundamental States rights issue in terms of its sovereignty and its ability as a matter of public policy to make that determination. 
   I agree with many of my colleagues that statutory changes to IGRA are in order, in light of recent court decisions. I am hopeful that Congress will see fit to reassert its lawmaking authority in this area by reexamining IGRA, rather than sitting on the sidelines while the Secretary of the Interior performs that task. 
   But, in the meantime, it is imperative that the Congress prohibit the Secretary from approving class III gaming procedures without State approval. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support the carefully crafted amendment by my colleague from Florida, Senator GRAHAM, and Senator ENZI from Wyoming--an amendment to preserve the role for States in the conduct of gaming on Indian lands. 
   It is fair, it is balanced, and it is reasonable. It is consistent with the overall intent of IGRA, which was adopted in 1988 by the Congress, to permit class III gaming activities when the three conditions which I have enumerated are met, ultimately with a compact negotiated by the Governor and the tribe within that State. In the absence of such an agreement, the Secretary of the Interior must not be allowed to determine that State's public policy. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Senator from New York and the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I came to the Senate as a new Member in January 1989, at the end of the decade of the 1980s. The fiscal policies the Federal Government pursued during the 1980s resulted in a Federal budget that was awash in red ink. 
   At the beginning of the 1980s, the entire national debt--from the time of the ratification of the Constitution up until 1980--was less than $1 trillion. That included the assumption of the Revolutionary War debt, financing a costly and devastating Civil War, two world wars, Korea, Vietnam, and the programs of the Great Depression. 
   In less than a decade, the national debt tripled to $3 trillion. That is an indictment of the fiscal policies of the 1980s that we ought not to repeat. 
   Mr. President, we have an opportunity here. 
   One can debate as to who should take credit for the circumstances which none of us could have foreseen a decade ago. A decade ago it was my fondest hope that somehow we would be able to control the spiraling annual deficits which were hundreds of billions of dollars each year. When asked by my fellow Nevadans, how about the national debt, how are you going to pay that back, my response was: I did not see any realistic likelihood that that would occur in my lifetime, certainly not my lifetime as a Member of the Senate. 
   So today we are in a fortuitous circumstance. As I said, who gets credit for that, that is an issue we can debate at some length. But we have an opportunity to do the responsible thing, and we have the opportunity to do the irresponsible thing. 
   I think the responsible course of action is to save Social Security, ensure the solvency of Medicare, pay down the national debt, and then provide for a modest and realistic tax cut. That is the responsible thing to do. 
   In my judgment, the irresponsible alternative is the Republican tax cut before us. 
   There have been numbers bandied around, $3 trillion is the projected surplus. With respect to the Social Security surplus, that means the Social Security taxes that exceed the amount of the Social Security payments, it is projected over the next decade that that surplus will amount to $1.9 trillion. With respect to that surplus, there is no disagreement. That should be set aside to protect Social Security. 
   The debate is about the $1 trillion projected surplus that is referred to as on-budget or non-Social Security surplus. 
   Earlier this morning, as a member of the Senate Banking 
   Committee, we were privileged to have Alan Greenspan, the distinguished and able Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. There are many, Democrats and Republicans alike across the land, who give Alan Greenspan a substantial measure of credit for the reversals in our fortunes at the Federal level in terms of the situation we find ourselves in today, where we are talking about projected surpluses and not projected deficits. I was privileged to have an opportunity to ask him a question. 
   I said: Mr. Chairman--directed to Mr. Greenspan--given our current economic circumstances, if we had three choices, what choice would you make: Choice No. 1, a substantial tax cut; Choice No. 2, additional spending; Choice No. 3, reducing the debt? 
   His answer, unequivocal: Reduce the debt. That, he said, would be the most important thing this Congress could do in fiscal policy to continue the extension of the longest economic expansion in our Nation's history. That comes from Chairman Greenspan. 
   Now, under the Republican proposal before us, $964 billion is the on-budget surplus. Their proposal would be to reduce taxes by $792 billion. 
   I understand the instant gratification and I understand that if in a roomful of good and hard-working Americans you asked, would you like to pay less tax, all of us would say yes. Perhaps it is because my wife and I are entering a new period in our lives--we are blessed with three adult children, two of whom have blessed us with grandchildren and a third to bless us with a grandchild to be in a couple of weeks--that my thoughts are not with respect to instant gratification, not the kind of political rhetoric ``we want to return your money to you.'' What is the responsible thing to do for the country? What about my grandchildren and your grandchildren? Ought we not to think about them? Our generation doesn't have a particularly impressive track record running up a national debt that tripled in less than a decade. 
   The Republican plan would reduce taxes by $792 billion, would cost $141 billion of additional interest, and would result in a surplus remaining over the 10-year period of $32 billion. This surplus that is projected over 10 years is on a very shaky foundation. 
   I also was able to ask Mr. Greenspan to talk about projections. I said to him: Is it not true, Mr. Chairman, that not even the most able economists--distinguished graduates of the Wharton School of Finance, the Harvard Business School, the Stanford Business School, the most erudite institutions in America--isn't it true that no one can tell us what the economy is going to be like next year, much less what it is going to be like a decade from now? He opined that that was in fact the case. 
   So this policy is built upon a house of cards. We are not sure these surpluses will, in fact, materialize. Yet we build in to our legislative actions a $792 billion tax cut. 
   We have been there before, and we have done that before, in the 1980s. We were told in the 1980s that we could have substantial tax cuts and, at the end of the day, we would still be able to reduce the national debt. That did not occur. The national debt more than tripled. 
   I know that our friends on the other side of the aisle would say that had nothing to do with tax cuts. That is because you all in Congress spent recklessly, foolishly, and irresponsibly. 
   I was not a part of the Congress at that time. I will not defend all of the expenditures. But I will tell Senators this: If you add what President Reagan requested the Congress to spend in the 8 years he was President and you add up the appropriations that the Congress approved during those 8 years, some of those with a Republican majority in the Senate, the Congress approved $13 billion less, $13 billion less than President Reagan requested. So whether you went to school, as I did, with the old math or the new math, those kinds of tax cuts left us with deficits in the trillions of dollars. 
   Mr. President, I ask the distinguished leader if he would extend me another 5 minutes; is that possible?

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, there are several assumptions that our Republican colleagues make in reaching the conclusion of a $792 billion tax cut, $141 billion in interest, leaving a $32 billion surplus to take care of Medicare, other priorities, including reducing the debt. It is a very shaky assumption. Mr. Greenspan also told us this morning that history teaches us to be cautious. This surplus may never materialize. No one can predict with certainty whether it will occur or not. 
   Implicit in this are some other assumptions that are totally unrealistic. One of those assumptions is we will be able to reduce discretionary spending by $700 billion over the next 10 years. Now, there are more people in America who believe there will be a sighting of Elvis than believe that we are going to reduce discretionary spending by $700 billion. We are talking about such programs as veterans' health, education, what we need to do for agriculture, and any kind of emergencies that might occur as a result of natural calamities or disasters. So the assumption that we can reduce spending by $700 billion in the discretionary accounts, also including national defense, is not realistic. 
   Indeed, that is premised also upon the spending caps that are in place--next year and the year after it will be even tighter--that we will be able to adhere to them. The chairman of the Banking Committee, as part of his questioning to Mr. Greenspan, indicated that in the House already this year they are talking about emergency spending, which is a vehicle to avoid the spending caps and, in point of fact, is not emergency spending at all--$3.5 billion or $4.5 billion for the census, $3 billion for veterans' health, $30 billion this year alone. That wipes this out. 
   The point I am trying to make is this is a highly reckless and irresponsible approach. What we ought to do is protect Social Security with the $1.9 trillion surplus, and there is agreement on that. Next, we need to shore up Social Security solvency, pay down that debt, reduce the amount of money we are paying on interest on the national debt, so that we can do some other things with the additional tax cuts or selective spending in terms of veterans' health, or education, or national defense, whatever we determine the priorities may be, and then a more modest tax cut. 
   The Democratic alternative, I think, comes pretty close to hitting the mark: Tax cuts of $290 billion, Medicare cuts of $290 billion, domestic needs of $290 billion--that reduces spending in real terms over the next 10 years by about $300 billion--and interest, $126 billion. That is a more responsible approach. 
   I hope we do not revisit the mistakes of the past. Chairman Greenspan, it seems to me, had a lot of wisdom to offer. History teaches us to be cautious. These surpluses may, indeed, never occur and, indeed, if we can pay down the national debt, would we not be doing something for our children and our grandchildren that is the responsible course of action, something we can all be proud of, and provide a reduction in the interest payments we make each year, which is about $230 billion? 
   I thank the Chair and yield the floor.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington State. I thank the Chair. 
   There are a couple of points I would like to make. I know we are winding up this debate. 
   No. 1, I think it is important for the public to understand that this industry faces a very dire financial situation. 
   In Nevada, we have witnessed in the last decade the third renaissance of mining activity. It has employed thousands and thousands of people in my State with an average salary about $49,000 a year with a full range of benefits. These are good jobs. 
   Because of the declining price of gold on the world market, we have lost more than 2,000 jobs in the last 6 months alone, and more are scheduled to be laid off. In part, this is because of some proposals by the British Government and the IMF gold sales. It is a separate issue for us. But we are facing a very difficult time. 
   The second point I would like to make is that this has been framed as an environmental issue. It is not. The full panoply of all of the environmental laws enacted since the late 1960s applies to this industry. So they are not exempt from any of these provisions. 
   Finally, the point needs to be made that with respect to the reclamation, or lack thereof, we are frequently invited to the specter of what happened decades ago. I don't defend that. This is a new era, and every mine application for a permit requires a reclamation process and the posting of the bond to make sure these kinds of problems do not develop. 
   Why are we so upset about the Solicitor's opinion? For more than a century unchallenged, the interpretation given by the Solicitor's office was never viewed as the law. In this current administration, when the Clinton administration came into office, at no time during the early years was this kind of interpretation attached. 
   All of those in this industry relying upon the law as it is--I agree with my colleagues who point out that the law of 1872 needs to be changed. I support those provisions. I think there should be a fair market value for the surface that is taken. There should be a royalty provision. There should be a reverter if the land is no longer used for mining purposes. I agree that there should be a reclamation process that is required. The devil has been in the details. Unfortunately, we have not been able to reach an agreement on that. 
   But those who have sought and applied for the permits have done so based upon the law as it is today, and the regulations and the manual passed along to us by the Bureau of Land Management say nothing about one mill site for every mining claim--not a word, not a jot, not a title. 
   This is a new development. It is unfair. I urge my colleagues to reject the proposal.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to call your attention to a situation that I became aware of only a short time ago. An article that appeared in the June 28 issue of Newsweek caught my attention. It is entitled ``Nuclear Leaks of Another Kind.'' 
   This was in the context of a discussion we have had about some of the espionage activity that has occurred in our labs and, particularly, the issue as it relates to Los Alamos in recent months. Let me share an excerpt so my colleagues will get the flavor of the article and understand the amendment I am offering and its underlying purpose. 
   The article begins by saying:  
   Nuclear secrets aren't the only kind of unauthorized leaks from U.S. weapons labs. According to a General Accounting Office draft report obtained by Newsweek, over the past three weeks, the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore labs were assessed fines of hundreds of thousands of dollars for safety violations, including exposing their employees to radiation levels that exceed the standards promulgated by the Department of Energy.  
   Then it goes on to say that, under the law, in an anomaly--which the occupant of the Chair will readily appreciate because of his own extraordinary and impressive legal background--we make a distinction with respect to the contractor status of those who work in the DOE labs. If the contractor is a contractor who is a private entrepreneur--that is to say, it is a profit-making contractor--these fines for safety violations--one in particular that caught my eye is the radiation standards to protect the employees according to the DOE promulgated standards. With respect to those fines that would be imposed upon a contractor who is a private sector contractor, the fines are assessed and collected. But under what I consider an extraordinary anomaly in the law, if you are a nonprofit contractor, the very violation--again, fundamental to the essence of protecting the health and safety of the employees; namely, the radiation standard they would be exposed to--for those kinds of violations, a fine is assessed but is never collected. 
   So in effect we have a totally inconsistent policy. One says that if you are a private contractor and you are an entrepreneur and are in the business to make money or to profit from that--all of which is very legitimate--and you violate one of the DOE's safety regulations and you are fined, you are assessed initially, and the fine is collected. If you are a nonprofit, you are assessed for the identical violation, but it is never collected. 
   Let me say that the General Accounting Office report that was referenced in this Newsweek article has now been made public in its final form. This is a document issued June 1999: General Accounting Office, Department of Energy Nuclear Safety, ``Enforcement Program Should Be Strengthened.'' 
   This report gives additional persuasive force to what I propose in the amendment. This General Accounting Office report makes an important point that if the regulations were promulgated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the NRC, no distinction is made between the private sector contractor and the public sector contractor. That is to say, if a violation occurs with respect to the nonprofit contractor, and it is a violation of health and safety standards, then the nonprofit is assessed and a fine may be collected. So we have an anomaly in the law that makes no public policy sense at all. 
   Let me make it clear to my colleagues that it is not my 
   intention to impose onerous fines on nonprofit entities that have a contract. But as the General Accounting Office makes very clear, the fact that a fine may be collected has a deterrent value. As this report further makes the point, there is no rational basis--none whatsoever--in making the distinction between for-profit and nonprofit contractors, and the further point that the purpose of imposing these civil penalties is not to collect fines but to encourage contractors to perform safely, that is the issue that I seek to address. 
   I recognize the concern that the nonprofits raise that, my golly, if you change the law, somehow this may constitute an invasion of our endowment moneys; that all of this could be compromised. Let me assure my colleagues that nothing is further from the truth. That is not what I intend. 
   So as a further effort to assuage those concerns in the amendment that  is before this body, we would limit any fine that was assessed to the amount of the performance fee provided to the nonprofit contractor by the Department. Let me repeat that. In effect, we would put a ceiling, a limit, if you will, on any fine that would be assessed and would say that, in no event, notwithstanding the extent, severity, and the extended period of time in which the violation may have occurred, may the fine exceed the performance fee that you are provided. It strikes me that that addresses fairly and reasonably the concern that a nonprofit would have in terms of the potential invasion of the endowments. 
   The point I seek to emphasize is that nonprofits have a track record of some very extensive fines. The assessments, according to the report, amount to several hundreds of thousands of dollars. So we are not talking about something that is theoretical, hypothetical, or highly speculative; it has occurred. And, remember, under current law, with respect to nonprofits, a fine can be assessed but never collected. So human nature tells us--and our entire legal system is structured on this premise--that for people who violate the rules, whether it is a speed limit or some other regulation, the fact that one can be fined or can be subject to some kind of a sanction, tends to influence our behavior in a positive way. 
   That is, we don't do that sort of thing. No one is accusing the nonprofits of bad faith. But I must say we have not gotten their attention with respect to these violations. 
   I conclude, as I began, by describing the nature of these violations. We are not talking about some highly technical extenuated rule or regulation that only a flyspeck--as we used to say--lawyer could pick up. We are talking about something fundamental to the public health and safety. That is the radiation standard--the exposure to which employees in these laboratories could be exposed. 
   I can't think of anything that would be more significant or more important in terms of health and safety than to make sure the laboratory is adhering to a radiation standard which the Department of Energy has promulgated, which they say is to observe to protect health and safety. 
   Let me say that I have had a little experience in this area, not as a technical person, but many years ago in my youth I worked as an employee at the Nevada Test Site. Every employee who entered the Nevada Test Site was given a badge. That badge had in it a gasometer. The reason for that is this was during the days of atmospheric testing programs. It was to periodically check to make sure no employee by inadvertence or accident was exposed to a higher radiation standard than had been determined necessary for the protection of the health and safety of that employee. 
   In the same spirit, these standards have been imposed to protect the health and safety of those individuals who work in the lab. That is the kind of violation about which we are talking. 
   I have attempted to work some type of an accommodation through the very able manager of the bill, and others, particularly the distinguished Senator from New Mexico, who understandably have an interest in this measure. We have not been able to reach an agreement. 
   I want to serve notice that this is not the last time this amendment will surface. This is a gross injustice to those employees who serve in the lab, and their families. Their health and safety can be endangered. And those who would do so face no penalty under the law. 
   I will not ask for a rollcall vote on this amendment. I intend to withdraw the amendment at the appropriate time, after the distinguished chairman of the committee responds. But this is an issue which must be addressed. It will be addressed by this Senator. We will have a series of votes on this at a later point in time if we are not able to reach an accommodation. 
   I will be happy to either yield the floor or to respond to any questions that the able managers of the bill have.

   I am not sure of the parliamentary vehicle that I may need to employ. If I need to ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment--I don't think I need that--if I do, I will ask for it. 
   If the Chair will guide the gentleman from Nevada, I will ease us out of this parliamentary situation.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, for those Americans who have been harmed by the decisions of managed care plans, this public debate is long overdue. For those who yet face a decision about their health care made by their managed care plan, the end to the wait cannot come soon enough. 
   The Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure those who depend on managed care plans for their health care will not be receiving a lesser standard of care than those who do not. 
   Last week while I was in Nevada, people voiced concerns about who really makes their medical care decisions if they are in a managed care plan. They wanted to know what would happen, under the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights, when a patient is told by his or her physician they need a specific treatment, and the physician informs the patient that the plan must first approve or disapprove his decision. 
   Would their physician be able to decide what treatments would be appropriate for their medical condition? Or, would they be at the mercy of a managed care plan bureaucrat far removed from the situation who would decide ``yea or nay'' on treatment determined necessary by their physician? 
   We can all empathize with the stress involved in this situation--your doctor has determined what your medical condition requires for appropriate care, but you must wait to see if what you need is approved by the plan. If the answer is ``no'', then you must either forego the care, or pay for it out-of-pocket --not a very good choice. 
   And what if you found yourself in the situation of a Nevada man, covered by an HMO plan, who came into an emergency room suffering from an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The emergency room physician called for a gastroenterologist to perform an emergency procedure to halt the bleeding. But the gastroenterologist would not treat this man without a prior authorization from the HMO plan. If he did the procedure without the authorization, he would not be paid. The doctor tried to contact the HMO for an hour to get the necessary authorization. During this time, the emergency room had to give the patient four units of blood, which would not otherwise have been required if the procedure had been done in a timely manner. Finally when it appeared the patient might not survive, the doctor contacted the HMO plan and said if he did not get authorization for the procedure, he would go to the media about this patient. The HMO then authorized the procedure. 
   The Democrats' ``medical necessity'' amendment would prohibit all managed care plans from arbitrarily interfering with a doctor's decision that the needed health care be provided in a particular setting, or is medically necessary and appropriate. 
   The amendment's definition uses a professional standard of ``medical necessity''. This is reasonable for both the patient and his or her treating physician, and the particular managed care plan. If a decision on whether or not to cover a particular treatment is made pursuant to a professional standard, it will be based on standards and case law interpretations historically used by insurance companies. 
   If a managed care plan can use its own definition of ``medical necessity'', any external review of a plan's treatment decisions would be resolved using that definition. This very likely would not work to the benefit of the patient. 
   The Democrats' approach would also maintain the important relationship between a doctor and the patient. It is a relationship that of necessity must be based on complete communication and trust between the two. 
   The Democrats' proposal will also ensure patients have a right to an external appeal from the decisions made by their managed care plans. One of the key provisions of this amendment is its requirement the appeal process be timely--for both internal and external appeals. It also requires ``expedited'' reviews when a patient is facing a medical emergency. 
   The Republican bill provides patients no guarantee of an expedited review for medical emergencies. Additionally, a managed care plan could simply delay sending the information needed for an appeal of one of its decisions. There is no deadline requirement for a plan to respond to a decision made by a reviewer. Without a timeliness requirement, patients are at the mercy of when, if ever, a plan wants to deal with an appealed case. 
   The Republican bill would drastically limit the application of its proposed patient protections to only one type of health care insurance--the self-funded employer plans. Those types of managed care plans provide the medical insurance for many Nevadans who work in the gaming industry. Those employees should have protections. But, why should 113 million people with private insurance be left unprotected? That is what the Republican bill would do, and it is wrong. For those small businesses which provide health insurance for their employees, almost all must depend upon the private insurance market for their coverage. Why should small businesses' employees have less protection than those workers in larger businesses which can afford to self-insure? Why should Americans who have to purchase their health insurance themselves, because they do not have an employer's assistance, be left unprotected? 
   The Republican bill will only cover 48 million Americans. The Democrats' bill will cover 161 million Americans--both those covered by self-insured employers, and those covered by private insurance. Why should 113 million Americans be without protection? Should we protect only 48 million, or protect 161 million? It is an easy decision. 
   Women should be able to designate their OB/GYN as their primary physician, and to have direct access to OB/GYN services without first having to obtain a specialist referral. Women also should make a decision with their physicians about the length of their hospital stay when they have a mastectomy. I have long supported these efforts to level the field of health care services for women. The Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure those protections. 
   For individuals who are chronically ill, or have medical problems requiring access to speciality care, the Patients' Bill of Rights will require plans to provide access to specialists. If plans do not have an appropriate specialist within their plans, then the patient will be allowed to go outside the plan network, at no additional cost. The Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights will ensure this access. 
   Every American should be assured the quality of their health care and their access to health care options is not diminished, because they rely upon an HMO for their health care coverage. 
   All of the 161 million Americans throughout this country who receive their health care through managed care plans deserve the protections included in the Democrats' Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   The opportunity is before us to ensure those protections. But that opportunity is going to be lost today. And that is a tragedy for everyone who depends on managed health care.

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the historic event that took place this past weekend in Paris when Las Vegas's own Andre Agassi captured the 1999 French Open Championship. Andre's completion of the career Grand Slam secures him a place in tennis history that only five other men can claim, and as a testament to his versality, he is the only person to accomplish this feat on three different surfaces--hardcourt, grass, and clay. He is the first American in 61 years to win all four majors--Wimbledom in 1992, the U.S. Open in 1994, the Australian Open in 1995, and now the French--and his victory will soon catapult him to No. 4 in the world rankings. 
   As great as Andre's accomplishments have been on the court throughout his career, they are, in my opinion, overshadowed by the generosity and compassion he has shown off the court. Andre's commitment to at-risk and underprivileged youth has been a passion of his throughout his tennis career. His establishment of the Andre Agassi Foundation in 1994 to support and fund programs that serve underprivileged kids has provided much needed assistance to a variety of service organizations that work with children in the Las Vegas area, including the Boys & Girls Clubs in Las Vegas, the Assistance League of Las Vegas, and Child Haven. Since its inception, the Agassi Foundation has donated over $5 million to local youth charities. 
   In today's world of professional sports, it is always refreshing to see an athlete who recognizes the blessings and opportunities he has received, and has chosen to give something back to his community. In spite of a tennis career that has had its ups and downs, Andre has always had a steady hand  when it comes to helping underprivileged children. Andre Agassi is the epitome of what a professional athlete should be, and I ask my colleagues to join me in commending him for making tennis history and for all of his charitable endeavors that mean so much to the Las Vegas community.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank my colleague from Michigan. 
   I rise today as a strong supporter and original co-sponsor of the amendment offered by my colleagues, Senator MCCAIN and Senator LEVIN, to consolidate our defense infrastructure and authorize an additional round of base closures. 
   For months, Pentagon officials, military leaders and key Members of the House and Senate have painted a picture of an American military force seriously compromised by years of declining or flat-budgets. 
   No one questions that the integrity of our force structure must be fortified, and I strongly support efforts to divert greater funding to modernization and readiness priorities--funding which, in my judgment, is critical if we are to continue to maintain the most powerful and proficient military force on the planet. 
   And I think we are all cognizant of the grave retention and recruitment problems prevalent throughout the military and the serious morale impacts of this lack of funding. These are real problems in our military. 
   Every recent defense-related appropriations measure--including last year's omnibus appropriations bill, the FY 1999 supplemental bill passed by this body just last week, and the legislation that is before us today--has included billions of dollars that the Pentagon did not request nor want. 
   Unquestionably, a large part of the problem has been the insistence of the Congress to continue the time-honored practice of forcing the Pentagon to purchase aircraft it does not want, to build ships it does not need, and to maintain military bases that have long outlived their usefulness. 
   And every dollar that we spend on these wasteful and unnecessary programs and infrastructure is a dollar that we cannot spend on such critical needs as readiness and quality of life programs for our military personnel. 
   Last year, a bipartisan coalition of Senators, led by Senator MCCAIN, and others, offered a proposal supported by the Secretary of Defense and the entire Joint Chiefs of Staff, to shut down military bases that had outlived their usefulness and to save the Pentagon billions of dollars. 
   And Remarkably, the Senate said no. 
   I am hopeful this body will not make the same mistake twice. 
   The manner in which we fund the Department of Defense borders on the absurd, and continues to undermine our credibility with the American people when it comes to our ability to exercise fiscal responsibility. 
   I am confounded by a Congress that on one hand bemoans the state of readiness of our military, and fights tooth and nail to add billions of unrequested dollars to the Pentagon's budget, and yet refuses to heed the advice of our military leaders and make sensible changes to our defense infrastructure. 
   We micromanage the Defense Department to the point where we tell the generals and the admirals not only how many ships and planes they need to provide for our national security, but also where to place these ships and planes once they are built. 
   It is armchair quarterbacking at its worse. 
   Two years ago, the Congress passed--with great fanfare I might add--a balanced budget agreement that put in place a series of tough spending caps, requiring the Congress to reform its free-spending ways and make the tough decisions that are necessary to maintain fiscal responsibility. 
   Over the past two years, I have watched countless members of Congress duck, dodge, and evade those tough spending decisions as part of a systematic effort to sustain programs that have no justification and no purpose other than to divert funding from other more critical defense needs. 
   The examples are boundless. 
   Last year, we included a $45 million down payment on a $1.5 billion amphibious landing ship that the Navy told us they had no need for. 
   This year, the Pentagon asked for ten new MV-22 Osprey aircraft, and the bill before us tells them to buy twelve. 
   The Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs tell the Congress that we have over 23 percent excess capacity in our current base structure and that it is time to consolidate our infrastructure and use the savings to shore up our readiness deficiencies. 
   And the Congress says no. 
   We shuttle precious defense dollars to shipbuilding, aircraft, and weapon systems programs that the Pentagon has deemed unnecessary and unimportant. 
   And unless the pending amendment is passed today, the Senate will continue to shun the advice of our military leaders, and divert precious dollars away from readiness and modernization programs to support an infrastructure that is clearly in excess of our needs. 
   Today, we have a modest, bipartisan proposal offered by Senators MCCAIN and LEVIN, supported by the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that would unquestionably save billions of dollars that could be used to improve readiness, enhance pay, retirement, family housing, and other benefits for our military personnel, and bolster our national security. 
   For three consecutive years, the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of Staff have asked us to allow the Pentagon to close those military bases it believes no longer hold operational value. 
   And for three years, the Congress has punted this political football, refusing to make the tough choices that we promised the American people we would make just two years ago. 
   Senator after Senator has come to the Senate floor to lament the lack of adequate funding for our Nation's defense. 
   We have heard that the readiness of our forces is at severe risk, that we do not have the funding we need to invest in the weapons technology of tomorrow, and that personnel problems threaten the integrity of our force structure, both at home and abroad. 
   This Senator believes those concerns are real and legitimate. Just last week, my colleagues approved some $13 billion from the Social Security trust funds to address some of these needs, I do not question the urgency in addressing all of our modernization, readiness and personnel shortfalls. 
   With that in mind, I cannot understand how the Senate, with a clear conscience, can fail to adopt the amendment that is pending before us, which was requested by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and which would save an estimated $3 billion a year. 
   Not just this year, but $3 billion every year, for years to come. 
   My colleagues, Senator LEVIN and Senator MCCAIN, have already made reference to a letter sent by the Joint Chiefs in support of this amendment. 
   In that letter, the Joint Chiefs characterize an additional round of base closures as ``absolutely necessary.'' 
   Not just a ``good idea,'' Mr. President, but ``absolutely necessary.'' 
   While legions of men and women have courageously stepped forward to defend this Nation and serve their fellow Americans, the Congress has continued to shortchange readiness and quality of life programs to finance questionable programs and weapons systems unrequested and in some cases outright opposed by the Pentagon. 
   There is no greater national security issue at stake than the readiness of our military and our ability to respond to global crisis. 
   Mr. President, the amendment before us is politically unpleasant, but fiscally prudent and imperative and I urge my colleagues to support it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and ask unanimous consent that the remainder of time be allocated to the Senator from Michigan, who controls the time.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to voice my disagreement with a portion of Senate Report Number 106-44, which accompanied S. 900, the Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999. The Report describes an amendment that I offered that was adopted by a unanimous vote of the Senate Banking Committee during its consideration of S. 900. I want to explain what I intend that amendment to mean and how I intend its language to be interpreted. 
   At issue is the standard for determining whether State laws, regulations, orders and other interpretations regulating the sale, solicitation and cross-marketing of insurance products should be preempted by federal laws authorizing insurance sales by insured depository institutions and their subsidiaries and affiliates. Since the inception of the national banking system, the insurance sales powers of national banks have been heavily restricted. In addition, since the inception of the insurance industry in this country, the States have been the virtually exclusive regulators of that business. Although S. 900 seeks to tear down the barriers that separate the banking, insurance and securities industries, at the same time it seeks to preserve functional regulation. This means that the extensive regulatory systems that have been developed to protect consumer interests in each area of financial services should be retained. 
   For that reason, one of the principles of the proposed legislation is to ensure that the activities of everyone who engages in the business of insurance should be functionally regulated by the States. After all, the States are the sole repository of regulatory expertise in this area. During my review of the Committee Print before the mark-up and during my conversations with my Senate colleagues, it became evident that the Committee Print's provisions regarding the preemption of State insurance laws and regulations did not adhere to this principle. The Committee Print disregarded the Supreme Court's holding in Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25 (1996), regarding the standard for preempting State regulation of insurance sales activity. 
   I therefore introduced an amendment that replaced the Committee Print's insurance sales preemption provisions with substitute provisions based on the Supreme Court's Barnett standard. My amendment deleted all of the provisions in the Committee Print regarding the permissible scope of state regulation of the insurance sales activities of insured depository institutions, their subsidiaries and affiliates. My amendment substituted language that had been developed and analyzed during prior considerations of these issues in previous Congresses, in particular during senate consideration of H.R. 10 last year. 
   The core preemption standard included in my amendment now appears as Section 104(d)(2)(A) of S. 900. It states:  
   In accordance with the legal standards for preemption set forth in the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Barnett Bank of Marion County N.A. v. Nelson, 116 U.S. 1103 (1996), no State may, by statute, regulation, order, interpretation, or other action, prevent or significantly interfere with the ability of an insured depository institution, or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof, to engage, directly or indirectly, either by itself or in conjunction with a subsidiary, affiliate, or any other party, in any insurance sales, solicitation, or cross-marketing activity.  
   The ``prevent or significantly interfere'' language was taken directly from the Supreme Court's Barnett decision and is intended to codify that decision. No further amplification of the standard was included because my colleagues and I intended to leave the development of the interpretation of that standard to the courts. 
   There is a great deal of disagreement among both regulators and members of the affected industries as to the manner in which the standard should be amplified. Indeed, State insurance regulators and significant portions of the insurance industry did not support the usage of the ``significant interference'' test at all but instead sought a clarification, supported by the Barnett opinion, that only state laws and regulations that ``prohibit or constructively prohibit'' an insured depository institution, or an affiliate or subsidiary of an insured depository institution, from engaging in insurance sales activities should be preempted.

   Mr. BRYAN. My colleague from Maryland asks a perceptive question. The Committee Report attempts to clarify the core preemption standard in a way that is contrary to the meaning of the provision. Page 13 of the Report states that State laws are preempted not only if they `` `prevent or significantly interfere' with a national bank's exercise of its powers'' but also if they `` `unlawfully encroach' on the rights and privileges of national banks;'' if they `` `destroy or hamper' national banks' functions;'' of if they `` `interfere with or impair' national banks' efficiency in performing authorized functions.'' The clauses after the initial restatement of the standard are paraphrases of the holdings of the cases cited in Barnett. 
   As I noted earlier, I intentionally omitted any amplification of the Barnett standard. In addition, the last paraphrase (regarding ``efficiency'') is correct and harmful. It is incorrect because it implies that it applies to any authorized function. In fact, the case cited by the Supreme Court in Barnett said that a State cannot impair a national bank's ability to discharge its duties to the government. The last paraphrase is harmful because it could dramatically expand 
   the scope of the preemption provision. It could do so if read to prohibit the application of any State law that impairs a national bank's or its affiliate's or subsidiary's efficiency in selling insurance. The Barnett opinion does not support any  such reading. Moreover, if this language had been suggested as an amendment to my amendment, I would not have supported it nor would the majority of my colleagues. 
   The Committee Report also lists several examples of State law provisions that the Report states should be preempted under the standard, incorporated into S. 900. As noted above, this violates my intent in offering an amendment based on the Barnett standard. For example, page 13 of the Committee Report states that an ``example of a State law that would be preempted under the standard set forth in subsection 104(d)(2)(A) would be a statute that limits the volume or portion of insurance sales made by an insurance agent on the basis of whether such sales are made to customers of an insured depository institution or any affiliate of the agent.'' I strongly disagree. State statutes that limit sales in this manner or that effectively require all insurance agents to engage in public insurance agency activities, and not limit their sales efforts to their captive customers, are not preempted under the Section 104(d)(2)(A) preemption standard. 
   In addition, page 14 of the Committee Report offers a requirement that insurance activities take place more than 100 yards from a teller window as an example of a State law provision that would be preempted. I wish to note that less restrictive provisions that merely require the physical separation of insurance activities from other activities within a bank are not preempted under the Section 104(d)(2)(A) preemption standard. The intent underlying the amendment was to leave these determinations of what is or is not preempted to the courts, based on the applicable legal standards identified in Barnett. 
   Finally, I fell compelled to note that page 15 of the Committee Report states that nothing in the preemption provisions can be read to require licensure of the bank itself, only of employees acting as agents. While this is technically true, it creates some potential confusion with the core licensure requirement. This should be read as allowing institution licensure so long as that licensure does not ``prevent or significantly interfere with'' the exercise of authorized insurance sales powers.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I want to engage my good friend from Arizona, our chairman of the Commerce Committee, in a colloquy concerning an issue I raised in committee on signal reception standards. 
</TEXT>

<DOCNO>106-bryan-nv-2-19990520</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, consumers who live in small and rural markets deserve access to network television service via satellite and the competition with cable it provides just as much as their fellow citizens living in urban markets. The local-into-local  service that will be made possible by the legislation we are considering today will provide this much-needed service to consumers, thereby enhancing competition to cable in many urban markets. Unfortunately, because local-into-local will not be available in small and rural markets in the immediate future, consumers who live there must depend on satellite delivery of network signals from distant markets. Recent court-imposed limitations on the delivery of distant network signals, however, will affect households that cannot receive viewable local network signals over-the-air. 
   To correct this imbalance, we should grant the Federal Communications Commission the authority to set a modern television signal reception standard. If the new signal reception standard is set at a level that will provide consumers with a viewable picture, then the new standard will produce a more realistic and accurate separation between ``served'' and ``unserved'' households for purposes of SHVA. In addition, such a standard would provide consumers who do not qualify to receive distant network signals with a reasonable expectation that, if they go to the trouble and expense of installing a ``conventional'' rooftop antenna, they will be able to receive a television picture they can actually watch. 
   To make application of the new standard more consumer friendly, I also urge that we give the FCC the authority to establish the most accurate point-to-point predictive model. Such a model would enable a consumer to know whether or not he or she will be able to receive a signal of the strength established by the rulemaking quickly, accurately, and without expensive testing.

   Mr. BRYAN. If this law isn't revised we can expect more consumer confusion and frustration. The ``Grade B'' standard that is used as the signal reception standard today measures the amount of signal intensity that a consumer must receive at his or her rooftop antenna to produce what is considered an ``acceptable'' television picture. Unfortunately, this was a determination made in 1952. Consumer expectations of what constitutes an ``acceptable'' picture have increased substantially in the past 50 years. What constituted an acceptable picture to a focus group in 1951 watching black and white television would almost certainly not be a picture that modern consumers would want to watch on state-of-the-art color sets. 
   In addition, interference has increased substantially since the early 1950's. Background noise produced by aircraft, automobile and truck traffic, power lines, and the like, and electronic interference produced by computers, cell phones, and other electronic equipment interfere with signal propagation. Because of this increased interference, consumers need higher signal intensity in order to receive a viewable television picture.

   Mr. BRYAN. Even though the language mandating a new signal standard and predictive model was not adopted in committee, I think the chairman would agree that such language needs to be incorporated into a final measure. Many of my colleagues have been stunned to learn of the crazy circumstance that is facing many of our rural constituents as they attempt to get a network signal that they can actually watch. We shouldn's be making it more difficult for them to get this valuable service.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, next Sunday and Monday, NBC is scheduled to air a miniseries entitled ``Atomic Train.'' The plot of this movie includes a runaway train carrying nuclear weapons and high-level nuclear waste causing a massive accident and catastrophe in Denver. 
   The movie is obviously fiction. Let me just tell you how the network initially described the scenario:  
   A runaway train carrying armed nuclear weapons and deadly nuclear waste suddenly careens out of control down the Rocky Mountains.  
   All of this made the nuclear power industry very nervous, because although the scenario is fictional, much of what is depicted, in part, is a scenario that is entirely possible, given the proposed legislation I will describe that this Congress is considering. 
   Earlier this week, just days before this was to air, all of a sudden NBC changes the story line of the television miniseries, and now we have:  
   A runaway train carrying a Russian atomic weapon and hazardous materials, suddenly careening out of control.  
   All reference to high-level nuclear waste is dropped. The Nuclear Energy Institute, which is the lobbying arm of the atomic energy lobby, was forced to go into high gear. They sent out what they called an ``Info Wire.'' They were very concerned. They say, in effect:   
   NEI, in consultation with industry communicators and representatives of the U.S. Department of Energy and the American Association of Railroads, has adopted a containment strategy for the upcoming movie. We do not want to do anything to provide additional publicity for this movie prior to the airing. The containment strategy is not a passive one, in that it envisions an aggressive effort prior to the broadcast.  
   It is the belief of this Senator that indeed it was a very aggressive effort, and the Nuclear Energy Institute put pressure on the network to drop all references to dangerous high-level nuclear waste. The last thing this industry wants the American people to understand is that legislation which has been supported in previous Congresses, and in this Congress, would result in the shipment of 77,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste within a mile or less of a total population of 50 million residing in 43 States. 
   The blue lines depict rails, and indeed there is a transportation corridor going through the State of Colorado, as well as others. 
   So why did NBC do an ``el foldo''? NBC is owned by General Electric and, surprise, General Electric has a nuclear division, and one of its senior officers is a member of the board of directors of NEI. 
   I acknowledge it is a fictional scenario. But what is very real is that in point of fact the proposal is to transport high-level nuclear waste through all these rail corridors that are depicted on this map. That is not fictional. That is real. 
   It is, in fact, real that high-level nuclear waste is deadly, as NBC first described it. In fact, it is deadly for tens of thousands of years. In point of fact, as we know, every year there are thousands of train accidents in America. A runaway train is not a fictional scenario. That is something that occurs, sadly, from time to time. It is not a fictional scenario for a train and an automobile or a truck to collide at an at-grade crossing. That occurred tragically earlier this year in Illinois. It is not fictional for trains to be derailed. 
   The last thing this industry wants the American people to know and to understand is that, indeed, the shipment of high-level nuclear waste, proposed to be sent to a temporary--allegedly temporary--storage area in my own State, at the Nevada Test Site, is a scenario that would involve the transshipment of 77,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste, with all of the risks that are inherent therein. 
   What is even more outrageous is that it is totally unnecessary. The Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board tells us it is unnecessary. The Department of Energy has indicated it is unnecessary. The President has indicated he would veto such legislation. All the risks depicted in this scenario with high-level nuclear wastes could be a reality if there was a tragic train accident and, indeed, the canisters were compromised and high-level nuclear waste was scattered along the route. 
   I think this is a very dangerous proposal. I think the fact the network would cave in is equally dangerous, because the American people have a right to know what is being proposed. In Nevada, we understand the risk. Sadly, there are hundreds of millions of Americans in this country who are not familiar with the nuclear industry's proposal to make their backyards the corridor by which high-level nuclear waste is to pass. 
   I must say, with tongue in cheek, if this is to be the standard, one might contemplate that the cruise line industry might have put pressure upon the producers of ``Titanic'': Please 
   do not make any reference to the fact that the ship is sinking. This may be bad for business. Or the producers of ``Planet Of The Apes'' might have been subjected to pressure from PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, saying: Look, we object to the way in which these apes are being treated in the film; please make changes. Or if some of the advocates of my own State approached the producers of ``Casino'' and said: Look, we don't want you to make any references to ``Casino'' in this story line; please delete that. 
   In my judgment, the circumstantial evidence is powerful here. The description I have given, namely of deadly nuclear waste, was the network's own description just days ago. The NEI goes into a full court press, what they call a containment strategy--what we all know is damage control--and, miraculously, days before this miniseries is scheduled to air, the story line is changed and all references to deadly nuclear waste are deleted. 
   I hope the American people will not be misled, that they will understand the risks that affect them and their neighborhoods. Mr. President, 43 different States are affected in this scenario. This map I have here depicts essentially the States. Because, by their nature, highway corridors and rail corridors connect the major metropolitan communities of our country, this high-level nuclear waste would in fact go through major cities in America. That fact is largely unknown. 
   Last year, I had occasion to travel with my senior colleague to the two communities of Denver and St. Louis, and to share with those communities the risks that are involved. Most people in the community did not have any understanding that this scenario is not fictional and far-fetched but, indeed, it is contemplated that those shipments will occur. 
   I regret NBC felt it was necessary to respond to the pressure of the nuclear power industry. Having been involved in this battle for the last 17 years, I am not unmindful of what a powerful force they are, not only in Washington but around the country. They have every right to advocate their point of view. As to their concern that somehow their industry would be exposed for what it is, a high-risk industry that threatens the health and safety of many Americans with this ill-conceived and unnecessary plan to ship nuclear waste to a temporary nuclear waste facility in my own State, at least this movie would have made the public aware that high-level nuclear waste is dangerous, to use the description NBC initially gave; that it was indeed going to pass through major cities such as Denver; and that indeed the health and safety of citizens of those communities and many others across the country could be compromised. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding Nevadan for his exemplary volunteer service to the disabled community both in Northern Nevada and across the United States. Jerry Crum has become a recognized leader through his advocacy on behalf of people afflicted with Chronic Fatigue Immune Dysfunction Syndrome, CFIDS. Since being diagnosed with CFIDS himself in the mid 1980's, Jerry has worked to increase awareness of this often misunderstood disease, and to improve the lives of those who suffer from it. 
   Jerry was incapacitated through much of the 1980's. After several years in and out of hospitals, however, he made a strong, though not complete recovery. As his strength increased, so did his efforts to help others with this debilitating condition. At the same time, he also saw that people with other disabilities and chronic illnesses had encountered many of the obstacles he had. He then sought to share his story with others, and to teach others with disabilities how to be effective advocates for themselves. 
   In 1990, Jerry became a charter member of the CFIDS lobbying organization called CACTUS. In 1992, he helped start the CFIDS Association of America's  Public Policy Action Committee, and later founded ``Lobby Day,'' an opportunity for people with CFIDS to travel to Washington, DC to meet with their federal representatives and advance funding and policy needs of CFIDS. Since then, he has testified at a Senate hearing examining the affects of this illness. 
   Although Jerry has always spoken on behalf of all people with disabilities, he specifically expanded his focus in 1998 to include people with lymphoma when he was diagnosed with this rare form of cancer himself. He became active in the Carson Advocates for Cancer and was the Nevada co-chair of the 1998 National Cancer March. He came to Washington again, and marched along-side cancer survivors such as Norman Schwarzkoph as they crusaded to encourage research to find a cure for this terrible disease. 
   Jerry has been a catalyst in bringing advocates together to achieve victories for the disabled. I thank him for his service to Nevada and to all who suffer from chronic, disabling conditions such as CFIDS. He has made Nevada proud.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Chair.  
   Mr. President, earlier today, the Senate adopted an amendment offered by the distinguished chairman of the Banking Committee dealing with the fraudulent procurement of personal information by information brokers. Last Congress, Senator D'Amato and I offered an identical provision, and we were successful in incorporating that in last year's financial modernization bill, H.R. 10. 
   Unfortunately, that measure died along with H.R. 10 which was filibustered at the end of the last session. I commend the Senator from Texas. The antifraud provision is a good first step, but as Senator SARBANES articulated earlier today, it is in no way a substitute for meaningful privacy protections. 
   The Gramm amendment deals with a small, but pernicious, group of information brokers that obtain personal information under false pretenses. This practice should be shut down. In fact, the Federal Trade Commission recently brought action against such practices. 
   While thousands of Americans are harmed by fraudulent information brokers, each and every American who has a bank account, stock portfolio or an insurance policy is subject to a massive invasion of his or her personal privacy that cries out for legislative remedy. 
   I applaud the fact that the chairman has indicated we are going to hold a series of hearings. 
   I applaud the chairman's promise to hold a series of hearings on the financial privacy issue. Many of us who worked on the Community Reinvestment Act would have hoped we might have had similar opportunities before moving forward with the CRA changes in this bill. 
   While the chairman's amendment and his hearings are good first steps, I encourage us to take one more step that Senator SARBANES and Senator DODD and I have been urging for some time. 
   My amendment is quite simple. What we are talking about is financial privacy. I want to make it very clear that I am a strong supporter of the restructuring bill that is before us, the financial modernization. I freely acknowledge and recognize that we need a regulatory framework which comports with the realities of the marketplace today. 
   So my purpose in offering this amendment is in no way to denigrate the need to make the kind of changes which essentially are outlined in S. 900, or a part of H.R. 10 in the previous session. But I think my colleagues and the American people would be absolutely shocked if they knew how little privacy they have in their personal financial information with the very people who are going to be players in this financial reorganization--banks, security brokerages, and insurance. 
   Here is what the American people have to say on the issue of privacy. When asked recently: ``Would you mind if a company 
   you did business with sold information about you to another company?'' Ninety-two percent said yes, they would object to it. The source of that information is the AARP. 
   Let me cite an illustration of precisely what does occur and will continue to occur. This is a financial transaction, I say to my colleagues, that occurred at a bank. A lady came in and deposited $109,451.59. At this bank, teller No. 12 made the following notation: ``She came in today,'' referring to the depositor, ``and wasn't sure what she would do with her money.'' That is the bank teller. 
   This bank has a relationship with a brokerage house. Here is what the teller then did. The teller then contacts ``David''--David is the individual with the brokerage house--and says, ``See what you can do! Thank you.'' 
   So in effect the privacy of this individual's personal bank account is compromised, as the bank teller then notifies the brokerage house: ``You'd better get ahold of this lady. She has $109,000. She doesn't know what she wants to do with it. You contact her.'' 
   This is a real-life situation. Under the current law--under the current law--your information with respect to your insurance accounts may be freely sold to a third party, or maybe transferred to an affiliate under the proposed arrangements that are contemplated in this bill. Your bank account information can be sold to a third party--a total stranger to you and to your financial transaction. 
   So you have a situation in which all of a sudden you have a certificate of deposit that is coming due next month, and you start to get a stream of information from vendors who are marketing financial services and saying, ``Mrs. Smith,'' ``Mr. Jones, I know your certificate of deposit is due next month. Let me show you what our financial package can provide for you.'' And you are saying, ``How does this outfit know that I've got a certificate of deposit that is maturing next month?'' And the answer is, that information can be sold to a third party, and that information is valuable to a particular vendor of services. 
   So the amendment that we propose does two things: No. 1--and I do not see how you can argue against this proposition--

<TEXT>
   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the Presiding Officer. 
   The point that I was making is that your financial information with respect to insurance brokerage accounts and bank accounts is not protected under the present law. That information can be sold or marketed to a total stranger. An outfit, for example, that may be selling penny stocks all of a sudden contacts you and says, ``Look, I know you've got a certificate of deposit or bank account with a sufficient balance involved.'' 
   So what we are proposing in this amendment is something very hard to argue against. We are saying that with respect to these financial organizations--banking, insurance and brokerage--that they cannot sell to a total stranger, a third party, without your consent. What is wrong with that? 
   So rather than being able to sell to any vendor your very personal and private information--your insurance coverages, 
   whatever information might be available about any medical condition that you might have, your brokerage account, your bank account--cannot be sold to a third party without your prior consent. I suspect if you ask the American people--Democrat, Republican, independent, whether they are to the right of center or to the left of center or in between--you would get almost a unanimous vote that would say, ``That is what I want as a protection for my privacy.'' 
   I understand that in this modern consolidation of financial services the thrust of this bill is going to permit banks and insurance and brokerage to be involved in affiliated relationships. I understand that. So we are told, ``Do not, Senator, do anything that would impair or compromise the synergy of the marketplace. Don't do that.'' 
   Well, this is what we propose with respect to those affiliate arrangements. This would not be a total stranger or a third party. If they are going to transfer and make available that information, they need to notify you and give you the opportunity to opt out. They do not have to get your prior consent, but they have to give you the right to opt out. 
   That concept is recognized in the law. Many of you will recall that I took the lead some years back in securing amendments to the Fair Credit Reporting Act. And we said there, with respect to information that is collected, with respect to your credit history, that before that information can be made available for marketers and others, they need to notify you where that information came from and that you had the right, after receiving a solicitation, to say, ``Look, no more. Take me off the list'' in effect the right to opt out. 
   So that is what we are proposing in this amendment--An absolute requirement that if the information is made available to a total stranger, a third party, that has no affiliate relationship, a vendor of any number of financial services, they must obtain your prior consent; that if the information, the financial information, is to be transferred from one of their affiliates, they need to give you the opportunity to opt out if you choose to avail yourself of that option. 
   Now, I am hard pressed to understand why anybody would object to that. I think any one of us would be somewhat surprised to know that our bank accounts, our insurance, and our brokerage accounts  can be made available to anyone under the existing law. If we are going to provide these new financial services, which I believe we ought to provide to recognize the change in the marketplace, that does not strike me as being an unreasonable proposition to advocate. 
   So this is a provision that I think needs attention. I must say that the ranking member has taken a lead on this. He has been a strong advocate, as has the senior Senator from Connecticut. I know he had a question or two to which I would be happy to respond.

As Henry VIII said to his third wife, I shall not keep you long--the question I have of the able chairman is, Would the Senator not agree that before a financial services institution sells personal information about your bank accounts, your insurance policies, about your brokerage accounts, it is not unreasonable that they get your consent before doing so?

   Mr. BRYAN. I say to the senior Senator from Maryland, not only do they not realize it, they are absolutely dumbfounded and amazed. Most people believe that in the world of high finance, brokerage accounts, insurance and banks, there is a system of Federal law that protects their privacy. I say to the Senator from Maryland, we all recognize that we are entering a new era of financial transactions, the Internet; computers have transformed the way in which we transact our business; the old green eyeshade guys are gone. 
   Today the right of privacy as we know it in America is threatened, I say to my friend from Maryland. More than a century ago the able, later Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court advocated, in a Harvard Law Review article, a right of privacy. That right was later enshrined in subsequent opinions of the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   I think the very essence of a right of privacy ought to be your personal financial information--how much money you have in your bank account; to whom you choose to make payments; your insurance coverages; any medical conditions that might be a part of that insurance record; what stocks and bonds and securities you hold; when those certificates of deposit might mature. To say that all of that can be sold, transferred without your knowledge, without your consent, to some total stranger who may not, I say to my friend from Maryland, be a legitimate vendor--we don't know who these guys might be. All of a sudden you get a ton of mail coming in and saying: Mrs. Smith, I know your husband just died last year, and I know you have some certificates of deposit. They are getting a 5-percent return. As a widow, you need to know, if you invest with us, we can quadruple that rate of return. 
   That is what is happening, I say to my friend from Maryland. That is something that I think is appropriate for the Congress and the Federal Government to say, that is wrong. 
   I appreciate the leadership of the ranking member on this. This is something that ought not to divide us, Democrat or Republican, liberal or conservative.

   Mr. BRYAN. I look forward to working with the senior 
   Senator from Maryland on this. 
   Let me say, I am going to withdraw this amendment, because of the lateness of the hour and because we want to move forward to process this. 
   I say to my friend from Maryland--I know he feels this very strongly--the word should go out tonight from this Chamber to the industry groups that believe this is an issue that is going to go away. It is not going to go away. What we are talking about is the essence of reasonableness and fairness. If you are talking about selling some information or making it available to a total stranger, you as an individual ought to have the right to make that decision. That is something that is fundamental and basic. As an accommodation to these new affiliate arrangements that can be entered into under this new legislation, we say, with respect to any transfers between the affiliates, an opt-out provision is a reasonable compromise. 
   I encourage our friends from the industry to work with us on this. I say to the Senator from Maryland, because this is not going to go away, we are going to address this issue, and the American people are going to be thoroughly outraged when they become aware that these new arrangements permit this continuation of an invasion of their privacy in the most personal way possible.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I believe the situation the Senator describes would fall under Section 104(c)(2) of the bill. That language allows states to take action on required applications or other documents concerning proposed changes in or control of a company that sells insurance, unless the action has the practical effect of discriminating against an insured depository institution. 
   The concern the Senator voiced is one of the situations we envisioned when we made the changes from the earlier text, and it is my intent that the current language would protect the North Carolina state law on the Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina conversion agreement.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, we are about ready to debate an important issue dealing with the Community Reinvestment Act. Let me say that I think there has been considerably more heat than light generated in the debate surrounding this issue. I thought it might be helpful to my colleagues to explain how the provisions of this act work, what is involved, what is not involved, the provisions that currently exist in the bill we are debating, and the contents of the amendment. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act has been in operation now for 21 years. The act itself is triggered in either of two circumstances--one, as part of a periodic review, and that depends upon the size of the institution. It applies only to insured depository institutions, so we are talking about banks and thrifts. It also is triggered when a depository institution files an application for a charter conversion, for merger, acquisition, or requesting authority for additional branches. 
   Those applications, then, are reviewed by the appropriate bank regulator, or the thrift regulator, whether that be the OCC, the Federal Reserve, or the OTC. Notice is then given, and the community groups have an opportunity to comment on the application. So you have a periodic review, which may be annually or a longer period of time, or you have the circumstances in which an insured depository institution seeks either a charter conversion, a merger, an acquisition, or additional branches. 
   Notice is given. Now, 97 percent of all depository institutions--banks or thrifts--get a satisfactory CRA rating. The penalties that can be provided are that, No. 1, an application could be denied, an application could be accepted subject to certain conditions, or the application can be approved without conditions. I think it is important to understand who is making the decision here. It is not the community groups that have a veto power. These are decisions that are essentially made by bank regulators--regulators that have traditionally evinced no hostility to the banking industry. And even an institution which gets the lowest rating--substantial noncompliance is the lowest rating you can get--may still have its application approved. So nothing in the language of CRA compels a regulator to disapprove an application, even if the financial institution that is applying for the relief sought gets the lowest evaluation possible. 
   What is the history in the last 21 years of the act? There have been some 86,000 applications filed over the last 21 years and, of those, only 660 have received adverse comments. So less than 1 percent of all of the applications relating to CRA that have been received have been subject to objections or adverse comments by any of the regulating groups over a period of 21 years. 
   What has CRA accomplished? Well, it has accomplished a great deal. In point of fact, the CRA, over the years, has resulted in a substantial increase in lending and other financial activity within the inner-city and minority groups in America. CRA encourages banks to meet the credit needs of the entire community, including low- and moderate-income areas. 
   Over the last 21 years, the CRA has been one of the strongest incentives to encourage investment in low-income and minority communities. 
   Under the law, federally insured financial institutions have made billions of dollars in profitable market rate loans and investments in underserved urban and rural areas. And it has done so without creating a large Federal bureaucracy, or jeopardizing the safety and soundness of any financial institution. 
   CRA has been an important tool in improving access to credit for minority and low- to moderate-income Americans. 
   The dramatic increase in home ownership rates for minorities is attributable in large part to increased focus on banks' CRA performance. Between 1993 and 1997, the number of conventional home mortgage loans extended increased for African Americans by 72 percent; for Hispanics, 45 percent; for Asian Americans, 31 percent; for Native Americans, 30 percent; for low- and moderate-income census tracks by 45 percent. 
   Small business owners in low- and moderate-income communities have seen a substantial increase in their access to credit under the law. 
   Under the emphasis of CRA, banks have made loans to African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanic and Asian Americans, and, according to the Small Business Administration, loans to African-American-owned firms increased by 145 percent between 1992 and 1997. In 1997 alone, banks made more than $34 billion in loans to entrepreneurs located in low- and moderate-income areas. 
   These loans have financed businesses which have been critical to revitalizing the distressed communities. 
   Mr. President, it seems to me that has a desirable result for every mayor of every major community in America struggling to revitalize the inner core of his or her State. That is the experience in my own State. That is the experience, I suggest, of every State. 
   As a result of CRA, we are seeing more money being invested and loaned in inner cities with minority businesses. 
   That, it seems to me, makes sense, and good public policy. 
   Who, then, objects to CRA? 
   We are dealing with a piece of legislation that will substantially transform the way in which modern financial institutions will be regulated--banking, securities and insurance. 
   Mr. President, those groups are in support of CRA, and they are in support of the amendment which I have offered. 
   Indeed, in the last session of the Congress, H.R. 10, which contains CRA provisions virtually identical to the ones that are contained in the Bryan amendment, were passed by the House of Representatives, and emerged from a Senate Banking Committee by a vote of 16 to 2--broad bipartisan support. 
   In this Congress, the financial institution restructuring bill that is making its way through the other body was approved by a vote of 51 to 8--51 to 8--and the CRA provisions contained in that piece of legislation are essentially identical to the provisions that the Bryan amendment addresses. 
   Banks are supportive, the insurance industry is supportive, and the securities industry--the major players are supportive. Moreover, banks have found not only that it is good public policy, but it makes sense financially. 
   The National Association of Home Builders, which has 
   participated in an enormous growth in the rate of new housing starts, and has seen a remarkable increase in the percentage of home  ownership in America, has this to say about CRA. 
   The National Association of Home Builders:  
   Therefore, the NAHB, the National Association of Home Builders, supports any amendments offered to remove or replace the provisions in S. 900--  
   That is the bill that we are debating--  
   that deals with a much more restrictive and a roll-back provision of CRA.  
   The Home Builders go on to say:  
   While the CRA may not be the perfect solution to ensuring housing credit is available to all communities, financial institutions of all sizes, through their compliance with CRA, have provided crucial community development loans and affordable housing production loans that have benefited millions of people across the United States. We see no public good served by a weakening or a reduction in the CRA requirements.  
   I will explain shortly how S. 900, the bill before us, would substantially weaken the CRA provisions, and the position taken by the Home Builders, and others, is to support the amendment which is presently before the body. 
   Mr. President, the distinguished chairman of the committee and I have a difference of opinion. And he will have an opportunity, I am sure, to articulate his point of view. The chairman--it is entirely appropriate for him to do so--sent out letters to various groups to get their comments. 
   A letter from a small banker dated March 26 of this year responds to that--a copy of which was made available to those of us who serve on the committee--a letter addressed to:  
   Dear Senator Gramm: I received a copy of your letter to Scott Jones--  
   Mr. Jones is the President of the American Banking Association--  
   regarding the proposed exemption from CRA requirements for small banks. While I appreciate your efforts on our behalf, I have to say that this exemption ``Don't mean jack to me.''  
   That is a quote. That is his language.  
   We have two bank charters, and have always received an outstanding rating. The burden is not onerous, especially under the revised requirements now in effect for the past two or three years. The information I gather to determine in-area versus out-of-area loans is useful to me outside of the CRA requirements. I probably spend less than 5 hours a year on the issue. I don't think it is worth squandering any political capital you have to eliminate the CRA.  
   That is the essential text of the letter that our distinguished chairman received. That small banker made reference to some provisions in CRA that were changed in 1996. 
   Mr. President, recognizing that a small bank has a much smaller staff to deal with compliance issues, substantial changes were made in the CRA requirements for small banks. Essentially, we are talking about institutions under $250 million. 
   No. 1, with respect to CRA, those small banks have no CRA reporting requirements. 
   Let me reemphasize that. They have no CRA reporting requirements. 
   And the standards which are applied to larger banks that are involved in a lending, a service, and an investment criteria 
   are not applicable to small banks. Indeed, small banks do not have to compile any data. They don't have to submit any reports. 
   They have to have records available so that when the bank examiner comes in pursuant to this periodic request, or if a small bank requests some activity which triggers the application of CRA, they simply say to the bank examiner, ``Our records are contained in the file cabinet over there.'' There is no reporting requirement and no affirmative burden on their part other than to have the records which, as the small banker who wrote the letter to our distinguished chairman pointed out, a bank would want to have for itself independent and separate and apart from the CRA requirements. 
   So, indeed, there has been an acknowledgment and an attempt to streamline the requirements that small bankers are subject to. And that has been acknowledged by the correspondent who wrote to our distinguished chairman. 
   What do we have in the current bill? The current bill does a couple of things which, in my view, roll back the provisions of CRA. 
   It says, in effect, that if a financial institution has a CRA rating of satisfactory or above for a period of 36 months, 3 years, it would be deemed in compliance for purposes of CRA, and for any one of the applications for either a merger, an acquisition, or grant of extension, there would be no opportunity for community groups to comment. 
   That would roll back the provisions.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the chairman. 
   The chairman states correctly the contents of the bill. However, let me say in response to the Senator's position, we have in effect a 97-percent compliance rate. Mr. President, 97 percent of the financial institutions in the country receive satisfactory or better. In the entire history of the Community Reinvestment Act, with some 86,000 applications, we have had fewer than 1 percent of those protested in any way. 
   In terms of balance, to give community groups an opportunity not only to comment but to register concerns, it strikes me that the Senator's provisions impose limitations that do not currently exist in the law. I know the able chairman well understands, even if there were a finding under current law that the particular financial institution has the lowest possible rating--substantial noncompliance--that does not preclude the bank regulator from approving the application. 
   CRA is not an onerous burden. Under the current law, which would remain in place with the Bryan amendment, a bank that seeks a merger approval or charter provision change or a new branch, even if that bank had a substantial noncompliance, the lowest rating possible in the CRA, under the law, nothing precludes the bank regulator from approving that application. 
   I understand the concern of the Senator from Texas in terms of balancing the equities here. It strikes me that we ought not to put that additional burden of proof on community groups who may want to file some legitimate concerns they have about a proposed merger, acquisition, or a branch extension. 
   I think the record reflects, of 86,000 applications, we have had fewer than 1 percent, 660, that have availed themselves of this. I respectfully submit, in response to the comments of my friend from Texas, that is not, in my judgment, unduly 
   burdensome. 
   The Senator also provides in his version of S. 900 a small bank exemption. The effect of that would be to eliminate about 37 percent of all of the banks in the country from the current provisions of CRA. Again, I think it is a balance. It is not the purpose of the Senator from Nevada nor of those who support the Bryan amendment to want to impose an onerous, unreasonable, unfair burden upon a financial institution. However, I must say, I think the track record would indicate that is not the case. 
   Responding to a legitimate concern of small banks, as I pointed out, in 1996 the rules were changed so that small banks do not have a reporting requirement. All they must do is maintain records so that the bank examiner who comes in periodically to review, or whenever the application is filed that triggers the CRA review to look at the records, can make sure in effect that the bank is lending in the community. It strikes me that is good public policy. Indeed, banks have profited from that activity.  
   Those are the two provisions that the Senator's version of S. 900 would contain. Also, it would eliminate CRA from the new activities which would be permitted under the provisions of this law. 
   The thrust of this legislation is to provide a regulatory framework that deals with the reality of the marketplace. Many of those who do not serve on the Banking Committee have heard Glass-Steagall mentioned frequently in the course of financial modernization discussions. This is a Depression-era piece of legislation. I like it. It neatly compartmentalizes banking regulation, insurance regulation, and security regulation. It makes a lot of sense. In the aftermath of the financial collapse of the 1920s and the Great Depression that followed, a number of abuses were pointed out. This legislation was in response to those abuses. It served the Nation effectively for many decades. 
   As a result of court decisions and actions taken by bank regulators, today much of Glass-Steagall has been effectively emasculated and the marketplace is dictating new products that involve combinations of insurance, securities, and banking functions. I agree with the distinguished chairman that we need a piece of legislation which effectively deals with that. In effect, what we are doing is establishing that modern framework. We have established essentially a system of functional regulation. 
   It appears from the testimony we have received from the Banking Committee and others who have offered comment that the new financial world will deal not so much in terms of mergers and acquisitions but will seek to avail itself of the new financial services that banks will be able to participate in under the provisions of S. 900, the financial restructuring bill we are debating. Those services involve, essentially, securities and insurance functions. 
   This is testimony offered before the House Banking Committee by Treasury Secretary Rubin. I think he makes a point far more effectively than I.  
   Banking industry experts agree that most of the consolidations within the banking community have occurred and that the new frontier will involve mergers among banks, securities and insurance firms.  
   As a side point, that is the kind of activity which the S. 900 restructuring bill will authorize. 
   According to Treasury Secretary Rubin, if we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time when the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and the establishment of nonbank financial services will become increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly authorized activities should be connected to a satisfactory CRA rating. 
   That is the philosophical underpinning. We will be dealing with a new world, a new financial structure, and that, we believe, is appropriate in light of the changes in market conditions. 
   What are the requirements that would be imposed upon a depository institution under the provisions of this amendment which would seek to avail itself of these new activities--insurance and securities? No. 1, as a condition precedent, a depository institution would have to have a satisfactory rating. That is not, it seems to me, an unreasonable provision. 
   What kind of action must the regulator consider? If the institution has a satisfactory CRA rating and all other regulatory issues nonrelated to CRA are in place, that application could be approved, it could be subjected to certain conditions, or it could be denied. An agreement could be entered into between the financial institution and the regulator if, indeed, there were some concerns about maintaining the CRA, and the regulator would have the ability to do several things if there were a noncompliance with the agreement entered into. 
   On balance, what we are talking about is preserving the relevance of CRA in this new financial world we are talking about that will deal with mergers and acquisitions involving brokerage and insurance type of services which are not currently authorized under the regulatory framework. 
   So I think, just by way of concluding, what we are talking about is not a bold or reckless expansion of CRA. We are really talking about, No. 1, maintaining the status quo with respect to CRA and its traditional functions as it deals with the mergers and the acquisition and charter changes and the new branch request, which is the current part of the law. And we are simply saying, with respect to these new services, these new opportunities which financial institutions will be allowed to participate in, which as Secretary Rubin points out is where the action is going to be, that is where the field of play is. To say that with respect to those new activities no CRA would be applicable, no requirement would be in place, is, in effect, to roll back the application of CRA to the range of financial services that banks are currently allowed to participate in. 
   In my judgment, this is a reasonable and fair amendment. Bankers support it. Securities firms support it. Insurance companies support it. It enjoys a broad range of support. 
   Let me emphasize to my colleagues that, unlike some issues which have tended to divide us in terms of partisan differences, the House of Representatives, in considering banking legislation and financial restructuring--the same type of legislation we are debating here today--in a vote of 51 to 8 approved CRA provisions which essentially track the Bryan amendment. In the last Congress, when we came within a gnat's eyelash of getting financial restructuring legislation enacted, it was approved by a bipartisan majority in the House and it cleared the Senate Banking Committee on a vote of 16 to 2. 
   So this should not be, and I hope it will not be, a partisan vote. 
   In the 21 years that CRA has been around, 86,000 applications have been received that were triggered by the provisions of the existing law. And in fewer than 1 percent--fewer than 1 percent--have objections or adverse comments been made. 
   I think the amendment is fair. It strikes a middle ground. It acknowledges the concerns of small banks with the changes that were made in 1996. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this legislation.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland is absolutely 
   correct. It is the regulators, whether it is the OTS, or Federal Reserve, or the OCC. 
   As the Senator from Maryland knows, because of his longstanding membership on the committee, much can be said about bank regulators. I do not believe anybody would indicate or suggest the record would indicate that there is a hostility by the regulators to the institutions they regulate. In effect, the regulators have the opportunity to consider the CRA issues presented among a range of other issues--capital adequacy, a whole host of things that may be unrelated. 
   As the Senator from Maryland knows--and I think this is something that needs to be pointed out--even if the institution which has the application has the lowest possible rating--substantial noncompliance, which, in effect, means they have done virtually nothing--the regulator can still approve the application. They can still approve it. So there is no requirement under the existing law with respect to the kinds of mergers, acquisitions, charter changes, and branch expansions that requires a financial institution to even have a satisfactory rate. 
   So this is hardly an onerous provision, I say to my friend from Maryland.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland makes a good point. I think any fair reading, in terms of the standards of proof, is that a ``substantial'' standard is much higher than a scintilla. 
   In effect, what this provision would do is raise the bar substantially, I say to my friend from Maryland, for community investment groups being able to, in effect, make their case for the consideration--the consideration of the regulator. 
   I come back to the point. Even if they make their case that, indeed, the bank has not been responsible, has not done what it ought to do under CRA, the regulator may disregard that and still grant that approval. So it strikes me that by posing a standard before they even get into the ball game of ``substantial,'' you indeed cut off access to much of the input the community groups ought to have before a regulator makes a decision.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator makes a good point. That is absolutely correct. As the Senator knows, as a practical matter, although CRA is triggered generically in two circumstances--one, part of a periodic review; the other, when applications are made for charter changes or new branches or mergers or acquisitions--as a practical matter, the only opportunity community groups have is in this application process which the Senator has described. 
   That is the only opportunity. So if you foreclose them by a standard that is unreasonable and difficult to meet, you have, for all intents and purposes, foreclosed community groups from registering any effective concerns that they have.

   Mr. BRYAN. That is the understanding of the Senator from Nevada, we have had no hearings at all. 
   I must tell the Senator from Maryland that the financial institutions in my State are supportive of CRA. If we want to take anecdotal evidence, I have to say financial institutions in my State have indicated, one, it is good public policy, and, two, they have financially benefited. But there is no record before us, based upon any hearings or testimony--and I must say I think that there is opportunity for hearings to be held. When we are dealing with some other regulatory relief issues in the Banking Committee, that might be an appropriate time to bring people in so we can build a record. 
   My understanding is that we have had nothing to that effect and, indeed, this Senator has been on the committee now for 11 years. Financial institutions in my own State are very supportive of the provisions.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Maryland is correct. Recognizing that small banks are in a different situation than larger banks in terms of staff capability, the Secretary did precisely that. In January 1996, these new provisions went into effect, and they are appropriate, in my judgment, and they are dramatic. 
   No small bank under the size of $250 million has to report CRA. There is no reporting requirement for CRA that is incumbent upon a small bank, as defined in the provisions. 
   The responsibility of the small bank is simply to make available to the bank examiner, when he or she comes in periodically or when the examiner is reviewing the records for an application, the fact that the bank is serving the community. 
   Moreover, the standards which are required for a larger bank dealing with a lending standard, a service standard and 
   investment standard are inapplicable to small banks. 
   In trying to balance the inequities here, as I know the distinguished Senator from Maryland is interested in doing and all of us share in a very bipartisan way, dealing with the very special concerns of small banks has been addressed, we have eliminated the reporting requirement and have simply said, if I might respond to my friend from Maryland, that when the bank examiner comes in, the only obligation on the part of the financial institution is to direct the bank examiner to the file drawer and say, ``Those are our records.'' The bank examiner examines those records, and that is the burden that is imposed. 
   I must say, in terms of the balance, as the Senator from Maryland knows, coming from a State which has major metropolitan areas that fight urban decay, as does every major community in America, CRA is one of the most effective redevelopment tools for the inner cities in America that we have. It has poured hundreds of millions of dollars of new investments into the inner cities. That benefits not just the inner cities, but that benefits all of us. 
   The tragedy that occurred in Littleton, CO, 2 weeks ago occurred in a suburban area, but I think it is increasingly apparent to America, whether you live in the inner city or live in the suburbs, the problems that our inner cities have in America spread like a contagion. So it is in the best interest of every American, wherever he or she lives, that those inner cities which face all the problems of urban decay, crime, and drugs, that what we can do to help to build those inner cities and strengthen the hands of mayors, Democrats, Republicans, nonpartisan, is important public policy, and CRA has done the job. That is why the U.S. Conference of Mayors, as the distinguished ranking member knows, has been so strongly supportive of the provisions in the BRYAN amendment that we offer today.

   Mr. BRYAN. I share the observation and the conclusion reached by the distinguished ranking member. That is precisely the case. As the Senator from Maryland knows, we are dealing with a changing dynamic in the financial marketplace. That really is the catalyst that brings us into this financial restructuring debate. 
   The Senator may have been off the floor when I shared the observation that the Treasury Secretary made, which reflects the view that the Senator has expounded upon. He says, in effect:  
   [I]f we wish to preserve the relevance of CRA at a time when the relative importance of bank mergers may decline and the establishment of non-bank financial [services] will become increasingly important, the authority to engage in newly authorized activities should be connected to.....CRA.  
   He is saying that much better than I. He is saying, in effect: Look, this marketplace is shifting, it is moving. From what we have seen historically, since CRA has been in effect, with the traditional consolidation and mergers of one bank with another, that is not likely to be where the dynamic is in the marketplace in the future. We have already seen it. 
   What we are going to see are consolidations and mergers with other aspects of the financial services community--insurance and securities. And if you say that CRA has no reference or application to those applications, in effect you are relegating CRA to the dustbin of history; by and large, it is no longer as relevant as it is currently. 
   So, in effect, what we are trying to do is simply keep CRA as relevant in the new financial world as we have in the old financial world. I do not view this as an extension of CRA. It simply reflects a change in the marketplace that we are likely to see with respect to the way the financial services are provided to Americans.

   Mr. BRYAN. I thank the chairman for accommodating me and allowing me to speak for 4 minutes. 
   Let me say we had much debate and much discussion. There are amendments on bills that come and go. They really do not impact the overall outcome. This amendment is the most important amendment that will be considered in this debate. If the Bryan amendment loses, we convert what can be a bipartisan effort to get this legislation, which I strongly support and supported in the last Congress--and it becomes immediately a partisan vote, and that legislation has no chance in that form of becoming law. Whatever  one's view is on CRA, and I understand we have widely different views, I respectfully submit this is not the vehicle to make this the issue. If, as the distinguished chairman and others have said, CRA needs to be revisited, let's do so in the context of some type of other legislation that is presently before the Banking Committee. We have had no hearings at all on this. 
   The Bryan amendment does two very simple things. One, it retains the current CRA provisions, including those provisions which relate to small banks that eliminate their need to even file a report. All they have to do is to point for the bank examiner and say the records are in the file cabinet. They need do no more. So this is not, in my judgment, an onerous burden. 
   And with respect to the new services that we permit banks to participate in, if Secretary Rubin and other experts who are looking at the banking field are correct, that is the wave of the future. If we do not require CRA as the condition of availing oneself of these new financial services, securities and insurance, in effect we marginalize and relegate CRA to a much 
   lesser role. 
   What is accomplished? Hundreds of millions of dollars have been invested in the inner cities in our country. Thousands of minority businesses have had an opportunity to participate, which they would not otherwise have gotten, and home ownership opportunities have expanded for literally millions of Americans. It would seem to me those are the kind of issues we can agree on--Democrats, Republicans, conservatives and liberals. CRA has accomplished much. 
   We have gone through this before. A year ago, we nearly got a bill. It passed by a bipartisan majority in the House, with virtually the identical provisions that relate to CRA as contained in the Bryan amendment. It passed 16 to 2 out of the Banking Committee in this session of Congress; in the House Banking Committee by a vote of 51 to 8. This legislation has progressed with, again, virtually the identical provisions as it relates to CRA that the Bryan amendment contains. 
   So why are we going through this? The protagonists, the bankers, the insurance companies and the securities industry, do not oppose this legislation. We are going through this because our able chairman, whom we all greatly respect, says he needs leverage in dealing with the House. The last time I looked at the record of the composition of the House, the Republican Party was in the majority. Among its leaders were people such as TOM DELAY and DICK ARMEY, not exactly what you would call liberal exponents, bleeding-heart types. 
   It seems to me the argument that we need leverage makes no sense at all. 
   Finally, let me say this may be the only opportunity in this Congress to vote on a civil rights amendment, a process that has worked well and has served the nation well. It is not objected to by those who are struggling to reach the compromises on this piece of legislation. We should enact the Bryan amendment and move forward and get this bill over to the House, get it to conference and signed into law by the President. We have that opportunity only if the Bryan amendment prevails.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, in the House Commerce Committee today, the Subcommittee on Energy and Power took the first step in what is fast becoming a futile ritual here in Congress. 
   The subcommittee reported to the full committee a revised version of H.R. 45--the latest in a long string of legislative efforts to single the State of Nevada out as the dumping ground for the nuclear power industry's toxic high-level waste. 
   The bill approved by the subcommittee today consists of a now familiar assault on the environment and the health and safety of millions of Americans, both in Nevada and along transportation routes throughout the Nation. 
   It requires the expenditure of billions of taxpayer dollars on a completely unnecessary and misguided ``interim storage'' facility in Nevada. 
   It makes a mockery of the National Environmental Policy Act process, and preempts every local, State, and Federal statute or regulation that interferes with the nuclear power industry's crusade to move high-level waste to Nevada, no matter what the costs or consequences may be. 
   The bill is an unprecedented power grab by the nuclear power industry, trampling on the most fundamental states' rights. 
   The bill overrides years of work by the Environmental Protection Agency in establishing a science based radiation standard, and substitutes by legislative fiat a standard more than six times less protective than generally accepted for citizens anywhere else in the United States. 
   By shipping waste to Nevada in advance of determining the suitability or licensibility of the Yucca Mountain site, the bill also irreversibly prejudices the scientific work at the site. 
   Any hope for an objective evaluation of Yucca Mountain will be lost. 
   The bill approved by the subcommittee today is an environmental and public health travesty. 
   Fortunately, as in the past two Congresses, the bill stands no chance of enactment into law. 
   President Clinton continues to oppose the nuclear power 
    industry's special interest legislation, and will veto the bill should it ever reach him. 
   Even the industry knows there is absolutely no doubt of the firmness of the President's veto threat. 
   Congress will vote to sustain the President's veto, and we will have once again wasted years of time and effort on a useless battle of wills, when we could have be working together towards an equitable, reasonable, and safe resolution of any legitimate grievances the nuclear power industry has with the federal high-level nuclear waste program. 
   The nuclear power industry's obsession with moving its waste to off-site, no matter what the consequences, defies all logic. 
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board, and the industry itself agree that the waste can be stored safely on site for the foreseeable future. 
   Somehow, though, moving waste off-site has become the ``holy grail'' of the industry. 
   Taking the liability for the industry's environmental travesty has been their only rallying cry. 
   Unfortunately for the industry, commercial nuclear power's problems cannot be solved by waste legislation, or anything else we may do here in Congress. 
   Nuclear power is a declining industry, unable to compete in an increasingly competitive electricity marketplace. 
   An industry once touted as a technological marvel--one which we were told could produce power ``too cheap to meter'' at thousands of reactor sites--has turned into an aged collection of ``white elephants,'' struggling to keep operating. 
   As the electricity marketplace moves away from the regulated environment, an environment which virtually guaranteed full cost recovery for utilities huge investments in nuclear plants, the cost of nuclear power continues to rise, due to increasingly expensive maintenance and retrofit costs to keep the plants in operation. 
   While the industry likes to portray what they describe as ``radical environmentalists'' for its inability to compete, the true cause for nuclear power's demise is simple economics. 
   The value of nuclear power plants in today's electricity marketplace has plummeted. 
   Nuclear plants that do sell barely fetch any price in today's markets, and 21 reactors have simply been allowed to shut down. 
   As the thoughtful newspaper article that I will insert in the RECORD makes pretty clear, nuclear power is an industry with no future. 
   Unfortunately, the industry's last gasp, its last in a long series of strategic miscalculations, appears to be to  deposit its legacy of high-level waste in Nevada. 
   Since its very inception, the nuclear power industry has shown a totally irresponsible lack of foresight in dealing with its highly toxic waste stream. 
   For decades, the industry has shut its eyes to its growing volume of high-level waste, and continued to generate waste with absolutely no rational plan to manage it. 
   The end result of this irresponsible lack of planning--or maybe the real plan all along--has been simply a demand that the commercial utilities be permitted to shove the waste problem off on the American public. 
   In 1982, the industry convinced Congress to accept responsibility for disposing of the waste, and, ever since then, the industry's demands on the Federal Government, and the Treasury, have only increased. 
   The nuclear power industry's surreal sense of entitlement got a jolt of reality last week. 
   For years, the industry has saturated Congress with frightening scenarios of tens or hundreds of billions of dollars in supposed damages at the expense of the American taxpayer resulting from delays in the Federal Government's high-level waste program. 
   Last week, the U.S. Court of Claims dismissed one of the utilities self-serving billion-dollar lawsuits. 
   The Court told Northern States Power, which had filed a claim for over $1 billion, to return to DOE, and seek appropriate adjustments under the contract the utility had signed in the early 1980s. 
   More dismissals of utilities outrageous damage claims are sure to follow. 
   While the math leading to the industry's claims of $80-$100 billion in damages was always very mysterious and suspect, last week's decision by the Court of Claims should lay this outrageous scare tactic to rest for good. 
   The nuclear power industry, or, more accurately, its ratepayers, do have some legitimate grievances with the DOE. 
   Since 1990, I have introduced legislation to help the Department of Energy and the industry address problems created by the Department's inability to meet the 1998 waste acceptance deadline. 
   Under this legislation, utilities would be allowed credits against Nuclear Waste Fund payments for the costs associated with storage of waste the DOE was scheduled to accept. 
   Recently, numerous proposals have surfaced which call into question the fundamental approach of legislation such as H.R. 45 and its predecessors. 
   On the House side, legislation has been introduced, based upon a previous DOE proposal, which would allow utilities to escrow Nuclear Waste Fund payments, and use some of the investment income from these escrow accounts to pay the costs of on-site storage. 
   In the Senate, a proposal is being developed to seek at least a partial technological solution to the high-level waste problem, through research and development of transmutation technology. 
   This week, the Institute for Energy and Environmental Research released a proposal which would store high-level waste on reactor sites, under the stewardship of a federally chartered non-profit corporation. 
   The Secretary of Energy has his own very generous proposal to the utilities to address any inequities created by the DOE's failure to meet the 1998 deadline. 
   As a settlement offer to the many utilities filing lawsuits against the Department, the Secretary has offered to take title to the waste at reactor sites. 
   Under the Secretary's proposal, utilities would be relieved of both financial and legal responsibility for the waste, leaving full responsibility for the waste in the hands of the federal government. 
   The Secretary's offer is more than generous. The modest adjustments in fees available to the utilities under the Standard Contract would be adequately addressed, in my view, by the Secretary's proposal. 
   Several utilities, including Commonwealth Edison, one of the largest nuclear utilities in the nation, recognizing the futility of the nuclear power lobby's continued insistence on interim storage in Nevada, have indicated an interest in accepting the proposal. 
   As the details of the proposal continue to develop, and as the prospects for interim storage in Nevada continue to decline, other utilities are sure to follow. 
   In fact, for most utilities, the interim storage proposals currently before Congress provide little or no actual relief. 
   For many utilities, even the overly optimistic 2003 deadline for the start of operation of an interim storage facility is too little, too late. 
   By that time, many nuclear utilities intending to continue to operate nuclear plants will have already had to invest in additional on-site storage. 
   For any of these utilities, the Secretary's offer of taking title provides far greater opportunity for relief than the pending legislation--even if the legislation had any chance of passage. 
   Any utility CEO who refuses to consider the Secretary's offer to take title would be doing the utility's shareholders, and ratepayers, a grave disservice. 
   Until the nuclear power industry can recognize that the tired, futile approach they have adopted for more than 5 years is going nowhere, and is merely setting a course for yet another legislation train wreck, Congress cannot address in any reasonable fashion whatever legitimate issues the industry may raise. 
   It is well past the time that the industry should abandon its pipedream of interim storage in Nevada, and come to the table to negotiate an equitable financial and legal solution to its dispute with the federal government over its high-level waste.

I will also have printed for the RECORD a letter from President Clinton earlier this year which repeats his veto threat in very clear and uncertain terms.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator from Nevada is absolutely correct. I think there is a shaft of light at the end of the tunnel, if I may use that metaphor, in which a number of thoughtful Members of Congress, working together with the administration and some responsible nuclear utilities, have come to recognize the futility of the process that my friend, our senior colleague, knows only too well, and to try to work out something that addresses the legitimate concerns of ratepayers in States where nuclear reactors exist and yet does not devastate our environmental laws and create a situation that is costly and dangerous to the American public.

   Mr. BRYAN. The Senator is correct again. These are suggestions that have been generated by thoughtful Members in the Senate, and in the House, by the administration, and increasingly the dialog has indicated that, again, what I would call responsible and reasonable nuclear utilities are engaged in a dialog. And I am hopeful, as I know my senior colleague is, that we can avoid this train wreck that occurs annually in the Congress and work out something that deals responsibly and legitimately with the concerns that ratepayers have in States with these reactors, but does not involve this incredibly foolish effort to transport 77,000 metric tons of high-level nuclear waste to the State of Nevada unnecessarily. And, as the Senator from Nevada knows, that is simply not going to happen, because the administration and the Department of Energy's Nuclear Waste Technical Review Board all agree that such an approach is unnecessary and unwise. 
   I thank my colleague for his thoughtful and insightful questions, and I look forward to working with him in developing a responsible approach to resolving this issue. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

    Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of Nevada's oldest and most respected businesses on the occasion of its 90th Anniversary. The Las Vegas insurance firm of Cragin & Pike was begun in 1909 by Ernie Cragin and William Pike, pioneers in the truest sense of the word. In 1909, Las Vegas was a newborn city, having been founded just four years earlier as a railroad division point for the San Perdro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad. 
   Since its 20th century birth, when Las Vegas was established as a railroad community, the Las Vegas Valley has seen dynamic change. Cragin & Pike has enjoyed as colorful a history as the city it calls home, both witnessing and shaping the events that would make Las Vegas the world's premier city for entertainment and tourism. Ernie Cragin himself served as the mayor of Las Vegas for 25 years. William Pike saw the legalization of Nevada gambling in 1931 and the construction of the Boulder Dam completed four years later. Cragin & Pike has been a full partner to many of the city's most familiar names in business. 
   In a city that defines itself by the ever changing view from the Las Vegas Strip, Cragin & Pike has endured through its dedication to its customers and its rock solid business philosophies. I know that its name sake founders would be as proud as I am today to see this innovative yet faithful member of the Las Vegas community observe yet another achievement in the celebration of its 90th Anniversary. I  congratulate the partners and associates of Cragin & Pike on this accomplishment, and look forward to many more.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join with my friend and colleague from Nevada, Senator REID, in introducing this important legislation today to honor an individual whose extraordinary military service record and faithful commitment to his community warrants special recognition. 
   As Senator REID has explained, in the next few months a new wing will be dedicated at the Ioannis A. Lougaris VA Medical Center in Reno, Nevada. This five-story, 110-bed tower is a welcome addition to the Reno VAMC, and will provide veterans in northern Nevada with the modern facilities and quality inpatient care they so clearly deserve. The purpose of the legislation we are introducing today is to name that new wing after Mr. Jack Streeter, an individual whose lifetime is hallmarked by his exemplary service record, his steadfast dedication to the veterans community and his leadership in numerous charitable and nonprofit organization. 
   I have had the opportunity to know Jack for many years now, dating back to my tenure as governor of Nevada. Anyone who has come into contact with Jack Streeter, and who had the occasion to talk with Jack and learn more about his experiences, can understand and appreciate what an extraordinary individual this man is. 
   Jack Streeter's military service record is quite well known in the state of Nevada. He is, in fact, the most decorated World War Two veteran in Nevada, having earned five Purpose Hearts, five Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars in the European Theater. Let me repeat that Mr. President, because it truly is an astounding record. Five Purple Hearts, five Silver Stars, and two Bronze Stars. 
   As a young second lieutenant during the war, Jack saw action from the Allied invasion of Normandy to the decisive Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944-45. Upon leaving the service in 1946, Mr. Streeter earned a law degree from Hastings Law School in San Francisco and later returned to Reno, where he was soon elected as district attorney. He later found the National District Attorney Association and participated in numerous civic organizations and foundations. 
   Jack Streeter's distinguished military service record, coupled with his unyielding dedication to his community, merits the sort of recognition and rememberence that this legislation will provide. To all Nevadans who have had the opportunity to know Jack, he is a friend, a civic leader, and most importantly, a champion of the community. 
   I look forward to working with Senator REID and the entire Nevada delegation in passing this proposal and naming this new wing after a true American hero.

   Mr. BRYAN. We are about to embark upon a roll call vote that only one other Senate in the history of our Republic has been called upon to cast. It is a weighty decision. We have taken an oath that requires us to render ``impartial justice according to the Constitution and the laws.'' By so doing each of us has undertaken a solemn obligation to be fair to the President, fair to the American people, and faithful to our constitutional responsibility. 
   One hundred thirty one years ago, the 40th Congress faced a similar decision. Then, as now, the Nation was divided. Then, as now, the passions of the day raged across the land. Then, as  now, the critics of the President were in the majority in the Senate. Confounding the cynics of that day, the Senate rose above itself by the slenderest of margins, a single vote, and acquitted President Andrew Johnson. More than a century later, that decision has stood the test of time. 
   The Senate's acquittal reaffirmed a basic constitutional doctrine that the Executive branch, and the Legislative branch shall be separate and co-equal; and that the Executive Branch should not be subservient to the prevailing views of a Congressional majority. 
   How different the course of our constitutional history might have been had President Andrew Johnson been convicted. Our system of government today might be more like a parliamentary system undermining the independence of the chief executive. 
   Future Presidents may have been forced to operate within the omnipresent shadow of impeachment whenever a legislative majority was hostile to their views or policies. I think it is fair to conclude the office of the Presidency would be a profoundly different one had Andrew Johnson been convicted. It is in that historical context we meet. 
   In this century, there have been five judicial impeachments that have reached the Senate. In each of those proceedings, the actions of the House and Senate were decided by a bipartisan vote, and all five judges were convicted, and removed from office. 
   In the history of the Republic, there have been but two presidential impeachments, that of Andrew Johnson and William Jefferson Clinton. Each Presidential impeachment, however, has come to the Senate under an ominous cloud of partisanship. 
   The Constitution wisely imposes a heavy burden of proof upon the House of Representatives to convict and remove a duly elected President. And when that constitutional process is tainted by partisan actions, the Articles of Impeachment must be subjected to an additional measure of scrutiny. 
   The Constitution provides in Article II, Section 4 that ``The President ..... shall be removed from office on Impeachment for the Conviction of, Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' 
   What constitutes impeachable conduct, as contemplated by the Constitution, is the central issue of this trial. 
   The Framers of the Constitution labored at some length to fashion an impeachment article. As their guide, they looked to the English experience in their parliamentary system. They followed that history in deciding to involve both the House of Representatives and the Senate giving them different roles--the former to charge and impeach, and the latter to convict or acquit. 
   Unlike the British parliamentary system with its monarch, the Framers decided impeachment would apply against its highest office holders, expressly including the President. Further, the Framers determined that impeachment would in and of itself be limited. Rather than including capital punishment and other criminal penalties as a part of 
   impeachment as Britain did, the Framers limited impeachment to the removal of the individual from office upon conviction. 
   As the drafting of the Constitution's impeachment clause proceeded, the drafters struggled with how to characterize the offenses for which a president could be impeached, convicted, and removed from office. Initially, offenses such as ``malpractice'', ``neglect of duty'', and ``corruption'' were considered. As the Constitutional Convention drew to a close, the Convention's Committee of Eleven proposed ``treason or bribery'' as the appropriate standard. 
   George Mason suggested the addition of ``maladministration'' due to his concern that limiting the offenses to only treason or bribery would still allow a president to commit ``many great and dangerous offences'' which would not be subject to impeachment. [The Records of the Federal Convention]. 
   However, James Madison believe ``maladministration'' was ``..... [s]o vague a term [it] will be equivalent to a tenure during [the] pleasure of the Senate.'' [The Records of the Federal Convention]. George Mason then proposed the addition of ``high crimes and misdemeanors against the State'', which the Committee on Style modified by deleting ``against the State'' believing that language unnecessary. 
   Alexander Hamilton in Federalist Paper Number 65 argues that the Senate could convict and remove a President only for ``those offenses which proceed from the misconduct of public men, or in other words from the abuse or violation of some public trust. They are of a nature which may with peculiar propriety be denominated political, as they relate chiefly to injuries done immediately to the society itself.'' 
   Nearly two centuries later, Charles Black explained in his ``Impeachment Handbook'', the purpose of impeachment is to protect the nation, rather than to punish the individual holding the office of president. Thus, the behavior at issue must reach a level of endangering the state. 
   The House voted to impeach President Clinton on two Articles; perjury before the Grand Jury, and obstruction of justice. Two other Articles accusing the President of perjury in a deposition in a civil case, and of abusing his power by not responding to the 81 requests for admission made on November 5, 1998 in a manner the House desired were not approved. 
   Article I charging perjury is poorly and rather vaguely worded. Nevertheless, it appears to contain 11 separate allegations. The House Managers in their presentation in Article II allege seven acts of Presidential misconduct constituting obstruction of justice. 
   The Office of Independent Counsel was authorized by the Attorney General of the United States to conduct an investigation of the President's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. Mr. Starr has 25 attorneys and 5 non-FBI investigators on his personal staff, and access to the virtually unlimited resources of the FBI. The investigation continued for eight months culminating in a record of over 60,000 pages of materials including sworn testimony from Grand Jury appearances, depositions, and sworn statements. 
   That the relationship between the President and the Office of Independent Counsel was a contentious one, is beyond dispute. Mr. Starr has been as aggressive Special Prosecutor. Many believe that his prosecutorial zeal violated any reasonable standard of fairness. He has been no shrinking violet in his pursuit of the President. 
   Yet even Mr. Starr and his staff, after careful analysis, concluded that 8 of the 11 allegations of perjury before the Grand Jury, and one of the allegations of obstruction of justice lacked sufficient prosecutorial merit to be submitted to the House. Certainly, it cannot be contended that these allegations can sustain the burden of proof to establish the President's guilt, or to rise to the level of impeachable conduct necessary to remove a duly elected president. 
   The Constitution's impeachment process was not created to mete out punishment against the individual serving as President. Rather, the impeachment process is to protect the nation from a President who has brought grave harm to the office and to the country. These are distinctly different goals. 
   As is so often the case, the American people have a clear understanding of the circumstances that bring us together. 
   The President had an improper relationship in the White House with a 22-year-old intern. 
   The President lied to his family, his staff and the American people in denying the existence of the relationship. 
   The President pursued a course of conduct to conceal his improper relationship with the White House intern. 
   The President's conduct was wrong and it was immoral. It remains for us to determine the constitutional consequences, if any, to be attached to this conduct. 
   The House Managers rely heavily upon circumstantial evidence and draw from that evidence a series of inferences which lead them to conclude that the President is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
   The President's counsel artfully attack the weaknesses in the Managers' case and assert that exculpatory direct evidence raises sufficient doubt under the law, and therefore, the President is entitled to be acquitted. 
   On this record, as one of the House prosecutors pointed out reasonable people can differ as to the conclusions they reach.  
   It is acknowledged that the House Managers have the burden of proof in establishing the President's guilt under legal definitions. Open to question is the standard of proof to be applied, a mere preponderance of the evidence as in a civil trial, clear and convincing evidence as in alleging fraudulent behavior, or beyond a reasonable doubt as in a criminal case. 
   The House alleges that specific crimes have been committed, to wit perjury and obstruction of justice as defined in law. Under these circumstances, I believe the appropriate standard is the criminal standard--proof beyond a reasonable doubt. 
   But is it impeachable conduct? Does it rise to the constitutionally required standard of bribery, treason or other high crimes and misdemeanors. I think not. 
   The President's conduct is boorish, indefensible, even reprehensible. It does not threaten the Republic. It does not impact our national security. It does not undermine or compromise our position of unchallenged leadership in international affairs. 
   Although I conclude that the evidence presented in this case does not reach the standard commanded by the Constitution to convict and remove a President, it does not follow that we are precluded from registering our strong disapproval of the President's personal conduct. 
   There is a way. After our vote on these Articles of Impeachment, and assuming, as most believe, there are not the votes to convict the President--the Senate should proceed immediately to adopt a bipartisan resolution of censure. 
   It is important for us to do this. There are two reasons. First, the American people need to hear from us in strong and unambiguous language that the President's personal conduct is unacceptable and unworthy of the President of the United States. 
   The record of these proceedings must also reflect that the acquittal of the President can in no way be construed as an exoneration of his conduct. A censure resolution should not be embarked upon lightly or for political reasons, but it should be used in this case. 
   And finally, a response to the injunction that we have frequently heard over the past several weeks: that no man is above the law. That is a core value. It goes to the very essence of our beliefs as Americans. No violence is done to this sacred principle by pursuing the course of action I have chosen. 
   For those who believe that the President is guilty of perjury and obstruction of justice--criminal offenses--there is a forum available for that determination. It is our criminal justice system and William Jefferson Clinton may be called to the bar of justice to respond to these criminal charges--armed with no greater legal protection than that accorded the most humble among us. And that is how it should be.

   Mr. BRYAN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Chairman MCCAIN today as a cosponsor of the Air Transportation Improvement Act. As Senator MCCAIN has indicated, this legislation is exactly the same as legislation approved by the Senate last year by a vote of 99-1. 
   Passing legislation to extend the Airport Improvement Program needs to be among our highest priorities for early action in this Congress. While I do not support every provision of this legislation, it was a reasonable compromise, which enjoyed nearly unanimous support in the Senate last year. As pressure continues to increase on our national aviation system, and with the looming Y2K problem, we need to act quickly to ensure continued improvements in air safety and efficiency. 
   One provision of this legislation of particular interest to me, and many others, is the provision related to the Reagan Washington National Airport ``perimeter rule.'' 
   Codified in 1986, the National ``perimeter rule'' limits non-stop flights serving National to destinations within 1250 miles of the airport. Originally enacted to promote the development of Dulles Airport as the region's long-haul carrier, the ``perimeter rule'' has long outlived its original justification, and remains today a significant barrier to competition in a very competitive aviation industry. 
   While the justification for the ``perimeter rule'' has long since faded, it continues to unfairly limit service to communities outside of the 1250 mile perimeter. Communities like Las Vegas, a community that desperately needs additional air service, are denied access to a very significant airport. In addition, air carriers which happen to operate hubs located outside of the perimeter face a very serious competitive disadvantage. On numerous occasions, the General Accounting Office has identified the ``perimeter rule'' as a barrier to entry in the Washington, DC air service market. 
   Simply put, the ``perimeter rule'' should be repealed. Nevadans, and other Westerners, deserve the same access to our nation's capital city as those in the East. Continuing this discriminatory, artificial barrier to competition creates major inequities in our national transportation system. 
   The legislation we are introducing today, unfortunately, does not repeal the ``perimeter rule.'' Instead, like the legislation passed last year by the Senate, the legislation grants limited exemptions from the perimeter rule for up to 12 additional slots a day at Washington National. Last year, in the interest of compromise, I supported this approach. I continue to be concerned, however, that the 12 new, outside the perimeter slots, if enacted, will be insufficient to truly address the competitive problems created by the ``perimeter rule.'' While I support Chairman MCCAIN's attempt to reach consensus on this issue, I am hopeful that last year's approach can be further refined to create additional opportunities for Washington National service from beyond the 1250 mile perimeter, while at the same time recognizing the interests of those communities within the current perimeter, as well as Northern Virginia. 
   I look forward to working with the Chairman, and other members of the Commerce Committee, on this important legislation.
