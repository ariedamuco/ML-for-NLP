   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, 3 years ago, during a visit by a constituent, I met a young man from southern New Jersey named Kevin O'Donnell. I have shared his story with the Senate before. But on this day, having met with some success, I share it with you again. 
   Five years ago, Kevin was 31 years old. He was a young father, a husband of a lovely woman, and in perfect health. He took his daughter skiing one day and upon returning home felt a pain in his leg. It continued over a period of time, bothering him, so he went to visit the doctor. You can only imagine the shock when this perfectly healthy young man--father of this little girl--discovered he had been stricken with ALS, known to most of us as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   Since that day, Kevin O'Donnell's wife and daughter have watched the life flow out of his body. Going from a healthy young man, they watched him lose control of his legs and arms, the ability to speak, and even the ability to breathe. Life simply evaporated from Kevin O'Donnell's body. 
   When he came in to see me those years ago, he had a very simple request--so logical I could not conceive of an argument against it. While he was waiting to die, not only was his life leaving him but the financial security of his family. Nursing care, medical assistance, things to ease the pain, to maintain some dignity in life, to provide relief for his wife and his family, were costing thousands of dollars. 
   But under the rules of Medicare, he could not begin to receive any assistance for 2 years. The life expectancy for 90 percent of ALS sufferers is only 3 years, 4 years. Most of the people who have ALS do not live beyond the waiting period in Medicare to get help. This never could have been anticipated. It never could have been even imagined by people in Medicare when these regulations were written. And because there is no other disease quite like it, the regulations have never been changed. 
   A person can have heart disease or cancer, and they may be at great risk, but they can live 2 years. With the right treatment, they can live 5, 10, 20 years; at least the chances are always good. With ALS, the outcome of the disease is nearly certain that the life expectancy is not long and most will not live to ever see their first dollar of Government help. 
   I brought this cause to many of my colleagues in the Congress. There are 28 Members in the Senate--16 Democrats and 12 Republicans--and over 280 Democrats and Republicans in the House of Representatives who have joined in this effort to help those people around the country who are stricken with Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   Today, I rise to thank Senator LOTT and Speaker HASTERT for their generous help, and Congressman GEPHARDT, Senator DASCHLE, Senator BYRD, Senator REID--the bipartisan leadership--for offering some help to those who suffer from this disease in this country. 
   But most importantly, I am also very indebted to President Clinton, who made this a critical priority in budget negotiations. Specifically, I thank members of the White House staff, Chris Jennings and Rich Tarplin, who, under the President's direction, fought to give some help to these Lou Gehrig's disease patients. 
   I have spoken on this floor many times about this cause. For me, this was a victory that was going to be won before this session of Congress ended--no matter what. 
   When I began this effort some years ago, I stood outside the Senate Chamber with people in wheelchairs, stricken with ALS, in a variety of conditions. As I stand here today to declare victory, I am mindful of the fact that most of those who stood with me when this effort began are now deceased. With their own lives, they proved the  importance of the legislation. They said they could not live the 2 years to ever receive the Medicare assistance to help ease the financial burden on their families. Most of them proved it with their lives. 
   Today, the CBO estimates that there are 17,000 ALS patients waiting to become eligible for Medicare. With the passage of this bill, their wait will end, and with it the anguish of calculating how to afford the $250,000 in annual medical bills while they are also dealing with the anguish of their disease. 
   For me, it is the end of a long fight, where I can tell Kevin O'Donnell: You began it, you fought it, and we won. And in your victory comes relief for 17,000 people just like you. 
   To all my colleagues who have helped, I give you my most sincere thanks and leave you with the words of former President Thomas Jefferson, in 1809, who said about service in Government:  
   The care of human life and happiness ..... is the first and only legitimate object of good government.  
   Mr. President, there is relief for ALS patients in this bill. That is good government. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Carole Anderson Graves, as she is honored by the Beta Alpha Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority in cooperation with the New Jersey Performing Arts Center during the 3rd Annual Kwanza Festival honoring the community elders of Newark, New Jersey. 
   Our cities and towns are constantly in need of individuals willing to give of themselves for the benefit of the community at-large. The individuals who fulfill this need are the volunteers and the public servants who improve the  world around us in ways that often go unseen. It therefore fitting that from time to time we take a moment to recognize their efforts. 
   Carole Anderson Graves has an extensive record of service to the Newark community. Since 1995, she has served as the Essex County Register of Deeds and Mortgages. In that capacity, Mrs. Graves has overseen the recording, filing and preserving of all property transactions within the 22 municipalities of Essex County. 
   Mrs. Graves also has given great deal to the furtherance of education in the Newark area. For nine years, Mrs. Graves was employed as a Special Education teacher at the Dayton Street School and spent twenty-seven years as the full-time President of the Newark Teachers Union. She is also an adjunct professor/lecturer of Labor Relations at Essex County Community College and Rutgers Institute of Labor and Management Relations. 
   The city of Newark has been truly fortunate to have someone of the talents and dedication of Mrs. Graves within the community. It is an honor to be able to recognize her on this special occasion.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in the days and hours that remain in this session, many of us on each side of our respective aisles will say a great deal about the colleagues we have worked with and admire from our own political parties. Indeed, I am no exception. For years, the contributions of the MOYNIHANs, or the BOB KERREYs, or the DICK BRYANs, or the FRANK LAUTENBERGs have been extraordinary in the life of our country and in the workings of this Senate. I will join those voices in praising each of them. But at this moment I wish to say a word as well about our colleagues from the Republican Party who are leaving this institution. 
   Having chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee for these years, I have known some of these Senators as friends and colleagues but also as adversaries. It is a peculiar and even awkward thing in the American political process that with people you like and admire, you can nevertheless have philosophical differences; you can have a political contest but nevertheless deal with them civilly. 
   I admire many of these men and rise today to praise their contributions to  the Senate and the country; and, as many other Americans, to thank them for their service even though it was my responsibility to help wage campaigns against them. That is our system. It is not personal. It is borne only in the struggle of ideas, the competition of proposals, and the free market of American politics that have served our country so well. 
   I would like to say a word about several Members of the Senate who are not of the Democratic Party. 
   Senator ABRAHAM of Michigan, with whom I worked on the Judiciary Committee, is a respected Member of the institution, 
   a very fine Senator who has left his mark on the great issues of law enforcement, who I have come to know and admire. 
   Senator ROTH of Delaware, who I did not know well personally but who cleverly served this institution with distinction for a long time, changed many of our laws and much for the better. 
   Senator ASHCROFT, who as well served with me on the Judiciary Committee, is a gentleman, is a fierce advocate for his point of view, and is a skilled man who dealt in a campaign in extraordinary circumstances, I believe with considerable distinction. 
   Senator GRAMS of Minnesota, I believe, too, worked hard gaining the respect of his colleagues. 
   Senator GORTON of Washington State, who served his State for so very long and so ably, I believe, was a tremendous Member of this institution. Although he did lose an election and is also leaving this institution, he is one of my favorite members of the other party.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Dwight Crist Northington on the occasion of his 9th Pastoral Anniversary at Calvary Baptist Church in Red Bank, New Jersey. Dr. Northington is an extremely gifted individual, and it is an honor to recognize this special moment in his life. 
   Dr. Northington has served the citizens of New Jersey since 1986, when he was named Pastor of First Baptist Church of South Orange. Since that time, he has also served as president of Westside Ministerial Alliance and currently serves as the Moderator of the Seacoast Missionary Baptist Association. While having done a great deal for the community of Red Bank, Dr. Northington has also served as an instructor at Brookdale Community College and as a member of the Borough of Red Bank Board of Education. 
   The needs of our Nation can only be met through the industrious efforts of each individual. The work of Dr. Northington and others like him is vital to the continued prosperity of our communities and meeting the needs of people who live within them. 
   The citizens of Red Bank are fortunate to have a talented and dedicated individual such as Dr. Northington in their community.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for 4 years, my colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, has shown extraordinary leadership in addressing the failings of the current bankruptcy system. He has enormous patience and has exhibited extraordinary leadership. I have been very proud to be his partner in this effort which now comes to a critical phase. This has not always been a popular fight. But it is certain to be a very important one. 
   I think everyone agrees that our bankruptcy system is in need of repair. It is only over the question of how to fix the bankruptcy system that there is any issue at all. 
   In the last Congress, efforts to pass bankruptcy reform legislation came extremely close. It failed simply in the waning days of the session. Having come so close in the 105th Congress, I inherited the role of the ranking member on the subcommittee with jurisdiction over the legislation. I felt some considerable optimism that this time we would be successful. 
   The bill passed the floor by very wide margins. The issues had narrowed. There was an overwhelming sense that there was a need to reform bankruptcy. I think that my optimism was well placed. 
   Since that time, I have spent countless hours working with Senator GRASSLEY and many other Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle dealing with very difficult issues in crafting this bill. I am very grateful to Senator GRASSLEY. I am very grateful to the Members on both sides of the aisle for having brought us to this point with this bipartisan bill that commands the support of over two-thirds of the Members of the Senate on both sides of the aisle. 
   I do not contend that it is a perfect bill. No bill that commands such broad support and that is this controversial could be perfect. Indeed, if I were drafting the bill on my own, or if any Member of the Senate were drafting this bill on their own, it would be different in some ways and in some fundamental respects. 
   But is it a fair and balanced bill? Yes. Does it deserve the support of the Senate? Absolutely. Will it improve the functioning of the bankruptcy system without injuring vulnerable Americans who need bankruptcy protection? Yes, it will. If it didn't, it wouldn't have my name on it. 
   For these reasons, I believe the bill deserves--as indeed clearly it will have--broad bipartisan support. 
   There is obviously speculation that although the bill will pass the Senate by a wide margin--it passed the House of Representatives by very wide margins--it might be vetoed when it reaches the White House. 
   I want to take a moment to outline for you, Mr. President, the reasons I believe a veto on this legislation would be a very serious mistake. 
   First, as I mentioned before, the bill is a product of extensive bipartisan negotiations--negotiations in which the White House has been a vocal and integral part. Many of the improvements that we have seen in the bill have been concessions to the White House demand that it be more consumer friendly. The President appropriately asked that consumer protection from credit card abuse--particularly for the young, the uninformed, and for the elderly--be in this bill. It is in this bill, and the President can take great pride in it. 
   We should not forget that there is also a very real possibility that the next administration may not have as strong a commitment to consumer issues as this administration, thus rendering the bankruptcy bill to emerge in the next Congress potentially significantly worse. 
   This is critical for the Clinton administration to understand. No one knows how this Presidential election is going to be resolved, and we may not know before this Congress leaves. There is a real chance that the next President of the United States is not going to share Bill Clinton's commitment to consumer protection or other objectives in the bill, meaning that from the administration's perspective this bill may be the best that we can get. And to veto it is to lose a real chance for meaningful consumer protection in bankruptcy law. 
   On substance, this bill provides a very important fix in our flawed bankruptcy system. Indeed, it may be tougher than current law. As I think the administration will concede, it also includes fair changes. 
   At a time when people in the United States are enjoying the most prosperous economic period in our history, there has been a rapid rise in consumer bankruptcy. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection. That is a 20-percent increase from 1996 and a staggering 350 percent increase since 1980. 
   While filings dipped by 100,000 in 1999 to just 1.3 million, they are still far too high. It is estimated that 70 percent of those filings were done under chapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Conversely, just 30 percent of petitions filed under chapter 13 require a repayment plan. 
   A study released last year by the Department of Justice indicated as many as 13 percent of debtor filings under chapter 7. A staggering 182,000 people each year could afford to repay a significant amount of their debts. They could, but they won't because they are indeed using those chapters of the bankruptcy code to allow them to escape debt that they are capable of paying. 
   If, indeed, this were not the case, and if the bankruptcy reform that we are offering the Senate were in place, an extraordinary $44 billion would be returned to creditors--banks, to be sure; credit card companies, obviously; but also small businesses, small contractors, family companies, mom-and-pop stores, companies that cannot afford to have the bankruptcy system of our country misused. The larger banks and the credit card companies will always cover this abuse. They have the financial resources. They can absorb the loss. It is not for them that I stand here today supporting this bill. 
   It is for the thousands of small businesses that cannot afford to absorb $4 billion of inappropriate bankruptcy. This bill before the Senate ensures that those debtors with the ability to repay these debts will do exactly that. 
   Despite what we hear from opponents of the bill, the core of the bill now before the Senate is a bipartisan agreement reached in May after months of informal negotiations. It is very similar to a bill that passed this body by a vote of 83-14, but in my judgment is a better bill than that legislation that commanded 83 votes in this Senate. Critics of bankruptcy reform have charged that the bill denies poor people the protection of the bankruptcy system. This is simply untrue. No American is denied access to bankruptcy under this bill--nobody. 
   What this legislation does is assure that those with the ability to repay a portion of their debts do so by establishing clear and reasonable criteria to determine repayment obligations. But it also provides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in need of debt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh start. Bankruptcy protection allowing all Americans a clean slate, a second chance at their economic lives, should not lose that chance and, under this bill, will not lose that chance. Judicial discretion remains where a good case can be made. 
   To ensure that this will remain the case, the bill before the Senate contains a means test virtually identical to that passed in the Senate bill. Under current law, virtually anyone who files for complete debt relief under chapter 7 receives it. This bill simply changes that criterion to a needs-based system which establishes a presumption that chapter 7 filings should be either dismissed or converted to chapter 13 when the debtor has sufficient income to repay at least $10,000 or 25 percent of their outstanding debt. 
   Isn't that fair? If some small business has provided a product or a service, you are the recipient of it, and you have demonstrated ability to pay $10,000 of your obligation or demonstrated the ability to pay that percentage of your obligation, shouldn't you have to pay it? That is the test that is being applied. I think it is fair. 
   Even so, the presumption may be rebutted if the debtor demonstrates special circumstances requiring expenses  above and beyond those the court has considered in applying the means test. We give an escape clause: Yes, you have the ability to pay this, but you have special circumstances. We will still exempt you. This is a flexible, yet efficient screen to move debtors with the ability to repay a portion of their debt into a repayment plan, while at the same time ensuring judicial discretion for a review of the debtor's circumstances. 
   In addition to this flexible means test, the bill before the Senate also includes two key protections for low-income debtors that were part of the Senate-passed bill. The first is an amendment offered by Senator SCHUMER to protect low-income debtors from coercive motions. This will ensure that creditors cannot strong-arm debtors into promising to make payments they simply cannot afford to make. Poor debtors will not be forced to reaffirm these debts if they cannot afford to make them. That was asked to be put in the bill to protect low-income people, and it is in the bill. 
   The second is an amendment offered by Senator DURBIN, a mini screen, to reduce the burden of the means test on debtors between 100 and 150 percent of the median income. This is a 
   preliminary, less intrusive look at the debts and expenses of the middle-income debtors, to weed out those with no ability to repay those debts and move them more quickly to a fresh start. 
   So it is a special category and a mini screen, if you are in that 100 to 150 percent of the poverty level, to ensure that you are given this extra degree of protection. 
   In addition to a flexible means test, in addition to the Schumer safe harbor and the Durbin mini screen, the bill contains other provisions not a part of the original Senate bill to protect low-income debtors: 
   One, a safe harbor to ensure that all debtors earning less than the State median income will have access to chapter 7 without qualification. Less than median income, no question, no qualifications, you are in chapter 7. We are not interested in denying protections to particularly low-income people. 
   Two, a floor to the means test to guarantee the debtors unable to repay less than $6,000 of their outstanding debt will not be moved into chapter 13. If that is the limit of your resources, that is all you can pay back, we are not interested in you; you get full protection. 
   Three, additional flexibility in the means test to take into account a debtor's administration expenses and allow additional moneys for food and clothing expenses. So even if you have the money, even if on the bill's face you can pay back that portion of your debt, if indeed that money is needed for basic human items--food, clothing--we are removing you from provisions of the bill. You will not be paying back those bills. You will be subject to full, complete protection. 
   This should convince my colleagues that it will not make it more difficult for those in dire need to sweep away their debts and obtain a fresh start. It will not be more difficult; it will be easier. The bill has been drafted very carefully to protect people in exactly these circumstances. Absolutely no one--no one--will be denied, therefore, access to bankruptcy and the discharge of their obligations. But every one of these additional five provisions makes that even less likely for people with low income. 
   All the bill does, therefore, is establish a process to move debtors who can afford to repay a substantial portion of their debt from chapter 7, where they can now sweep away all those debts, into chapter 13, where they have a repayment plan. That is the bill. Demonstrated ability to pay; a repayment plan for your debts. 
   Critics, however, have also argued that the bill places an unfair burden on women and single-parent families. This is the most important emphasis that must be made about this bill. That is not true. I wouldn't vote for this bill, I wouldn't cosponsor this bill, I wouldn't have worked for this bill for 2 years, I wouldn't stand here today if there was anything to the argument that women, single-parent families, children, have any vulnerability because of this legislation. Nothing would be more important to me than protecting these vulnerable citizens. 
   Indeed, the bill contains the following: An amendment that I offered with Senator HATCH to facilitate the collection of child support by requiring the bankruptcy trustee to give the person to whom support is owed information on the debtor's whereabouts. Fine for bankruptcy; there is a chance this can impact, obviously, a single mother or a child. We are now affording the ability to locate the person who has the obligation in order to help the single mother or the child. 
   Most important, the bill protects single-parent families by elevating child support from its current seventh position in line seeking the resources of the person in bankruptcy to first. The single mother, the child, who right now is behind financial institutions, behind the Government, will now be behind no one; they are the first claim on assets. 
   Finally, the bill requires that a chapter 13 plan provide for full payment of all child support payments that became due after the petition was filed. Meeting family obligations must be in the repayment plan, which is not required under current law. These provisions put both families and the States in a better position than under current law. 
   But it doesn't stop there. The bill also includes a number of other provisions designed to ensure protections for other vulnerable people in American society. It protects the rights of nursing home patients when a nursing home goes bankrupt. The bill requires that an omsbudsman be appointed to act as an advocate for the patient and provide clear and specific rules for disposing of patient records, a protection not now available for people in nursing homes. 
   The bill includes a permanent extension of chapter 12 programs to provide expedited bankruptcy relief for farmers, a provision not now in the bankruptcy law. 
   Finally, and most importantly, I have always said it is critical the bill not only address debtor abuse of the bankruptcy system, but also overreaching by the credit card industry. From the beginning, we insisted that consumer protection from abuse in credit card solicitation and sales must be in any balanced bill. The credit card industry now has more than 3.5 billion solicitations a year. That is more than 41 mailings for every American household, 14 for every man, woman, and child in the Nation. 
   We recognize it is out of control and in some cases irresponsible. The bill addresses the problem. Vetoing the bill accomplishes nothing. Voting against the bill means voting against consumer protections that otherwise will never be in the law. This is the chance to do something about credit card abuse. Opposing the bill and vetoing the bill means we do nothing about credit card abuse. 
   The problem is substantial because it is not the sheer volume of solicitations, it is also who is targeted. High school and college student solicitations are at record levels. Since the decade began, Americans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their uses of credit. The result is not surprising. Mr. President, 27 percent of families earning less than $10,000 a year have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of their income. 
   I in no way advocate that less credit should be made available to low-income and moderate-income consumers, but rather that consumers be given more complete information so they can better understand and manage their debts. That is what this bill does. The bill contains provisions, which I authored with the help of Senators SCHUMER, REED, and DURBIN, to ensure consumers have the information necessary to help them better understand and manage their debts. The bill now requires lenders to prominently disclose: First, the effects of making only the minimum payment on your account each month. That is not in the current law. It will be in the law if this bill becomes law. Next, that interest on loans secured by dwellings is tax deductible only to the value of the property. That is not in current law. It will be if this bill is signed. Also, when late fees will be imposed, and the date on which introductory or teaser rates will expire and what the permanent rate will be after that time. 
   In addition, the bill prohibits the cancelling of an account because the consumer pays the balance in full each month and thus avoids incurring a finance charge.  
   Indeed, there is one other issue we will also hear discussed on the floor--the question of debtors who seek to discharge the judgments they owe because of their violence against abortion clinics. This is the final issue. And for many Members of the Senate it may be the central issue in deciding whether or not to vote for this bill. It may be determinative of whether or not the President signs this bill. 
   Let me personally, therefore, begin a discussion of it by making clear that I support Senator SCHUMER in his efforts to have his amendment included in the bill. I voted for it. Given the opportunity, I will vote for it again. I believe it is a provision that is both necessary and appropriate. 
   But I also recognize the reality of the situation. The 
   Republican leadership is not going to include Senator SCHUMER's amendment in this bill. It is not going to happen. That leaves the Senate with a very real choice. The family businesses, the financial institutions, the family contracting companies that face bankruptcy every day because they cannot collect debts owed to them will be jeopardized. The consumer protection that was put in this bill for people who have problems with the credit card industry, who cannot manage their debts, who need more information, will be lost without this bill. Bankruptcy reform will simply not occur for yet another Congress. Indeed, if George W. Bush becomes President of the United States, our best chance at balanced, bipartisan bankruptcy legislation will be lost for 4 years. That is a high price to pay for Mr. SCHUMER's amendment on abortion clinics. 
   Since the bill only maintains the status quo, it may not improve the situation on abortion clinics but it does not worsen it either. We live to fight another day on that narrow issue, but we make all this progress on so many other issues. Enactment of this legislation will impact many people involved in so many parts of our economy. I urge my colleagues to think carefully about this bill. Overwhelmingly, you have voted for it before. It is now better than it was when you voted for it previously, and 84 Senators voted for it previously. I urge the President to think very carefully about vetoing this legislation for the most narrow of provisions. 
   The FACE legislation that was offered and adopted previously by this Congress did much to protect abortion rights. If it needs to be strengthened again, we can do so again. But to lose bankruptcy reform protections that I believe are contained in this bill for women and children, for small businesses, to lose the restraints on the credit industry and credit card solicitations--that is a high price to pay; to lose 4 years of work for this balanced bipartisan approach. 
   I urge adoption of the bill. I am proud to be its coauthor with Senator GRASSLEY, proud of the work we have done together. I urge its adoption and I urge its signature. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to offer the ``Greening the Government Act of 2000.'' This bill would allow the Federal Government to use its purchasing power to conserve natural resources, create markets for the materials that the American people recycle in their home and office recycling programs, and reduce the toxicity of products commonly used by establishing an infrastructure for coordinating and expanding Federal recycling and ``green'' purchasing activities. 
   The Federal Government spends $275 billion each year buying goods and services. With this immense purchasing power, and through its research, development and assistance programs, it can influence markets to create more environmentally friendly products. Indeed, I believe that the Federal Government should be a leader in demonstrating how organizations can meet their mission in a cost-effective and environmentally protective way. 
   Tomorrow, we will celebrate America Recycles Day. Millions of Americans will re-dedicate themselves to recycling and, more importantly, closing the recycling loop by buying recycled content products. Hundreds of American companies are also recognizing the importance and cost-effectiveness of ``greening'' their operations. For instance, in my State of New Jersey, Telecordia Technologies has saved more than $3 million by recycling 72 percent of its waste. Telecordia saves $4,000 per week by simply replacing disposable cafeteria trays with recycled content plastic trays. I believe that the Federal Government can also achieve similar savings by ``greening'' its operations and encouraging environmental innovation. Indeed, the Federal Government's purchasing decisions can tremendously affect the environment we leave to future generations. 
   Building on the progress made during the past seven years under President Clinton's Executive Order 13101, ``Greening the Government through Waste Prevention, Recycling, and Federal Acquisition,'' the Greening the Government Act of 2000 will establish a permanent infrastructure for coordinating, promoting, and expanding Federal recycling and ``green'' procurement activities. Under this legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will designate both recycled content products and environmentally  preferable products and services for Federal agencies to purchase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) will also create a list of biobased products for agencies to consider purchasing. Federal agencies will then incorporate procurement of these USDA and EPA-designated products and services into their acquisition processes. Finally, Federal research and development monies, technology transfer programs, and assistance programs will be expanded to facilitate the development of greener technologies. 
   In 1994, approximately 12 percent of the copier paper purchased by the Federal Government was recycled content paper, and that contained only ten percent postconsumer (recycled content) fiber. President Clinton increased the Federal postconsumer content standard to 30 percent. Today, 98 percent of the copier paper purchased from the Government Printing Office and General Services Administration contains 30 percent postconsumer fiber. The Greening the Government Act of 2000 raises the Federal content standard to 40 percent postconsumer fiber and, for the first time, requires agencies both to consider purchasing office papers bleached without chlorine and to purchase wood products made with sustainably grown wood. 
   We all know that it is not easy to buy ``green'' products. It is my intention that the ``Greening of the Government Act'' will encourage manufacturers to identify their products as ``green,'' making it easier for all Americans to buy these products. It is time that the Federal Government truly live up to the resource conservation goals first established by Congress in 1976 within the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and become a true role model in our nation's conservation efforts.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I applaud the Senate's passage of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000, WRDA, S. 2796. This legislation is critical to my State of New Jersey, which is so dependent upon its rivers, estuaries, and coasts for its livelihood. New Jersey relies on these unique resources as avenues for freight and business, recreational and harvest fishing, and a vibrant tourism industry. Indeed, it is imperative that these resources be kept environmentally and economically viable. 
   Along these lines, I am pleased that the Senate has agreed to pursue environmentally responsible alternatives for addressing flooding along the Passaic River. I originally introduced language to address this issue, which represents a new era in flood control, in 1998. S. 2796 authorizes the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to use up-to-date criteria in developing a new environmentally and economically responsible alternative. Such an alternative will take into account non-structural options, such as land buyouts and wetlands preservation. The bill also directs the Corps to study the possible acquisition of open space in the Highlands region of New Jersey as a way of reducing low-land flooding. 
   I also applaud the Senate's authorization of more than $1.7 billion to bring the channels of the New York and New Jersey Harbor to a depth of 50 feet. This authorization is based on the findings of the New York-New Jersey Harbor Navigation Study which was designed to evaluate the navigational needs of the Port of New York and New Jersey over the next 50 years. The results of the study have made clear the need for deepening the channels of Port Jersey, Kill Van Kull, Newark Bay, Arthur Kill, and Bay Ridge Channels to a depth of 50 feet. 
   While the region has relied on the maritime industry for over two hundred years, the port lacks the capacity to accommodate new deep draft shipping vessels. More than a decade ago, Congress authorized the deepening of these channels to 45 feet which has begun and is on track to be completed in the next few years. But this is only the beginning. In order to maintain the  165,000 jobs and $22 billion in annual economic activity port commerce generates, these channels must go to 50 feet. 
   Once clean materials from these deepening projects, and other projects from around the nation, have been dredged we should not neglect possible beneficial uses. Within WRDA, there is a $2 million annual authorization for the Corps to develop a program that will allow all eight of its regional offices to market eligible dredged material to public agencies and private entities for beneficial reuse. 
   I want to thank my colleagues, particularly Senators SMITH, BAUCUS, and VOINOVICH for their assistance and cooperation in developing this legislation. My colleagues have been remarkably helpful in this matter, having worked closely with me to ensure that the final bill incorporated language based on my legislation S. 2385, the Dredged Material Reuse Act, which I introduced earlier this year. They have understood the need, and I am grateful that they have agreed to include it in this legislation. 
   Beneficial reuse is a largely underutilized concept. As a result, unwanted dredged material is often dumped on the shorelines of local communities. Through a program of beneficial reuse the dredged material would be sold to construction companies and other developers who would be eager to have this material available. 
   Mr. President, the people of Southern New Jersey are all too familiar with this situation. Current plans by the Corps calls for more than 20 million cubic yards of unwanted material dredged from the Delaware River to be placed on prime waterfront property along the Southern New Jersey shoreline. However, with some effort and encouragement, the Corps has recently identified nearly 13 million cubic yards of that material for beneficial reuse in transportation and construction projects. 
   We should learn from beneficial reuse that contracting companies, land development companies, and major corporations want this material. This means we need to encourage the Corps to market dredged material for beneficial reuse up-front so that communities will not be confronted with the same problems faced by the citizens of Southern New Jersey. 
   The program created by this legislation will give the Army Corps the authority and the funding they require to begin actively marketing dredged material from projects all across the United States. It recognizes the need to keep our nation's rivers and channels efficient and available to maritime traffic while ensuring that communities are treated fairly. 
   Of equal, if not greater importance, to the small businesses and shore communities of New Jersey is the protection of our beaches. Recreational activity at our beaches is extremely important to NJ, supporting an annual tourist economy of $17 billion. 
   However, due to beach erosion, many of our shore communities have lost revenue on which they depend. This lost revenue affects the local tax base, property values, results in lost jobs and diminished quality of life in coastal regions. 
   Rebuilding and protecting our beaches is vital to the health of our economy. With 127 miles of shoreline and a booming tourist industry, simply watching the beaches erode is not an alternative. From commercial and recreational fishermen, to bait and tackle shops and restaurants, our shore communities depend on healthy coastlines. 
   With this in mind, I applaud the Senate for authorizing in WRDA several Corps projects to protect and re-nourish New Jersey beaches. 
   One project authorizes the Corps to re-nourish beaches along the entire stretch of Long Beach Island, from Barnegat Inlet to Little Egg Inlet, in Ocean County, New Jersey. This $51.2 million project authorizes the Corps to create dunes and beaches along the coastline municipalities of Long Beach Island, including: Harvey Cedars, Surf City, Ship Bottom, Beach Haven and Long Beach Township. 
   Another project for shore protection authorizes the Corps, at a total cost of $30 million, to re-nourish beaches on the 1.8 mile stretch in Port Monmouth along the Raritan Bay and Sandy Hook Bay Shoreline, by constructing floodwalls, levees, dunes, dune grass, dune fencing, dune walk-overs, and suitable beachfill. 
   Finally, I commend the Senate for including language I supported that would direct the Secretary of the Army to develop and implement procedures to give recreational benefits the same budgetary priority as storm damage reduction and environmental protection in cost-benefit analysis for Corps beach replenishment projects. Currently, the Corps is not required to list recreation benefits in its cost-benefit analysis of beach projects. This language is similar to legislation I introduced earlier this year, and I am pleased that this initiative has been passed in the Senate's WRDA Conference Report. 
   Prior to the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Corps viewed recreation as an equally important component of its cost-benefit analysis. However, the 1986 bill omitted recreation as a benefit to be considered, and New Jersey coastal communities have suffered. 
   It is imperative that federal policy base beach nourishment assistance on the entirety of the economic benefits it provides. Beach replenishment efforts ensure that our beaches are protected, property is not damaged, dunes are not washed away, and the resources that coastal towns rely on for their lifeblood are preserved. 
   Mr. President, it is for these reasons that I support the passage of WRDA. New Jersey relies on its unique water resources and this legislation will go a long way towards maintaining our economic and environmental health.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today regarding a matter of great importance to the entire State of New Jersey. My home state is confronted with an array of complex challenges related to the environment and economic development. However, one issue in particular, the over development of land and stormwater management, has become especially concerning because of the impact it is having on our watersheds and floodplains. 
   As you may know, this past August vast parts of northern New Jersey were devastated by flooding caused by severe rainfall. The resulting natural disaster threatened countless homes, bridges and roads, not to mention the health, safety and welfare of area residents. The total figure for damages in Sussex and Morris Counties alone has been estimated at over $50 million, and area residents are still fighting to restore some degree of normalcy to their lives. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, in just those two counties, 34 dams were damaged, 6 bridges were damaged and 4 were destroyed, and 10 municipal buildings were damaged. 
   While the threat of future floods continues to plague the region, one New Jersey institution is taking concrete steps to prevent another flooding catastrophe. The New Jersey Institute of Technology, NJIT, has been studying the challenges posed by flooding and stormwater flows for some time, and is ready to create a multi-agency federal partnership to continue this important research. 
   NJIT is one of New Jersey's premier research institutions and is uniquely equipped to carry out this critical stormwater research. The university has a long and distinguished tradition of responding to difficult public-policy challenges such as environmental emissions standards, aircraft noise, traffic congestion and alternative energy. More broadly, NJIT has demonstrated an institutional ability to direct its intellectual resources to the examination of problems beyond academia, and its commitment to research allows it to serve as a resource for unbiased technological information and analysis. Indeed, I originally requested that NJIT be given the funds to take on this Stormwater flood control and management project. 
   Despite that, the 2000 Water Resources Development Act, WRDA, still presents an excellent opportunity for NJIT to partner with the federal government and solve the difficult problem of flood control. At my request, and in close coordination with my House colleagues from the state delegation, the final version of this important legislation includes a provision directing the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to develop and implement a stormwater flood control project in New Jersey and report back to Congress within three years on its progress. While the Corps of Engineers is familiar with this problem at the national level, it does not have the firsthand knowledge and experience in New Jersey that NJIT has accrued in its 119 years of service to New Jersey. Including NJIT's expertise and experience in this research effort is a logical step and would greatly benefit the Army Corps, as well as significantly improve the project's chances of success. 
   Therefore, I urge the New York District of the Corps of Engineers to work closely with my office and NJIT to ensure the universities full participation in this study. By working together, we can create a nexus between the considerable flood control expertise of the Army Corps and NJIT, and finally solve this difficult problem for the people of New Jersey. I hope my colleagues will support my efforts in this regard.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for the last 4 years, my colleague, Senator GRASSLEY, has shown extraordinary patience and considerable leadership in bringing this institution towards fundamental and fair reform of the bankruptcy laws. It has not always been a popular fight, but it is unquestionably the right 
   thing to do for consumers, for business, and perhaps most importantly, for small businesses, family-owned businesses, that are often victimized by abusers. 
   Everyone, I think, generally agrees, within reason, that there is a need for bankruptcy reform. The question, of course, has been how to do that. In the last Congress, we came extremely close to bipartisan reform. Having come so close in the 105th Congress, I inherited the role as the ranking member of the subcommittee with jurisdiction, and I felt some optimism that we could succeed. 
   Since that time, working with Senator GRASSLEY, I think we have dealt with most of the critical issues. He has been extremely cooperative. Indeed, Members on both sides of the aisle have had suggestions, changes, most of which have been incorporated. Overwhelmingly, Senators who had problems with the bill and individual changes have been accommodated in both parties. 
   So today we bring to the floor the culmination of 2 years of work, of refining something that had been worked on for the 2 years before that--4 years--with many Members of the institution, and overwhelmingly Members who have voted for it. 
   Is it perfect? No. Were I writing bankruptcy reform by myself, there would be differences. But none of us writes any bill by ourselves. 
   The critical question is: Is it fair and is it a balanced bill? Unequivocally, the answer to that question is yes. 
   Will it improve the functioning of the bankruptcy system without doing injury to vulnerable Americans who have need, legitimate need, of bankruptcy protections? Absolutely, yes. 
   For those reasons, this bill deserves and, indeed, clearly has overwhelming bipartisan support in the Senate. 
   What has fueled this broad and deep support among Democrats and Republicans in the House and the Senate have been the facts, an overwhelming misuse and expansion of bankruptcy. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection, a 20-percent increase since 1996, during the greatest economic expansion in American history, with record employment, job growth, income growth, a 20-percent increase in bankruptcies, more staggering, since 1980, a 350-percent increase in the use of bankruptcy laws. 
   It is estimated that 70 percent of those filings were done in chapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Conversely, just 30 percent of those petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a repayment plan. 
   The result of these abuses of the system has meant that just 30 percent of petitions under chapter 13 require a repayment plan. Overwhelmingly, people have discovered, contrary to the history of the act and good business practices, they can escape paying back these debts, although they have the means to do so, and escape so by simply filing under a different chapter. 
   This is the essence of the bill. Simply making this adjustment, moving many or some of these 182,000 people back into repayment plans, could save $4 billion to creditors. This isn't somebody else's problem. That $4 billion gets paid. If the bankruptcy affects a carpenter, a family owned masonry business, a home building company, it can put them out of business, or the cost gets passed on to someone else who buys the next house. If it is the mom and pop store on main street, it can put them out of business or they absorb the cost. But even if it is a major financial institution, with many credit card companies losing 4 or 5 percent of revenues to bankruptcy, it gets passed on to the next consumer. 
   This $4 billion is not the problem for some massive company faraway that can afford to absorb it. It is us. We are all paying the bill. The American consumer is absorbing this money from the abuse of the bankruptcy system--often those least able to absorb it, small businesses, family owned businesses, and consumers. 
   This is why, with these compelling facts and the logic of this reasoning, that the Senate passed a very similar bill by a vote of 83-14 from both parties, across philosophical lines, in an overwhelming vote. That is the bill we bring back today. 
   It is charged by critics of the bill that this will deny poor people the protection of the Bankruptcy Act. One, this is not true. Two, if in any way it denied poor people the protection of bankruptcy, not only would I not speak for it, not only would I not vote for it, I would be here fighting against it. The simple truth is, no American is denied access to bankruptcy under this bill. 
   What the legislation does do is assure that those with the ability to repay a portion of their debts do so by establishing a clear and reasonable criteria to determine repayment obligations. However, it also provides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in need of debt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh start. That bears repeating. No one is denied bankruptcy protection because, ultimately, of judicial discretion. Prove you need the protection, and you can and will get it. 
   To do this, the bill contains a means test, virtually identical to the one passed by the Senate with 84 votes on a previous occasion. Under current law, virtually anyone who files for complete debt relief under chapter 7 receives it. Regardless of your resources, whether you can repay it or not, your obligation simply gets passed along to the small store owner, the mom and pop store, the family business. You pass on your obligation, regardless of your ability. We changed that by creating a needs-based system which establishes a presumption that chapter 7 filings should either be dismissed or converted to chapter 13 when the debtor has sufficient income to repay at least $10,000 or 25 percent of their debt--a presumption that if you have money in the bank or you have income to repay a portion of this, you should do so. You can answer the presumption. You can overcome it. You can 
   defeat it. But surely it is not unreasonable for someone with those means to have that burden, to prove they cannot pay the debt. 
   In addition to this flexible means test, the bill before us also includes two key protections for low-income debtors that were a vital part of the Senate bill previously passed. The first is an amendment offered by Senator SCHUMER to protect low-income debtors from coercive motions. This will ensure that creditors cannot strong arm poor debtors into making promises of payments they cannot afford to make. Senator SCHUMER asked for it to be in the bill. It is in the bill. It offers protection from unscrupulous, unfair, and burdensome collections. 
   The second is an amendment offered by Senator DURBIN. Senator Durbin, who previously held my position and drafted the bill 2 years ago in its initial form, provided a miniscreen to reduce the burden of the means test on debtors between 100 and 150 percent median income. This is a preliminarily less intrusive look at the debts and expenses of middle-income debtors to weed out those with no ability to repay those debts and to move them more quickly to a fresh start. 
   It was a good addition, but the combination of Mr. SCHUMER's amendment  for a safe harbor in addition to the Durbin miniscreen and other provisions, not a part of the original Senate bill, will provide real protections to low-income debtors. These include, first, a safe harbor to ensure that all debtors earning less than the State median income will have access to chapter 7 without qualifications; two, a floor to the means test to guarantee that debtors unable to repay less than $6,000 of their debts will not be moved into chapter 13; three, additional flexibility in the means test to take into account the debtor's administrative expenses and allow additional moneys for food and clothing expenses--three 
   protections--absolute, providing real protection for low-income families on vital necessities, on modest savings, and on means of collection. 
   All of this should assuage any fear that this bill will make it more difficult for those in dire straits to obtain a fresh start and reorganize their lives. Absolutely no one, because of these protections, will be denied access to complete protection in bankruptcy. But it is balanced because there is also protection for businesses and family companies. 
   Critics have also argued that the bill places an unfair burden on women and single-parent families. This is the most important part of this bill to understand. There is not a woman in this country, there is not a single parent, there is not someone receiving alimony, child support, or any child in America whose position is weakened because of this bill. Indeed, their position is strengthened because of this bill. Single-parent families, by elevating child support to the first position rather than its current seventh position, are in a better place because of this bill than they are if we fail to act. 
   Under current law, when it comes to prioritizing which debts must be paid off first, child support is seventh--after rent or storage charges, accountant fees, and tax claims. Remember this, because if you oppose this bill and if we fail to act in the bankruptcy line, accountants will be there, tax claims will be there, storage claims will be there, and women and children will be behind. Under this bill and this reform, children, women, single-parent families are where they belong--in front of everyone, including the Government. 
   Finally, the bill requires that a chapter 13 plan provide for full payment of all child support payments that become due after the petition is filed. This is simply a better bill--for business and for families. 
   Finally, in drafting a balanced bill, Senator GRASSLEY and I were confronted with the very real need to provide some additional consumer protection. The fact is, many people don't just fall into bankruptcy. In my judgment, they are driven into bankruptcy by unscrupulous, unnecessary, and burdensome solicitations of debt by the credit industry. This had to be in the bill, and it is in the bill. 
   The credit card industry sends out 3.5 billion solicitations a year. That is more than 41 mailings for every American household--14 for every man, woman, and child in the Nation. It is not just the sheer volume of the solicitations; it is a question of who is targeted. Solicitations of high school and college students are at a record level. Americans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their use of credit. 
   The result is not surprising, as 27 percent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt of more than 40 percent of their income. This bill deals with that reality. 
   With the help of Senators SCHUMER, REED, and DURBIN, we have ensured that there is good consumer protection in this bill. It is not everything I would have written, certainly not everything they would have liked, but it is good and it is better than current law. 
   The bill now requires lenders to prominently disclose the effects of making only a minimum payment on your account; that interest on loans secured by dwellings is tax deductible only up to the value of property, warnings when late fees will be 
   imposed, and the date on which an introductory or teaser rate will expire and what the permanent rate will be after that time. All of these things will be required on consumer statements in the future. Few are required now. 
   What this means is that Senator GRASSLEY and I have done our best. We have worked with all Members of the Senate in both parties. This is a good bill and a balanced bill. The Senate has approved it before. It should do so again. It provides new consumer protection, protection for women and children, securing their place in bankruptcy lines, ensuring that debts get repaid when they can be, ensuring bankruptcy protection, and ensuring that abuses end so that small businesses are not victimized and consumers who can pay their bills do not pay the additional costs of those who choose not to. 
   I congratulate Senator GRASSLEY once again on an extraordinary effort. I am very proud to coauthor this bill with him. I look forward to the Senate's passage. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to salute the charitable efforts of Project Acorn, a non-profit organization that works to place and fund children in two-year preschool scholarship programs. What started out as Stuart and Jill Lasser's individual act of kindness has become an expanded effort throughout Morris County and now across New Jersey to help families who cannot afford quality preschool education. The couple's lofty objectives and hard work enabled the organization to flourish over the past five years through partnerships with benefactors, volunteers, and area preschools.  
   Education has been, and continues to be, the cornerstone of opportunity and advancement in American society. Preschool education provides the foundation and many of the basic tools that children need to succeed. Study after study has shown a direct correlation between high-quality early childhood education and success in life. All of these studies on the effects of preschool education have shown higher short-term and long-term gains such as higher I.Q. scores and a greater likelihood of graduating from high school and college. 
   Project Acorn has provided hundreds of families with the critical resources necessary to place their children in a variety of preschool programs. These scholarships defray the costs of preschool education and thereby ``plant the seeds for a better community, one child at a time.'' 
   Project Acorn has helped many young individuals in Morris County. It serves as an excellent example of what can be accomplished by concerned citizens who have identified an urgent need within their community, and it is an honor to recognize their vision and compassion.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator is making an important point, but I would like him to supplement it because I, too, have been startled in hearing Governor Bush explain they had their chance to enact a Patients' Bill of Rights. Indeed, it is my memory that on more occasions than I can remember the Clinton-Gore administration, with support of Democrats in this House, attempted to have a Patients' Bill of Rights. 
   I heard Governor Bush say on prescription drugs that we promised it and had not delivered it; we had our chance. Indeed, the Clinton-Gore administration supported prescription drugs and Democrats supported it in the Congress but failed. 
   Is my recollection of this correct, that we had our chance, we have attempted to do it but, ironically, the people who have stopped it are now the same people who constitute the Bush campaign?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator will yield, can we focus on that one as well because I heard in debates Governor Bush said on education Clinton-Gore had their chance. Indeed, the President proposed 100,000 new teachers repeatedly and has been fighting for it every year--got it enacted at one point--including right up to tonight on school reconstruction, which has not been supported, to my knowledge, by Governor Bush, certainly not supported by his party in Congress. So indeed they had their chance on education, and the Clinton-Gore administration led on education as they led on health care.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I hope my friend from West Virginia knows that had I had the time, I would have been happy to yield to him. I did not have it. 
   I rise in opposition to the conference report and, unlike some of my colleagues, I am not citing broad policy reasons or enormous constituencies, but for a fight I have waged for almost 3 years, and that is for 17,000 Americans who are going to die, are certain to die, will be dead within a matter of 2 years. They are ALS patients. They have Lou Gehrig's disease, and they are the victims of an unintended consequence. 
   Under Medicare rules, there is a 24-month waiting period from the time of diagnosis. Uniquely, with Lou Gehrig's disease, diagnosis is difficult. Sometimes there is only a simple muscle pain for up to a year, and then at the time of diagnosis, life expectancy is only 2 to 3 years. So people facing the certainty of death and medical bills of $200,000 a year are unable to get a dollar, a dime, a penny of Medicare assistance while they are losing their lives. 
   This was no one's intention. It is a mistake. It is an error, and it should be changed. 
   Earlier in the year, this Senate unanimously adopted my legislation to exempt ALS patients from Medicare's regulations. 
   Twenty-eight Senators have cosponsored the bill. 
   Yet in this conference report, despite strong support from the White House and this Senate on a bipartisan basis, the conference report eliminates the provision and asks for a study--a study. 
   The Congressional Research Office has already done a study. I will tell you the study. When I introduced this bill, I stood with ALS patients outside the Capitol. Almost every one of them is now dead. They lost their lives waiting for Medicare, and they never got it. 
   I will tell you the results of the study. There are now 17,000 people in the country who need this same 24-month exemption. If we return here next year to argue this again, half of them will be dead, and they never will have received any Medicare assistance. 
   My request is very simple. And I ask the support of the Republican leadership, as I have received the support of my leadership and of the White House: Give us a 24-month exemption so that these desperate people can get this assistance and their families, in addition to losing someone they love--a parent, a husband, a spouse--also do not have to deal with this enormous financial responsibility. 
   It is a small and unique class of citizens. There is virtually no other disease in the Nation with quite the same circumstances--for which there is no cure, little treatment, and a certainty of death within the 24-month period. 
   There are desperate people across this country who thought when the Senate acted earlier in the year, they would at least have this relief. I believe they had reason to believe, given the bipartisan support, and White House support, when the conference report was written, this would happen. Tragically, the conference report does not contain this relief. I cannot imagine anything more cruel to these families. 
   This has to happen. This simply must be done. I ask, again, that if this conference report does not become law, and it is changed again, that these victims of ALS have this numerically and financially insignificant but personally overwhelmingly important relief from the Medicare rules. 
   Mr. President, I thank the distinguished minority whip for the time and I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Ms. Deborah V.H. Cook and Ms. Patricia Buekema for their 25 years of service to the Glen Ridge School System. 
   For the past 25 years, these outstanding educators have taught many grade levels and a countless number of students have benefitted from their instruction. As members of the Glen Ridge community, Ms. Cook and Ms. Buekema have demonstrated an extraordinarily high level of commitment and selflessness to which we should all strive to achieve. 
   However, the impact of their service reaches far beyond the classroom. Both Ms. Cook and Ms. Buekema have dedicated themselves to creating a supportive and productive environment for the youth of Glen Ridge. They have helped to shape the minds and encourage the spirit of these young individuals during a crucial stage of development in their lives. 
   Ms. Cook's and Ms. Buekema's accomplishments, throughout their years of service, reflect only a small portion of the many contributions they have made to the people of Glen Ridge. Their efforts have touched the lives of their students as well as those throughout their community. 
   They are an example of the professionalism that we look for in our educators, and the type of citizens that we hope to find in our neighborhoods, which is why their dedication is to be recognized and commended.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I stand today to congratulate Berkeley College for being named the Woodbridge Metro Chamber of Commerce Corporate Citizen of the Year. Berkeley College has become a vital link in the Township of Woodbridge and throughout Middlesex County among students, business leaders, and government officials. Cooperation among all three elements has allowed them to form stronger relationships, institutions, and alliances throughout the community. 
   Berkeley College has fostered this collaborative spirit by hosting a number of informational forums such as the Education Foundation's Educator Institute, Tech Academy 2000, and other useful job training programs. Berkeley College has also sponsored a number of annual public service events like the Mayor's Fun Run, the Mayor's Holiday Stroll in the Park, and Making Strides in Breast Cancer. Most importantly, Berkeley offers a high quality business education to more than 600 students who receive valuable hands on knowledge of the current business culture through the College's association with various business and government leaders. 
   It is an honor to be able to recognize the achievements of Berkeley College.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Bernadette M. Sohler as the 2000 recipient of the Woodbridge Metro Chamber of Commerce Member of the Year for her exemplary service to the Chamber and the community at large. 
   Bernadette has served as a strong advocate and avid supporter of the Woodbridge Chamber since 1994. She served as its President from 1998-1999 and has volunteered for numerous committees including the Annual Chamber Golf Classic, Tour of Woodbrigde, Holiday Luncheon and Parade, Chairman's Award, and Staff Appreciation Day.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Elizabeth Jonasky of Woodcliff Lake, New Jersey on the momentous occasion of her 105th birthday. Mrs Jonasky will reach this wonderful milestone on November 5th of this year, and I feel it fitting that we acknowledge this special moment. 
   As I ponder all of the marvels and tragedies of our world that Elizabeth Jonasky has witnessed, I am reminded of the profound words of the Greek philosopher Plato, who once said, ``It gives me great pleasure to converse with the aged. They have been over the road that all of us must travel, and know where it is rough and difficult and where it is level and easy.'' 
   It is a honor to wish Mrs. Jonasky the best of happiness on her birthday. It is my sincere hope that we will be able to continue to learn about life's rough and easy spots from her for sometime to come.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, for nearly 200 years from the founding of our Republic, capital punishment has loomed as the ultimate punishment for the violation of our laws. This reflected a belief that such a severe penalty would serve as a deterrent to those who might think they can take an innocent life or bring injury to our people. 
   While this Nation has always believed that capital punishment is an appropriate penalty for those who commit the most heinous of crimes, our criminal justice system has also been based on the premise that it is better--and it has been part of American lore to suggest that it is better that ten guilty men go free than an innocent man ever be put behind bars or lose his life. 
   This is all the more true when what is at stake is not just putting a person in prison--an act that could be rectified or proven wrong--but the irretrievable taking of a human life. As long as there has been the American Republic, this has been a founding belief: Taking of a life, if it can deter a crime, but protecting a mistake of justice. 
   Throughout our history, concerns have been raised about the fair application of the death penalty for exactly this concern. 
   Almost 30 years ago, the Supreme Court, in Furham v. Georgia, effectively abolished the death penalty when it decided that death penalty statutes at the time did too little to ensure the equal application of the law. In doing so, the Court held that the death penalty, while itself not necessarily unconstitutional, was often  being applied in a manner that was both arbitrary and too severe for the crime committed. As such, it constituted, as the death penalty was then applied, that it 
   was a ``cruel and unusual'' punishment under the Constitution. 
   Just 4 years later, in 1976, the Court, in its Gregg decision, reinstated the death penalty when it ruled that the newly enacted statutes in Florida, Texas, and Georgia were constitutional. By providing guidelines to assist the judge and the jury in deciding whether to impose death, those statutes addressed the arbitrariness that had previously colored capital sentencing. 
   It was at this point in my life that I reached my own decision. I agreed with the Court in what had become the tenets of American history that the death penalty was fair and appropriate as a deterrent to crime; it was just when the application of the American Constitution, as the Court had held, where it was arbitrary, where there were not guidelines, where there was not a safety to protect the innocent or arbitrariness of penalty, it was unconstitutional. 
   As the Court had found by 1976, I believed that with the right guidelines, a second jury, oversight, appeal, fair representation, the death penalty was right and it was appropriate. 
   In the nearly 25 years since I reached my own judgment, and indeed as our country reached its decision, 666 people have been executed across the Nation. 
   I rise today to bring attention to the point that in those 25 years, more than 80 people on death row have been found to be innocent and released. Some were hours, minutes, weeks away from their own execution. 
   These were not reversals on technical grounds. For the people whose convictions were overturned, after years of confinement, years on death row, it was discovered they simply were not guilty of a crime for which they had been convicted. 
   The Death Penalty Information Center reports that between 1973 and October 1993 there were an average of 2.5 convicted persons released per year. Since the advent of DNA testing, the number has increased to 4.8 people per year. For any American, particularly someone such as myself who supports the death penalty, believes in the fairness of the death penalty, one can only imagine the responsibility individually and collectively we must feel. 
   The question is begged; If this has happened since DNA testing, 4.8 people released from jail on death row, my God, what has happened in recent decades? How many people were strapped to gurneys, had their wrists attached to leather strips in electric chairs, knowing in their own minds that they were innocent but executed? My God, what must they have thought of our society, justice, and our people? 
   There are now 3,600 people on State and Federal death rows. 
   Despite my own support of the death penalty and our society's general belief in it, we must face the reality that those 3,600 people some may be innocent. The events of recent months give little comfort to any of us who support the death penalty. 
   Two weeks ago, the Governor of Virginia was forced to pardon a mentally retarded man who spent 9 1/2 years on death row for rape and murder after DNA tests proved he was innocent--9 1/2 years awaiting death. 
   An inmate in Texas served 12 years on death row for the killing of a police officer before a film maker stumbled across his case and discovered evidence that established his innocence. An Illinois inmate was released just 50 hours before his scheduled execution because a student's journalism class at Northwestern University accepted his case as a class project and established with certainty his innocence--50 hours before his death. 
   The evidence, both academic and anecdotal, shows that the death penalty is not functioning as it must to ensure that innocent people not be put to death. 
   What has happened to the conviction of the Founding Fathers and Jefferson's admonition that it is better 10 guilty men go free than an innocent man go to jail? It has not been ``an innocent man go to jail,'' but the evidence is overwhelming that some innocent men are going to death. 
   It is not an easy issue. I am not here to ascribe the responsibility to others. I bear it, too. Through all my public life I have supported the death penalty, and I do not abandon it today. I believe it can be fair; I believe it can be just; and I believe it deters crime. I believe it is appropriate that society take the lives of those who would take the lives of others. But something is wrong. 
   The fact is that sometimes these people committed other crimes, and most of the people who commit these crimes who are put to death are guilty. None of those things matter. It doesn't matter if it is only 1 in 100. It doesn't matter if it is 1 in 1,000. As a just and fair society, no one can feel right about the fact that obviously without question some innocent people may be put to death or, if not put to death, are spending years of their lives on death row for crimes they did not commit. 
   Nowhere is this problem more evident than the State of Texas. I do not say that because its Governor is a Presidential candidate or because of the other party. I don't care. It has no relevance to me. I ascribe nothing to George W. Bush. I am simply discussing the facts in the State for which this problem appears to be most prevalent. 
   Since 1982, Texas has executed 231 people--and, in fairness, under both Republican and Democrat Governors, to take away any partisan motive. 
   This year alone, 33 people have been put to death in Texas. Another 446 are on death row. 
   Because of the frequency of executions in Texas, that State offers us the best window through which to examine some of these concerns because in doing so, it quickly becomes clear that if the death penalty in Texas is representative of the rest of the Nation, we have a real problem. 
   In a massive study of 131 executions in the State of Texas, it is documented that there were widespread and systematic flaws in trials and in the appeals process. 
   In a third of the Texas death penalty cases, the defendant was represented by an attorney who had already been disbarred. 
   How in God's name is it possible in a just and fair society to take a man's life or a woman's life in an American court of justice if that poor person, who is probably inevitably indigent, is represented by an attorney who has been proven to be incapable and is disbarred before the courts of the United States? 
   My God, what kind of people have we become? Are we so interested in revenge, execution, and punishment of a man or woman that we would not give them a competent attorney? Several of these attorneys have themselves been convicted of felonies. Others have been jailed on contempt charges for sheer incompetence in the performance of their duties. 
   The Supreme Court has held--and the Founding Fathers must have believed--that any man or woman who shares our citizenship has a right to counsel before the courts and a defense before the Government with their own attorney. 
   Is this the standard they held? Is this the standard that every American would have for themselves--the right to an attorney who was disbarred, jailed, held in contempt, or found incompetent? Is this the barrier between an accusation against an American citizen and their execution? 
   In one-third of the death penalty cases in the State of Texas, defense counsel presented no evidence or presented only one witness during the sentencing phase. 
   When I made my decision in my life as our country made its judgment to support the death penalty, it was based on the Supreme Court requirement that there be a sentencing phase in the death penalty and a separate jury dealing just with the penalty of death. 
   I think that is right. I think that is fair. That is why I support the death penalty. 
   But now we find in the State of Texas that when that separate jury heard the case, these attorneys for these indigent men and women facing death presented no witnesses--or just one. 
   This cannot possibly be what the Supreme Court envisioned for the protection of our citizens from execution. 
   At least 23 cases featured notoriously unreliable ``hair comparisons''--visual matching of the defendant's hair to that found at the crime scene. 
   This is unbelievable, but I am giving you the facts about this study of Texas cases.  
   One hair ``expert'' in a capital case with a man facing death was temporarily released from a psychiatric ward to testify. Another ``expert'' in a hair identification case pleaded no contest to multiple charges of falsifying and manufacturing evidence. There is the lone witness in a case that decides whether or not a man would be executed. 
   Since 1995, the highest criminal appeals court of the State of Texas has affirmed 270 capital convictions, including some where the defendants' lawyers were asleep during trial. But in those 270 cases, new trials were granted on only 8 occasions. 
   I do not think that I am suggesting to the Senate today an unreasonably high standard. But is it not appropriate at a minimum that in any case where a man or a woman is facing execution and the State is taking their lives, regardless of the evidence, that defense counsel should be awake during the trial? Where the evidence clearly establishes that the trial attorney is asleep, as a matter of simple justice, without contradiction, a new trial should be granted--at least on the penalty of death, if not of guilt or innocence. 
   This same court of appeals upheld the conviction and sentencing of a Hispanic man who was sentenced to death after a psychiatrist testified that he was more likely to commit future acts of violence because of his ethnicity. A psychiatrist argues before a court in the United States of America that a man is more likely to commit a crime because of his ethnic origin, and a court in the United States of America hears this evidence without reversal. It is unimaginable.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Charles E. Thomas, pastor of New Hope Baptist Church upon the occasion of his retirement. During his time in the ministry, Pastor Thomas has shown a great commitment to both church and community. 
   Under Pastor Thomas's leadership and guidance, The New Hope Baptist Church has accomplished a great deal and continues to grow. The New Hope Day Care Center has been established and the edifice of New Hope has been renovated and expanded, creating a beautiful church with seating for over 1,200. Further, numerous programs have been implemented to enhance the lives of The New Hope members. 
   Pastor Thomas has also contributed much to the Newark community. He established the Minority Contractors and Craftsmans Trade Association and the New Hope Skills Center to enable individuals to pursue careers in carpentry, masonry, and machinery. In 1975, the New Hope Development Corporation was organized to build New Hope Village, a 170 family housing complex in Newark that provides affordable housing for lower income families. 
   For over 20 years, Pastor Thomas has dedicated himself to both his congregation and his community. His efforts have benefitted the lives of countless individuals, and he is richly deserving of our thanks and well wishes for his retirement.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the retirement of Dr. Orlando Edreira. Dr. Edreira's hard work and dedication as a Councilman in Elizabeth, New Jersey has had a lasting impact on communities throughout Union County and the State of New Jersey. 
   For more than four decades, Councilman Edreira has been contributing to the future of our children and the improvement of our communities as both an educator and a civil servant. He has contributed to hundreds of community projects and has been a member of numerous professional and community-based organizations in New Jersey. Councilman Edreira has also been a well-recognized and respected advocate for the Latino community of New Jersey throughout his career. 
   I salute Councilman Edreira's leadership in Elizabeth, which during his service has enjoyed a remarkable economic renaissance as new jobs and economic development have brought new life to one of New Jersey's historic cities. He is to be thanked for helping to sow these seeds of revitalization in the community. Councilman Edreira's retirement from the Elizabeth City Council is a true loss for both the City of Elizabeth and the entire State of New Jersey. After a career marked by many accomplishments, I am pleased today to highlight his remarkable record of service on the occasion of his retirement. While we are losing one of our State's finest and most valuable leaders, we can take pride in the countless contributions that Councilman Edreira has made to one of New Jersey's most important communities.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month. As one of America's largest ethnic groups, the Hispanic American community embodies the true spirit of our country as a land where people from all over the world can come to for the chance to pursue their dreams. 
   For countless years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role in American society. This has been characterized by a strong work ethic, deep sense of faith and unwavering commitment to both family and community. Throughout the history of our country, the contributions of Hispanic Americans in areas such as public service, business, entertainment, and the sciences have been lasting and have made America a stronger nation. 
   Today, there are more than 31 million Hispanic Americans living in the United States, and they represent nearly 12 percent of our total population. The Hispanic American community in New Jersey includes more than 1 million residents, with roots from all over the world, including Europe, the Carribean, and both South and Central America. 
   I am proud to have the opportunity to represent a State with one of the largest concentrations of Hispanic Americans in the entire country. The vibrant Hispanic American communities across the State have given New Jerseyans a window into their cultures and heritage. We have also been fortunate to have members of these communities take on important roles in our public life. In New Jersey, we have Hispanic Americans representing some of our nation's most diverse communities in both the State legislature and the United States Congress, and dozens more hold elected office at the county and local levels. 
   As we begin a new century, it is projected that nearly 25 percent of America will be of Hispanic origin by 2050. At the same time, the widespread influence of Hispanic Americans is touching all of our communities, transcending racial and ethnic boundaries on a daily basis. I have no doubt that as America's Hispanic American community grows, it will maintain the legacy that it has built while also adding a new chapter to its rich history as an important piece of the American mosaic.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Federal Drug Courts Foundation Act of 2000.'' This legislation will usher in an new era in the struggle against drug-related crime by establishing a system of federal drug courts. These courts will help bring an end to the cycle of repeated and escalating crimes committed by small-time drug offenders. As General Barry McCaffrey has said: ``The establishment of drug courts ..... constitutes one of the most monumental changes in social justice in this country since World War II.'' 
   Mr. President, I have long fought against the scourge of drug-related crime that has plagued this nation. The legislation I introduce today will continue that fight by creating a three-year pilot program establishing federal drug courts in ten cities selected by the Department of Justice. 
   Drug courts are a response to the fact that more than fifty percent of state parole violators were under the influence of drugs, alcohol, or both when they committed their new offense. They represent a creative new way to address this disturbing fact and are aimed at cleaning up first-time, small-time offenders through comprehensive supervision, drug testing and treatment. 
   Drug court programs have been successfully implemented at the state level. Since 1989, more than 100,000 drug offenders have participated in drug court programs at the state level and there are now more than 400 drug courts in existence. These drug courts have proven to be both effective and cost-efficient. A study in one New York drug court showed that only 11% of offenders were rearrested as compared to 27% in the general prison population. And while the incarceration of a drug offender costs between $20,000 and $50,000 annually, a drug court costs less than $2,500 per offender. 
   Drugs continue to be one of the greatest threats to our children and to the well-being of our communities. For this reason, we must continue to fight against the scourge of illegal drugs ravaging our communities. To that end, I am introducing the ``Federal Drug Courts Foundations Act of 2000,'' legislation designed to sensibly combat the epidemic of drug-related crime. I hope that this much-needed legislation will enjoy your support and I look forward to working with each and every one of you in order to get this legislation enacted into law.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the adoption of the conference report to H.R. 3244, the Sexual Trafficking Victims Protection Act. This conference report contains two pieces of legislation that are critically important for ensuring the safety of women and their children in our Nation as well as around the world, the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and the Sexual Trafficking Victims Protection Act. I am extraordinarily pleased that the Senate is finally poised to join our colleagues in the House and pass both of these legislative proposals. Although it is unfortunate that Congress allowed the Violence Against Women Act to expire at the end of the fiscal year on September 30, 2000, today's action on this legislation goes a long way towards sending a message to battered women and their children that domestic violence is a national concern deserving the most serious consideration. 
   An important component of the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act that is contained in the conference report today is the provision of resources for transitional housing. Due to the fact that domestic violence victims often have no safe place to go, these resources are needed to help support a continuum between emergency shelter and independent living. Many individuals and families fleeing domestic violence are forced to return to their abusers because of inadequate shelter or lack of money. Half of all homeless women and children are fleeing domestic violence. Even if battered women leave their abusers to go to a shelter, they often return home because the isolation from familiar surroundings, friends, and neighborhood resources makes them feel even more vulnerable. Shelters and transitional facilities are often located far from a victim's neighborhood. And, if emergency shelter is available, a supply of affordable housing and services are needed to keep women from having to return to a violent home. 
   Due to the importance of ensuring that battered women may access transitional housing, I remain concerned that the conference report provides only a one-year authorization for the transitional housing programs. Consequently, I intend to work closely with my colleagues throughout next year to ensure the continued authorization and funding of these critical programs. I look forward to working with my colleagues to strengthen transitional housing programs for battered women and their children and I hope they will lend their strong support to this effort.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, all of us in our public lives on occasion meet an individual under circumstances and remains with us. They are so powerful in their impact that they haunt us and, if we are true to our responsibilities, also lead us to involvement. It could be circumstances of a struggling family attempting to pay their bills. It could be someone in enormous physical or emotional distress. 
   I rise today because 3 years ago I met a young family from Burlington County, NJ, who had exactly this impact on me, my life, and my own service in the Senate. 
   Kevin O'Donnell was 31 years old, a devoted father who was skiing with his daughter one weekend, when he noticed a strange pain in his leg. It persisted, which led him to visit his family doctor. Here, he was shocked to learn, despite his apparent good health, the vibrancy of his own life and his young age, that he had been stricken with ALS, known to most Americans as Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   We are fortunate that ALS is a very rare disorder. It affects 30,000 individuals in our Nation, with an additional 5,000 new cases diagnosed every year. 
   We should be grateful it is so rare because the impact on an individual and their health and their family is devastating. Indeed, there are few diseases that equal the impact of ALS on an individual. 
   It is, of course, a neurological disorder that causes the progressive degeneration of the spinal cord and the brain. Muscle weakness, especially in the arms and legs, leads to confinement to a wheelchair. In time, breathing becomes impossible and a respirator is needed. Swallowing becomes impossible. Speech becomes nearly impossible. Muscle by muscle, legs to arms to chest to throat, all motor activity of the body shuts down. 
   While ALS usually strikes people who are over 50 years old, indeed, there are many cases of young people being afflicted with this disease. Once the disease strikes, life expectancy is 3 to 5 years. But the difficulty is, life expectancy is not measured from diagnosis; it is measured from the first symptoms. 
   Diagnosing ALS is very difficult. What can appear as a pain in the leg can be overlooked for months. Muscle disorders can be ignored for a year. Doctors have a difficult time diagnosing Lou Gehrig's disease. 
   Not surprisingly, after diagnosed, the financial burdens are enormous. Work is impossible. Twenty-four hour care is likely. Wheelchairs, respirators, nursing care can easily cost between $200,000, to a quarter of a million dollars a year. 
   Families struggle with this financial burden while they are also struggling with the certainty of death at a young age. 
   This leads me to the responsibilities of this institution. 
   Patients with ALS must wait 2 years before becoming eligible for Medicare. For 2 years--no help, no funds, no assistance. As a result, 17,000 ALS patients currently are ineligible for Medicare services. And thousands of these  individuals will die having never received one penny of Medicare assistance. Their death from ALS is a foregone conclusion. It could come in a year or 2 years or 3, but we are requiring a 2-year waiting period before there is any assistance. 
   Clearly, ALS, the problems of diagnosis, the certainty of death, the rapid deterioration of the human body, was not considered with this 2-year waiting period. 
   Nearly 3 years ago, I first introduced legislation that would eliminate the 24-month waiting period for ALS from Medicare. Most of the people who were with me that day here in the Senate when we introduced this legislation are now dead. Most of them never received any Medicare assistance. Only I remain, having been there that day offering this legislation again to bring help to these people. 
   But their agony and the burdens on their families have now been succeeded by thousands of others, who at the time probably had never heard of ALS disease, certainly did not know that Medicare, upon which their families had come to rely, would be out of reach to them in such a crisis. 
   The ALS Treatment and Assistance Act, since that day, has enjoyed bipartisan support, with 28 cosponsors in the Senate, 12 Republicans and 16 Democrats. In the House of Representatives, 280 Democrats and Republicans have cosponsored the legislation. 
   This spring, the Senate unanimously adopted this legislation as part of the marriage penalty tax bill, which, of course, did not become law. 
   Both Houses, both parties have responded to this terrible situation. 
   Two weeks ago, when Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator DASCHLE introduced S. 3077, the Balanced Budget Refinement Act of 2000, I was very proud that the ALS provision was included in their legislation. Last Wednesday, the ALS waiver was included in the balanced budget refinement legislation approved by the House Commerce Committee. So there is still hope. 
   As every Member of this institution knows, the calendar is 
   late. Regretfully, we are again at a time of year when the legislative process ceases to work as it is taught in textbooks across the country. There will not be an opportunity for me to advocate this legislation for ALS patients by offering an amendment on the Senate floor to the Medicare package developed by the Finance Committee. That option is simply not going to exist under the procedures and the calendar of the Senate. 
   I am, therefore, left with the following circumstances. Having lost many of those ALS patients, on whose behalf I originally began this effort, a new group of families are now helping me across the country. They, too, have a year or two remaining in their lives and need this help. 
   If I can succeed in getting this provision, with the support of my colleagues, in the balanced budget refinements that ultimately will be passed by this Senate, for those people before their deaths, there is still hope. If I fail, then these people, too, will expire before they get any assistance from the Government. 
   I do not know of an argument not to pass this legislation. I do not know of a point that any Senator in any party, at any time, could make, to argue on the merits, that these ALS patients should not get a waiver under Medicare, in the remaining months or years of their lives, to get some financial assistance. 
   The unanimous support of the Senate previously, I think, is testament to the fact that we are of one mind. I simply now would like to ask my colleagues, in these final days, knowing that there will be a Medicare balanced budget refinement bill, that this provision be included.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Sexual Assault Prosecution act of 2000. This legislation will ensure that no rapist will evade prosecution when there is reliable evidence of their guilt. 
   As the law is written today, a rapist can walk away scot-free if they are not charged within five years of committing their crime. This is true when if overwhelming evidence of the offender's guilt, such as a DNA match with evidence taken from the crime scene, is later discovered. Some states, including my home state of New Jersey, have recognized the injustice presented by this situation and have already abolished their statutes of limitations on sexual assault crimes, and many other states are considering similar measures. Given the power and precision of DNA evidence, it is now time that the federal government abolish the current statute of limitations on federal sexual assault crimes. 
   The precision with which DNA evidence can identify a criminal assailant  has increased dramatically over the past couple decades. Because of its exactness, DNA evidence is now routinely collected by law enforcement personnel in the course of investigating many crimes, including sexual assault crimes. The DNA profile of evidence collected at a sexual assault crime scene can be compared to the DNA profiles of convicted criminals, or the profile of a particular suspect, in order to determine who committed the crime. Moreover, because of the longevity of DNA evidence, it can be used to positively identify a rapist many years after the actual sexual assault. 
   The enormous advancements in DNA science have greatly expanded law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute sexual assault crimes. Unfortunately, the law has not kept pace with science. Given the precise accuracy and reliability of DNA testing, however, the legal and moral justifications for continuing to impose a statute of limitations on sexual assault crimes are extremely weak. To that end, I am introducing the ``Sexual Assault Prosecution Act of 2000'' which will eliminate the statute of limitations for sexual assault crimes. This legislation will not affect the burdens of proof and the government will still have to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt before any person could be convicted of a crime. 
   Currently, the statute of limitations for arson and financial institution crimes is 10 years and is 20 years for crimes involving the theft of major artwork. If it made sense to extend the traditional five-year limitations period for these offenses, surely it makes sense to do so for sexual assault crimes, particularly when DNA technology makes it possible to identify an offender many years after the commission of the crime. By eliminating this ticking clock, we can see to it that no victim of sexual assault is denied justice simply because the clock ran out. I look forward to working with each and every one of you in order to get this legislation enacted into law.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the truly gifted athletes of the state of New Jersey. It gives me great pleasure to extend my congratulations to Tom Wilkens on winning the bronze medal in the men's 2000 meter individual medley event at the XXVIIth Olympic Games in Sydney, Australia. 
   Despite having asthma and a severe allergy to chlorine, Tom Wilkens has consistently performed as a champion. At the 1999 Pan Pacific Championships, he won a medal of each color, gold in the 200 meter individual medley, silver in the 200 meter breaststroke, and bronze in the 400 meter individual medley. To this impressive collection, he adds a bronze from the Games of the XXVIIth Olympiad. 
   Tom Wilkens represents the best of New Jersey's athletes. His outstanding representation of New Jersey and the United States at these Olympic Games is a testament to the dedication that has afforded him success in the face of diversity. 
   Through his efforts, Tom Wilkens has been able to achieve athletic greatness. His commitment to excellence serves as an inspiration and it is an honor for me to be able to recognize his accomplishments.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to recognize William Hernandez for his efforts as president of the Hispanic State Parade of New Jersey. His work has done a great deal for Hispanic-Americans, and it is an honor to acknowledge him today. 
   As president of the Hispanic State Parade of New Jersey, Mr. Hernandez has been able to honor the accomplishments of many prominent Hispanic-Americans. For the last three years he has also served as the president of DesFile Hispanoacericano of New Jersey. During that time, he has worked to arrange the first international cultural and health fair, and create unity and cultural pride among Hispanic-Americans. 
   Mr. Hernandez is an extremely talented and energetic individual. His work on behalf of Hispanic-Americans has been truly beneficial, and I am confident he will continue to work tirelessly for all Americans of Hispanic decent as well as all of society.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Father Albert R. Cutie, to whom the 25th Hispanic-American Parade of New Jersey Annual Banquet is being dedicated. This tremendous honor is being bestowed upon an individual who is a true example of the possibilities that are available to all in our great nation. 
   Father Albert's parents were forced, like many others, to flee from Cuba to Spain due to the atheist-communist dictatorship that took over their homeland. Fortunately, his family was reunited a few years later in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and was able to emigrate to the United States when he was seven years old. Here he has been able to pursue a life that would not have been possible in communist Cuba. 
   Father Albert has always been a talented and industrious soul. From a young age, he showed vibrant entrepreneurial skills by turning his love for music into his own business. During his High School years his experience in parish youth groups and spiritual retreats began to foster his great love for the Church and its mission. Hearing his calling, Father Albert entered the Seminary in 1987 and was ordained on May 13, 1995. 
   Since his ordination, countless individuals have benefitted from Father Albert's love and guidance. Not only does he continue to reach out to individuals, families, the sick, and those in need, but he works diligently to give  the youth of our society a better future. 
   We are truly fortunate to have an individual such as Father Albert as a member of our society. I am confident that our future is much brighter thanks to the efforts of Father Albert and other young Americans like him.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of New Jersey's extremely talented and humble public servants, the Honorable Judge Julio Fuentes. This distinguished member of my State is being honored with the dedication of the 25th Hispanic-American Parade of New Jersey Annual Banquet in his name, and it  gives me great pleasure to recognize his accomplishments. 
   Judge Fuentes is a man of great intellect and a distinguished record of public service. He is constantly seeking to improve himself, as can be attested to by his pursuit of master's degrees in Latin American affairs and liberal arts during his time as a sitting judge. Those who have had the opportunity to work with Judge Fuentes universally praise his integrity as well as the depth and breadth of his knowledge of the law. 
   Through a great internal drive and determination, Judge Fuentes has risen from Newark Municipal Court Judge to his current post of judge for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Fuentes also has the distinction of being the first Hispanic-American to sit on this prestigious court, an honor he has truly earned. 
   Judge Fuentes is a good, honest, decent man. He is an exemplar of the coveted American ideal of public service. It was truly an honor to be able to recommend his nomination to President Clinton. We are truly fortunate to have someone of his immense capabilities and desire for public service sitting as a judge on the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in only a matter of 2 or 3 weeks, the Congress will adjourn--I trust having passed H-1B visas, but in all likelihood without passing a Patients' Bill of Rights, or, unfortunately, a prescription drug benefit, and probably without any real improvement in gun safety legislation. 
   While many of us will take comfort in helping American high-technology companies by providing H-1B visas, it is not even a mixed success. Worse, however, than most of these frustrations is the most unnecessary of all of these failures; that is, the failure to pass the Violence Against Women Act. 
   Five years ago, Senator BIDEN led this Congress in passing a Violence Against Women Act, which I believe became noncontroversial and which benefits have been widely accepted. It makes it all the more difficult to understand that this $1.6 billion package is languishing and will expire. 
   Under this legislation, we have trained thousands of police officers to make them sensitive to the problems of family violence and abuse. Judges and counselors have received training in sensitivity. We have increased the means of reporting domestic violence. So our records are accurate. We know the extent of the problem and how to respond. 
   Most importantly, we have provided real services, medical services, for a woman or a family who is abused; a place to go to get counselling from someone who understands domestic violence and how to deal with it; a place to take a child. 
   I think the most important of all is temporary housing. No American parent should have to choose between subjecting their child or themselves to violence, sexual abuse, or even a threat to life, and homelessness. 
   Thousands of American women face that every night. Do I take my child to the streets, to a temporary motel, unsafe shelter, no shelter at all, or do I stay in a home where the child can be abused, where my life can be threatened? 
   The Violence Against Women Act has created thousands of beds in temporary shelters across the country so women do not have to face that choice. It established an emergency hotline which continues to get 13,000 calls a month, half a million calls since its inception; where a desperate woman, not knowing her options, or how to protect her child, not knowing what to do, how to get medical help, how to get counseling, how to get a police officer who understands, can call and get someone on the other end of a phone and get help. 
   The greatest part of the Violence Against Women Act is that it is showing results. Since 1997, the programs created by the Violence Against Women Act have reduced the rate of partner violence against women by 21 percent. This is a dramatic decline in the amount of violence against women since the act came into being. There may be many reasons. 
   We are also seeing dramatic drops in murders. Fewer murders were committed by intimate partners in 1996, 1997, and 1998, than any year since 1976. The number of women raped has declined by 13 percent between 1994 and 1997. Members may cite many reasons why violence is down, rape rates are down, and most importantly, murder rates are down, but one of those reasons must be that police officers are better trained and are responding more promptly, judges are move sensitive to the crime, and most importantly, women who feel threatened in these circumstances have a choice, are getting out of residences and into shelters, into protected environments. 
   During a recent recess, I visited a number of the shelters across my State of New Jersey. The Women's Center in Monmouth County, NJ, is receiving $285,000 for counseling and shelter and emergency services. The Passaic County Women's Shelter in Paterson received $185,000 under the Violence Against Women Act for Spanish-speaking women to get help and advice. 
   If this act is not reauthorized, these shelters lose their Federal funding, potentially close their doors, with the unescapable conclusion that violence may rise as women lose choices. 
   We have come to recognize in these years, the criminal justice system has come to recognize, as well, that violence in the family, particularly in cities, is dangerous not only to the individuals in the family, but society, which is built upon a family unit. We decided not to ignore the problem. But that may be exactly what this Congress is doing. This legislation will lapse, this funding will end, and people will get hurt. Those are realities. They are not partisan comments. They don't represent a philosophy or ideology. They are cold, hard, facts because for all the progress we have made, family violence in this country remains an epidemic. One in three women continues to experience domestic violence in their lifetime. A woman is still raped every 5 minutes, and still there are no arrests in half of all the Nation's rape cases. 
   The risks of not acting are great: Lose the shelters, lose another generation of police officers or judges who are not properly trained, a phone call in the night that cannot be made, beds that will not be available. Is it worth the price, the cost of this inaction? 
   I am pleased we are voting on this H-1B visa today. I wish 
   we were doing many other things. Other things may be controversial, we may have our own ideas about them, but surely this could bring us together. It did once. In 1995, we acted together, without division. Are we less now than we were then--is the problem so much less in our minds? 
   I urge the leadership to bring the Violence Against Women Act to the floor and to do so now.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Madam President, I rise to address a provision included in WRDA that will help local communities in many parts of the nation deal with the burden they often face when the federal government undertake dredging projects in their region. 
   Before discussing the merits of this legislation, I want to first thank my colleagues, particularly Senators SMITH, BAUCUS, and VOINOVICH for their assistance and cooperation. My colleagues have been remarkably helpful in this matter, they have understood the need, and I am grateful that they have agreed to include it in the managers package. 
   Within WRDA there is a $2 million annual authorization to allow the U.S. Army Corp of engineers to develop a program that will allow all eight of its regional offices to market eligible dredged material to public agencies and private entities for beneficial reuse. 
   Beneficial reuse is a concept which has largely been largely underutilized. As a result, dredged material is often dumped on the shorelines of local communities to their disadvantage, instead of sold to construction companies and other developers who would be eager to have this material available. We have known about this strange and ironic, even tragic, situation for some time, yet until now, not enough has been done to bring relief to these communities. 
   The people of southern New Jersey are all too familiar with this situation. Current plans by the U.S. Army Corps call for more than 20 million cubic yards of material dredged from the Delaware River to be placed on prime waterfront property along the Southern New Jersey shoreline. However, with some effort and encouragement, the Army corps has recently identified nearly 13 million cubic yards of that material for beneficial reuse in transportation and construction projects that would have otherwise been simply placed in upland sites. 
   From this experience, which is also happening in port projects in other parts of the country, we should learn that contracting companies, land development companies, and major corporations want this material. This means we need to encourage the Army corps to be thinking about ways to beneficially reuse dredged material up-front so that communities will not be confronted with the same problems faced by the citizens of Southern New Jersey. 
   The program created by this legislation will give the Army Corps the authority and the funding they require to begin actively marketing dredged material from projects all across the United States. It recognizes the need to keep our nation's rivers and channels efficient and available to maritime traffic while ensuring that local communities are treated fairly. 
   I would again like to thank chairman SMITH, Ranking Member BAUCUS, and Senator VOINOVICH for their commitment and attention to this important issue.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize one of the truly dedicated public servants of the State of New Jersey. It gives me pleasure to extend my congratulations to Thomas Corcoran on receiving the Outstanding Citizen Award for 2000 from the Phillipsburg Area Chamber of Commerce. 
   Over the years, Mr. Corcoran has done a great deal for the betterment of Phillipsburg, New Jersey. He has fought for a better education for the children of the area through his efforts to promote a bond issue for the construction of new schools. He was appointed by former Governor Florio to serve as a commissioner on the Phillipsburg Housing Authority. Further, he has worked towards the revitalization of Phillipsburg's tourist industry by working with New Jersey State Legislators and other prominent individuals to promote Phillipsburg as the site of the New Jersey Railroad Museum. 
   Mr. Corcoran has always been there for the Town of Phillipsburg. Be it serving as town mayor and other public posts, or taking the time to serve as the public address announcer for Phillipsburg High School football games, Mr. Corcoran has been an exemplar of citizenship, town pride, and selflessness. 
   Through his efforts, Mr. Corcoran has shown the great dedication he holds for the town he calls home. Those efforts make it an honor for me to be able to stand with the Phillipsburg Area Chamber of Commerce and recognize an individual such as Mr. Corcoran.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I think it is important to remind the Senate of the issue before the body. It has been argued that China should be allowed into the World Trade Organization. That is not a question of this amendment. China is coming into the World Trade Organization under PNTR. 
   It has been argued that there should not be an interference in trade between China and the United States; it was argued strenuously by my friend and colleague from California. That is not before the Senate under this amendment. 
   It has been argued that the internal politics of China should not interfere with trade. That is not before the Senate. The Senate has defeated the measures on internal matters in China. It is going to support WTO and the PNTR. The issue before the Senate is narrowly defined. 
   Under Thompson-Torricelli, there is a single issue before this body: Whether repeated acts of violations of nonproliferation agreements by Chinese companies will give the President the authority, which he will have the right to waive, to interfere with Chinese access to American capital markets. That is the only issue before the Senate. 
   I recognize that we come to this institution with a variety of local interests. Some of us represent agriculture and some industry; some labor and some business; some in the West, some in the North; some in the South; some in the East; some rural; some suburban. We have one unifying common interest--the national security of the United States. Wherever we are from, whatever our priorities, whatever our philosophy, that single guiding responsibility unites us all. 
   I recognize there are economic interests in the country that are on different sides of the issue of PNTR. But on this single issue, the proliferation of dangerous weapons of mass destruction that are a threat to the life and the security of the United States of America, we can find common ground. 
   Indeed, as enthusiastic as any individual farmer in America may be to get access to Chinese markets, notwithstanding the fact that this amendment does not deal with agricultural exports, I would challenge any Member of this Senate to find an individual American farmer who, even if this amendment did threaten agricultural exports, would trade a single sale for the United States not being resolved in denying Chinese companies the ability to export missile or nuclear or biological technology that threatens the American people. 
   Find me a single high-tech executive, given the choice between an individual contract and the ability to restrict a single Chinese company from selling technology that threatens the United States of America, find me one who would not take a stand for this amendment. 
   Individual interests, I understand them. 
   My friend and coauthor of this amendment, Senator THOMPSON, stood on the floor reciting comments by the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, who threatened retribution against 
   Senators who support Thompson-Torricelli and cited the ``politics of nuclear proliferation.'' 
   What have we come to as an institution? The ``politics of nuclear proliferation''? I thought the issue of nonproliferation knew no politics, was supported by Democrats, Republicans, liberals and conservatives. We can all differ on some of the strategies of defending the United States. We may differ on the question of a missile shield defense. We may differ on how we allocate our national defense resources. But I thought the question of proliferation was the one uniting aspect of our foreign policy that knew no bounds--we are all united in the question that there are some governments that are so irresponsible, some nations that live so far out of the norms of accepted behavior, that they must be denied these weapons. 
   The evidence is unmistakable that the People's Republic of China, despite  20 years of commitments to accede to this policy of denying these rogue nations these technologies, continues to export this dangerous technology. The evidence is overwhelming. 
   The Director of Central Intelligence reported to this Congress, last month, that China has increased its missile-related assistance to Pakistan, continues to provide assistance to Iran, North Korea, Libya; that China has proliferated to Pakistan. 
   This Senate has debated what to spend and how to spend to defend ourselves against the possibility, by 2005, of nuclear-tipped missiles from North Korea. We have all lived in anguish with the destruction of American citizens by the terrorism in Libya and Iran. 
   Now before this Senate is the most modest of amendments--not an interference with trade; not a restriction on exports, though indeed that may be justifiable; not a sanction against the violations of workers' rights or human rights, though that may be arguable. We have not dared, in the most modest of positions, to ask, to request, to suggest any of those things. Just this: That the authority exists to deny companies in the People's Republic of China that consistently, regularly are found, by overwhelming evidence, to be proliferating dangerous technologies that threaten the United States of America, access to our capital markets. But, indeed, that would be too ambitious to ask, so we have given the President waiver authority to cancel that restriction and simply tell the Congress why he did so. 
   Is there a man or woman in the Senate who thinks this request is so ambitious, would so threaten the economic life of the United States, that we cannot ask this? I challenge my colleagues in the Senate, if you will not accept the evidence from the Director of Central Intelligence on this proliferation, if you will not cede the warning, accept the overwhelming evidence of this proliferation and the threat it constitutes to the United States of America, then have the intellectual honesty and courage to rise on the floor of this Senate to say the Central Intelligence Agency no longer provide this evidence. Because if you will not read it, you will not accept it, and you will not act upon a request that is this modest in scope, then have the intellectual honesty not to even receive it. 
   I say to my colleagues, it has been stated on this floor that the history of economic sanctions has been uniformly disappointing; that there is no evidence that they succeed. In the long history of economic sanctions, this would be the most modest. We interfere with no trade, restrict no product, restrict no market, only the raising of capital, and only then if the President does not exercise a waiver. 
   But even if this were a more ambitious amendment, do my colleagues in the Senate really want the record to reflect that we do not believe economic sanctions are ever justifiable or ever successful, particularly members of my party? 
   The birth of economic sanctions was from Woodrow Wilson, former Governor of my State, who believed they were the civilized alternative to avoiding armed conflict and war. They are not a perfect weapon, but they have avoided conflict. 
   Who here would rise and say that unilateral sanctions by European states against South Africa and apartheid was wrong, or against Rhodesia or against the Soviets after invading Czechoslovakia? Who here would argue that they were wrong against Cambodia after the death camps? Who would argue they were wrong against fascist Italy, against Abyssinia and Ethiopia? Who here would argue that Roosevelt was wrong in using them against the Nazis or the Japanese invasion of Manchuria or Wilson himself against unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic? For the entire 20th century, these sanctions have been used--not a perfect tool, not always successful, but always an alternative to conflict and in defense of the national security. 
   That issue is before the Senate again. Because while these may not be sanctions, because it may appear the Senate, given the economic opportunity, would not accept them, Senator THOMPSON and I have offered something far less ambitious, a simple standby authority. But it is an alternative. 
   What will we say to the American people if one day we discover that missile or nuclear or biological weapons are in the hands of our most feared enemies threatening the lives of the American people? Someone on this floor would be right to rise and quote the old Bolshevik maxim: They will sell us the rope with which we will hang them. 
   No one on this floor wants to provide that explanation. I urge support for the Thompson-Torricelli amendment. It is right. It is modest. I believe the Senate would be proud to take this stand. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I hereby recognize Ms. Emily E. Rome of the Paterson School District as the 2000-2001 Passaic County Teacher of the Year. For the past 50 years, Ms. Rome has served as a physical education teacher and has received numerous awards and accolades along the way. Her accomplishments range from prestigious recognition by the U.S. Congress and the Governor of New Jersey to various awards granted by the New Jersey Education Association and the National Education Association. 
   However, the effectiveness of her service reaches far beyond the view of the public eye. In the classroom, Ms. Rome has dedicated herself to creating a supportive and productive environment for the youth of Passaic County. As a educator, she as helped to shape the mind and spirit of these individuals during a crucial stage of development in their lives. Further, as a member of the community, Ms. Rome has demonstrated the high level of service and commitment that we all should strive to achieve. 
   Ms. Rome's accomplishments and accolades reflect only a small portion of the many contributions she has made to those she has served. He efforts have spanned from the children of Passaic County to a variety of young individuals who aspire to follow in her footsteps and education and service in the future. She is a exemplar of the professionalism that we hope to find in our educators, and the type of citizen that we hope to find in our communities. Ms. Rome is a representative of excellence, and her dedication to the world both inside and outside of the classroom is to be commended.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Gun Parts Trafficking Act of 2000. 
   For years, I have fought along with many of my colleagues against the gun violence that has plagued America. We have sought to keep firearms from the hands of children and those who would use them to do harm. After long debate, we succeeded in enacting a ban on assault weapons as well as the Brady bill requiring a criminal background check at the time of a firearms purchase--positive steps in the effort to protect our communities from gun violence. 
   Gun violence, however, continues to have a devastating impact on our nation. The statistics have been well documented, but bear repeating. In 1997 alone, more than 32,000 Americans were shot and killed. Fourteen children die from gunfire every day. The economic toll of firearms deaths and injuries on our country--$33 billion each year--is astronomical. 
   In light of these staggering figures it seems obvious that we must do more, including regulating guns like any other consumer product. But while we look forward, we must also be mindful of attempts by some to subvert the progress we have made. 
   Gun dealers are exploiting a loophole in current law that allows them to sell, through the US mail, gun kits containing virtually every single item needed to build an automatic weapon. When we enacted a ban on these deadly automatic weapons, we exempted automatic weapons legally owned prior to the ban. We also allowed replacement parts to be legally sold so that these grand-fathered weapons could be repaired by their owners, and we allowed these parts to be shipped through the nail. 
   These provisions, however, have been exploited and replacement part kits that can convert a legally owned firearm into an illegal automatic weapon are readily available and heavily advertised in numerous publications. Some of these kits even go so far as to provide a template that shows how to make this conversion. This is a flagrant effort to evade the laws of the United States. This activity must be stopped in order to maintain the integrity of our ban on assault weapons and protect our communities from gun violence. Legislation is needed that provides simple, common-sense measures to remedy the glaring loopholes in current law. 
   To that end, I am introducing the Gun Parts Trafficking Act of 2000, legislation designed to close the loopholes in existing law and end the sale of kits designed to convert legally owned firearms into illegal automatic weapons. The bill will expand the definition of ``firearm'' to include the main components of the weapon and will prohibit the manufacture or assembly of guns by an individual who does not have a license to do so.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it has been obvious for some time now that when permanent normal trade relations for China comes to a vote in the Senate, it will, indeed, pass overwhelmingly. My colleagues proceeding with this debate in recent days have detailed at length the enormous potential economic benefits to the U.S. economy. Other colleagues have appropriately discussed the human rights record in China, problems with religious freedom, and the rights of workers in China. They are all legitimate points and each belongs in a debate on PNTR with China, but the debate is not complete. 
   The relationship of the United States with the People's Republic of China is not only about economics; it must include human rights, religious rights, and workers rights. But it is not just about those rights; it is also ultimately about the security of the United States. 
   Our relationship with the People's Republic of China, a nation of 1.3 billion people, an immense land of economic, geopolitical significance, goes beyond that, perhaps, of any other trading partner of our country. Indeed, how we define this relationship in this vote and in this debate has enormous ramifications in the next generation. 
   Indeed, just as the debate in those first few months and years after the Second World War changed permanently the security and economic relationship between the United States and Western Europe and the remainder of the world, this debate will permanently alter our relationship with the People's Republic of China, and it is not right and it is not appropriate that it be done on a single plane. Economics is important, but it is not everything. That is why Senator THOMPSON and I have offered our amendment to address the continuing problem of the proliferation of weapons and technology from the People's Republic of China. 
   It was, of course, our hope that this vote could have been taken independently of PNTR. It was our desire not to complicate PNTR but to have a separate debate and separate vote. Regrettably, that proved not to be possible. So we return today with this amendment actually on the bill. 
   As I understand the arguments now for the bill, the most compelling is that PNTR will integrate China into the international economy, that it will encourage China to follow international trading rules. It is a strong argument, but even with passage of PNTR, even if the proponents are correct that China will then adhere to international trading rules, that does not automatically make China a member in good standing of the global community. Trading rules do not govern all international conduct. A nation is not a nation in good standing in the world simply because it trades according to these rules; it is by all the rules by which it chooses to live. 
   Truly to participate in the global community, China will, as has been argued on this floor, have to reform its human rights practices, the way it treats its workers, the way it relates to Taiwan, and how it deals with sensitive military technology that threatens all peoples everywhere. 
   Despite many assurances that it will reform its behavior, China has continued to be one of the most persistent and serious violators of international nonproliferation agreements. Ultimately, that is the question every Senator must ask themselves: If, indeed, PNTR is passed and China continues to violate trade agreements, you can go to your local townhall meeting and complain to the autoworkers and you can explain it to the Chamber of Commerce, but if China continues to violate proliferation agreements which leads to the spread of nuclear technology and missiles to a variety of dangerous neighbors that one day leads to warfare involving our Nation or others, to whom will you apologize then? 
   Where will the explanations lie? That is the question before the Senate. 
   Last month, the Director of Central Intelligence delivered to the Congress the intelligence community's biannual ``Unclassified Report on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction.'' 
   The DCI report clearly states that China has increased its missile-related assistance to Pakistan, and it continues to provide missile-related assistance to countries such as Iran, North Korea, and Libya. What is especially troubling about China's activities is that this sensitive assistance is going to the most dangerous nations in the most volatile areas of the world, with the greatest potential to do harm. 
   Indeed, looking at this map I have here--from Algeria to Libya to Syria to Iran--what is it that China could do more? What would be worse? What other nation would have to receive nuclear or missile technology before it  would offend Members of the Senate? In the entire list of rogue nations, almost no one is absent. 
   Just a couple of months ago, Chinese sales to Iran led to the test by Iran of a Shahab-3 medium-range ballistic missile. It is believed that components of Iran's missile program are from Beijing. 
   The People's Republic of China companies were sanctioned in 1997 for transfers to Iran, contributing to chemical weapons proliferation. Yet the DCI's August 2000 report said Iran continues to seek production technology, expertise, and chemicals for its chemical weapons program. 
   So it is missiles and chemicals. 
   Pakistan is a country located, perhaps, in the most volatile region of the world, which in recent years exploded a nuclear device and has come to the brink of war with India on several occasions since its new nuclear status. 
   The DCI reported last month that the PRC provided ``extensive support'' to Pakistan's weapons of mass destruction program, and in the second half of 1999 Iran had ``ongoing contacts'' that could not be ruled out, despite a 1996 promise by the PRC to stop assistance to unsafeguarded nuclear facilities. 
   In unpublished press accounts, U.S. intelligence agencies have reportedly concluded that China has stepped up its shipment of specialty steels, guidance systems, and technical expertise to Pakistan. Chinese experts have also been sighted around Pakistan's newest missile factory, which appears to be partly based on Chinese design. 
   Libya is a country with a history of promoting regional instability, sponsoring state terrorism, including the destruction of our own aircraft and our own citizens. 
   The August 2000 DCI report publicly confirmed the PRC's assistance to Libya for the first time. The Defense Department reportedly discovered in December 1999 that the PRC plans to build a hypersonic wind tunnel in Libya for missile designs for the Al-Fatah missile program. 
   According to reports in the Washington Times, the director of Libya's Al-Fatah missile program is planning to travel to China to attend China's premier training center for missile scientists and technicians. 
   North Korea's missile program is now believed to be achieving the potential to reach the United States with a ballistic missile, potentially by the year 2005--a direct security concern of the United States, leading this 
   Congress to authorize and appropriate billions of dollars for missile defense, leading all of us to a sense of new vulnerability. 
   The DCI first publicly confirmed in 1999 that the PRC is supplying components to North Korea. The August 2000 report states that North Korea acquired missile-related raw materials and components ``especially through firms in China'' in the second half of 1999. 
   These countries--Iran, Pakistan, Libya, and North Korea--are just the countries China has proliferated to in recent years. In the past, proliferation by the People's Republic of China has also included sending weapons technology to Iraq, Syria, and Algeria. 
   I cannot imagine any accusation against a foreign government that could or should raise more serious concerns in this body. How, indeed, could any Member of this Senate ever explain to the American people granting the greatest economic gift in the world, a normalized trade relationship with the United States, the greatest economy in the world, without at least, at a minimum, seeking enforcement of previous agreements for arms control and nonproliferation? 
   Until China ceases to allow this type of sensitive equipment, technology, and expertise to flow through its borders, it must understand that it can never have normalized political and economic relationships with the United States or, indeed, be accepted into the family of nations on an equal status with all other nations. 
   Opponents of our amendment contend that the current nonproliferation laws are effective; that Chinese proliferation is under control; that unilateral sanctions never work. They could not be more wrong. 
   As the reports I have just cited demonstrate, Chinese proliferation behavior is not improving. It is not getting better. And the DCI's report delivered to this Congress proves it. Existing nonproliferation laws are simply not working. This provides a real incentive, in actual quantifiable costs, for sharing technology with dangerous nations. 
   Our nonproliferation laws must be strengthened. This amendment--and only the Thompson-Torricelli amendment--offers that opportunity. Under this amendment, the President of the United States would submit a report to Congress by June 1st of each year identifying entities in key proliferating nations that have contributed to the development or acquisition of nuclear, chemical, or biological weapons, or ballistic or cruise missiles by foreign countries--every year a report identifying the entities. 
   The President would be required to impose measures against companies in key supplier nations that have been identified as proliferators, and the President would also be authorized to impose measures against any supplier countries as he sees fit. The President is given the discretion, but he is also given the responsibility. And this Congress is given the information that it needs to know whether or not the Nation is being safeguarded. 
   Over the past several months, we have substantially revised this legislation to address a number of concerns by the administration and by our colleagues. This amendment was not drafted by Senator THOMPSON or by myself alone. The administration raised legitimate concerns that it dealt only with specific technologies, only with the nations about which we should be concerned. It has been redrafted to deal specifically 
   with those concerns. 
   The revised bill now applies to all countries identified by the Director of Central Intelligence as key suppliers of weapons of mass destruction. The list currently includes China, Russia, and North Korea. Countries could be added or removed from the list over time based on the DCI's guidelines. So there are no unintended consequences of other states. 
   There were objections originally that the President did not have enough discretion in applying the sanctions; that the sanctions in the bill were too broad; and that they were applied with a standard of evidence that was too low. Every one of those problems was changed to meet the administration's objectives. 
   The bill is now drafted so that any sanctions against supplier countries are totally within the discretion of the President. The list of measures available to the President are the same as in the original bill. But now the President is authorized--not mandated--to apply these sanctions. 
   So those within the Senate who had concerns that we were taking away Presidential discretion, forcing him to act when the facts may not warrant it, prohibiting him from negotiating by not having this discretion, have had their concerns addressed. The President is given authorization. He is not mandated. 
   The only mandatory measures remaining in the bill would be applied against specific entities or countries that are determined by the President to be proliferators. Only if the President determines they are a proliferator will any entity be sanctioned. 
   If a company is determined to be a proliferator, the President must deny all pending licenses and suspend all existing licenses for the transfer to that company that are controlled for export under the Arms Export Control Act, the Export Administration Act of 1979, or the Export Administration Regulations. 
   Isn't that how the Senate would have it? If a company has been identified, if they have been multiple violators, if they have been cited by the President, shouldn't that company then be denied the benefits of these various export acts? 
   There is also an across-the-board prohibition on any U.S. Government purchase of goods or services from, and U.S. Government assistance or credits to, the proliferator. Would any Member of the Senate argue with this? To use the taxpayers' money, U.S. Government resources to buy from a company that has been repeatedly cited as a proliferator by the U.S. Government? Certainly they should not be entitled to the benefits of trade with the Government itself. 
   Is it too much to ask that we impose the sanctions on companies that are already identified, already established as  having been engaged in this conduct? But for some Members of the Senate, this was not enough. So we gave the President one further set of powers, waiver authority, which allows the President to waive the imposition of measures required under this legislation if he determines that the supplier country was taking appropriate actions to penalize the entity for such acts of proliferation and to deter future proliferation. The President also can waive the sanctions if he determines that such a waiver is important to the national security of the United States. 
   How little would be enough? It isn't mandatory. It is optional. It requires multiple instances. It must be an entity already identified by the President. It must be a technology already identified by the Government. It isn't mandatory. The President can waive it. He can cite larger national interests. 
   I believe there is a positive impact with the passage of this amendment. 
   Now I ask the Senate another question: What is the impact of failing to enact it? Who could ever believe that this Senate considers proliferation issues to be serious, that we are concerned that there is a price to selling these weapons of mass destruction or these technologies to other nations, if we cannot at a minimum pass this authorizing sanction on an optional basis, to be used if the President wants to use it? 
   Imagine the message in Beijing or North Korea or Iran or Iraq. Are we so desperate for trade, is this economy so desperate for that one more dollar immediately, not to offend a potential investor or buyer, that we would compromise our own good judgment? 
   I don't believe we would lose a dollar of trade with this amendment. I don't believe we lose a product, a job. But even if we did, even if I were wrong and we did, is the price too high to send a message that in our proliferation policy there is more than words? 
   Words will not defend us. It is not at all clear that our missile defense shield will ever protect us. This might. It can't hurt. It at least can set a serious tone that we will not be dealt with with impunity. Trade with us; get the benefits of our market. But we will look the other way while you send dangerous technologies to nations that kill our people or threaten the peace. 
   In a recent editorial, the Washington Post noted:  
   China's continuing assistance to Pakistan's weapons program in the face of so many U.S. efforts to talk Beijing out of it shows the limits of a nonconfrontational approach.  
   The Post went on to say:  
   The United States should make clear that ..... Chinese missile-making is incompatible with business as usual.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation which will ensure the preservation of our nation's coastal areas. Protection of our beaches is paramount; they are not only where we go to enjoy the sand and surf, but they also generate a significant portion of our nation's revenue. 
   Tourism and recreational activity are extremely important to New Jersey, especially to our small businesses and shore communities. New Jersey's $17 billion a year tourism industry is supported by the 160 million people who visit our 127 miles of beaches each year. This spending by tourists totaled $26.1 billion in New Jersey in 1998, a 2 percent increase from $25.6 billion in 1997. 
   My state is a microcosm of coastal tourism throughout the United States. Travel and tourism is our Nation's largest industry, employer, and foreign-revenue earner, and U.S. beaches are its leading tourist destination. In 1997, total tourism expenditures in U.S. coastal areas was over $185 billion, generating over 2.7 million jobs with a payroll of nearly $50 million. 
   Americans are not the only ones eager to enjoy our beaches and coastal regions. They are also the top destination for foreign tourists. Each year, the U.S. takes in $4 billion in taxes from foreign tourists, while state and local governments receive another $3.5 million. 
   In Florida alone, foreign tourists spent over $11 billion in 1992, $2 billion of that amount in the Miami Beach area. This Florida spending generated over $750 million in Federal tax revenues. A recent article by Dr. James R.  Houston, published in the American Shore and Beach Preservation Journal, shows that annual tax revenues from foreign tourists in Miami Beach are 17 times more than the Federal government spent on the entire Federal Shore Protection program from 1950 to 1993. If the Federal share of beach nourishment averages about $10 million a year, the Federal government collects about 75 times more in taxes from foreign tourists in Florida than it spends restoring that State's beaches. 
   Delaware, one of the smallest states in the Union, is visited by over 5 million people each year. This, in a state where just over 21,000 people actually live in beach communities and another 373,000 live within a several hours drive. Beach tourism generates over $173 million in expenditures each year for ``The First State.'' 
   Equally significant, however, beach erosion results in an estimated loss of over 471,000 visitor days a year, a figure which is estimated to increase to over 516,000 after five years. A 1998 study by Jack Faucett Associates (Bethesda, MD) in cooperation with independent consultants for the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control shows that during this five-year period, beach erosion will cost an estimated $30.2 million in consumer expenditures, the loss of 625 beach area jobs, and the reduction of wages and salaries by $11.5 million. Business profits will drop by $1.6 million and State and local tax revenues will decrease by $2.3 million. Finally, beach erosion will reduce beach area property values by nearly $43 million. The situation in Delaware is indicative of beach erosion problems throughout the coastlines of our nation. Unless we increase our efforts to protect and re-nourish our coastline, we jeopardize a significant portion of our country's revenue. 
   The Federal government spends $100 million a year for the Federal Shore Protection program. While the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers does a benefit-cost analysis in connection with every shore protection project, that analysis suffers from its own myopia. It places its greatest emphasis on the value of the private property that is immediately adjacent to the coastline. It is not reasonable to assume that a healthy beach with natural dunes and vegetation will benefit only that first row of homes and businesses. Homeowners spend money in the region; hotels attract tourists, who also spend money; local residents who live inland come to the beach to recreate. They too, spend money. Countless businesses, from t-shirt vendors to restaurants, all depend on these expenditures. 
   Prior to the 1986 Water Resources Development Act, the Army Corps of Engineers viewed recreation as an equally important component of its cost-benefits analysis. However, the 1986 bill omitted recreation as benefit to be considered, and our coastal communities have suffered. Indeed, the economy of our nation has suffered. My legislation would make it clear that recreational benefits will be given the same budgetary priority as storm damage reduction and environmental restoration. Companion legislation has been introduced in the House of Representatives, by Congressmen Lampson and LoBiondo, and enjoys bipartisan support. 
   Beach replenishment efforts ensure that our beaches are protected, property is not damaged, dunes are not washed away, and the resource that coastal towns rely on for their lifeblood, is preserved. It is imperative that federal policy base beach nourishment assistance on the entirety of the economic benefits it provides. To limit benefits to hurricane or storm damage reduction ignores the equally important economic impact of tourism.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I wish to enter into a colloquy with the distinguished Senators from our neighboring state of Delaware, Senators ROTH and BIDEN. Each of us has communicated with members of the Appropriations Committee on a matter of deep concern to us and our constituents that has been included in the FY 2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill. The Army Corps of Engineers' Delaware River Deepening Project seeks to deepen over 100 miles of the Delaware River channel from the current authorized 40-foot depth to 45 feet. The project would dredge 33 million cubic yards of bottom sediments, placing some 23 million cubic yards in dredge disposal areas in New Jersey, and 10 million cubic yards along Delaware shores. 
   This project continues to be highly controversial in our states for a number of reasons. First, there remain significant environmental concerns regarding the material to be dredged and its ultimate disposal and impacts on the environment of the Delaware Bay. The Corps of engineers has been criticized for its method of evaluating toxic and polluted sediments--using an averaging method, which many believe can mask the potential impact of dredging toxic hot spots and more concentrated polluted material. Our citizens continue to have strong concerns about the impacts of dredging and disposal on water quality, on drinking water supplies, on important recovering shellfish areas, and on the environment in the vicinity of proposed disposal areas. 
   A number of members of the New Jersey and Delaware congressional delegations and state agencies have made requests to the Corps of engineers to address a number of these issues. Earlier this year, Representative Andrews and I made a request to the General Accounting Office to conduct a review of the cost-benefit and environmental analyses in light of many of the concerns that have been raised about this project. In addition, Representatives SAXTON and LOBIONDO also sent a similar request to the GAO regarding the economic and environmental issues regarding the Delaware Deepening project. The GAO responded that it could not conduct and complete the study as quickly as would be necessary for conclusions to assist in the consideration of the FY 2001 Energy and Water Development Appropriation.  
   I want to state here that I intend to continue to pursue these issues and over the course of the next several months to engage the General Accounting Office, the Army Inspector General, the Army Corps of engineers, and any other appropriate agencies to get answers to the questions that I believe are critical to my constituents. For the record, Mr. President, I would like to enter into the record copies of study requests made by members of the New Jersey delegation to the General Accounting regarding the Delaware River Main Channel Deepening project. 
   If I may address the distinguished senior Senator from Delaware, have you not also made known your concerns to the Committee on Appropriations and to the Army Corps of Engineers?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have an amendment, No. 4109, filed with the clerk. It is my understanding that will be in the manager's package. I do not, therefore, call it to the floor of the Senate at this time. 
   I do wish for a moment to discuss with my colleagues the merits of this legislation and to thank the Senator from New Mexico and the Senator from Nevada for their cooperation and their assistance. 
   Within this legislation is $27 million to deepen and widen the main channel of the Delaware River. To the city of Philadelphia, the city of Camden, and the States of New Jersey, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, this is of some considerable importance. The Delaware River is a major artery of maritime commerce. I have always supported, and I will always support that river being efficient and available to maritime traffic, but there are serious problems. 
   When this legislation was considered in the House, my colleague, Representative ANDREWS from southern New Jersey, with the support of Congressman KASICH, offered an amendment to strike this funding. I will not do that tonight because I believe, first, the votes are not available and, second, I still hope the general problems with this dredging can be solved.  
   The problems are relatively simple. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers has proposed to dredge 33 million yards of material from the Delaware River. Three States will benefit by this dredging. Primarily the benefits will go to Philadelphia and the State of Pennsylvania, simply based on the size of the economic activity in the region by these States comparatively. Ten million of these 33 million yards will be used to replenish beaches in the State of Delaware. Twenty-three million yards will be placed on prime waterfront property in the State of New Jersey. Ten million goes to Delaware; 23 million occupies prime real estate in the State of New Jersey. And although the principal economic benefits of the dredging are for the city of Philadelphia, none--I repeat, not an ounce--of the material goes to the State of Pennsylvania. 
   Now I recognize we all have to share the burden, and we may not share the burden equally; it may not be shared proportionally to the economic benefit. But certainly accepting nothing, while the State of New Jersey takes the overwhelming majority of the material, cannot be right and it cannot be fair. Let me make clear that Senator SPECTER and Senator SANTORUM have been remarkably helpful in this matter. They have understood the inequity. They want the three States to work cooperatively. I am very grateful to both of them that, while protecting the interests of their State first and foremost, they have been good neighbors and have been cooperative. 
   I believe there are solutions to this problem: Primarily, ironically, that while this material is being dumped on the shorelines of New Jersey to our disadvantage, there is an enormous desire by construction companies and others in land development to have this material available. 
   It is a strange and ironic, even tragic, situation. I hope by this experience, which is also happening in the Port of New York, the Army Corps of Engineers will begin to understand and learn from the situation. Contracting companies, land development companies, major corporations, and communities want this material. Market it, sell it, use it, but no longer use it as if it is a waste material to be dumped on valuable real estate, on the unwanted. 
   Because of that, in my amendment, we reserve $200,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers to begin actively marketing this material for private and public projects--from road projects in south Jersey, to the future expansion of the Philadelphia Airport, to new construction in Atlantic City, there are willing users, even buyers. This $200,000 can go a long way to solving this problem. Particularly, I thank Senators SPECTER and SANTORUM for their help and cooperation. Of course, to Senator BIDEN, the Senator from New Mexico, and the Senator from Nevada, I am grateful that this is being put in the managers' amendment. I thank them for this time. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleague Senator JOHNSON to introduce ``The Municipal Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 2000.'' This legislation provides municipal deposits with one-hundred percent federal deposit insurance coverage by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The lack of one-hundred percent coverage for municipal deposits has stifled the ability of community banks to invest in local families and businesses. By providing this much-needed coverage, this legislation ensures that local banks have the resources they need to grow their communities. 
   Municipal deposits are taxpayer funds deposited by state and local governments, school districts, water authorities and other public entities. Due to the fact that the FDIC does not provide insurance coverage to municipal deposits, many states require banks to provide collateral for municipal deposits. Full deposit insurance coverage of municipal deposits could free up bank resources currently used for collateral. These resources could be used to keep local public funds at work in the communities in which they are generated. 
   Moreover, FDIC coverage helps build consumer confidence in their bank and helps attract the core deposits that are needed for community lending and a bank's survival. Without FDIC coverage, many independent, local banks are losing substantial deposits to large, corporate banks because of the perception that larger banks are safer. Providing municipal deposits with complete insurance coverage will strengthen community banks by placing these banks in a more competitive position to attract municipal deposits. Our nation's independently-operated banks are a valued part of our communities. It is important that these banks are able to maintain their competitiveness and continue providing their communities with their characteristic attention to customer service and investments in local farms and small businesses. 
   Finally, numerous taxpayers may be at risk municipal funds are placed in a failed bank. Recently, a bank failure in Carlisle, Iowa resulted in the loss of nearly $12 million in uninsured municipal deposits. Even though the state of Iowa has a fund that guarantees the deposits of state and local governments, there was an $8.4 billion shortfall in the fund. Consequently, this shortfall in funds will have to be made up by other Iowa banks. 
   This is why Senator's JOHNSON and I are introducing ``The Municipal Deposit Insurance Protection Act of 2000.'' The legislation will provide one-hundred percent coverage for municipal deposits will free up bank resources currently used as collateral, enable local, independent banks to attract municipal deposits, and will protect municipal taxpayers from losing uninsured public money. Senator JOHNSON and I look forward to working with our colleagues on this much-need legislation.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to address the Senate today on the question of the national elections and the rising interest by the American people in campaign finance reform. There is no better time to debate the intricacies of how we are financing and conducting national elections than in the midst of the very contests themselves. 
   Over the next 8 weeks, candidates for Federal office will spend more money than at anytime in American history to attempt to persuade the American people in the casting of their votes. There is one simple, compelling reason for this spiraling increase in campaign expenditures, and that is the cost of televised political advertising, the cost of being on the national television networks. 
   This Congress has tangentially dealt with some of the campaign finance problems. It is obviously positive that Congress tightened regulations for the disclosure of contributions for section 527 organizations. It was a small victory.  
   We have, through the years, increased the number of votes in this institution, of which I am one, for comprehensive reform as envisioned by Mr. FEINGOLD and Mr. MCCAIN. But indeed, even if both of these provisions were enacted, the pressure for increased expenditures would not abate. With all of these reforms in place, the pressure to raise more money and spend more money would still dominate the system, which leads to the proposition that to deal with the costs of advertising on television, either this Congress must go beyond the current debate on campaign finance reform or others outside of the Congress must become part of the solution. 
   Ironically, the principal critique of the campaign finance system is coming from the very people who are driving its costs--the television networks. A 30-second prime time advertisement in the New York City market now costs $50,000. In Chicago, the same advertisement can cost more than $20,000. This is the heart of the problem. 
   The New York Times estimates the 2000 elections will cost $3 billion. This is a 50-percent increase over the 1996 elections. And $600 million, or 20 percent of those expenditures, will be on political advertisements on television. This represents a 40-percent increase in only 4 years. 
   During the Presidential primaries, both GORE and Bush spent 46 percent of all of their campaign expenditures just on television ads, twice as much as any other category of expenditures. The evidence is overwhelming. What is driving this increase in expenditures, hence requiring the raising of these exorbitant, even obscene, amounts of money, is the cost of television advertising. It could not be clearer. 
   Potentially the most expensive Senate race in American history is going to be the current Senate race in New Jersey. A study by the Alliance for Better Campaigns focused on last June's primary in my State. It came to the following conclusions: 
   Local television stations in New York and Philadelphia took in a record $21 million from New Jersey Senate candidates, but these same television affiliates of the networks devoted an average of only 13 seconds per night in the final 2 weeks of the Senate campaign to actual news. 
   This chart illustrates what was available to the people of my State in choosing a Senator. In New York, a CBS affiliate--this is in the final 2 weeks of the campaign, only the last 14 days--devoted 10 seconds to coverage of news on the campaign. In Philadelphia, one network gave an average of 1 second per night to actual news about the campaign. 
   It is, therefore, not unpredictable that this would lead to candidates unable to communicate with voters through the news spending exorbitant amounts of money in advertisements. Indeed, during the final 2 weeks of the New Jersey Senate primary, viewers in Philadelphia and New York markets were 10 times more likely to receive a communication from a candidate through a paid advertisement than they were through an actual news story. They were 10 times more likely, if they were watching the news, to see an ad rather than actually seeing a report from a reporter on the campaign. 
   Paid advertisements have come to dominate sources of information over actual news reports in American political campaigns. 
   During the last Presidential primary season, it was much the same. The typical local television station aired less than 1 minute of candidates discussing issues each night. During the month before the Super Tuesday primary on March 7, the national networks aired a nightly average of 36 seconds. The people of the United States were choosing their two nominees in the major national primary, and for the preceding month the television networks devoted 36 seconds to discussing issues. Of the 22 televised Presidential debates held during this year's primary season, 2 were aired on network television. ABC, CBS, and NBC reduced by two-thirds the amount of time that was then devoted to the national political conventions. 
   This is the source of some obvious changes in the American political culture. Not only is this collapse of news coverage leading candidates to raise more money and buy more advertisements, it is obviously changing how the American people make their judgments. 
   On average, since 1952, 22 percent of voters have said they decided how to vote based on their observation of political conventions. This is also in a state of collapse. People made judgments on hard news, they made judgments on political conventions, they watched for sources of news that were unbiased or professional, and that is being replaced by political advertisements, not by choice but because there is no choice. 
   It is extraordinary, given this state of affairs, that the principal force driving allegedly for campaign finance reform has been in the media. 
   The networks reduced the amount of news coverage, radically increased the cost of advertising, and then complained about campaign financing. It is an extraordinary state of affairs. 
   Indeed, at this point, the television networks have political advertising as the third most lucrative source of their revenues--only behind the automobile companies and retail advertisers. 
   Indeed, buying air time for political ads is now 10 percent of the revenues of the television networks. Hence, it will become clear why they may complain about the cost of political campaigns, appropriately--because we all want reform in this institution more than they--but one can see why they are leading by complaint, not by example, in doing anything about the costs. They are themselves living off of and profiting by the system. And it is accelerating. 
   In the last decade, the percentage of political ads as a portion of total revenue of the television networks has gone from 3 percent of all revenue in political ads in 1992 to 9.2 percent this year and rising. 
   During the last cycle, network broadcasters accepted $531 million in political advertising. This is a 33-percent increase since 1996 and over a 110-percent increase since a decade ago. It isn't just that they are charging exorbitant money; it is rising in multiples every year. They are driving the cost of American political campaigns. 
   Candidates have been living, for the last 25 years, with the same $1,000 limit in raising hard Federal dollars--$1,000 per American per election. But the networks are up 110 percent in how much they are taking in, meaning that candidates are spending more and more time, going to more and more people, raising more and more money to communicate with the same voters. 
   I do not know how we get this Congress to enact campaign finance reform. I trust at some point it will happen. I do not know what else the Democratic Party can do. We have had 45 seats in the Senate for the last 2 years, and every single Democrat has voted for campaign finance reform. 
   But even if we were to have succeeded in those votes, it would not have solved this problem. We would limit how much would be raised, perhaps, but we would not deal with these expenditures. Ultimately, it is these expenditures that must be addressed. 
   As my friend, Senator MCCONNELL, stated many times on the floor of this Senate, the Nation does not suffer from too much political debate. It probably suffers from too little. If we lower the amount that can be raised, and the networks keep raising the amount that is required to be spent, all we are going to accomplish is less discussion of issues. If the networks were devoting more time to the impartial discussion of issues, debates, news coverage, conventions, it would be a good substitute for political advertising. But the amount of news coverage is collapsing while the costs go up. 
   If we control the expenditures, the net result will simply be this: The American people, making vital decisions about the Nation's future, with less and less and less information. 
   The hypocrisy of this gets worse. It is not just that networks charge more money and have less news coverage. For those of us who believe there should be a requirement for free or reduced-rate air time over the public airwaves, to reduce the need to raise this money, guess who is working against us. The very people who employ Mr. Brokaw, Mr. Rather, and Mr. Jennings, who, every night, are complaining about the cost of 
   political advertising. Their employers are lobbying to stop the reforms. The National Association of Broadcasters, the lobbying arm of  the television networks, spent $2.8 million lobbying Congress in 1998.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. In the year 2000, they have already spent $1.4 million. 
   As the Washington Post reported on May 2, when it comes to helping solve the political fundraising problem, the broadcasting industry ``doesn't see beyond its own bottom line.'' Exactly. 
   They are for campaign finance reform, unless they have to make a contribution. They are the principal component of this problem. Every person in this institution is spending time raising money when they should be working on legislation--compromising public confidence in the Congress by raising exorbitant amounts of money to feed the television networks that do not meet their own responsibility in reporting the news, no less in reducing the costs. 
   This is everybody's problem. The principal burden of solving it is in this Senate. I do not excuse that. The principal burden is here. We should be requiring free or low-cost television. But it is not our problem alone. Everyone in America can make a contribution to this. And it begins with the networks. You have a public license. The airwaves of the United States belong to the American people. In no other democracy in the world does the cost approach what we require for political candidates to raise money to use the public airwaves to communicate with our own constituents--sold at a profit. 
   I believe this Senate should require the FCC to have the networks offer a reasonable amount of free or reduced-rate advertising to candidates for Federal office as a matter of law. But until we do, the networks, as a matter of public responsibility, need to evaluate how much time they are devoting to political news so the American people are informed, recognizing that is the only way for democracy to reach sound judgments, and to unilaterally meet their responsibility and reduce these costs unless or until this Congress takes action. I believe this is the heart of the campaign finance problem. 
   Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota, once again, for allowing me the time. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to join people in New Jersey and throughout the nation in recognizing Colombia's 190 years of independence from Spain. On July 20, 1810, the citizens of Bogota created the first representative council to challenge Spanish authority. Total independence was proclaimed in 1813, and in 1819 the Republic of Greater Colombia was formed. In 1822, the United States became one of the first countries to recognize the new republic and to establish a resident diplomatic mission. 
   In addition to recognizing the day of Colombia's independence, this is an excellent opportunity to celebrate the contributions of the growing population of Colombian-Americans in New Jersey and throughout the United States. Almost 100,000 Colombian-Americans reside in Northern New Jersey alone. The Colombian-American culture is vibrant and rich and it is important to acknowledge the impact it is having on our communities. 
   While Colombia boasts one of the oldest democracies in South America, that democracy faces many serious challenges today. Celebrating this day of independence reminds us that Colombia has a long journey ahead as it works to overcome the problems of drug trafficking and rebel violence that continue to plague its society. The United States Congress is committed to helping in that struggle in any way we can. 
   I commend the great accomplishments and contributions of the Colombian-American community and as we join Colombian-Americans in celebrating their nation's independence we also look to establishing peace and justice in their homeland.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to draw attention to the increased number of environmental enforcement actions brought against repeat violators in the United States. 
   In 1970, many of America's rivers and lakes were dying, our city skylines were disappearing behind a shroud of smog, and toxic waste threatened countless communities. Today, after a generation of environmental safeguards, our rivers and lakes are becoming safe for fishing and swimming again. Millions more Americans enjoy clean air and safe drinking water, and many of our worst toxic dumps have been cleaned. Yet more remains to be done before we can truly say our environment is a healthy environment. 
   Indeed, in 1997 alone, over 11,000 environmental enforcement actions had to be taken at the State and Federal levels. Sadly, it is also becoming much more common for the defendants in these actions to be repeat violators. For instance, in 1994, a chemical company in New Jersey was fined $6,000 for environmental violations. Just four years later, the same chemical company was again cited for an environmental crime--releasing cresol into the air. Unfortunately, this time 53 children and 5 adults had to be hospitalized and the EPA had to evacuate the local community. 
   Incidents such as this are becoming all too common. Under current law, the penalties for repeat environmental violators, or parties responsible for environmental catastrophes resulting in serious injury, are too low. Indeed, paltry fines are insufficient deterrents for large corporations or parties that repeatedly commit environmental crimes. Between 1994 and 1998, New Jersey had 774 repeat violators--more than any other State in the nation. This lack of deterrence has serious repercussions for the environment and public health. 
   To provide a real safeguard against these repeat violators, today I will introduce the ``Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000.'' This legislation will create stiffer penalties for repeat violators of environmental safeguards and provides penalties that will more accurately reflect the costs to public health and the environment of catastrophic events. The bill also gives the EPA emergency order and civil action authority to address imminent and substantial endangerments of health and environment and creates a new EPA trust fund into which recovered funds can be used to address other significant threats. 
   Repeat environmental polluters that negligently endanger the public with their actions or inaction will not be tolerated. No individual or business should be able to endanger the public's health and safety with only the threat of a slap on the wrist hanging over them. The ``Zero Tolerance for Repeat Polluters Act of 2000'' goes a long way towards ensuring that public health and the environment are truly protected for future generations.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I rise to talk about two sites in New Jersey which are worthy of federal funding for their protection. I would hope that should additional funding become available, the Senate would consider providing federal funding to contribute to the acquisition of these sites. 
   The first is The Historic New Bridge Landing, located in Bergen County, New Jersey. I am concerned that this site will be lost unless federal protection is afforded to it. In November 1776, reeling from a series of devastating defeats in Brooklyn and Manhattan, the Continental Army fled across the Hudson River to New Jersey. The Red Coats, in hot pursuit, continually forced Washington to retreat. 
   After crossing New Bridge, Washington instructed a contingent of troops to dismantle the bridge and protect the army's rear. Though unable to destroy the bridge, Washington's troops held off the British long enough to allow the Army to escape. 
   This bridge called ``The Bridge that Saved a Nation,'' was strategically situated at the narrows of the Hackensack River. The bridge and surrounding area were a hotly contested battleground, encampment ground, military intelligence post and headquarters. In 1780, when the Continental army regained control of the area surrounding the New Bridge, Washington used the Steuben house as a headquarters and stayed in a second floor bedroom. 
   This property has been the object of attention for historians and preservationists for many years. The historical significance of this has been confirmed; the site is listed on both the New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places. In addition, in 1999, the site was named among the 10 Most Endangered Historic Sites in New Jersey by Preservation New Jersey, a private state-wide historic preservation organization. Finally, this site is included in the National Park Service's Revolutionary War and War of 1812 Battlefield study, which aims to catalog important sites in need of protection. 
   New Bridge Landing encompasses 18 acres on both sides of the Hackensack River in Central Bergen County, New Jersey. Commercial development, neglect and time, have combined to erode and threaten to destroy this historically significant site. Since 1995, the Historic New Bridge Landing Commission has been working toward the establishment of a major new historic and cultural park at Historic New Bridge Landing, in Central Bergen County, NJ. The Commission has established a General Management Plan which outlines the objectives of the proposed park. 
   Today, this site remains a hotly contested battleground, and while the nature of the battle is different, the importance of prevailing is no less important. New Jersey has undergone a revolution from ``Garden State'' to ``Suburban State,'' More than 40 percent of New Jersey is developed. New Jersey is by far the most built-over state in the nation and it is number 1 in the rate at which it is losing its open space. Since 1961, New Jersey has lost over half a million acres to sprawl. The area adjacent to New Bridge Landing have not been spared. Virtually all of the land adjacent to the site has been developed. This development is visible from the site, altering its character and diminishing the visitor's experience of the park's historic landscape. 
   Mr. President, I would like to introduce this letter from the National Park Service testifying to the importance of Historic New Bridge Landing, and the need for federal efforts to preserve and protect it. Historic New Bridge Landing is worthy of our protection, and I would hope that the Senate would consider providing funding for the protection of this important site. 
   The second site which I rise today to speak in support of, is the Glen Gray Boy Scout Camp, located in the heart of the Ramapo Mountains, in New Jersey. 
   Much like the rest of my state, this 850 acre tract is threatened with development. Sprawl threatens to eat away at this pristine site, and the remainder of the Highlands. New Jersey knows all too well the peril of sprawl and has paid a terrible price at the hands of developers of shopping malls and subdivisions. 
   An average of 10,000 acres of rural/agricultural land is being developed piecemeal every year in New Jersey. The NY-NJ Highlands has seen a 60 percent increase in urbanization in the last 25 years, and is expected to absorb a 14 percent increase in population by 2010. Years ago, we made an important step in the preservation of the Highlands with the effort to protect Sterling Forest. This effort was aided by a study of the New York-New Jersey Highlands Region, conducted by the Forest Service. 
   That study also found the Highlands to be of national significance due to the diversity and quality of its natural resources and landscape. In addition, the study confirmed threats from development to water quality, critical open space, and recreational resources. 
   The Highlands regional study has shown us that this region is deserving of federal funding to allow for its protection. I am hopeful that the Committee will share my concern for this region, and commit funding for its protection.  
   I realize that the Committee faces many demands when putting this bill together. While these requests were not included in the bill, I would ask the Committee to consider funding for these worthy projects in the Conference.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Bryan amendment, which would ensure protection of our nations forests. This amendment would cut $30 million from the National Forest System's forest products program and would redirect $15 million to the Wildland Fire Management's fire preparedness program. The amendment would return the remaining funds to the Treasury to reduce the national debt. There are many reasons why I support this amendment, but let me discuss just two. 
   First, is the need to end corporate welfare. It is estimated that within the federal budget corporate welfare makes up anywhere from $86 billion (CATO Institute) to $265 billion (Progressive Policy Institute). A recent report by the Green Scissors Coalition estimates that over a five year period the Federal government will spend $36 billion on wasteful and environmentally harmful projects such as the forest products program. 
   Second, simply, is that by passing this amendment, we enact good environmental policy. The continual construction of new roads required to access our nation's forests removes ground cover and creates a channel for water to run down, accelerates soil erosion, weakens hillsides and fouls steams, destroying the foundation of our recreational and commercial fisheries. Logging roads are a major source of non-point source water pollution. According to the National Forest Service, 922 communities receive their drinking water from streams within the national forests-streams that are polluted from contaminated run-off associated with construction.  
   The protection of our roadless areas is important because they represent an important legacy for future generations. Areas without roads are becoming scarce in this country and in our national forests. Roadless areas provide significant benefits including: opportunities for dispersed recreation, clean, clear sources of public drinking water; large undisturbed landscapes that provide privacy and seclusion; bulwarks against the spread of invasive species; habitat for fish and game and other rare plant and animal species. 
   While I would prefer to see this program eliminated completely, at the minimum timber companies should not be subsidized by the taxpayers. The timber industry, like any other business, should bear its own costs. At a time when we are asking all Americans to do more with less, we should have the courage to ask the special interests to at least pay their own way. I support the Bryan amendment, and ask my colleagues to join me by voting for this important initiative. 
   While I have the floor, I will take a moment to comment on legislation that the Senate will soon consider. The Conservation and Reinvestment Act would guarantee full funding for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, and afford permanent protection to our nation's threatened natural, cultural, and historical treasures. 
   In 1964, Congress made the decision to reinvest revenue from the development of non-renewable resources into acquisition and permanent protection of key land, water, and open space. In the 30 years since its creation, the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) has been responsible for the acquisition of nearly seven million acres of parkland-contributing to the creation of the Appalachian Trail, Everglades and Rocky Mountain National Parks. In New Jersey, it helped fund the acquisition of Sterling Forest, and the Cape May and Walkill National Wildlife Refuges. 
   However, the LWCF is not a true trust fund in the way ``trust fund'' is generally understood by the public. Despite the fact that by law, the revenues are supposed to go to the LWCF, Congress must appropriate the money before it can be spent; if appropriations are not made, the revenues instead go to the General Treasury, to be spent on defense, or roads, or whatever Congress decides. The practical effect is that historically, only a small portion of the funds in the LWCF has actually been used for land preservation. 
   At no time has full funding of the LWCF been more needed than today, as the demands of development and suburbanization jeopardize land preservation efforts. The United States loses 50 acres an hour to development. In New Jersey, we know all too well the effects of suburban sprawl. Since 1961, New Jersey has lost half a million acres to sprawl. This is not surprising when you consider that New Jersey ranks 9th in terms of population. The reality is that sprawl is settling in over our open space. 
   In a very exciting development, the House of Representatives recently passed LWCF legislation, and this bill now stands in the Senate. I am hopeful that the Senate will mark up its legislation this week, and I urge the Leadership to schedule floor time for this landmark initiative as soon as possible. 
   Inscribed in one of the hallways of our nation's Capitol are the words of Theodore Roosevelt. He said: ``The nation behaves well if it treats the natural resources as assets which it must turn over to the next generation increased, and not impaired in value.'' Let us act on this vision and pass this extraordinary initiative during the 106th Congress.

As the matter between the U.S. Air Force and the New Jersey Forest Fire Service has been resolved, the need for legislative language to rectify this matter is no longer necessary. 
   At this time, I would like to show my appreciation to the Secretary of the Air Force and his staff for their professionalism and cooperation in helping bring about an expeditious and satisfactory resolution to this matter. I would like to thank the staff members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, in particular Mike McCord, for their assistance in seeing this matter through. 
   The reimbursement from the Air Force to the New Jersey Forest Service will help enable the men and women of this vital department to continue their important duties in protecting the forests and state parks of New Jersey from disaster.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I rise in support of Strengthen Our Sisters, a non-profit, tax-exempt shelter in West Milford, New Jersey that has provided homeless and battered women and children with safe shelter and supportive services since 1988. The mission of Strengthen Our Sisters is to help women and children break the cycle of domestic violence and homelessness, which, if unchecked, is passed from one generation to the next. To date, Strengthen Our Sisters has experienced great success in fulfilling its mission as evidenced by its remarkable growth. While in 1988, Strengthen Our Sisters started with an annual budget of less than $36,000, this year's budget stands at $1.3 million. Strengthen Our Sister's continued growth is a result of their demonstrated expertise in management and dedicated and knowledgeable staff. 
   As a way to help more women, Strengthen Our Sisters would like to expand the service their program offers for older women. In 1998, Strengthen Our Sisters served four women over age fifty-five, a number that jumped to fourteen in the span of less than a  year. The older women they serve often arrive with long histories of abuse that requires special services related to domestic violence, drug and alcohol addictions, unemployment and mental health. Indeed, the need for assistance naturally increases as we grow older. And, adding life changing circumstances such as abuse, homelessness and physical challenges to the equation increases the need for assistance exponentially. Thus, Strengthen Our Sisters would like to expand the services its program offers to address the needs of senior women in a comprehensive and integrative manner that focuses on helping them attain appropriate shelter, resources and advocacy services. 
   The work of Strengthen Our Sisters is an appropriate focus for the Committee because domestic violence is a national epidemic. Expanding the Strengthen Our Sisters program to help senior women could be a model for shelters across the country that are confronting similar problems and population trends.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I would like to take this opportunity to express my support for a very important initiative to both myself, the State of New Jersey, and the Nation. The University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey (UMDNJ)-Robert Wood Johnson Medical School has developed the Child Health Institute (CHI) of New Jersey--a comprehensive biomedical research center focused on the development, growth and maturation of children. The mission of the Institute is to improve the health and quality of life of children by fostering scientific research that will produce new discoveries about the causes of many childhood diseases as well as the treatments for these diseases. Researchers will direct their efforts toward the prevention and cure of environmental, genetic and cellular diseases of infants and children. 
   The hospitals in central New Jersey birth nearly 20,000 babies each year. The founding of the Child Health Institute has created an extraordinary health care resource for these hospitals and the patients they serve. The new Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital is scheduled to open in 2000 and the Child Health Institute in 2001. Together these institutions will provide state of the art clinical and scientific research and treatment complex to serve children and their families, not only in New Jersey, but throughout the nation with cutting edge care and the latest scientific developments. 
   At maturity, the Child Health Institute is also expected to attract between $7 and $9 million of new research funding annually with the total economic impact on the New Brunswick area estimated to be $50 to $60 million per year. This facility has also already attracted the private funding of two endowed professorships designed to allow recruitment of world-class faculty. 
   Mr. President, funding for the University of Medicine and Dentistry's Child Health Institute in this bill would be entirely appropriate under the Health Resources and Services Administration account. It would be money well spent. I ask the Chairman to consider providing $5 million for the completion of the Child Health Institute.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last week the Senate voted to tighten regulations on 527 organizations--organizations created to influence political campaigns in the United States; that section of the Tax Code allows them to operate without disclosure of their contributors or without limitations on their expenditures, and, indeed, on a tax-deductible basis. 
   The vote last week was genuinely historic in the Senate. It was the first time since 1993 that a campaign finance reform measure passed the Senate. 
   I congratulate Senator LIEBERMAN on his leadership in bringing the Senate to this important moment of judgment. 
   These ``527 organizations,'' as they have come to be known, are the latest threat to the integrity of our Nation's electoral process, with unlimited funds unaccountable from unknown sources. 
   If this legislation does not become law, they threaten to change the entire electoral process of the country. Every reform instituted not only since Watergate but, indeed, in this century could be undone. 
   There is no assurance that even those limited protections--from the progressive movement in the times of Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson that barred unlimited and undisclosed corporate contributions--and reforms could remain in place if these 527 organizations are allowed to operate and, indeed, to proliferate. 
   The Senate's vote last week sent a very strong message that for whatever we are unable to do on campaign finance reform we can at least agree that complete and full disclosure is required 
   and that we will not allow the Tax Code to be misused for the raising of unknown political funds. 
   It is, however, important that the public not accept this limited achievement as the sum total of all the Congress can do on campaign finance reform. It is only a beginning. Indeed, it is a modest beginning. 
   It is also true that our efforts on soft money in McCain-Feingold have been frustrated. For a variety of reasons, it is now very clear McCain-Feingold and limitations on soft money contributions are not going to be enacted in this Congress. Some of the barriers are political. Some are legislative. Indeed, as my friend, MITCH MCCONNELL, has pointed out, some are very real and constitutional. There are real problems to enacting a complete soft money ban. Federal courts have spoken on the subject. There are many who believe their  individuals rights might be limited. That debate will continue for years on the merits. 
   Now the Congress is left with a partial achievement on 527 organizations, a frustration on soft money prohibitions. The question is whether anything else can be done. Indeed, a great deal more could be done that is both easier to achieve and in some respects more important. 
   There is primarily a single reason that campaign fundraising is rising exponentially in the Nation. It is very simple. Campaign expenditures are rising exponentially in the Nation. It is becoming more and more expensive to communicate with the American people through more and more news outlets. It is the heart of the problem. 
   A recent study has indicated that records are being broken across the Nation in the cost of political advertising. The study, led by the Alliance for Better Campaigns, cited the Senate primary in my own State of New Jersey as evidence of how broken the campaign finance system has now become and that the same broadcasters in the news media who are leading national efforts for campaign finance reform are a central part of the problem. 
   Television stations in New York and Philadelphia during the recent New Jersey Democratic primary took in a record $21 million in advertising. The chart shows the stations in New York and Philadelphia, the four rated stations, the amount of time they actually devoted to hard news. We have these stations in New York and Philadelphia bringing in $21 million in revenue from political advertising. Yet in actual news coverage of the campaigns per evening--two stations in Philadelphia--one is giving 19 seconds of coverage per evening; another, 1 second; in New York, the two top stations, WNBC and WCBS, 23 seconds and 10 seconds, respectively. 
   Advertising rates soar. News coverage collapses. Candidates are left with no choice. There being no other means to communicate with people who live in our States, they must buy more advertising time at ever-higher and higher rates. Indeed, in the final 2 weeks of the New Jersey primary, voters in Philadelphia and New York markets were 10 times more likely while watching a news program to see a campaign advertisement than a news story--10 times more likely to see an advertisement than a legitimate news story on an issue in the campaign. 
   That, my colleagues, is the heart of the problem. However, it is not only a senatorial problem or not only a problem in my own region of the country. During the month before the March 7, Super Tuesday primary, the national networks aired a nightly 
   average of only 36 seconds discussing an issue of importance to the national voters. The situation that Democrats and Republicans face in the New Jersey primary is identical to what AL GORE and George W. Bush face in the national elections--no news coverage, rising rates, higher expenditures. It is, of course, part and parcel of this problem that is driven by the individual rates for specific advertising time. 
   An example of this would be, in New York City, a 30-second advertisement can now cost as much as $50,000. In Chicago, the same advertisement could cost $20,000. Television stations in the Nation's top 75 media markets took in a record of $114 million in the first 4 months of this year in political advertising. 
   There is no other nation in the world where the public airwaves are licensed to a private corporation which will then set commercial rates as the cost of discussing public policy issues with the Nation's voters. This wouldn't happen in Britain, Canada, Italy or France. These airwaves belong to the American people. The issues, be they Democrat, Republican, or Independent, be they from some other group or political party, are issues of importance to the American people. Yet the broadcasting networks are using them as a revenue source while they incredibly claim to be campaigning for campaign finance reform. 
   There is no mistaking that the power to change the campaign finance system belongs in the Congress. We could lead to a solution. For a variety of political reasons, legislative reasons, and constitutional reasons, that is not going to happen. The question now is whether the television networks will spend the remainder of this electoral season complaining about this political problem of reaching a solution or be part of the answer. I believe they should lead by example. 
   Only a year ago, Mr. Kennard, the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, raised the prospect of, by regulation, lowering the cost of television advertising. Rather than $50,000 in New York or $20,000 in Chicago, the FCC could mandate, if the networks are unwilling to do it voluntarily, a lower cost. Since television accounts for 80 or 90 percent of the cost of the Senate or Presidential campaign, lowering the cost of that advertising would dramatically remove pressure on fundraising. The problem could begin to solve itself. The FCC chose not to do so under pressure from Members of Congress. 
   The question remains, Why do the networks not do so themselves? I understand the networks looking to the Congress for an answer. They should. They are entitled to look to us, and they are entitled to expect an answer. But I also look back to them. Rather than 20 seconds a night for candidates to discuss the future of our Nation, rather than using the national airwaves to discuss every latest crime trend or weather pattern or cultural abnormality, the national airwaves could be used to actually discuss the Nation's future--not 10 seconds a night or 20 seconds a night but 10 minutes a night or 15 minutes a night so candidates believe there is an alternative to communicating with the American people other than buying the public airwaves to do so. 
   Second, the networks, most obviously, could enhance this national debate and reduce the cost of this fundraising, remove the pressure on fundraising by dramatically reducing these costs. Political advertising is now the third largest source of revenue for the television networks. We have become an industry supporting the networks themselves, only behind retail sellers of merchandise in the Nation, spending hundreds of millions of dollars in this Presidential and congressional campaign. A reduction of those rates to allow challengers to compete with incumbents and lesser-financed candidates to compete with multimillionaires would enhance the American political system and start setting an example of how the Nation can begin to change the dominance of money in the American political system. 
   I hope at some point the networks, as good corporate citizens and as Americans, no less as people who claim to be for campaign finance reform, would hear this message and join this movement. 
   I yield the floor. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for yielding the time. 
   If this argument seems familiar to my colleagues, it is because it is. We have had this debate three times in as many years, always to the same bipartisan conclusion. 
   I approach it today from several perspectives; first, from the institutions. Is what we are proposing and arguing to the American people really fair? The American farmer is being told in the midst of an agricultural crisis that if only you could sell some crops to Cuba, your problems would be relieved--11 million people in the Caribbean who earn $10 a month. Rather than coming to this floor honestly and dealing with agricultural crises and agricultural policies which have left farmers in my State and most States in genuine trouble, instead we hold up this false promise. 
   The truth is, Cuba can buy agricultural products from every other nation in the world today. From Australia, Canada, Argentina, they can buy corn and they can buy wheat. They do not. Yet the false promise is held on this floor that somehow, magically, they would buy those products from us. If they don't buy them from Canada, for the same reason they will not buy them from the Dakotas or Nebraska or Iowa--Cuba has no money. The average Cuban earns $10 per month. The Nation is bankrupt. Yet somehow Castro, in the last totalitarian state in the Americas, the most repressive dictator of human rights possibly in the world, is being seen somehow as victimized and the United States is the aggressor. 
   This argument has been made so many times but never seems to register with my colleagues. Let me say it again: Since 1992, the United States has issued 158 licenses for medicine--virtually every license request filed. We have given $3 billion worth of humanitarian assistance to Cuba. There is no relationship between two peoples on Earth where one nation has given more food and medicine to another than the United States to Cuba. We have given more food and medicine to Cuba than we have given to our closest ally of Israel or other nations struggling in Latin America. We have given food and medicine. 
   Say what you will about the policy, but be fair to the United States of America. We are a generous people. This policy has a moral foundation. No Cuban is suffering because of the U.S. Government. They are suffering because of Fidel Castro and failed Marxism. We have said it every year, and every year we return to the same point. It is not right and it is not fair to the United States. 
   Then we hear the argument that this has failed for 40 years, how could we go on? This policy was instituted by Bill Clinton in 1993 on a bipartisan vote with the leadership of a Republican Congress and a Democratic administration. Until then, there essentially was no embargo. You can say 40 years as long as you want; it does not make it true. 
   Until 1993, corporations were trading through Europe. Every American corporation was able to trade with Cuba through European affiliates. Until 1990, the Soviet Union was putting $5 billion worth of aid into Cuba. There was no embargo. Is 7 years too long to take a stand for the freedom of the Cuban people? We waited 50 years with North Korea. 
   We fought apartheid with an embargo for 30 years--the international community. With Iraq, we have waited 12 years. We can't give 7 years to try to bring some hope to the Cuban people in this moment of extraordinary despair? 
   Why do you choose this moment? Why now? The Clinton administration has but 7 months left in office. A new President, with a mandate of the American people, will want his own foreign policy, be it GORE or Bush. Yet you would saddle this new administration with a commission not of its choosing, with a policy not of its directive for 4 years that do not belong to Bill Clinton? 
   What message is this to Fidel Castro? It is not as if things in Cuba have gotten better. If, indeed, my colleagues were coming to this floor and saying, you know, Senator, there has been an election, there is now an opposition threat, and the Cubans are now acting responsibly, they are finally recognizing the rights of our people and we must respond--in fairness to my colleagues, they don't even make that argument. Things are not getting better. Indeed, things are not even the same. 
   Human rights organizations have classified last year as the worst year in a decade for human rights in Cuba. This is the reality to which you respond. The U.N. Commission on Human Rights in Geneva voted to condemn Cuba several months ago, accusing it of ``continuing violations of human rights, fundamental freedoms, such as freedom of expression, association, and assembly.'' The U.S. State Department, a few months ago, called Cuba a totalitarian state that ``maintains a pervasive system of vigilance through undercover agents, informers, and rapid response brigades in neighborhood communities to root out any and all dissent.'' 
   Since last November, Cuban police have detained 304 dissidents, restricted the movements of another 201, and have been holding 22 more for possible trials. 
   The Cuban statutes were changed last year to make it a felony to communicate with the U.S. Government, against the law to communicate with American Government agencies, or to be interviewed by the American media. This is the reality to which you are responding. I do not say it lightly, but it is a reward for deteriorating circumstances in Cuba. 
   Several years ago, in 1994, 72 men, women, and children attempted to leave Havana Harbor for Miami in a tugboat. They were intercepted. The Cuban police restricted their movements. They began to fire water hoses on the boat. Women held up 20 babies to show the police that they had infants on board, with a belief that this would stop the water hoses. Instead, the pressure increased. That day, 72 men, women, and infants went to the bottom of Havana Harbor. Several days later, the relatives asked permission to retrieve their bodies. They didn't get it that day; they haven't gotten it since. Those babies are at the bottom of Havana Harbor. This is Fidel Castro's Cuba. This is what you are responding to--a deteriorating, despicable situation. 
   There will come a change in American policy to Cuba. It is in the law. The burden is on Fidel Castro. It is the fault of his policies, not our own. Hold an election, allow a free press, allow free expression, release political prisoners, and everything is possible. You may disagree with that policy, but it is the law. It is bipartisan. But at least until you do, be fair to this country. We have not abused Cuba. Fidel Castro has abused Cuba.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Washington and the Senator from Maine. I congratulate each of them on this amendment. 
   There are good and sound arguments that people who serve in the Armed Forces of the United States deserve some special privilege. Their lives are at risk. They give months and years of their time in service to our Nation. Certainly, they deserve some special recognition and accommodation to their needs. 
   I know of no argument that people in service to our country, because they are in the Armed Forces, deserve less. Access to safe abortions is not a national privilege. It is not a benefit we extend to the few. It is, by order of the Supreme Court of the United States, a constitutionally mandated right. Yet people would come to the floor of the Senate and say those who take an oath to defend our Nation and our Constitution by putting their lives in harm's way deserve not those constitutional rights of other Americans but less. 
   To the extent my colleagues want to debate the law, fight on the constitutional issue, I respect them. To the extent they simply want to provide barriers when a woman wants to exercise her constitutional right while in service to our country, it does not speak well of the anti-abortion movement. Women in the Armed Forces serving abroad must arrange transportation, incur delays. Ironically, to those in the anti-abortion movement, these are women whose abortions get postponed to later stages of 
   pregnancy and must have the personal dangers of travel while pregnant because of this prohibition. 
   In spite of words I heard said on this floor, there are no public funds involved. Women would pay for these procedures themselves. No providers of health care in a military hospital or other facility would be forced to do this against their will. This would be done only on a voluntary basis by regulation of the Armed Forces. It is voluntary; it is privately paid for; it is constitutional; and it is right. 
   How would we account for the expense, the Senator from Arkansas has raised. This was done in 1994 and 1996; it was done before 1993. In all those years, in hundreds and thousands of cases, we had no accounting difficulty. A woman is presented with a bill: Here is what it costs. Is it a private matter? You pay for it. 
   The Armed Forces themselves may be in the best position to speak for their own members. On May 7, 1999, Assistant Secretary of Defense Sue Bailey stated:  
   The Department of Defense believes it is unfair for female service members, particularly those members assigned to overseas locations, to be denied their constitutional right to the full range of reproductive healthcare. *.*.*   
   Exactly. Members of our Armed Forces ask for no special privileges. They ask for no special rights. They want to have the constitutional rights of all other Americans. It is not right. It is not fair. It is not even safe to ask a woman at this dangerous, important, critical moment of her own life to seek transportation to travel across continents to exercise the abortion rights that every other American can get from their own doctor at their own hospital. 
   No matter what side you are on in the abortion debate, this is just the right thing to do. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, on all sides of this debate, if ever there was a moment for unity on reproductive rights, I urge support for the Snowe-Murray amendment.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mr. Joseph A. Mezzo of New Jersey and the 4th Regiment of the United States Marine Corps, whose gallant actions in 1937 prevented an already tumultuous conflict from destabilizing further. The 4th Marines were deployed near the Soochow Creek in China to diffuse tensions that emerged after Japanese forces penetrated Chinese boundaries. Further intensifying the situation, a Chinese officer killed two members of the Japanese military, creating a hostile climate that culminated in armed conflict. Amidst heavy gunfire from both Japanese and Chinese forces, Mr. Mezzo and the 4th Marine Regiment demonstrated tremendous fortitude and resolve as they assisted in the stabilizing of the Soochow Creek, halting what could have been a major international battle. 
   After all other American forces returned home, the 4th Marines remained in the Soochow Creek, accepting an even greater challenge of returning a Chinese rice barge that had been captured by the Japanese to its rightful owner. Mr. Mezzo and his fellow Marines executed this risky maneuver, thereby diffusing a situation which could have added fuel to an already volatile situation. The 4th Marine Regiment courageously exhibited the Marine Corps standard of Semper Fidelis, which saving the lives of many people. 
   Although Mr. Mezzo and his comrades acted with bravery and selflessness, their efforts, and the efforts of many gallant veterans, have gone virtually unrewarded and unappreciated. While their exploits may not be found in history books, the services with which these veterans have provided our country are invaluable. I would like to recognize Mr. Mezzo, the 4th Marine Regiment, and all veterans who have risked their lives for the welfare of our country. Their willingness to accept these dangerous missions is a testament to their senses of duty, honor and patriotism. For this, I salute our veterans to whom we own a debt of gratitude and our ceaseless appreciation, for they exemplify what it means to be American.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Ballistics Fingerprints Act of 2000'' which will help reduce gun violence in our communities. Despite recent progress in reducing gun violence, the number of people killed or injured each year in this country remains too high. Each year more than 32,000 Americans are killed by gunfire. This means that each day, almost 90 Americans, including almost 12 young people under the age of 19, die from gunshot wounds. For each fatal shooting, three more people are injured by gunfire. These grim statistics require all of us to do more to further reduce gun violence. 
   History has shown that coordinated law enforcement strategies involving the public and private sector are the most effective tools in reducing gun violence. This includes targeting the illegal shipment of firearms and implementing strategies to keep guns out of the hands of criminals. It also includes using advanced technologies, such as computer ballistic imaging, to assist law enforcement in investigating and identifying violent criminals. 
   Like fingerprints, the barrel of a firearm leaves distinguishing marks on a bullet and cartridge case and no two firearms leave the same marks. Computer ballistic imaging technology allows these distinguishing marks or characteristics to be maintained in a database where they can be rapidly compared with evidence from a crime scene for possible matches. The ATF and FBI have been using this technology since 1993 to help state and local crime laboratories across the country link gun-related crimes and recently these agencies entered into an agreement to create one unified system. In 1999 alone, a total of 2,026 matches were made with this unified system which represents the linkage of at least 4,052 firearm related crimes. 
   The ``Ballistice Fingerprints Act'' would take this innovative approach to crime fighting one step further by creating a national registry of ballistic fingerprints. Under this legislation, every gun manufacturer will be required to obtain the ballistic fingerprints or identifying characteristics for every gun manufactured prior to distribution so that guns used in the commission of a crime can be easily traced and identified. The bill also requires the Department of Treasury to inspect this information and create a national registry of ballistic fingerprints. With the help of this information, police will be better able to locate and identify the guns used in criminal activity and to prosecute the criminals who use these guns. 
   The saturation of guns in American communities and the frequency of gun related violence calls upon all us to do more to combat gun related violence. Common sense tells us that one way to further reduce firearm violence is to identify the guns used in committing these crimes so that the criminals who use these can be brought to justice. Regardless of where one stands on gun control, we all should be able to unite behind this simple but highly effective crime fighting tool. I look forward to working with my colleagues to see this legislation enacted into law.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the distinguished career of an outstanding American, Mr. Michael Valmoro of Mahwah, New Jersey. Serving his community as a teacher of English, world literature and the works of William Shakespeare at Teaneck High School for the past thirty-eight years, he is one of the longest serving teachers in the history of the New Jersey school system. That tremendous achievement alone is worthy of praise. However, his commitment to his students by opening their young minds to the world's great literature and the genius of William Shakespeare has made him a respected educator and pillar of the community. 
   Cicero once professed, ``What nobler employment, or more valuable to the state, than that of the man who instructs the rising generation.'' It is clear that Mr. Valmoro has taken Cicero's wisdom to heart during the course of the last four decades, as he has enlightened and inspired the thousands of students fortunate enough to have passed through his classroom. 
   Whether he was teaching his students to express themselves through creative writing, introducing them to the tragedy of ``Romeo and Juliet'' or reveling in the simple joy found in one of Shakespeare's sonnets, Mr. Valmoro approached each of his lessons with the wisdom and perspective of a scholar and the unbridled enthusiasm of an eager student. 
   In one of the scenes of ``King Lear,'' the titular monarch asks his audience, ``Who is it who can tell me who I am?'' This question often presents itself to an individual upon the twilight of their career. If the outpouring of accolades, fond reminiscence and affection are any indication, the answer to this probing question for Mr. Valmoro is, an excellent teacher, a trusted mentor, a lover of great literature and an inspiration to his colleagues, students and family. 
   Throughout his distinguished tenure, Mr. Valmoro has exemplified the ideals which the American people value in their educators. It is with my most sincere congratulations and respect that I recognize him today in the Senate.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I state my regret over the position in which we find ourselves with Senator WARNER. There is no one in this institution more committed to the Armed Forces. His legislation deserves being supported. 
   I regret this amendment has become a complication. However, it is a necessity. This is an extraordinary moment in the national political process. Make no mistake, if this Senate fails to deal  with the problem of 527 organizations and their influence in the American political process, what little remains of campaign finance laws in this Nation will collapse before our eyes. 
   The Justice Department may be investigating foreign contributions and the media may be discussing soft money, but the Members of the Senate know that the newest and largest challenge to the integrity of the American political financial system are the 527 organizations. It would be difficult for most Americans to even believe the scale of the problem. It is not a new problem. In 1996, $67 million was introduced to the American political systems through these organizations; 2 years ago, it was $250 million. It could easily be hundreds of millions of dollars in the ensuing months if the Senate does not act. 
   It is a contradiction with everything this Congress on a bipartisan basis has attempted to do to preserve some integrity in the American financial political system in the last 30 years. The donors to these organizations are secret. They are not necessarily American. They use tax deductions. They distort the national political debate. Everything we are now investigating is legal if they are done through these organizations: foreign governments, illegal organizations, individuals who simply want to distort the system through the exclusive use of their own money. 
   Some of these organizations may not be organizations at all. It could be a single individual writing $1 million or a multimillion-dollar check in the disguise of an organization. Compounding the problem, adding insult to injury, they are reducing it from their taxes. 
   Only a few days ago, in the State of New Jersey, two Republican primaries were influenced by these organizations. Candidates were campaigning, raising funds, gaining support, and these organizations with secret donors began their advertising campaigns. Not a single voter knew who they were, where they came from, what the moneys were about. They only heard the advertisements. 
   In some respects, this is not a policy question; it is a law enforcement problem. If these organizations coordinate with candidates and their campaigns, it already violates laws. It is incumbent upon the Justice Department to investigate them and prosecute them if necessary. 
   I trust on this day while the Senate debates this issue, the Justice Department will meet its responsibilities. But if they are not coordinated, they are legal. That burden falls on us. 
   I regret the difficulty this causes for Senator WARNER on this very important piece of legislation. His constitutional argument may be sound regarding the reaction of the House of Representatives. But the consequences of not acting are enormous. As chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, I have urged every Democratic senatorial candidate in the Nation not to engage in this practice of 527s, not to coordinate with them, because it is unethical and it is illegal--denounce them. 
   If we have learned anything by the soft money example and other exceptions that have been taken to the prevailing campaign finance laws, it is when a precedence is established and a campaign expenditure enters the political culture, it expands exponentially. This may be our last opportunity before the 2000 elections to close this new avenue of expression through large, unregulated, undisclosed political contributions. 
   Make no mistake, if we fail to do so, we do not simply invite the abuses of the last few elections, we may create a political system where we return to the type of campaigns before Watergate, where no one knew where the money was coming from, who was providing it, and what was being spent. 
   What little remains of this campaign finance system will collapse before our eyes, not in future years, but in future weeks. This Senate has failed to agree upon comprehensive campaign finance reform. While I regret that failure, I at least understand it. There are legitimate constitutional arguments, differences in philosophy and politics. 
   There can be no legitimate differences on outlawing these undisclosed, unregulated 527 organizations. This should be bipartisan and it should be a deep commitment upon which we act immediately. 
   I am proud to join with Senator LIEBERMAN in his amendment as a sponsor. I urge the Senate to act before it is too late. The consequences of inaction are enormous, and reconstructing this system, if indeed these organizations proliferate in the ensuing months, will be extremely difficult to impossible. I urge the Senate to act. 
   I thank the distinguished Senator from Wisconsin for the time and for his support for our amendment.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this Senate has been engaged in more than a decade of discussion about reforming the campaign finance system in the United States. Indeed, the Senate has not only debated the issue but has focused attention on McCain-Feingold, attention that brought about a national debate about how to change this system. The Senate may be on the verge of yet another discussion in the coming days. 
   I take the floor today because, while I praise Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD and, indeed, once again pledge my vote for their reform legislation, I believe it is a disservice for the Senate to believe there are no other contributions that can be made to solving the campaign finance dilemma. 
   McCain-Feingold, and the former comprehensive legislation, would be the best answer. It is not the only answer. There are a variety of very real problems to enacting this legislation that begin with legitimate constitutional problems, decisions by the Federal courts, legitimate differences on philosophical questions about how to conduct elections in America, and some real political problems. The reality is that whether I believe in McCain-Feingold or not, whether the entire Democratic caucus votes for it or not, it is not going to be enacted. That leads many to believe that simply, then, nothing will happen; there can be no change because there are not enough votes. 
   I believe that is not necessary, that does not have to be the final word. 
   Yesterday's primary election in the State of New Jersey, now setting a record of $31 million in expenditures in a single partisan primary, again focuses the Nation on the problem. Our campaign finance laws in the United States are recognized in the breach. There is no national governing system of campaign finance laws. They are misunderstood, violated, contradictory, and incomplete. Regrettably, there is a failure to look at the contributions that others can make and the alternatives that exist in law given the current deadlock in this Senate acting on campaign finance. 
   Indeed, to listen to the network anchors each evening--Mr. Rather, Mr. Brokaw, and Mr. Jennings--one would believe there are no other answers; this is simply a case of political candidates raising as much as can be raised in a complete vacuum of other considerations. 
   I believe that until this Congress acts and there is a majority for campaign finance reform, there are things that others can do and, indeed, it begins with the media itself. The costs of these campaigns are staggering, but I have never met a candidate for political office who wanted to raise money beyond what was actually required to win the race. It is not only a question of how much is being raised; it is how much the campaigns cost. 
   As my friend, MITCH MCCONNELL, has pointed out on a variety of occasions, America is not suffering from too much political discussion. There is not too much debate. Campaigns are simply too expensive. That begins with an analysis of where the money is going. 
   In New York City today, a 30-second prime time advertisement can cost $50,000. In Chicago, the same advertisement is $20,000. A 30-second ad on the late news in New York is $6,000; in Chicago, $4,500. The effect of this is obvious. 
   Year in and year out, the networks charge more money for the same advertisements for the use of the public airwaves, and an endless spiral of costs is driving campaign fundraising in America. Indeed, the same network anchors who rail against campaign fundraising almost every night are the principal beneficiaries of the campaign fundraiser. I do not know any candidate in  America who wants to raise this money voluntarily if they had a choice. There is no other means of communicating with the American people but to buy network television advertising, and I have never seen the cost of advertising go down. 
   The New York Times estimates that the 2000 elections in the United States will cost $3 billion. That is a 50-percent increase over 1996. Mr. President, $600 million of that advertising, or 20 percent, will be spent directly on network television advertising. That is a 40-percent increase over what the networks absorbed only 4 years ago. 
   Isolating the Presidential campaign in 1996, President Clinton and Senator Dole spent $113 million on television ads. Half of all the money they spent went to network television. This is done for a reason. It is not only the spiraling cost of network advertising far beyond the rate of inflation; far beyond the rate of increase of the cost of anything else in political campaigns is the networks themselves. They are the principal generating force in the rising cost of campaign 
   finance. 
   They are part of the problem not in one dimension but in two. From Labor Day through election day in 1998, ABC, CBS, and NBC aired 73 percent fewer election stories than they did in the same period in 1994. The amount of advertising is going up and the cost is going up because candidates' ability to communicate with the American people through legitimate news stories is going down. It is not going down marginally; it is not going down significantly; it is going down overwhelmingly. There is a 73 percent reduction in the amount of legitimate news stories aired over the public airwaves to inform the American electorate. 
   What, Mr. Rather, Mr. Jennings, and Mr. Brokaw, are candidates for elective office in the Democratic and Republican Parties to do? The amount of legitimate free news stories to inform the electorate is in a state of collapse. The number of Americans reading newspapers is declining. There is a similar reduction in the amount of newsprint for legitimate news stories, and your rates are skyrocketing. 
   The result is clear: Costs of campaigns are soaring. Indeed, there is a solution. The most obvious solution is we could change the national campaign finance laws. For constitutional reasons, philosophical reasons, and political reasons I have suggested, that is not about to happen. I suggest the networks, therefore, look at themselves and their own ability unilaterally to reduce the cost of advertising on the public airwaves. After all, the public airwaves are not their own province. It is not something for which they paid and own exclusively. These are the public airwaves, licensed to ABC, CBS, and NBC, with a public responsibility to the American people, a responsibility they do not meet. 
   No other democracy in the Western world allows private corporations to use the public airwaves exclusively for their own benefit charging candidates for national office what approach commercial rates to communicate with the people themselves. Use the people's airwaves, charge exorbitant rates to candidates for public office to communicate in a national election--it would not happen in Canada, and it does not happen in Britain, Germany, Italy, or France. It happens nowhere, but it happens here. 
   While we wait for this Congress to act, I challenge the network executives: Be part of the solution, not the principal cause of the problem. Act unilaterally until this Congress can act. But they do not.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   One can recognize why the networks are in this extraordinary hypocrisy. They are for campaign finance reform. They are against spending in national political campaigns increasing. Indeed, we all share that concern, but they are also the principal beneficiaries. 
   In 1998, automotive ads were 25 percent of all national 
   advertising. Retail sales were 15 percent. Political advertising was 10 percent of all revenues. They are offended at the cost of national political campaigns, but it is the third largest source of their funding. 
   Similarly, it is not a stable problem. Political ads are a rapidly rising, indeed, the largest increasing, source of network revenues, from 3 percent in 1990 to approaching 10 percent of all network revenues in the year 2000. What an extraordinary hypocrisy. 
   But it gets worse. They are for campaign finance reform, but they want the advertising revenues. What could be worse? The National Association of Broadcasters last year spent $260,000 in PAC money and soft money, often supporting candidates who are against campaign finance reform, and hundreds of thousands of dollars lobbying to protect their right to use the public airwaves at retail costs for people who need to communicate with the American electorate. 
   I applaud Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD for coming to this floor and fighting for campaign finance reform. I applaud my colleagues who have the courage to stand for it and fight for it. I always will. But changing the American political system in America to reduce money in the equation is not our fight; it is everybody's fight. 
   I could understand it if the networks were to be neutral, but to engage in this headlong daily criticism of the process while they profit by it is inexcusable. 
   My friends in the networks, join the fight. Help us reform the system. Lead by example. Reduce the costs of the public airwaves for the public good. Allow candidates to communicate ideas without exorbitant costs. And meet your public responsibilities by dedicating more--not less--time to discussions of the issues. Make that a legitimate discussion of real choices before the American people--not horse races, an accounting simply of expenditures in races. Be positive, be responsible, and be part of the process of change. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, first, I would like to thank Senators KERREY, DASCHLE, and ROBERTS who have worked to craft a national crop insurance reform bill. I rise in support of the Conference Report because it represents a fundamental shift in farm policy in its recognition of the importance of agriculture in the Northeast. 
   Historically, New Jersey farmers have been at a disadvantage when it comes to crop insurance for two principle reasons. First, many of the specialty crops they grow are not eligible for insurance. And second, because our region has a history of non-participation, many farmers fail to investigate what options they may be eligible for. They simply assume that they are not eligible or that the programs are not economically worthwhile. 
   Without crop insurance, farmers in my region will not be able to continue farming, they will be forced out of a way of life, they will be forced to sell their land. New Jersey may be the best example of what can happen when we do not protect our farmers. In 1959, New Jersey had 15,800 farms. Today we have 9,400. In 1959, New Jersey had 1,460,000 acres of farmland. Today we have but 800,000. 
   The current Federal Crop Insurance program has failed to curb the losses which farmers have experienced and has forced them to sell their land and their livelihood. It has facilitated the end of a way of life in New Jersey. 
   When the Senate passed its version of the crop insurance reform bill, it adopted the so-called ``Northeast Amendment'' drafted by myself, Senator SCHUMER, LEAHY, REED, ROCKEFELLER and others. The amendment has been almost entirely preserved in the Conference Report. The amendment is targeted at increasing participation in states in which there is traditionally, and continues to be, a low level of crop insurance participation and availability. 
   The conference report provides $50 million over five years for research to create new crop insurance policies. The goal is to develop new programs tailored to the crops in our region so that our farmers will find it economically worthwhile. 
   An additional $25 million over five years for education programs designed to inform farmers of the current crop insurance options available to them. This would include hiring more agents to sell insurance and more USDA officials to help farmers craft a strategy for their farm. This money will put in place the necessary human infrastructure. 
   The final provision of the Northeast amendment is $50 million over five years for payments to farmers who adopt certain conservation practices. The effect of this amendment will be to increase participation, by making it more attractive, more affordable, and more accessible to farmers who grow specialty crops and have low rates of participation in crop insurance. 
   But the Conference Report also vastly improves the situation for farmers who grow non-insurable crops by improving the Non-insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program (NAP). Because farmers who grow the majority of crops in my state do not qualify for crop insurance, the NAP program is the only assistance my farmers can rely on when their crops are decimated, as during last summer's drought. Under current law, losses in the region where a farmer grows must be extensive before a single farmer is eligible for NAP relief. The Conference Report removes this ``area trigger'' and ensures that farmers not eligible for crop insurance receive protection in times of hardship, regardless of whether they are the only farmer who suffered. 
   The Conference Report also addresses the needs of states like New Jersey by including additional provisions to develop broad specialty crop policies. These policies are designed to protect farmers who grow ``specialty crops'', fruits and vegetables which constitute many of the crops grown in the Northeast. By focusing on specialty crop product development, the bill truly addresses the needs of farmers in all regions throughout the country. Because of these provisions, I will support the bill and will urge my other Northeast colleagues to do the same. 
   However, I am extremely concerned that the $7.1 billion in emergency farm aid included in this bill essentially provides no relief to our region. The majority of this funding will be distributed in AMTA payments to farmers in the Midwest and South who grow commodity crops such as corn, soybeans, and wheat. It will not help the specialty crop farmers in New Jersey or anywhere else in the Northeast. This is unfortunate, considering that the farmers in my state are still suffering from last summer's drought. 
   The Senate will soon have another opportunity to provide this desperately needed relief when it considers the Agriculture Appropriations bill after Memorial Day. As written, this bill includes additional aid for dairy farmers, livestock and peanut farmers. But it still fails to address the situation faced by small family farmers throughout the Northeast. During consideration of that bill, I plan on offering an amendment with my colleagues from the Northeast that will provide some relief for the specialty crop farmers in our  region. I hope at the time we will enjoy the support of the other regions of the country who so generously are benefitting from the emergency aid included in this crop insurance bill. 
   Again, I want to thank Senators KERREY, ROBERTS, DASCHLE, HARKIN and LEAHY for their willingness to work with us during this process.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia for yielding the time. I commend the Senator from Virginia and my colleague, Senator BYRD from West Virginia, in bringing this issue before the Senate. 
   Before discussing Kosovo, or the provisions of the NATO treaty, there is something more paramount that should come before the Senate. It is not a treaty with a foreign nation or obligations in another land but our own Constitution and our own responsibilities in this country. 
   For too long, the foreign policy and military powers of the Congress have been yielded to the executive. This Congress has not been a jealous guardian of its own constitutional prerogatives. 
   Under our system of government and its Constitution, the military and foreign policy powers are shared between the executive and the legislative branches. By necessity, the Commander in Chief must have the ability to deploy troops and make command decisions in emergencies. Often there is not time to consult, certainly not time to receive permission. But the power remains shared because we have the responsibility for the resources of the Government. 
   The unfolding events in Kosovo that threaten to go not a matter of months but many years--even more than a decade--does not require emergency powers. There is no shortage of 
   time. There is an opportunity for our Constitution to function and for the President to return to this Chamber. 
   We are now having the debate in this Chamber. The Bundestag had theirs in Berlin a year ago. The British Parliament gave its assent. The National Assembly in Paris and the Italian Parliament have had their debate. This Congress, unlike the great democracies in Europe, has remained silent. Is our Constitution less? Do our people exercise less powers through their elected representatives than those in Germany or Italy or France? 
   Many Members have risen to talk about Kosovo. I rise to talk about the United States. There has been great concern for the NATO treaty. As did my colleagues from Virginia and West Virginia, I rise because I am concerned about our Constitution. 
   I believe there is a legitimate role for the United States in Kosovo. I strongly believe in the NATO treaty. The United States has met its responsibilities under the NATO treaty. 
   Strictly defined, that treaty was for the defense of Western Europe from external threats. By necessity, it was properly expanded at the end of the cold war to include legitimate internal threats to European order. 
   The United States was not a participant in dealing with that threat. We were a leader. Not a single European soldier would have been in Kosovo or Bosnia but for the U.S. Air Force. None of it could have been supported but for the U.S. Army. None of it would have been viable but for the U.S. Government. Our responsibilities were met. 
   But expanding the NATO treaty to include internal threats to Europe was one thing--legitimate, in my judgment--but expanding the NATO treaty to deal with permanent control of order and peacekeeping is another. 
   I believe we have met our responsibilities. I believe it is incumbent upon a new administration, next year, to return to this Congress and make the case, if it is possible, that it is necessary on an ongoing basis to have a near-permanent presence in Kosovo--no longer a crisis--now maintaining order. 
   It is not too much to ask the administration to make that case or this Congress to meet its responsibilities and act affirmatively upon the judgment. It will, in truth, not be an easy case to make. 
   Kosovo is a nation of a mere 2 million people. This long after the war in Kosovo, it must be made in a case to this Congress that 300 million Europeans, with a gross national product larger than the United States, with combined government resources in excess of the United States, are unable to maintain these modest numbers of troops to maintain order within their own borders, on their own continent, for their own purposes. 
   It is not a question of our unwillingness to respond to crises or threats, but to learn to separate the crisis response from the near permanent presence to maintain order. 
   The final point made against this amendment is the most extraordinary of all, that our credibility is at issue. Who could rise to challenge the credibility of the U.S. Government to international security or the defense of freedom--which of our NATO allies? Fifty-five years after the close of World War II, tens of millions of American young men and women have served in western Europe. Our presence remains, at an expenditure of hundreds of billions of dollars. Who among our NATO allies could rise and say that our credibility is in question? But for the United States, there would have been no operation in Bosnia or in Kosovo. It was made possible by the U.S. Government. 
   This Government's credibility is not at issue. Fifty years after the war in Korea, we and we alone remain on the line to defend freedom. A decade after the war in the Persian Gulf, often we and we alone remain resolute in defiance of Saddam Hussein. Twelve years after the destruction at Lockerbie, we alone have to convince our allies to remain strong against Libya. We alone often maintain vigilance against those few remaining Communist states where freedom is eclipsed. The credibility of the U.S. Government is not at issue. 
   What is at issue is the constitutional prerogatives of this institution. It remains a question of Europe meeting responsibilities not for crisis response, which we share under NATO, but for maintaining order on a near permanent basis. It is not an issue of credibility. 
   There is a fourth issue. Kosovo is not the last crisis this Government is going to deal with in international order or maintaining peace and stability.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. A future American President is going to have to factor in, in responding to a crisis in Asia or North Africa or the Middle East, that American ships and planes are on station supporting operations in Kosovo, not dealing with a crisis but on a police patrol. The number of forces may not be great, but, indeed, our resources are very strained. Is it fair to this country, the security of the United States, that we will have to at some point forgo defending interests elsewhere because our forces are substituting what Europe should be doing in Kosovo? 
   No, Mr. President, our credibility is not at issue, nor our resolve. Whether or not this generation of Senators and Members of the House defend its prerogatives under the Constitution is at issue. 
   I commend the gentleman from Virginia for bringing this before the Senate.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Lao Veterans of America as they mark the 25th Annual Remembrance of the United States involvement in Laos. During the Vietnam War, many brave Laotians and their families chose to fight along side American soldiers against the North Vietnamese as part of the United States Special Forces. These brave souls took great risks, and deserve our recognition and thanks. 
   Those represented by the Lao Veterans of America served honorably during the conflict in Vietnam. They fought bravely to prevent the North Vietnamese from invading South Vietnam from Laos, and rescued shot down American pilots and brought them to safety. Through their actions, countless American lives were saved. These heroic deeds often placed the veterans and their families' lives in great risk as a result.  
   The selfless aid of the Lao Veterans of America is a true testament to the cause of freedom around the world. While the causes of this tragic conflict may continue to be debated, I believe we can all agree that the sacrifices of the Laotian veterans and their families should not be forgotten, as we owe them a great debt of gratitude.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, this month I join people in New Jersey and throughout the nation in celebrating Pacific-American Heritage Month. The Pacific-American community represents an important part of America's future and I applaud their proud celebration of heritage and community. 
   Taiwanese-American Heritage Week, from May 7 to May 14, celebrates the unique and diverse contributions of the more than 500,000 Taiwanese-Americans in the United States. These Americans have played a significant role in our nation's life and their countless accomplishments can be found in every facet of American society. For instance, Taiwanese-Americans have succeeded as notable artists, Nobel Laureate scientists, researchers, human rights activists, and business leaders. 
   In addition to recognizing these contributions, this is an excellent opportunity to celebrate the success of democracy on the island of Taiwan. Since 1987, the Taiwanese people have possessed the rights to select their own leaders, practice the religion of their choice, and express their thoughts openly and freely. Taiwan is a vibrant and democratic participant in the family of nations. 
   The election on March 18 of opposition leader Chen Shui-bian as president, and my friend Annette Lu as vice-president, represents the crowning achievement of the struggle of the people of Taiwan for full-fledged democracy and freedom. While Taiwan has established a model democracy, there remain political challenges. Gaining worldwide recognition of the legitimacy of Taiwan's government is paramount. With all that Taiwanese and Taiwanese-Americans have accomplished there is still more work to be done before Taiwan's status and global contributions are properly respected and appreciated. 
   Mr. President, Taiwanese-American Heritage Week recognizes the longstanding friendship between the United States and Taiwan. I commend the great accomplishments and contributions of the Taiwanese-American community.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution that would greatly improve the lives of thousands of New Jersey residents. 
   Healthcare in New Jersey has a long history of innovation and advancement. From the large number of pharmaceutical companies that create new medicines, to the hospitals and facilities where innovative therapies are develop, New Jersey remains one of the most progressive healthcare States in the country. This State was one of the first to introduce and pass a comprehensive patient's bill of rights, and one of the first to recognize the importance of expanding access to healthcare to children and low income families. 
   One of New Jersey's greatest innovations, and one which truly demonstrates the community based approach which has been so successful, is the development of our Emergency Medical Services (EMS) system. The current EMS system in New Jersey, which has been in place for roughly 25 years, was designed as a modern remedy to the age old problem of guaranteeing access to emergency transport, while at the same time preserving local involvement in the delivery of services and preventing skyrocketing costs. 
   The New Jersey EMS system accomplished all three goals by establishing a two-tiered approach to emergency transport. This two-tiered system includes volunteer and for-profit Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) who provide basic life support (BLS), and hospital-based paramedics, who provide advanced life support (ALS). Basic and advanced life support are differentiated by the status of the victim, with the most serious injuries, such as heart attacks, treated by ALS paramedics. 
   The two-tiered system has been an unqualified success in New Jersey, providing universal access for all residents to affordable emergency services, while simultaneously ensuring that those persons in need of the most advanced care receive it from the proper authorities. The system allows almost 500 local volunteer emergency medical technician (EMT) squads to blanket the entire State with quick and effective initial responses to emergencies. In the case of more serious emergencies, paramedics are strategically stationed at various hospitals throughout the State to provide secondary assistance. In either case, the EMTs will generally transport patients to the hospital with the paramedics, if necessary, along to provide care. 
   There are currently an estimated 20,000 EMTs providing ambulance transportation for virtually all BLS and ALS emergencies, close to 400,000 calls each year. It is estimated that over 80 percent of these calls are handled by volunteers who are not reimbursed by Medicare. In contrast, the hospital-based paramedics, also known as mobile intensive care units (MICUs), are reimbursed by Medicare when they respond to ALS emergencies, just as all other paramedics. 
   Unfortunately, the great success of this system would be jeopardized if the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) finalizes plans to implement new rules regarding the reimbursement of EMS services. The new HCFA EMS guidelines propose to only provide reimbursement to hospital-based paramedics. This would have the effect of requiring them to be the only responders to provide transport for all victims in order to be reimbursed by Medicare. This, in turn, would eliminate the two-tier structure by solely recognizing MICUs, and thus also eliminate the need for volunteer EMS units, which currently provide the bulk of the transport. Under the new rules, there would be no incentive for EMS units to respond to calls of they know their mission has been given to MICUs. 
   While I applaud HCFAs intentions in releasing the new rules, which are designed to control costs by enforcing one, standardized, system throughout the country, I am dismayed by the impact this will have on New Jersey. Our system, when compared to the system HCFA is set to approve, would save an estimated $39 million annually, due to the preponderance of BLS calls and the large number of EMS volunteers who respond to these calls. But beyond the cost savings, the elimination of EMS units would jeopardize the prompt service that New Jersey residents have come to rely on. 
   The resolution I am submitting today seeks to emphasize the benefits of two-tiered EMS in my State, and request that HCFA do its best to preserve this highly beneficial and cost effective system. HCFA has always been a strong supporter of measures that improve the delivery of healthcare services, while lowering the cost to taxpayers. I believe that once they have been made fully aware of the importance of this issue, the agency will act responsibly and include an exemption for New Jersey. 
   It is my hope that the Senate will see the importance of supporting my resolution, not just for the impact it will have on the residents of my State, by also for the statement it will make about the Heath Care Financing Administration's mission.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Marie Cascone Rotunda, an outstanding New Jerseyan who has dedicated her distinguished career to the service of others. A selfless individual and member of the Trenton community, she is being honored with the prestigious Community Service Award by the Grandville Academy National. 
   The revered American poet Walt Whitman once wrote ``Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity. When I give, I give myself.'' It is clear that Marie Cascone Rotunda's many years of community service is the embodiment of this notion. She has tirelessly given of herself through her dedication to many noble and charitable causes. She has served with the International Special Olympics, taken it upon herself to create an emergency food pantry in the Township of Lawrence and for the past several years, she has focused much of her effort in supporting the Sunshine Foundation, which helps chronically and terminally ill children realize their dreams and fulfill their wishes. Furthermore she has spearheaded fund raising efforts that have raised over $2 million for charitable causes in her community. 
   The Trenton community is truly fortunate to have been graced by such a talented and caring person. New Jersey is proud of this distinguished individual who has touched so many lives. Marie is an exemplar of the coveted American ideals of compassion and community service, and it is my honor to recognize her tremendous achievements today.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Shitama Manzo Sensei and Takaki Masanori Sensei of the Seikiryukan Dojo upon the occasion of their visit to the United States. As the 16th headmaster of Sosuishi-ryu Jujutsu and kancho of the Seikiryukan, Shitama Manzo Sensei with the aid of Takaki Masanori Sensei, chief instructor of the Seikiryukan, have provided exemplary leadership and dedication in their oversight of the instruction of Jujutsu and Judo for many years. 
   The Seikiryukan Dojo has a history dating back centuries as the bombu of Sosuishi-ryu Jujutsu. It is dedicated to the ethical and physical principles that compose the martial arts of Jujutsu and Judo and was one of the first martial arts schools in Japan to teach the United States Military Jujutsu and Judo. 
   Shitama Manzo Sensei and Takaki Masanori have given much of their time and energy working for the betterment of others. I am appreciative of the opportunity to recognize men of such charter and conviction who work at teaching other their honorable ways.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, 2 weeks ago it was a Michigan nursing home and Monday night it was a shootout at the National Zoo here in Washington, D.C. The epidemic of gun violence has become something that affects all Americans, not only those living in our inner cities. 
   Whenever we open our morning newspapers and read about these tragedies, we are left to wonder whether our loved ones might be the next victims and whether our own community, our own neighborhood, and our own home could be tomorrow's headlines. 
   The devastation that guns have brought to our families and to our communities has been well documented, but the statistics bear repeating. Only with an understanding of the dimensions of the problem will we ever bring real change. 
   In 1997 alone, more than 32,000 Americans were shot and killed, including 4,000 children. 
   The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates by the year 2006 firearms will become the largest single killer of our own children in the United States. 
   The economic cost of every shooting death in society--if it is necessary to measure it in these cold terms--is $1 million per victim in medical care, police services, and lost productivity. 
   The American public has grown tired of hearing of these appalling statistics. And so have I. More importantly, they have grown tired of a Congress that does nothing about it, with no real efforts to stop this bloodshed. 
   Last April, it seemed that the senseless death of 12 students at Columbine High School had finally brought the Nation to a point of judgment. It even appeared to me that this Congress had finally had enough. The shocking and heartbreaking nature of the tragedy, which was really unlike anything in its dimensions that the Nation had faced before, appeared to convince the Congress that it could no longer ignore the problem. 
   Indeed, this Senate, in one of its finer moments since I became a Member of this institution, courageously passed a juvenile justice bill that included three basic gun safety measures: It banned the possession of assault weapons by minors; it closed the gun show loophole; and it mandated safety locks on all firearms. 
   Originally, we had sought a more comprehensive solution that would restrict gun sales to one per month, a reasonable proposal; reinstate the Brady waiting period, proven to be an effective proposal; and regulate guns as consumer products, certainly a worthwhile proposal. 
   But we limited ourselves to those other basic provisions in the interests of a consensus, with a belief that they were so sensible and so necessary that there could be no reasonable opposition. So before the debate even began, the proposals had been limited to what should have represented a consensus view, leaving the more ambitious but still reasonable proposals for another day. 
   But now, with the 1-year anniversary of the Columbine 
   shootings having passed, it is clear that our confidence, perhaps even our strategy, was misguided. Today, the bill languishes in conference--an unfortunate reminder that no gun law is too important or too responsible that it cannot be opposed by the National Rifle Association. 
   In place of changes, the Republican leadership and the NRA have offered the American public flimsy rhetoric that blames gun violence on poor enforcement of existing gun laws. The NRA erroneously claims that prosecutions have plummeted under the Clinton administration when, in fact, these prosecutions rose by 25 percent last year. 
   This campaign provides nothing but further evidence that this agenda is not aimed at protecting our communities, but it is aimed at protecting the status quo--a status quo that most Americans a long time ago decided was unacceptable. 
   No one disputes the fact that enforcement is a critical element of any response to this problem. That is why, indeed, on this side of the aisle we have supported 1,000 new ATF agents and 1,000 new prosecutors to deal with gun violence. 
   But as much as we have done, we can always do more; while laws are being enforced, they can be enforced better. But no one can reasonably believe that enforcement alone constitutes a comprehensive or sufficient answer to this national epidemic. 
   Better enforcement of every gun law ever written will not prevent the 1,500 accidental shootings that are occurring every year. Enforcement of every gun law on the books would not prevent a 6-year-old boy from bringing his father's gun to school and killing a 6-year-old classmate. Nor does it address the fact that 43 percent of parents leave their guns unsecured, and 13 percent have unsecured guns loaded or with ammunition nearby. Enforcing gun laws, vigorous prosecutions, would answer none of those problems. 
   These realities point to the need for a broad approach to gun control. The provisions contained in the juvenile justice bill are the first steps, but they are important first steps. 
   The real answer--perhaps the challenge that should have come to this Congress last year--is to bring the entire issue to the Senate, and build upon what is already in the juvenile justice bill by also challenging the Senate to restrict the sale of firearms to one per month, a simple provision which would help eliminate the problem under which my State is suffering, where people go to other States and buy large numbers of firearms and transport them to the cities of New Jersey, selling them, often to children, out of the trunks of cars. 
   Second, reinstitute the Brady waiting period on handgun purchases to prevent individuals in fits of rage and passion from acting upon their emotions with a gun. Separate the rage of the individual from the purchase of the firearm, giving a cooling off period that can and would save lives. Most important, we must do on the Federal level what Massachusetts recently did on the State level: regulate firearms as consumer products. Firearms remain the only consumer product in America not regulated for safety, a strange, inexplicable, peculiar exception to the law because they are inherently the most dangerous consumer products of them all. 
   It is, indeed, an absurd, inexplicable contradiction that a toy gun remains regulated but a real gun is not. Consumer regulation would ensure that, as every other product in America, guns are safely designed, built, and distributed, not only for the benefit of the public but also for the people who purchase them. Indeed, who has a greater interest in gun safety by design and construction than the people who buy guns? If the materials are imperfect, if they do not work properly, it is the gun owner who is going to be hurt. 
   Together these three measures would make a real difference in ending gun violence. Would they end all gun violence? Would they end all crime? Indeed, not. No single provision, no amendment, no law, no single action could eliminate all gun violence or most gun violence. But if we await a perfect solution, we will act upon no solution. Ending the problems of violence and guns in America is not something that will be done by one Congress or one legislative proposal in any one year or probably in any one decade. It is successive ideas in succeeding Congresses where people of goodwill put the public interest first and look for real and serious answers to this epidemic of violence. 
   As long as the NRA is allowed to dominate the gun debate in place of common sense and compassion, the Columbines of the future are sadly, even tragically, inevitable. It is time for Congress to finally muster the courage to act responsibly on this issue out of concern for our children. Out of respect for the memories of those who have died, we can and should do nothing less. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator REID of Nevada for giving me the time earlier in the debate. 
   My colleague from North Carolina, Mr. EDWARDS, rose to remind our colleagues that while the flooding earlier in the year may be over and not in the headlines of our newspapers, Hurricane Floyd is still a reality for many communities around our country. 
   Towns such as Bound Brook, NJ--and, as indeed Mr. EDWARDS pointed out, Princeville, NC--Florida to Maine, Hurricane Floyd left a path of destruction so large that FEMA declared it to  be the eighth worst disaster of the decade. In New Jersey by comparison, it was worse: 
   Two-hundred and fifty-three municipalities in New Jersey, the populations of 4.2 million people, were stricken. 
   More than 43,000 structures, including homes, schools, and businesses, suffered severe damage. 
   Over 20,000 residents of New Jersey alone applied for Federal assistance, and municipalities submitted over 2,000 requests for public assistance to remove debris or to repair damages. 
   While FEMA has led an effort of providing assistance to homeowners, the greatest problem is how to rebuild their own economic infrastructure. 
   Bound Brook, NJ, alone, a community that was entirely inundated by this flooding, lost 7 percent of its annual revenue and 37 percent of its property value. A month after Floyd, the New Jersey government appropriated $80 million for disaster relief. 
   The reality is that the magnitude of the loss is so overwhelming that, without Federal aid, these communities will not simply suffer--some will actually cease to exist. 
   Main Streets were inundated, businesses lost, local governments lost revenues. 
   They will close their doors and no longer be the communities where people live and work. 
   The amendment I have offered with Mr. EDWARDS provides needed resources by increasing funding for communities in a regional development by $250 million. It includes $150 million for community development block grants; $50 million for the EDA; $50 million for community facilities block grants. 
   This, my colleagues, is not an unusual approach. In 1997 the supplemental disaster bill provided flood aid for the upper Midwest of $500 million for communities in desperate need in North and South Dakota and Minnesota. 
   In 1998, the disaster supplemental bill provided $250 million for community development block grants in Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands as they recovered from Hurricane George. 
   Now we return to those States damaged from Florida to Maine, particularly in North Carolina, Delaware, Maryland, New York, and New Jersey. Hurricane Floyd destroyed many of our communities. We need this Congress to respond again. 
   Tomorrow this amendment will be offered. I hope in this budget resolution we can make room for this $250 million to respond to the need of these communities. 
   I thank the Senator from Nevada for yielding and I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, I rise to commend the Senate for passing, last Thursday, S. 835, the Estuary Habitat Restoration Partnership Act. Section 12 of this legislation is taken from legislation that I introduced, S. 878, with Senators BOXER, GREGG, MACK, GRAHAM, KENNEDY, LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, REED, FEINSTEIN, KERRY, MURRAY, and SARBANES. 
   Today our nationally significant estuaries are threatened by pollution, development, or overuse. With 45 percent of the Nation's population residing in estuarine areas, there is a compelling need for us to promote comprehensive planning and management efforts to restore and protect them. 
   Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife because they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy-five percent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during some stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries contribute $111 billion to the nation's economy and support 1.5 million jobs. Estuaries are also important to our nation's tourist economy for boating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four states--New Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion. 
   Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our nations's estuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. This is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development and fast growing year round populations which increase dramatically in the summer. Nowhere is this more pronounced than New Jersey. At Barnegat Bay, the population doubles in the summer months. 
   Land development, and associated activities that come with people's desire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause runoff and storm water discharges that contribute to siltation, increased nutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination closes many popular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in estuaries. Also, several estuaries are afflicted by problems that still require significant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the toxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in Maryland and Virginia. 
   Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing coastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary Program in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The Program's purpose is to facilitate state and local governments preparation of comprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened estuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, Section 320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to states to develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across the country have been designated. However, the law fails to provide assistance once plans are complete and ready for implementation. Already, 22 of the 28 plans are finished. 
   As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is incumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal government initiated ten years ago to insure that our nationally significant estuaries are protected. S. 835 will take the next step by including language from S. 878 that will give EPA the authority to make  grants for plan implementation and authorize annual appropriations in the amount of $25 million. I am also hopeful that when this bill goes to conference, this authorization can be increased to $50 million. With such an increase areas will be able to upgrade sewage treatment plants, fix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater discharges, and reduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will eliminate burdensome and unnecessary regulations which are devastating the nation's limousine companies, 80 percent of which are small business owners. 
   Federal Highway Administration regulations grant limo operators the right to cross states lines ``without interference''. Yet local entities across the U.S. have taken it upon themselves to establish unnecessary bureaucracies for the purpose of placing excessive and arbitrary requirements upon limo operators that enter their jurisdictions. 
   Current law already requires limo operators to be certified and registered at three different stages: the U.S. Department of Transportation; the state in which they principally operate; and the locality in which the business is located. Therefore, company owners, drivers, and vehicles must already comply with a myriad of safety and financial requirements that includes carrying at least $1.5 million in liability insurance. Public safety is clearly being upheld. 
   Yet, after satisfying these three stages of compliance, limo operators often find that there is a fourth, fifth, sixth and sometimes even more bureaucratic hoops to jump through to simply conduct their business. This happens when a locality sets up a Local Taxi and Limousine Commission to place certification requirements not only on companies located in their jurisdiction, but on any other limo that enters their locality to pick up or drop off a customer. These additional licenses can cost up to several hundred dollars annually--and that's just to enter one jurisdiction. 
   The purpose of the CARR ACT is simple. It says that if a limo operator has satisfied federal, state, and local requirements, no other state or entity has the authority to establish additional requirements. The bill will not lower the quality of service which the public expects from the limousine industry nor does it compromise public safety. In fact, my legislation does not affect any safety regulations or financial requirements on interstate operations required by the U.S. DOT nor does it affect the power of states to regulate safety or financial responsibility as they may do under current law. 
   The same protections were granted to the trucking industry in 1995, to the armor car industry in 1997, and to the chartered bus industry under TEA-21. The time for these protections to be extended to the limousine industry is long overdue. No small business should be faced with the unfair and excessive bureaucracy faced by the nation's 9,000 limousine operators.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I am certain he understands many of us believe that the long, slow erosion of the agricultural community in the Northeast must come to an end. Those who are engaged in specialty crops and other products in New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Massachusetts, and other States have suffered very badly in recent years. 
   I think the agreement we have come to is of some real note. That is, this isn't simply an agricultural crop insurance program; it is now a national program. For the first time in my experience, we have reached across the Nation's borders, coast to coast, and designed a program that can work for every State. This is a very important moment for the State of New Jersey and preserving those farms that remain. I am grateful and very much appreciate his commitment to fight vigorously in conference so that the Senate provisions prevail. I thank the Senator.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that will help bring more criminals to justice and create a better federal judicial system in New Jersey. This legislation will divide the federal District of New Jersey into the Southern and Northern Districts of New Jersey which will enable the federal courts and federal agencies to better serve the approximately 8 million residents of the state. It will also bring much needed federal law enforcement resources to the state, particularly southern New Jersey. 
   Under the bill, the proposed Southern District of New Jersey would include 8 of the 21 counties in New Jersey and the Northern District of New Jersey would include the remaining 13. The federal courthouses would be located in Camden and Trenton for the Southern District and in Newark for the Northern District. All federal cases arising in the eight-county Southern District would be heard in the federal court in Camden or Trenton and cases from the 13-county Northern District would be heard in Newark. The bill would also result in the creation of several new federal positions for the Southern District including a Clerk of the Court, U.S. Attorney, U.S. Marshal, and a Federal Public Defender, among others. 
   By creating a new Southern District of New Jersey, more federal crime-fighting resources will be brought to a region which crime statistics reveal is besieged by violent crime. In 1998, southern New Jersey accounted for 25 percent of the state's urban murders, 32 percent of the state's murder arrests and 33 percent of the state's arrests for violent crimes. This initiative will also ensure that crime-fighting decisions are made locally instead of by officials who are based elsewhere in the state and that law enforcement officials in the region will get the resources needed to prosecute crimes effectively and expeditiously. 
   The creation of two districts will also provide relief from the crush of cases that have crowded the dockets of the federal courts in southern New Jersey and caused a severe backlog in the system. In 1998 alone, 281 federal criminal  cases were filed in federal courts in southern New Jersey and 161 criminal cases were still pending at the end of the year. In that same year, 2,116 civil cases were filed and 1,318 civil cases were pending at the end of the year. Moreover, of the 95 federal judicial districts across the nation, more than half generated fewer criminal and civil cases than southern New Jersey and in some cases with far more federal judicial and law enforcement resources. Currently, only 10 percent of the FBI agents, 15 percent of the United States Marshals and 18 percent of the Drug Enforcement Administration agents in New Jersey are assigned to the region. Of the 119 Assistant United States Attorneys in the state, only 12 are assigned to South Jersey. 
   Finally, the creation of a new Northern and Southern Districts of New Jersey is warranted based on the sheer size of the state. The current District of New Jersey is the third most populous federal judicial district in the nation. Of the 25 states that have a single federal judicial district, New Jersey has the largest population and more than a dozen states with smaller populations have multiple judicial districts. In fact, with more than 2 million residents in the southern counties, the population of the proposed Southern District of New Jersey would exceed that of almost half of the current judicial districts and the proposed Northern District would rank even higher. 
   This initiative enjoys broad bipartisan political support in New Jersey, and a similar bill has been introduced and cosponsored in the U.S. House of Representatives by the entire southern New Jersey Congressional delegation. The measure also has strong support in the southern counties and is backed by all eight southern county bar associations, the South Jersey Police Chief's Association, the Chamber of Commerce of Southern New Jersey and various former county prosecutors and former federal law enforcement officials. 
   While the process of reviewing and deliberating the merits of this legislation will be lengthy and time consuming, this is an idea which is long overdue. The citizens of New Jersey deserve a better federal judicial system and their fair share of federal crime-fighting resources. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure passage of this legislation.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, during this generation we have witnessed the greatest expansion of democratic nations in history. From East Asia to Eastern Europe to Latin America and the islands of the Pacific, the blessings of democratic pluralism have expanded to the very bounds of each continent. It is in the proudest legacies of this Nation that the United States has played an essential role in facilitating the transition of these nations to democracy and their protection at critical moments. 
   From military defense to economic assistance, it is questionable whether Korea, Poland, Haiti, and scores of other nations would be free if it were not for the leadership of the United States. Now this generation of American leadership has a new challenge. As certainly as our parents and grandparents fought to ensure that these nations would have an opportunity to be free, it is our responsibility to assure that these fledgling democracies have an opportunity to remain free, a challenge that democracy is not a transitional state but a permanent condition of mankind, and the nations that would represent them. 
   There is one threat developing now before us to this proposition. It involves the people of Taiwan. During the late 1980s and 1990s, Taiwan underwent an extraordinary transformation from an authoritarian regime to a genuine democracy. Taiwan provided an example of peaceful political evolution from a military and authoritarian government to a true pluralist democracy with little violence, no military confrontation, and without a revolution. 
   After years of justifying tight security control, step by step, year by year, Taiwan created a genuine democracy. In 
   1986, a formal opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party, was formed. And in 1987, martial law was ended after more than 40 years. In 1991, President Lee ended the Government's emergency powers to deal with dissent and a new, freely elected legislature chosen by the people was created. In 1996, Taiwan's democracy had matured to the point that a Presidential election was held. Taiwan had fully developed. Democracy had come of age. 
   Now, in only a few days, on March 18, Taiwan will hold its second democratic Presidential election. The challenge to this democracy and the rights of freedom of press, worship, and assembly so central to maintaining human freedom are no longer under attack from within. The pressure is from Beijing. On the very eve of these elections, the People's Republic of China issued a statement that constitutes a new threat to Taiwanese democracy. China recently  issued its so-called white paper which warned that if Taiwan indefinitely delays negotiations on reunification, China will ``adopt all drastic measures possible, including the use of force.'' 
   This goes beyond China's previous statements that it would take Taiwan by force only if it declares independence or were occupied by a foreign power. The more democratic Taiwan has become, the lower the bar appears to be for military intervention and a hostile settling of the Taiwan issue. 
   These aggressive statements obviously only serve to increase tension in the region and make a peaceful settlement among the people of Taiwan and the People's Republic of China much more difficult. This belligerent approach obviously has precedent, almost an exact precedent. In 1996, also on the eve of a Presidential election in Taiwan, the People's Republic launched missiles in a crude attempt to intimidate the people of Taiwan as they approached their election. 
   It now appears that the election of Taiwan's new President will be close. It is critical to the functioning of Taiwan's democracy that they thwart any belief in Beijing that intimidation will solve or contribute to the relationship between these peoples. It is critical that the people of Taiwan stand resolute and that their voters not allow these actions to intimidate them. 
   There is obviously an American role. The United States must respond to this ultimatum by making it absolutely clear that our position is firm; it is unequivocal. The dispute between Taiwan and Beijing will not be settled by military means, and the United States, in a policy that is not unique to Taiwan, will not idly witness a free people in a democratic nation be invaded or occupied and have their political system altered by armed aggression. 
   This, I believe, is the cornerstone of American foreign policy in the postwar period. It remains central to who we are as a people and our role as the world's largest and most powerful democracy. Any ambiguity will, on the other hand, only serve to embolden Beijing and can lead to dangerous misinterpretations and miscalculations. 
   There is, within this Congress, the opportunity to end any possible ambiguity. The House of Representatives has passed, and the Senate has before it, the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act. Senator HELMS and I introduced this legislation last year in the Senate. The House has spoken overwhelmingly in favor of our legislation, as modified. The question is before this Senate. 
   The legislation Senator HELMS and I have offered is designed to ensure Taiwan's ability to meet its defensive security needs and to resist Chinese intimidation. It imposes no new obligations on the United States. The legislation, as passed by the House, will simply strengthen the process for selling defense articles by requiring an annual report to Congress on Taiwan's defense requests and ensuring that Taiwan has full access to data on defense articles. It mandates the sale of nothing. It requires the transfer of no specific article. It does guarantee that this Congress understand the security situation, Taiwan's requests, and a flow of information. It improves Taiwan's military readiness by supporting Taiwan's participation in U.S. military academies, ensuring that their military personnel are trained, understand American doctrine, and could coordinate if there were a crisis. This is not only good for Taiwan, it is good for the United States, ensuring that if tragically there ever should be a confrontation, our own Armed Forces are in the best position to train people familiar with our doctrine and any mutual obligations. 
   Finally, it requires that the United States establish secure, direct communications between the American Pacific Command and Taiwan's military. Nothing would be more tragic than to enter into a military confrontation by mistake or misinformation. This ensures reliable, fast, secure information so the situation is available to our own military commanders. 
   The legislation does not commit the United States to take any specific military actions now, later, or ever. A full range of options are available to the President and to the Congress. It also does not alter or amend our commitments under the Taiwan Relations Act. Rather, it helps us to fulfill those commitments under the act and ensures that Taiwan's security needs are 
   adequately met. 
   If we pass this legislation, it makes it less likely that we will become engaged in any future conflict because there will be no ambiguity, no chance of miscalculation because of Taiwan's ability to strengthen itself, and because of our mutual ability to assess defensive needs, less chance of a military calculation in the mistaken belief that either Taiwan will not be defended or have the ability to defend itself. 
   There is an important national interest in integrating the People's Republic of China into the world's economy and in promoting the growth of democracy and human rights in a nation that will play a vital role in the coming century. But our overall relationship cannot possibly develop quickly and positively if China continues to seek a military solution to the question of its relations with the people of Taiwan. 
   By not making our policy clear, by not assessing the military situation, we do not contribute to the avoidance of military conflict. We enhance the possibility of military conflict. This legislation, I believe, is a strong statement that avoids miscalculation and lessens the chances of conflict. President Clinton made a strong statement last week in support of a peaceful resolution of this issue when he said:  
   Issues between Beijing and Taiwan must be resolved peacefully and with the assent of the people of Taiwan.  
   This formulation's emphasis on the ``assent of the people''--the words used by President Clinton--is new and important. 
   Together with this Taiwan Enhancement Security Act, I believe it is an important contribution in this current debate on the problems of Taiwan security. It is, most importantly, in accord with the language of the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act as passed by the House, which states, ``Any determination of the ultimate status of Taiwan must have the express consent of the people of Taiwan.'' 
   The Taiwan Enhancement Security Act, therefore, and President Clinton's own statement in response to recent provocations by Beijing, are not only similar, they are identical. I believe the House of Representatives, in changing the Helms-Torricelli approach, has made a valuable contribution. I believe, for the maintenance of the peace and ensuring this Nation's commitment, that those nations which have chosen to be democratic, pluralist nations, governed with the consent of their own people--the commitment of this Nation that those nations will not by force of arms or intervention have their forms of government changed or altered will be enhanced. 
   Taiwan, today, is the cornerstone of that American commitment. Tomorrow, it could be Africa or Latin America. How we stand now on the eve of these free elections in Taiwan will most assuredly constitute a powerful message in all other places where others would challenge these new and fledgling democracies. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that I rise to thank my colleagues for their support of the nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   There has been much discussion of late of the slow pace at which the Senate has moved to confirm judicial nominees in the 106th Congress. It is a fact of which no one should be proud. Each judicial seat that we leave vacant slows the administration of the courts and access to justice for the American people. 
   That being said, I want to publicly thank Senator HATCH who has repeatedly--and admirably--demonstrated his commitment to moving nominees through the Judiciary Committee in a timely fashion. I want to thank both Senator HATCH and Senator LEAHY for their support in assuring Judge Fuentes' confirmation. 
   The vote that we took this evening on Judge Fuentes is an important step towards easing the burdens on the courts. It is also evidence that a qualified candidate with broad support can get a fair vote in this Senate and move quickly from a hearing to confirmation. Judge Fuentes' nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee just last week by a unanimous voice vote. 
   George Washington once said, ``The Administration of Justice is the firmest pillar of government.'' As I stand here today I am reminded of that quote because long after we all leave the Senate, those who sit on the Judiciary will continue to impact public policy and the lives of other Americans. When I recommended Judge Fuentes, I did so with the utmost confidence that he was well-suited to such great responsibility. In fact, I first considered Judge Fuentes for the position of District Court Judge. However, it soon became apparent that his stellar qualifications were so impressive that he deserved consideration for the Third Circuit. And I note with considerable pride that Judge Fuentes will be the first person of Hispanic descent to serve on the Third Circuit. 
   His career has been distinguished by a solid record of public service, which began in 1966 when he left college for three years to serve in the United States Army, including service in the Airborne Rangers. From his days in law school to his current tenure on NJ's Superior Court, he has demonstrated that he is an accomplished attorney who has made a commitment to improving the quality of justice in our society. I have no doubt that he will bring these same qualities to the federal bench. 
   A graduate of SUNY--Buffalo School of Law, Judge Fuentes began his legal career in private practice where he worked for 7 years on both civil and criminal matters. For his last three years in private practice, he also served as a part-time Judge on Newark's Municipal Court. Then in 1981, he assumed the bench full-time as a Municipal Judge where he remained until 1987 when he was promoted to the New Jersey Superior Court. 
   In his now 13 years on the Superior Court, he has built a reputation as a fair and able jurist. When you speak with those who have had the opportunity to work with Judge Fuentes throughout this distinguished career, they universally praise his integrity as well as the depth and breadth of his knowledge of the law. And those who know him well describe him as bright, dedicated, and compassionate. 
   I could not be more confident that Judge Fuentes is the right person to fill this seat--a view that is shared by those best in a position to know the Judge's qualifications. New Jersey's Governor Christie Whitman, the New Jersey State Bar Association, and the Hispanic Bar Association--both nationally and in New Jersey--have written letters enthusiastically supporting the Judge's nomination. 
   I am extremely proud to support Judge Fuentes nomination to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. I know he will be a superb addition to the bench.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank my colleague. 
   At this point I think every argument has been made and almost everybody has made them. This Senate has now looked at the question of education savings accounts from every possible perspective. I know these arguments, both for and against the legislation, have been sincerely made. But, indeed, I fear that what is the beginning of a long and detailed analysis of the problems of American education has been plagued by a perennial senatorial problem, and that is making the perfect the enemy of the good. 
   Neither Senator COVERDELL nor I have ever argued that offering these private savings accounts would solve every education problem in America. They will not. No Senator could come to this floor with any proposal solving every problem. But they are the opening shot in a revolution in American education, a revolution that, if we are wise enough, will at some point include the construction of new schools, the raising of teacher salaries, the increasing of accountability, and new standards. But on this day, if we succeed, it changes the battle lines in American education by bringing private resources and the private community into the process of education. 
   Throughout the history of our country, we have allowed American education to be simply a question of what  local governments, sometimes with Federal resources, can do through the instruments of Government to educate children. That formula will always dominate American education. We seek to change it if only in this marginal degree. By the use of these private savings accounts, we estimate that $12 billion of family resources will be used to help educate children from kindergarten through high school. That is not a substitute for public resources. It does not divert public resources. Indeed, not a dollar of public money is diverted from the public schools to any other institution. It does allow the community, a family at the birth of a child, to establish these savings accounts and then call upon grandparents, parents, cousins, churches, synagogues, labor unions, and corporations to contribute moneys into these funds. 
   That cannot be bad. Mr. President, $12 billion will be spent on education tomorrow that is not spent today. We may divide on other issues of education, but no one can sincerely argue in this Chamber those resources are not needed or that it is not a good thing parents or churches or grandparents have a vehicle to participate in that child's education. 
   I know my colleagues, particularly my Democratic colleagues, are sincere when they express concern, but this legislation will not help every child. I cannot argue that point. There are some families so wealthy they may not qualify, and there are some families so poor they may not be able to contribute or find sponsors who will. For them, there are other days, other legislation, and other proposals which this Senate has an obligation to consider. But on this day, on this vote, for millions of American families, working-class families, people who work hard every day, middle-income families who can save $50, $100, $1,000 for their child, this is a vehicle. 
   Under what possible reason would the Federal Government be taxing the interest of an account where a family saves for the education of their child? Not only should we not be taxing it, we should be doing everything possible to encourage that family to save that money. It will help most families. 
   Yet many of my colleagues still argue: But the money will be diverted from public schools. No, I say to my colleagues, not a dollar. Indeed, the CBO has estimated that 70 percent of this money will actually be spent by public school students. 
   The other day, in this Chamber, my friend and my colleague, whom I admire greatly, Senator DODD, said: But the public schools are free. No, I say to my colleagues, public schools are not free. Afterschool activities cost money, tutors cost money, transportation costs money, books cost money, computers cost money. 
   Some of the greatest champions in the Senate of public schools in America have argued against this legislation in the belief they are defending public schools. Most of this $12 billion will go to the public schools so middle-class families and working families will be able to use these funds to help pay for public school activities. Yet some of this money will also go to help pay the tuition of private school students, and that is a good thing, too. 
   I say to my colleagues, this has been a good debate. This is a sound proposal. I hope and I trust on a bipartisan basis we will send a signal that this Congress is finally serious about genuine education reform; that we will return on another 
   day to deal with the problem of teacher salaries, construction, and standards, but that on this day, we will marshal private resources to deal with the public and private school problems of America. 
   This is good, and it is sound legislation. It passed the House of Representatives on an overwhelming bipartisan basis. Almost every Member of this Senate voted for the identical proposal to fund higher education. Now we offer the same bill with the identical language to deal with K through 12. Senator COVERDELL, I believe, has made a great contribution by this legislation. I am very proud to join with him in offering it and very proud that it has become a genuinely bipartisan proposal. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that would greatly improve the lives of millions of Americans, thousands of whom live in my State of New Jersey, who are infertile. 
   For many American families, the blessing of raising a family is one of the most basic human desires. Unfortunately almost fifteen percent of all married couples, over six million American families, are unable to have children due to infertility. 
   The physical and emotional toll that infertility has on families is impossible to ignore. I have heard from a number of men and women from New Jersey who have experienced the pain and trauma of discovering that their bodies, which appear normal and function perfectly, are somehow deficient in the one area that matters most to them. This is only compounded when patients discover that their insurer, which they rely on for all of their critical health needs, refuse to cover treatment for this disease. The deep sense of loss expressed by those who desire a family as a result of this gap in coverage is real and significant. Their pain should no longer be ignored. 
   Infertility is a treatable disease. New technologies and procedures that have been developed in the past two decades make starting a family a real possibility for many couples previously unable to conceive. In fact, up to two thirds of all married couples who seek infertility treatment are subsequently able to have children. 
   Unfortunately, due to the high cost of treating this illness, only 20 percent of infertile couples seek medical treatment each year. Even worse, only four out of every ten couples that seek infertility treatment receive coverage from health insurers, and only one quarter of all health plans provide coverage for infertility services. 
   My bill, the Fair Access to Infertility Treatment and Hope (FAITH) Act, will end this inequity by requiring all health insurance plans to ensure testing and coverage of infertility treatment. Specifically, FAITH requires health plans to cover all infertility procedures considered non-experimental that are deemed appropriate by patient and physician, up to four attempts (with two additional attempts provided for those successful couples that desire a second child). 
   One reason often cited by health insurers for their continued refusal to provide infertility treatment is the negative impact that this coverage would have on monthly premiums. However, recent studies demonstrate that FAITH would raise the costs of health coverage by as little as $.21 cents per month per person, an insignificant amount compared to the enormous premium increases we have recently seen from HMOs. 
   Similar legislation that recognizes the vital right of families to infertility treatments has already been passed in thirteen states, including Texas, California, New York, Illinois, Ohio, Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Arkansas, Hawaii, Montana, and West Virginia. In my home state, both branches of the New Jersey Legislature recently passed legislation that mandates this coverage. 
   Reproduction is one of the most important values for both men and women, and those individuals who desire the gift of family should have access to the necessary treatments that make life possible.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator COVERDELL for not only yielding me this time but more than that, for, through these last few years, framing this debate and tirelessly bringing this issue forward. This is not the first time, it is not the second time, it may not be the third time Senator COVERDELL and I have come to the Senate floor for A+ savings accounts and, most assuredly, it will not be the last. This is going to happen. 
   More than simply telling the Senate of the inevitability of these savings accounts, I want us all to recognize what a positive contribution we are making to American education. 
   I rise in opposition to Senator DODD's amendment. Indeed, on another day, another opportunity, I not only would vote for it, I would fight for it, as I would with Senator ROBB's amendment dealing with the building of new schools, and Senator MURRAY's amendment adding new teachers and reducing class size. 
   The problems of American education are not such that they require a single idea or one change. This is not a system with which we need to tinker. We have compound problems. The one Senator DODD raises is among the most important. We gave an obligation to local schools without the resources to pay for special education. Senator ROBB's amendment and Senator MURRAY's amendment are important in building schools that are crumbling around us in some communities and adding new teachers. They are good ideas, they are important ideas, but so is this. 
   For as long as I can remember, the formula for funding American schools has been quite simple: We raise your taxes, and we spend your dollars. That will continue to dominate American education. It is the right formula. We are adding something new, though not a novel idea. Indeed, ironically the source of this idea is President Clinton. In establishing higher education savings accounts of $500, he laid the foundation for what we debate today because what was a good idea for higher education at $500 is a great idea for secondary schools at $2,000. Same idea, same formula with the same end. 
   This is using private money. It is using a family's own resources. By our estimation, after 5 years, $12 billion in private money will be used to educate children K through 12. That cannot be a bad thing. Yet the critics argue it is a diversion of money from the public schools. Not one dime of money that is now going to a public school goes anywhere else but to that same school on that same basis. This is new money, private money, a net increase of $12 billion. 
   People argue that maybe it is all new money, but it goes to a privileged few. The Congressional Budget Office argues that 70 percent of this money will be spent by families who earn less than $70,000. Does this solve the educational problems of a family in poverty who may have no money? Maybe not. Probably not. I challenge any Member of this Senate to come to this floor and tell me one educational idea that solves the educational problems of every family in every regard forever with one bill. This one does not either, but it does help many working families, working poor, middle-class families. 
   The family who earns $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, even $70,000 a year but wants to give their child some extra advantage in education, they want to establish a private savings account. Why should the Federal Government be charging taxes on the interest on that account? Every Member of this Senate knows that education is the great test of whether or not we preserve our quality of life, our national security, our way of life. 
   The Federal Government should be doing everything it can to encourage every parent in America to save every dollar they can muster to educate their child. Taxing that money is the last thing we should be doing. That is the essence of this bill: Eliminate Federal taxes on money saved for education. That cannot be a bad idea. Yet it is argued that maybe it is private money and there is no diversion. Maybe Senators are right about that. Maybe it does go to middle-class and working-class families. Maybe Senators are right about that. It is argued that it is not for a privileged few but it all does go to private schools and we have a public and private school problem. Well, wrong again. 
   CBO estimates that 70 percent of this money actually will go to public school students. Public school students are over 90 percent of the students in America. If we are going to help everybody, by definition, most of that money will go to public school students. That is what the research has found because this money is not just available for private school tuition. This money is available to hire public school teachers after public school is out in the afternoon to help students in math and science--something desperately needed by many of our families--for afterschool transportation, for afterschool activities of band or athletics or clubs, to buy a home computer, to buy books or, if you do not use money for any of these things, to roll it into your college account after the 12th grade when the student is going into college. 
   Is some of this money going for private school tuition? Yes, a minority of it, 30 percent of it. Some does go to private school tuition. I am not here to apologize for that. If, in one piece of legislation, we can add $12 billion to the national expenditure for schools, help public school students with 70 percent of this money--for computers and books and tutors--I do not rise on this floor to apologize that some of this will go to private schools, yeshivas, or parochial schools for tuition. 
   In many of our cities, the Catholic school is the only alternative available to many families who want something better for their child. Tuition can be $800, $700, $1,200--out of reach for many families. Who is going to these schools? What is this ``idle rich'' we hear about who will benefit from this bill? Ninety percent of the students in Camden and Newark and Jersey City going to parochial schools are Protestants; 80 percent of them are African American. This is not a religious opportunity. It is a competitive school, a chance for a parent to give something else to their child. 
   We do not ask the Federal Government to pay for it--not a dime, no public money. Personally, I do not believe in it. I think it is unconstitutional. I do not think public money can or should go directly to pay for tuitions in religious institutions. That is my belief. That is why I am for this bill because this bill does not do that--no public money. A family takes their own money, earned off the sweat of their own brow, puts it in a private account, and uses that money, which has not been taxed because of this legislation, and pays tuition. That cannot be a bad thing. 
   Opposition to this legislation has many aspects. In my judgment, clearly, one of them is that we do not recognize the true depths of the problem of American education. Getting more teachers, building more schools, higher standards for public schools are all part of that, but that is not enough. This is a 
   fight that must be fought on every front simultaneously. 
   Second, I think many people simply do not recognize the state we would be in if we did not have private schools. We are losing a Catholic school in America every week with another school closing its doors. If we lose the parochial education system in America, it will cost $16 billion immediately to replace the system. The system must survive within constitutional bounds. That is what Senator COVERDELL and I are attempting to do with this legislation. 
   Third, I think there is a partisan issue. With all respect to my friend, Senator COVERDELL and his colleagues, in my personal judgment, the leadership in America on education for the last generation has been borne by the Democratic Party. We created the programs for grants, for tuition assistance, for aid to secondary schools that built libraries, built schools, and opened opportunities. It is one of the reasons why I am a Democrat. Now we  have a little competition; frankly, not a lot. 
   The ideas are still overwhelmingly from the Democratic Party. But this idea cannot be bad simply because some Republicans are for it. That is the only argument I have heard against it. If there is going to be a competition between the Democratic and Republican Parties for leadership on education, that is good for America. If we are going to compete to convince the American people that each of us has the best formula for improving our schools, that is good for every child in America. 
   To the Republican Party, I say: Welcome to the fight. We have been waiting for you for a long time. But I am glad you are here. 
   This concept of A+ savings accounts has no parentage on a partisan basis. It is borne of Bill Clinton's concept for funding higher education. It has been adjusted by Senator COVERDELL, imaginatively, creatively, and effectively, to deal with the problems of grade schools and high schools, to help public and private schools with millions of American families. 
   I have been for this concept since I came to the Senate. It is a reflection of my own belief that the American standard of living is not sustainable if we do not dramatically improve the quality of instruction and the performance of our students in this generation. It is not difficult to comprehend, if the United States goes another decade being 16th of the leading 18 industrial nations in the quality of math and science instruction, if 40 percent of 4th graders effectively cannot read to national standards, if a third of our students in the 8th grade cannot meet basic science requirements, this Nation will not continue to maintain our standard of living or even our current level of national security. 
   Education is the great divider in the world, between the insecure and the poor and the wanting and those who exercise leadership and live behind secure borders with rising standards of living. That is our test. I can think of no more important issue for this Senate to debate. 
   I genuinely hope that not only will this A+ savings account legislation pass the Senate--and I have no doubt it will pass the Senate--I genuinely hope we will pass it on a bipartisan basis. But in a challenge to Republican leadership, as well, the argument that Senator DODD makes today for funding special education, and the argument that Senator MURRAY and Senator ROBB will make on class size and school construction, are arguments that not only must be heard, it is legislation that must be adopted. 
   Pass this legislation today and then let us return and complete the debate and meet our obligation to America's schoolchildren. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor. 
   Mr. DODD addressed the Chair.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe, indeed, this debate is helpful in narrowing some of these issues. As I think I have attested, I also believe Senator DODD has a good idea, an idea that should be adopted. It simply is not an alternative to this idea. 
   Let me suggest to my colleagues where Senator DODD and I have common agreement and where we have differences. Senator DODD has made the point that most families could not afford to put the $2,000 in a savings account to pay for their public or private school education. I agree. It is critical to this concept that this $2,000 savings account does not rest solely on the shoulders of the mother or the father. I remember--I am not so young I cannot recall--a time when in an American community, the education of a child was generally an involvement of the larger community. 
   It wasn't just a single mother or the father. These accounts are an opportunity to re-ignite that sense of involvement. We allow the extended family--grandparents, aunts, uncles, churches, labor unions, corporations--to put money into these accounts. 
   Senator DODD is right that few families will be able to put $2,000 in these accounts per year. But a lot of labor unions can go to their employers and say: We would like a little raise next year and we want money in the savings account. A lot of churches will be able to go to the parishioners and say: Thanks for giving to the church. We would like to help Johnny or Jane with their education savings accounts. A lot of parents can go to grandparents and say: At Christmas, instead of that toy, would you put $100 into the education savings accounts? 
   This is under the concept that educating a child is everybody's business. Even then, can we get $2,000 a year? Maybe not. But if upon the birth of a child we can get $500 or $700 and compound it, with tax-free interest, year in and year out, by the time that child is going to the eighth or ninth grade and needs a tutor after school because he or she doesn't understand the math assignment, they can afford it. By the time they are in the sixth grade and they can't afford to buy a computer, with this they could afford one. By the time they go to college, if they have spent none of this money and for 18 years they have been saving $200, $500, or $700, at compound interest, it would be significant. Does it pay for a Harvard education? No, but it gets them into the community college or a State school or it pays for part of the education. It helps. It is valuable. 
   More than just dollars is involved; it creates the concept of the community being involved, having the vehicle of these accounts. It is no coincidence that when Senator COVERDELL and I offered these accounts, the House sponsor was not some conservative Republican from the Deep South, with all due respect to my Southern colleagues from the Republican Party; it was Floyd Flake, a minister, African American, from Queens, NY, who has had the philosophy of the government that: I will take care of my own community; just get out of my way--if I may paraphrase him. He has a charter school; he started it himself. He would like people to be able to have these accounts to pay for some of the extra costs. 
   That goes to the second point Senator DODD made. We agreed on the first--everybody doesn't have $2,000. We disagree on the second. Senator DODD said public school is free. It was when Senator DODD and I went to school. It isn't anymore. How many parents tonight face their children who come home and say: I would like to be part of the band or the Latin Club or the French Club and it costs $500. Can I do that, mom? 
   What we built in the fifties and sixties in this extraordinary public education, funding all these tremendous activities, we have eroded. I represent communities in New Jersey where you can't get a bus home after school if you don't pay for it. You can't join the football team. Some of the books are so old, parents have to buy them themselves. These education savings accounts go to the heart of that problem. Public school is not free. Sixty percent of the African American students in our public schools don't have access to a computer. It is the new divide in American education. That includes 70 percent of Hispanic students and millions of other students from all backgrounds. 
   Why? What is so wrong if we allow a parent to take their own hard-earned money and put it in their own account? All we ask the Federal Government to do--my God, the minimum we can ask anybody to do--is not tax them on the interest. Let them keep the interest so a parent can buy their child something, so they can maximize. I visit public  schools throughout New Jersey where children are struggling with math, science, and areas that were never approached when I was in high school. They struggle. It is hard. If you ask them the one thing they can get more out of public school, they will tell you: I wish there was somebody after school to help me with my work--a tutor. 
   Instead, our public school teachers, who are underpaid and overworked, leave school at 3:30 or 4 o'clock and take second jobs selling clothing, painting houses--anything to support their own families. How about an education savings account, where at the end of the day the public school teacher can work for some extra dollars doing what they do best--teaching, tutoring, helping public school students learn the math and science with which they struggle. 
   No, public school is not free. And $2,000 is a lot for most families. We could be wrong. Senator COVERDELL and I could be wrong. We could offer this chance to every labor union, church, and grandparent in America to help with their kids' education by putting money in every birthday, holiday, or Christmas, and maybe nobody will answer. But I don't believe that. That is not the kind of people we are. That is not the kind of communities I represent. I think people will answer. I think Floyd Flake is right. Every Member of the Senate talks about faith-based answers to problems, working hand in hand with the Government. Well, let's see. I bet the grandparents, aunts and uncles, labor unions, churches, and synagogues will come forward and use these accounts as a vehicle. But mostly, I don't want to fail because we didn't ask. This is an invitation to America to get back in your public or private school, get involved and solve the problem. 
   I believe these are worthwhile. Senator DODD may be right that this institution doesn't have the will or the resources to answer this problem and the special education problem and the school construction problem. If this country doesn't have the will or resources to deal with those problems, we are headed for real trouble. I believe we have the will, and I certainly believe we have the resources--not expenditures, not a dime of it, but investments, every single dollar in every investment for building a school or hiring a teacher. I will fight every day for every one of those things. 
   Today is the Coverdell-Torricelli legislation for private savings accounts to fund public and private schools. I am proud to be part of it. I yield to Senator COVERDELL.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues Senator JEFFORDS, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator MURRAY, and Senator KERRY to introduce ``The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing Act of 2000.'' This legislation provides funding for shelter assistance to women and children fleeing domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault. Due to the fact that domestic violence victims often have no safe place to go and financial obstacles make it difficult to rebuild lives, this funding is needed to help support a continuum between emergency shelter and independent living. 
   In my home state of New Jersey, one act of domestic violence occurs approximately every six minutes and thirty-seven seconds. Nationally, it is estimated that a woman is beaten every fifteen seconds. Yet, many individuals and families fleeing domestic violence are forced to return to their abusers because of inadequate shelter or lack of money. Half of all homeless women and children are fleeing domestic violence. Even if they leave their abusers to go to a shelter, they often return home because the isolation from familiar surroundings, friends, and neighborhood resources makes them feel even more vulnerable. Shelters and transitional facilities are often located far from a victim's neighborhood. And, if emergency shelter is available, a supply of affordable housing and services are needed to keep women from having to return to a violent home. 
   The issue of homelessness for battered women goes beyond the ability to find a space in a domestic violence shelter. Because women escaping abusers often leave suddenly, they often have no money saved for a security deposit and first month's rent. This is especially problematic in New Jersey as rents are so expensive. New Jersey is the second most expensive state in the nation to rent a two-bedroom apartment and 45 percent of all New Jersey renters cannot afford the State's average rent for a two-bedroom apartment. And, many battered women may have to leave their jobs because of workplace stalking by their abusers. Women who leave violent situations often incur additional expenses as they must purchase clothing, cookware, and furniture. The lack of financial security hinders their ability to secure safe, decent, and affordable housing for themselves and their families. 
   This is why Senator's JEFFORDS, LANDRIEU, MURRAY, KERRY and I are introducing ``The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing Act of 2000.'' Under current law, domestic violence shelters must apply for federal homeless assistance along with  other 
   organizations assisting the general homeless population. This legislation creates a specific grant targeted towards shelters providing assistance to individuals and families fleeing domestic violence, stalking, and sexual assault only. Funding is authorized through the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act for five years beginning at $50 million for fiscal year 2001. Non-profit, community-based housing organizations receive the funds through a competitive grant process administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Groups would use the grant to provide emergency and transitional housing or direct financial assistance for rent, security deposit, and first month's rent. In addition, the legislation also requires organizations to provide a 25% match in funds for services such as child care, employment assistance, and healthcare. This assistance helps provide a stable home base so that those fleeing domestic violence learn new job skills, work full-time jobs, or search for adequate child care. 
   The Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault Victim's Housing Act of 2000 is supported by the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund. Senators JEFFORDS, LANDRIEU, MURRAY, KERRY and I look forward to working with them and all others interested in helping us address the continuing national epidemic of domestic violence. I urge my colleagues to join us in our efforts to prevent victims of domestic violence from having to choose between violence and homelessness.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator SPECTER for yielding time to me. I also thank him for his perseverance and diligence in working on this issue over the course of the last several months. 
   I also express particular thanks to Senator BIDEN who in reviewing this legislation made very important additions and allowed us to proceed on a bipartisan basis for what I think is an important and worthwhile change in the laws dealing with foreign intelligence surveillance. 
   The origins of this legislation--part of the Judiciary Committee's oversight--is the question of how the Department of Justice handled allegations of Chinese espionage at our most important National Laboratories. 
   The focus of this review, of course, had to do with the case of Dr. Wen Ho Lee, a scientist who was charged in December with 59 counts of illegally removing secrets from computer information at the Los Alamos Laboratory. It appears that Dr. Lee was the subject of interest or investigations for espionage for over 17 years. He was dealing with the most important weapons secrets possessed by his government critical to the security of the United States. 
   It would be difficult for anyone in this Government to explain to the American people why, despite 17 years of investigation and some reasons for considerable doubt all during this time, he was permitted to continue with his job and retain access to highly classified information. 
   Much is still to be learned about this case. A criminal case is proceeding and an investigation. That is for, in some instances, others to deal with. That does not mean we do not already know some things that can change the conduct in this Government and the laws under which we govern ourselves. We have learned through this investigation that this was all made possible by a series of procedural and investigative errors that gave Dr. Lee this opportunity to download this highly classified material to an unsecured computer. 
   In truth, we do not yet know whether or not, when this unguarded material was in an unsecured computer, in fact it got to foreign agents or other interested parties other than people with proper clearance in the U.S. Government. We do not know. We may never know. But we do know this after interviewing many witnesses and thousands of documents: There was a startling, almost unbelievable failure of coordination and communication between the Department of Justice, the FBI, and the Department of Energy in dealing with this matter, and only through that lack of coordination was an allegation of possible espionage able to lead to 17 years of continued access and the possibility that this information was compromised. 
   As early as 1982, the FBI was aware that Dr. Lee was engaged in suspicious activities. Yet both at that time and in the years that followed there was no action taken to limit access to classified material. The Department of Energy detected Dr. Lee transferring an inordinate number of systems from a secured system to an unsecured system in 1993 and 1994. Personnel responsible for reporting that information failed to do so. 
   In 1997, the FBI had an opportunity to stop Dr. Lee, but they were stymied by the denial of the Department of Justice of a request submitted by the FBI for a warrant to further investigate Dr. Lee. It is this failure that brings us here today. 
   The evidence supporting a FISA request for their warrant 
   was overwhelming. It had been building for years. No single piece of evidence may have been sufficient to warrant a criminal case, but they were more than sufficient to raise a proper level of suspicion to support the issuing of a warrant. 
   Now we know that the request for this warrant, a FISA application, was never even considered by the Attorney General of the United States. When the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Mr. Freeh, sent a personal representative to meet with the Attorney General to express his concern about the warrant application, which he was right and proper to do, the Attorney General delegated the matter to a subordinate who was unfamiliar with the matter and who had never processed a similar request--no experience, no knowledge, no involvement--and the final disposition of the matter, therefore, was predictable. The request was denied. The warrant was not issued, and an opportunity potentially to either apprehend someone committing a criminal act or to have prevented further damage, if any occurred, was lost. 
   Unfortunately, this problem was compounded in that when the FBI was denied this warrant, in my judgment, the matter should have been appealed but it was allowed to languish, and then further hampered by the Department of Energy which conducted a polygraph of Dr. Lee, and then, incredibly, unbelievably incorrectly concluded that he had passed the test. 
   It is a series of compounded errors of procedure and judgment. It is difficult for the Congress to legislate good judgment for the proper execution of responsibilities. If we cannot do so, we can at least design the laws to provide for greater accountability. 
   That is, indeed, what is being done by my colleagues. Under the legislation we are now introducing, Senator SPECTER and I have written amendments to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to provide that upon the personal request of the Director of the FBI, the Attorney General must personally review the FISA requests--no subordinate, no uninformed associate. This is a matter of national security. The Attorney General has no greater responsibility than protecting the secrets of the U.S. Government. This matter belongs on the Attorney General's desk, and under this legislation that is where it will rest. 
   There are those who may argue that making the Attorney General directly responsible will somehow provide an avalanche of work, that they will not be able to deal with all of these matters. Appropriately, the legislation has been designed so this provision is triggered only by the personal request from the Director of the FBI--no subordinate, no associate, no one else in the Government. So the number of cases will be extremely limited. But when asked by the Director of the FBI, one person, and one person in this Government alone, will have direct responsibility. 
   Second, the legislation requires that if the Attorney General decides not to forward a FISA application to the court, that decision must be communicated in writing to the FBI Director along with specific recommendations as to what investigative steps should be undertaken to meet the probable cause requirements. Matters of national security on this level cannot fall in departmental cracks--not get lost somewhere between Justice and the FBI. This will ensure that in those cases when the Attorney General has personally rejected this request the reasons will be stated, the FBI will be told why and then given a chance to return having met the appropriate probable cause standard. 
   Third, the legislation requires that the FBI Director must personally supervise the implementation of the Attorney General's recommendations to ensure once again that in the highest levels of the U.S. Government these unusual but critical cases of national security dealing with foreign espionage are dealt with not by subordinates, but that this Congress can hold people for which it has responsibility, oversight, and votes to confirm--such as the Attorney General and the FBI Director--directly accountable. 
   I believe these are appropriate responses to what we have learned to date out of this investigation. But I conclude by saying both what this legislation is and what it is not. 
   This legislation is not an attempt to lower the probable cause standard for what is required for a warrant and a FISA application. Probable cause is a standard of law. It should be taken seriously. 
   The rights of no citizen should be violated by an intrusive or curious government. The standard remains. 
   What is being changed here is accountability, not a lessening of civil  liberties. We simply want to know that the standard which has always existed of probable cause will be used, that procedures will be followed, that people will be held accountable, not that the Government is any more or any less intrusive. The probable cause standard remains the cornerstone of American liberties to ensure that the Government has reason and merit as a matter of law to involve itself in the privacy of our citizens. 
   I proudly offer this legislation with Senator SPECTER. I believe it is a good and appropriate response. I thank the Senator for his patience in the drafting. I listened to my colleagues, particularly on this side of the aisle, with relatively modest changes we have recommended, all of which the Senator has incorporated. I look forward to the committee and then the Senate enacting this legislation.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, if Americans knew that every time they walked through their local shopping mall or wandered through the shopping district of their hometown their movements were being tracked, every purchase was being recorded, and every conversation was being monitored, they would be outraged. Americans would consider this level of surveillance a violation of their most basic constitutional right. Yet that very expectation of privacy we expect in our traditional shopping in the local mall, or our visiting with friends, or searching for information in our hometown is exactly what is not happening in the shopping center of the 21st century in cyberspace. 
   Whenever a citizen ventures online to pay a bill, seeks medical advice, purchases a product, checks the latest news, or engages in a conversation on the Internet, there is a chance that someone is gathering information about us, recording their information, and then selling it, or giving it to others. It is a very disturbing new look at a very exciting new technology. 
   Indeed, there are companies now being formed for the specific purpose of monitoring our travels through cyberspace and recording this very information. 
   The situation, while unsettling, does not need to necessarily be menacing. Marketing both online and offline is very common in our daily lives. By collecting some of this information, businesses, indeed, can benefit, if they know the kind of products we want, what our tastes might be, our sizes, and our preferences in what we want to read and want to purchase. The question is whether consumers can control that information because, indeed, companies having access to this information can be more efficient and allow our time to be used more efficiently. I may want a retailer of clothing to know the kind of clothes I want to buy so that I receive the proper advertising. I may want a book company to know the things that I like to read and my areas of study so I can receive products more properly. 
   That is having information used at its best. One can only imagine how it can be used at its worst. 
   This information about what I want to read in the wrong hands can reveal my most private political thoughts that I would rather have others not know. It could reveal sexual orientation or party affiliation. Indeed, if I seek medical advice online for psychiatric care or for a disease for myself or a child or a mate, it very well probably would be information I wouldn't want generally available to other people for commercial purposes, political purposes, or worse. 
   Too often web sites underinform or misinform the public about how they intend to use this information or have presented work to be used improperly or where it can be misused. The fact is that over 90 percent of our most popular web sites do not reveal that they gather and share consumer information with other businesses. And if the public knew that 90 percent of these sites were sharing this information, we as consumers and citizens would be more careful about what we reveal or what we purchase. 
   A 1999 Georgetown survey also concluded that only 36 percent of leading web sites that admit to gathering information fully explain how they intend to utilize it. So the consumer, the citizens, are not able to make an informed decision about what information they are providing and what risks they might be taking. 
   Many consumers are now being informed through the popular media that without our consent or knowledge, programs known as ``cookies'' monitor and collect information regarding our web site browsing habits. 
   Personal data is also routinely extracted directly by web sites whenever we transmit the information required to purchase a product or surf the net for a specific topic. 
   In both cases, our actions are monitored and our information will be shared unless we specifically request that a company do not do so, a process known as opting out. 
   Opting out requires that a user directly contact a site to decline disclosure. The problem with opting out is that the location on web sites where one clicks to opt out, to take your information out of circulation, is often not prominently displayed and therefore is not known by the consumer. 
   One leading marketing company that tracks 80 million online consumer profiles has revealed it receives an average of only 12 opt out requests per day; 80 million customers, 12 opt out per day. 
   It is unlikely that only 12 people are concerned about privacy of their purchases or other vital personal information. I suggest to the Senate it is much more likely that the opt out location  on the web page is obscured or in some form inadequate. 
   Privacy policies meant to inform users of both the scope and scale of this information are very often inaccessible. A recent California Healthcare survey of 21 popular health care sites reveals many sites have secretly shared personal health information with marketers despite the fact that privacy policies were posted. Often the opt out sites are not adequately displayed. They often are misleading. Sometimes, as this study by California Healthcare indicates, they are just plain dishonest. 
   There are, however, solutions. I believe these solutions are important to protect privacy. I remind those who are now marketing on the Internet and share my enthusiasm for the potential of the Internet for economic purposes that we have a common interest. If consumers do not believe their interests are protected regarding safeguarding their most vital personal information, the Internet will never reach its true economic potential. This point bears repeating. This is vital for privacy in our society and personal confidence in the Internet, but it is equally vital for the Internet in meeting its economic potential. 
   Great segments of this society are going to be reluctant to purchase books, health care products, seek information, and exchange ideas if they do not know whether the information is safeguarded. It is no different than citizens using the telephone to convey information, exchange political ideas, or purchase products, if citizens did not have some idea that their every phone conversation wasn't being monitored. It wouldn't be any different than citizens visiting the local shopping mall, meeting friends, engaging in conversations, going to restaurants, or purchasing products, if they knew that over their shoulder someone was recording everything they did and everywhere they went. This is vital economically as well for the privacy of our citizens if this new, wonderful technology is to meet its economic potential. 
   To deal with this problem, I have introduced S. 2063, the Secure Online Communication Enforcement Act of 2000. This legislation is not a final product, I stress to privacy advocates and to the Internet industries and online companies. It is not a final product. It is establishing, I hope, a national dialog first to educate ourselves about the privacy problem in cyberspace. It is a beginning document to which I invite comment and amendment. Its purpose is simply to begin collecting ideas of how to enhance privacy. But it is built on the concept of opting in versus opting out; that is, that the consumer, the citizen, must make a choice about whether they want this information shared. So the consumer, the 
   individual, holds the power. 
   If I believe a company can better market to me--and, indeed, I believe a company can better market to me if they know my taste in music, my taste in reading, my taste in clothing or automobiles--I can decide that I want that information shared, given to other companies, and come back to me with good information. However, if I don't want something shared--perhaps I have gone online with a health care company and I prefer my health information not be shared--I do not opt in, I do not give anybody the right to give that information. 
   A second vital part of this bill: I strongly believe government oversight and regulation of the Internet should be kept to a minimum. That is one reason I have opposed steadfastly a sales tax on Internet purchases. This is one area of American life where the government should keep its presence to an absolute minimum in taxation and regulation. For that reason, this legislation is self-enforcing. No government bureaucracy will be calling if there is a violation. If, indeed, a company violates a citizen's privacy, the right of action is with the citizen, not the government. There is a legal right of action when sharing my personal information which I have said will not be shared. If I did not give anyone that right, then I as a citizen will hold them liable for doing so. 
   Those twin pillars are: As a citizen, I decide whether to share my private service; second pillar, as a citizen, I and not the government have the right of action to enforce it. 
   I have introduced this new legislation to begin this dialog, S. 2063, the Secure Online Communication and Enforcement Act of 2000. I hope it is helpful to my colleagues. I hope a good and worthwhile debate proceeds in the Senate, in our country, and, mostly, within this vital industry. If we can get this right, we not only do service to our people by protecting their privacy, as is our cultural and constitutional tradition, we also do a great deal to reinforce public confidence in the Internet, cyberspace, as a new arena of economic commerce and competition. We can bring the Internet to reach its true economic potential. 
   I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate, by a 95-2 vote, has confirmed Joel Pisano as a district court judge for the District of New Jersey. 
   Judge Pisano is an excellent choice to fill the district court seat created with the confirmation of Marion Trump Barry to the third Circuit Court of Appeals this past summer. He is extremely well-respected in New Jersey for his commitment to public service, as well as for his depth and breadth of knowledge of the law. 
   A graduate of Lafayette College and later of Seton Hall University Law School, Judge Pisano has had a varied and distinguished legal career. He served for 4 years as a public defender in New Jersey, before moving into private practice as a partner with a well-respected New Jersey law firm for 14 years. 
   In 1991, Judge Pisano was appointed to be a U.S. Magistrate Judge in Newark, New Jersey. In that capacity, he ably presided over a number of high profile cases, including that of a former Mexican deputy attorney general who was charged with laundering $9.9 million in drug payoffs. 
   In a 1995 survey of attorneys who practice in New Jersey before Federal judges, Judge Pisano was praised for his skills in managing cases and his efficiency in moving a calendar quickly. His ``street-wise'' nature and prior experience as a trial attorney were said to serve him well on the bench. 
   Judge Pisano's 8 years as a magistrate judge have prepared him for his promotion to the district court. He has an understanding of, and the training for, the responsibilities and challenges he will face as a district court judge. I am confident that he will serve us all well in his new role. 
   In conclusion, I just want to say how pleased I am that Joel Pisano has been confirmed by the Senate as a district court judge for the District of New Jersey. I am sure that he will be a superb addition to the bench.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank Senator LEAHY for his very kind comments and leadership in bringing this legislation to the floor, as well as, certainly, Senator GRASSLEY, who began this effort so long ago and worked so very hard. So many Senators have played an important role that I think it bears some analysis of how we came to this point. And there are some provisions of the bill that should be mentioned before we go to conference in order to set our clear agenda. 
   I know there are those from the outset who doubted whether, indeed, real reform of bankruptcy law could be achieved in this Congress. There was some reason to be skeptical because there were some conflicting provisions. Some of us had some very real needs that had to be met before the beginning legislation could ever be enacted.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Most important of these objectives, in my mind, was dealing with the need for some consumer credit protection because, indeed, while there may be abuses in bankruptcy by debtors, to be certain, there are clearly problems in the credit industry. 
   I believe several important amendments have achieved this goal. Most importantly, in my mind, was the adoption of the Grassley-Torricelli disclosure amendment. Other important amendments were additions by Senators SCHUMER and SARBANES that will together provide real consumer protection. 
   All three amendments are based on the belief that if consumers have knowledge, they will make rational choices. Simply providing information will avoid many credit problems from which the American people are currently suffering. These include--if you look at the Torricelli-Grassley, Schumer, and Sarbanes amendments--a combination of disclosing prominently on credit documents: The effects of only making minimum payments on your account every month; second, when late fees will be imposed; and, third, the date on which introductory or teaser rates will expire and what the permanent rate will be upon that expiration. 
   Additionally, the Grassley-Torricelli amendment includes a provision authored by Senator JACK REED prohibiting the canceling of an account because the consumer pays the balance in full every month. That was a growing problem where people with good credit and good bill-paying habits were being penalized unnecessarily. That provision is now in the bill. 
   For all of these good additions that have made this better legislation, there are some problems which I hope and trust can be resolved in conference so that this can genuinely be bipartisan legislation, broadly accepted, and signed by the President. 
   The principal obstacle between what we want to achieve and that reality is obviously the minimum wage provisions in this legislation. 
   Mr. President, 12 million Americans continue to earn the minimum wage. Although they work all day, every day, throughout the year, they are in a daily struggle simply to survive. A 
    mother of two working at the minimum wage earns only $10,712 per year, 22 percent below the poverty line, a wage at which it is impossible to provide housing and food and clothing for a child, no less two children--or even a person, no less a family. It is not a minimum wage; it is a poverty wage. 
   In the last 15 years, inflation rose by 86 percent, but the minimum wage rose by only 37 percent. The fact remains that the United States is allowing a standard of living by working people below what those who stood in this institution only 15, 20, and 25 years ago were permitting by law. 
   We in America are allowing the establishment of a near-permanent underclass of working people doomed to poverty and children who do not have a chance of breaking out of these circumstances, who are likely to enter life malnourished, poorly clothed, inadequately housed, knowing only poverty. 
   We need to reach the same judgment that our grandparents and our parents have reached for 70 years: A working, fair minimum wage. 
   With the proposed new minimum wage, a full-time worker will have an annual income of $12,700, an increase of $2,000 a year. The problem with our bill is that this change is brought over the course of 3 years rather than 2 years, as many of us have proposed. 
   If it is the right thing to do, upon which most Senators seem to agree, it is the right thing to do now. Leaving millions of American children in poverty for this extra time makes no sense, and it is indefensible. 
   Indeed, during that extra time it denies $1,200 to families who are struggling trying to work their way out of poverty. 
   I can think of no better addition to legislation dealing with debts and the struggling realities of American economic life in this reform of bankruptcy  legislation than including a real minimum wage. 
   It is obviously my hope that when the bill returns from conference we will return to a 2-year increase in the minimum wage rather than the 3-year provisions in this legislation. 
   The second area of concern--for all that we have achieved in this legislation--is the creation of a new school voucher program which was contained in a Republican antidrug amendment. 
   I want to make clear that I voted against this amendment last fall. I did so not because of objections to the underlying amphetamine prevention legislation, which I voted for in the Judiciary Committee, but to the voucher program. 
   When we considered this provision in the Judiciary Committee, it did not have this voucher provision. It actually was dealing with narcotics problems in schools with younger people. It was a good provision. It has now been changed on the floor to include this voucher program. It is a simple diversion of desperately needed public moneys in the public schools, which can only make the problem worse. Money that would go to children at risk to deal with many problems, including narcotics problems, would now be removed from the schools. This provision does not make sense. It should be removed. 
   I believe if these objections are dealt with, we can return to this floor with a conference committee report of which we can all be proud. 
   For all the divisions we might have faced when this legislation began, I think we all now understand there is a problem with bankruptcy abuse in the United States. In 1998, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection. Something is wrong. There either are not adequate credit protections to ensure people under the circumstances when they borrow money, or the law does not properly deal with their filings for bankruptcy, or both and other factors. In my judgment, it is all of these things. 
   Currently, 70 percent of bankruptcy petitions are filed in chapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Just 30 percent of petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a repayment of debt. 
   More than anything else, in addition to consumer protection, we will assure that people who can pay back part of these debts will do so. That is not simply a benefit to the financial industry; it is also a benefit to every mom-and-pop store, every small business in America that is being abused by these unnecessary filings for bankruptcy. Indeed, it is estimated by the Department of Justice that 182,000 people every year can afford to pay back some of the debts they are now escaping by inappropriate filings. This means $4 billion to creditors, financial institutions, to be sure, but also many small businesses that cannot afford losing these funds. 
   I conclude, once again, by thanking Senator GRASSLEY for his extraordinary leadership, Senator LEAHY for his patience through this process, Senator HATCH in chairing our committee and bringing us to this point, and the very great contributions made by Senators BIDEN, REID, SCHUMER, and Senator DURBIN who worked on this legislation so tirelessly in the last Congress. 
   This is good legislation. We can be proud of it. With modest adjustments, we can, indeed, make it something that both parties in both Chambers can bring to the President for his signature. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the resolution submitted by Senator SPECTER designating March 25, 2000 as Greek Independence Day. The Greek-American community has made significant contributions to the United States. It is in honor of those achievements that we recognize Greek Independence Day. 
   The ancient Greeks conceived the very notion of democracy when they placed the power to govern in the hands of the people. Our founding fathers relied on the political and philosophical experiences of ancient Greece to create the government we have today. As a result, America's close relationship with Greece is long and historic. I believe that James Monroe best expressed America's feelings toward Greece when he said, ``The mention of Greece fills the mind with the most exalted sentiments and arouses in our bosoms the best feeling of which our nature is susceptible.'' 
   As Greece fought for its independence in the 1820s, the American Revolution became a driving ideal. In fact, Greek intellectuals translated our own Declaration of Independence to use as their statement of freedom. By the end of World War II, Greece was one of our most important allies in the region as it fought to stem the Communist tide across Europe. In 1953, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appropriately noted this effort when he said, ``..... Greece asked no favor except the opportunity to stand for the rights which it believed, and it gave to the world an example of battle, a battle that thrilled the hearts of all free men and free women everywhere.'' 
   Today, we know that Greece is one of only three nations in the world which has allied itself with the United States in every major international conflict this century. Through immigration, we have grown even closer. During the early 1900s, one out of every four Greek males between the ages of 15 and 45 emigrated to the United States. Greek-Americans have the highest median educational attainment among all American ethnic nationalities, and they are now a successful and integral part of this country. 
   The relationship between Greece and America is a unique one which has survived the test of war and the looming threat of Communism. We owe a great deal to Greece, and to its people who have chosen to make America their home. Greek civilization touches our lives as Americans and enhances the cultural existence of this great nation. I hope my colleagues will join me in expressing our gratitude to Greece and all Greek-Americans for the role they have played in building this country.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today behalf of Jack McKeon, a South Amboy native, who led the Cincinnati Reds to within one game of the 1999 National League Playoffs. It is a pleasure for me to be able to recognize his accomplishments. 
   During his 50 years in Major League Baseball, Jack McKeon has been honored as both ``National League Manager of the Year'' and as ``Major League Manager of the Year.'' In his 26 years of major league managing he has won nearly 700 games with the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Athletics, San Diego Padres, and Cincinnati Reds. In addition, Jack McKeon has also served as General Manager, receiving the ``General Manager of the Year'' award. 
   Before Jack began his distinguished career, he had already made an impact in New Jersey. As a member of the McKeon Boys Club, Jack played his first organized baseball and went on to become an all-county catcher as a student at St. Mary's High School. 
   Jack's playing career spanned 10 years in the minor leagues. During that time he discovered his natural ability to lead. His first pro coaching assignment came at the young age of 24, in which he led his club to a 70-67 record. His later success as a rookie manager of the Kansas City Royals in 1973 brought the foundering team new respect in the American League with a 2nd place finish. His later managerial and executive positions led to greater renown as he approached the 1999 season. The strong finish of the Cincinnati Reds earned Jack the respect of his peers and the national press which named his Manager or the Year. 
   So it gives me great pleasure to recognize a leader of great stature in New Jersey. His tremendous accomplishments in baseball, as a player, manager, and executive have made a significant contribution to the national pastime. I am pleased that one of New Jersey's native sons is now being honored, and I hope my colleagues join me in congratulating Jack on his success.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to William Sumas, a New Jersey resident and distinguished member of the business community, who will be inducted as Chairman of the New Jersey Food Council on January 27, 2000. 
   Bill is a native of New Jersey, having grown up in South Orange. After attending Columbia High School, he continued his education at Fairleigh Dickinson University. 
   Bill Sumas currently serves as a Vice President of the International Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives New Jersey Chapter, and as an Executive Vice President of Village Supermarkets, the 49th largest corporation in the State of New Jersey. Village Supermarkets was founded in 1937 by Bill's father and uncle, Perry and Nicholas Sumas. Since then, the company has grown to become one of New Jersey's most important food retailers. 
   The New Jersey Food Council (NJFC) was formed to promote, foster, aid, advance and protect the mutual interests of the food retailers and their suppliers. The council represents the multi-billion dollar food industry, including over 1,200 retailers, wholesalers, manufacturers, and service companies involved in every aspect of the industry. The NJFC is recognized nationally for its effective leadership and achievements in all aspects of public affairs, and has always maintained a reputation of excellence and integrity. 
   It is my firm belief that William Sumas will continue this fine tradition, and serve with distinction as an advocate on behalf of the NJFC's members. He will clearly promote the short and long term goals of the food industry in a timely and prescient manner, and will enhance the image and standing in the community of the entire industry. 
   Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me today in congratulating William Sumas on his induction as Chairman of the New Jersey Food Council. Under his leadership I am confident that the industry will continue to grow, and I look forward to its successful future.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I express my deep appreciation and thanks to Senator KYL for his diligent  work to help resolve my concerns. This compromise is reflected in section 1085. This language is very important to permitting parimutuel wagering on horse racing to be exempted from the prohibition on Internet gambling that we are enacting. 
   The new language makes explicit which was implicit and assures that every State has the right to establish requirements for Internet and phone wagering that will best serve the public and governmental interests of the State and to do so, if it wishes, before such wagering takes place. I believe this is so important because it ensures that a State will have its traditional authority to safeguard the interests of its consumers and racing industry through the regulatory and approval process of proposed phone or Internet wagering.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. My college is correct. The State Street decision may have unintended consequences for the financial services community. By explicitly holding that business methods are patentable, financial service companies are finding that the techniques and ideas, that were in wide use, are being patented by others. 
   The Prior Inventor Defense of H.R. 1554 is an important step toward protecting the financial services industry. By protecting early developers and users of a business method, the defense allows U.S. companies to commit resources to the commercialization of their inventions with confidence that a subsequent patent holder will prevail in a patent-infringement suit. Without this defense, financial services companies face unfair patent-infringement suits over the use of techniques and ideas (methods) they developed and have used for years. 
   While I support the Prior Inventor Defense, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, I hope that we will revisit this issue next year. More must be done to address the boundaries of the State Street decision with the realities of the constantly changing and developing financial services industry. 
   I look forward to working with Senator SCHUMER and my colleagues on the committee on this important issue.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Disaster Victims Tax Relief Act. This legislation will help mitigate the losses that hundreds of thousands of Americans incur each year as a result of natural disasters, and helps clear the path towards full recovery. 
   My home state of New Jersey is not known as a place which suffers tropical storms or hurricanes with great frequency. However, this past September, many of my constituent witnessed nature's fury first hand. Hurricane Floyd, one of the largest storms in recent history, battered much of New Jersey, along with the several other Eastern states, with winds in excess of 140 miles per hour and flash downpours which caused extensive flooding. To date, the flooding caused by this disaster has inflicted more than $500 million in damages in New Jersey alone, and it is estimated that this figure may exceed more than $1 billion when the final costs are calculated. In terms of economic damages, New Jersey was the second most heavily damaged state as a result of Floyd. 
   Natural disasters, such as the one we recently witnessed, too often cause people to lose their homes and the businesses that were made successful through a lifetime of hard work. This pain is exacerbated by the fact that they are still required to meet a heavy tax burden for that year. It is unreasonable to expect these unfortunate Americans to meet their full tax responsibilities after suffering a cataclysmic disaster such as a hurricane such as a hurricane or flood. While our current tax code includes a provision that addresses this situation, qualification requirements ensure that the overwhelming majority of victims cannot utilize the provision to their benefit. 
   Under current law, an individual may deduct uninsured damages or ``casualty losses'' incurred from a natural disaster so long as those losses exceed 10 percent of their adjusted gross income (AGI). Unfortunately, many victims of disasters have found that this threshold is too high for them to qualify. Compounding this situation is the fact that only the small percentage of taxpayers who itemize their deductions are effectively eligible to claim their disaster losses as a deduction. This is troubling because 75 percent of taxpayers who do not itemize, comprised mostly of lower and middle class families who need this benefit most, cannot participate. 
   The bill I introduce today is straight forward. First it would reduce the current AGI threshold from 10 percent to 5 percent. Second, it would make the deductions available an ``above the line'' deduction. These two provisions would enable the majority of American taxpayers, who do not itemize their returns, to benefit. Third, my bill would institute a 2-year ``carry back or forward'' provision which would allow people who incur casualty losses to claim the deductions on either the previous year's return, or they can defer and claim the losses either the following year or the year after. Finally this bill is narrowly tailored to provide relief to those people who need it most; those who live in a federally declared disaster area. This will help avoid abuse of the provision. 
   Mr. President, people who have emerged from earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes and floods are confronted with the daunting task of rebuilding their lives in the face of overwhelming economic loss and the emotional trauma of losing everything they own. Their tax burden should not be one of the obstacles that they must overcome in order to embark on the road to recovery. This bill will help ensure that this is not the case. I would urge my colleagues in the Senate to fully support this legislation.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to pay homage to one of my constituents, the late John A. Sacci, who was a resident in my home county of Bergen. John Sacci served with distinction as a history teacher in the Hoboken Public Schools until his untimely death in 1997. The good citizens of Hoboken will dedicate a playground in the historic Columbus Park in honor of his memory, and I join his family, friends and colleagues in paying tribute to a man who inspired so many young people. 
   John Sacci lived a short life, but it was not without ample achievements and success. Mr. Sacci helped to shape the minds of our children and did so with his unique brand of humor. His approach to teaching was filled with a refreshing attitude that won him the affection of countless students. Mr. President, above all, John Sacci was a committed and dedicated teacher and servant of the people. 
   Mr. Sacci lent his support to countless causes, including the implementation of Advanced Placement courses and the International Bacculauralate programs at Hoboken High School, creating scholarship opportunities for students, and initiating professional learning opportunities like the Academic Bowl and Mock Trial providing for Hoboken's students to be among the brightest in Hudson County. Additionally, John served as the Girl's Softball Team Coach and helped to build young women's self-esteem through leadership and team work. 
   When it came time to assist students with the college application process, John Sacci was the one hundreds of students turned to for assistance because they knew he cared. Indeed, John Sacci's efforts made it possible for hundreds of students to go on and become productive citizens. In fact, John Sacci helped and inspired a member of my own staff, George A. Ortiz, who serves as my press secretary. He was a vital asset to the success of Hoboken High School and his loss is profoundly felt. For all who ever crossed his path and benefitted from his intrinsic commitment to helping shape the future of America, we are all the better for it today. 
   Mr. President, I have stood on the floor of this great chamber time and again to urge the imperative need for meaningful gun control. On February 17, 1997 the tragedies that have struck in places like Littleton, Jonesboro and Columbine were all too familiar to the small community of Hoboken, as John Sacci's life was tragically cut short by gun violence. To all of my constituents in New Jersey who have died from gun violence, like John Sacci, I commit to fighting so that their memories and untimely deaths are not forgotten. 
   In conclusion, I want to express my personal condolences to John Sacci's family and friends. To his wife, Kathy, his children, Carla, Christi, Jenna and Elaina, though nothing I can say today will change the pain you feel, but take pride in your husband and father John Sacci. He was, indeed, a man of courage, inspiration and above all, he cared enough to want to make a difference. 
   Mr. President, I would like the record to reflect that today, Tuesday, November 23, 1999, family, friends and countless students gathered together in the City of Hoboken, in Hudson County in my great state of New Jersey to dedicate a playground in the living memory of John A. Sacci, an accomplished teacher.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Captain James L. Cardoso, a native of Cherry Hill, New Jersey, as he receives the Silver Star for gallantry from the United States Air Force. Captain Cardoso's daring rescue of a downed F-117 ``Stealth Fighter'' pilot makes him more than worthy of this prestigious honor. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments. 
   On March 27, Captain Cardoso led his helicopter unit through Serbian air defenses within 25 miles of Belgrade. His extraordinary effort is even more remarkable considering the low visibility and the minimal air support his unit received in the rescue. He fearlessly led his formation, at great personal risk to himself and his crew, in penetrating an extremely formidable Serbian air defense system which knew of the rescue. In the process, Captain Cardoso successfully avoided Serbian ground forces located a mere 10 miles away. 
   Despite these difficulties, Captain Cardoso's unit was able to rescue the downed pilot within 45 seconds of landing. He narrowly escaped encroaching Serbian forces. 
   Having learned of Captain Cardoso's heroic leadership, I am pleased to recognize his efforts. Captain Cardoso's actions saved an American pilot from enemy hands at a critical time in the Kosovo campaign. By his gallantry and sense of duty, Captain Cardoso has proven a great credit to himself, the State of New Jersey and to the country. I wish him the best as he receives this tremendous honor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, at the outset of this debate for bankruptcy reform, I made clear my own feelings that, as important as I thought it was to reform the bankruptcy laws, in fairness, the legislation needed to be balanced by addressing some of the abuses in the credit industry. 
   In recent days, Senators DURBIN and DODD have come to the floor with their own variations to protect consumers and the credit industry's own excesses. Those amendments have not been successful. 
   I offer what I believe is a balanced and is clearly a bipartisan effort to include some consumer protection in this legislation. It is not based on a theory of government intervention or restriction on credit. It is based on the theory of giving consumers information to make their own judgments. I offer this amendment with Senator GRASSLEY, who has been both accommodating and has offered leadership in fair consumer protection, with Senator LEAHY and Senator BIDEN. 
   As I outline the amendment, I think it will be clear we borrowed heavily from ideas offered by Senators GRASSLEY, BIDEN, and LEAHY but also consumer protection initiatives in part  previously offered by Senator SCHUMER, Senator REED, Senator HATCH, and Senator GRAMM. That is why it is all inclusive and why it is balanced. 
   There has been a great deal of attention on the rise of consumer bankruptcy in recent years. The numbers bear some repeating. Since 1980, there has been a 350-percent increase in bankruptcy filings. Indeed, there are many reasons for it. Part of the crushing debt forcing millions of Americans into bankruptcy clearly is the availability of credit. In the last 23 years, the debt burden by American families has quadrupled. Twenty percent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of their income. 
   As this chart indicates, consumer bankruptcies and consumer credit debt are nearly identically tracking each other. One cannot separate the rise in bankruptcies from the level of consumer debt. They are one and the same problem. 
   Therefore, as certainly as we deal with other reasons for the abuse of bankruptcies, we must at least deal in part with this issue of availability of credit and whether consumers are fully informed. 
   In 1975, total household debt was 24 percent of aggregate household income. Today, the number is more than 100 percent. That bears repeating: Household income and household debt have now matched each other in an extraordinary and dangerous statistic. Certainly, one of the factors that has led to this radical rise in household debt is the amount of solicitation of consumer credit card debt, 
   which include both aggressive and dubious solicitation techniques. 
   In 1998, the credit industry sent out more than 3.5 billion solicitations. That is 41 mailings for every American household; 14 credit solicitations for every man, woman, and child in America. This does not simply represent aggressive marketing for Americans with high incomes who can afford this increase in credit; it includes high school and college students, a situation so serious, as Senator DODD pointed out yesterday on the floor of the Senate, that 450 colleges and universities have banned the marketing of credit cards on their campuses; so serious that credit card debt is a leading reason for college students dropping out of school. 
   I recognize the problem. Our amendment does not restrict access to credit, as many Senators would not support that. There is no mandatory control. All we are doing is simply ensuring that before people with low income or students incur this debt, they at least know the consequences of the debt they are accepting. If this is true for students, it is equally true for low-income people. Just in this decade, Americans below the poverty line have doubled their credit usage. Indeed, that is one of the reasons credit card debt now accounts for 31 percent of all consumer debt, putting not only students but low-income people on a treadmill from which they will never, ever escape. 
   Yet I recognize why many Senators would never accept restricting access to credit because the availability of credit to low-income people, even to students, in a free economy is part of how they make investments, make their own judgments. The answer is not to restrict credit to poor people or working people or students. The Senate has rejected that technique, and I do not offer it today. I offer full disclosure. Full disclosure means the 55 to 60 million households in America that carry a credit card balance on average, month to month, of $7,000, which incurs interest and fees of $1,000 a year, will understand the consequences of that debt before and during incurring that debt. Too few consumers understand making only the minimum payment means their balance will grow and they may never, in a reasonable amount of time, have that debt paid. 
   Specifically, what are we asking under this amendment? First, we are requiring a warning as appears on this chart which, in my own office, has modestly been dubbed ``the Torricelli warning.'' It has provisions in it specifically that will warn that, with a balance of $1,000 and 17-percent interest, if the consumer pays only the minimum payment, it will take 88 months to pay off the balance. Here is that warning:  
   Minimum payment warning: Making only the minimum payment will increase the interest you pay and the time it takes to repay your balance. For example, making only the typical 2-percent minimum monthly payment on a balance of $1,000 at an interest rate of 17 percent would take 88 months to repay the balance in full. For an estimate of the time it would take to repay your balance making only the minimum payments, call this toll-free number.  
   First, in this Torricelli warning, we put a 1-800 number that is available for people to call to get the specifics of how long it will take to pay down your account. That is one. 
   No. 2, we will require creditors to disclose that interest on loans secured by a dwelling is tax deductible only to the value of the property because too many consumers are being told if they secure their debt with their real estate, it is tax 
   deductible, only then to find if they have a debt beyond the value of the property, it is not tax deductible. We want full disclosure of this fact. 
   This is based on an amendment previously offered by Senator REED. It has great merit. I have included it in this amendment that I offer with Senator GRASSLEY and others of my colleagues. 
   No. 3, we require that with credit solicitations containing an introductory or teaser rate, which is so popular, the date at which the introductory rate will expire must be clearly and conspicuously disclosed, so people understand these low interest rates will expire and when they expire, so they can make an informed judgment as consumers. This is based on legislation previously offered by Senator SCHUMER. I think it is invaluable. 
   No. 4, we require that disclosure of the standard truth-in-lending information now required for paper solicitations also be required for Internet solicitations. What we are already requiring on paper solicitations we simply apply to the Internet. This is also based on an amendment offered in committee by Senator SCHUMER. I think it is extremely valuable. 
   No. 5, we require prominent disclosure of the date on which a late fee will be charged and the amount of the fee. If people are subjecting themselves to late fees, that fact and what the fee would be must be disclosed in the amendment Senator GRASSLEY and I are offering. This, as well, is based on something Senator SCHUMER has done in the past, and we are very grateful for his valuable contribution to it. 
   No. 6, finally, we prohibit a creditor from terminating an account prior to its expiration date because a consumer has not incurred finance charges. To me, this is the most outrageous of the abuses of the credit industry. A person uses their credit card, they pay off the balance in full, therefore not availing themselves of the credit that could be used, and there is no interest rate because they are paying off their balance, and they are getting their credit card taken from them. We would prohibit that. Good consumers who use their credit card and do not incur any debt do not have to pay, and should not be penalized, for being responsible consumers. We prohibit that practice. 
   I believe, therefore, what we have done with Senator LEAHY and Senator BIDEN, under the leadership of Senator GRASSLEY, is balanced, it is fair, it is at this point the only chance in the bankruptcy bill to have real consumer protection. It is the only amendment being offered on a bipartisan basis. It is based on the very good work of Senator REED and Senator BIDEN, Senator LEAHY, Senator SCHUMER, and Senator DURBIN. I hope, based on that work, this amendment can be adopted. 
   I yield the floor and thank my colleagues for their contributions to this amendment.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Privacy Protection Study Commission Act of 1999 with my colleague, Senator KOHL. This legislation creates a Commission to comprehensively examine privacy concerns. This Commission will provide Congress with information to facilitate our decision making regarding how to best address individual privacy protections. 
   The rise in the use of information technology--particularly the Internet, has led to concerns regarding the security of personal information. As many as 40 million people around the world have the ability to access the Internet. The use of computers for personal and business transactions has resulted in the availability of vast amounts of financial, medical and other information in the public domain. Information about online users is also collected by Web sites through technology which tracks an individual's every interaction with the Internet. 
   Despite the ease of availability of personal information, the United States is one of the few countries in the world that does not have comprehensive legal protection for personal information. This is in part due to differences in opinion regarding the best way to address the problem. While some argue that the Internet's size and constantly changing technology demands government and industry self-regulation, others advocate for strong legislative and regulatory protections. And, still others note that such protections, although necessary, could lead to unconstitutional consequences if drafted without a comprehensive understanding of the issue. As a result, congressional efforts to address privacy concerns have been patchwork in nature. 
   This is why Senator KOHL and I are proposing the creation of a Commission with the purpose of thoughtfully considering the range of issues involved in the privacy debate and the implications of self-regulation, legislation, and federal regulation. The Commission will be comprised of experts in the fields of law, civil rights, business, and government. After 18 months, the Commission will deliver a report to Congress recommending the necessary legislative protections are needed. The Commission will have the authority to gather the necessary information to reach conclusions that are balanced and fair. 
   Americans are genuinely concerned about individual privacy. The Privacy Commission proposed by Senator KOHL and myself will enable Congress and the public to evaluate the extent to which we should be concerned and the proper way to address those concerns. The privacy debate is multifaceted and I encourage my colleagues to join Senator KOHL and myself in our efforts to gain a better understanding of it. Senator KOHL and I look forward to working with all those interested in furthering this debate and giving Americans a greater sense of confidence in the security of their personal information.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that is important not only to every American of Italian descent, but to any American citizen who values our Constitutional freedoms. This legislation draws attention to the plight of Italian Americans during World War II. Their story has received little attention until now, and I am pleased to be able to heighten public awareness about the injustices they suffered. 
   Hours after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested 250 Italian Americans and shipped them to internment camps in Montana and Ellis Island. These men had done nothing wrong. Their only crime was their Italian heritage and the suspicion that they could be dangerous during war time. By 1942, all Italian immigrants, approximately 600,000 people, were labeled ``enemy aliens'' and given photo IDs which they had to carry at all times. They could travel no further than five miles from their homes and were required to turn in all cameras, flashlights and weapons. 
   These violations did not discriminate against class or social status. In San Francisco, Joe DiMaggio's parents were forbidden to go further than five miles from their home without a permit. Even Enrico Fermi, a leading Italian physicist who was instrumental in America's development of the atomic bomb, could not travel freely along the East Coast. Yet, while these activities persisted in the United States, Italian Americans comprised the largest ethnic group in the Armed Forces. During the war, Italian Americans fought valiantly to defend the freedoms that their loved ones were being denied at home. 
   These are the stories we know about and the facts which have come to light. Yet more than fifty years after the end of World War II, the American people still do not know the details of the Italian American internment, and the American government has yet to acknowledge that these events ever took place. Through this legislation, the Administration will be required to report on the extent to which civil liberties were violated. The Justice Department would conduct a comprehensive review of the Italian American internment, and report its findings, including the name of every person taken into custody, interned, or arrested. The specific injustices they suffered in camps and jail cells would also be detailed in the report. Moreover, federal agencies, from the Department of Education to the National Endowment for the Humanities, would be encouraged to support projects like ``Una Storia Segreta'' that draw attention to this episode of American history. 
   The United States has rightfully admitted its error in interning Japanese Americans. However, Americans of Italian descent suffered equal hardships and this same recognition has been denied to them. I look forward to working with my colleagues to secure passage of this legislation so that the United States government will begin to release the facts about this era. Only then can Italian Americans begin to come to terms with the treatment they received during World War II.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, included in these nominations is the United States attorney for New Jersey, Faith Hochberg, of the Federal district court, who has been nominated by the President. Mrs. Hochberg's quest for the Federal district court began with my predecessor, Senator Bradley, who nominated her. I, indeed, succeeded in that quest and am very pleased tonight she will be confirmed to the Federal district court. 
   I thank Senator LEAHY for his efforts in the course of the last week to bring the nomination forward and, of course, Senator GRASSLEY for his efforts tonight. She succeeded in having been an extraordinarily successful United States attorney. We are very grateful for her service that now comes to an end and wish her well in the Federal district court. 
   I have no objection.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to address a potential crisis in our nation's system of organ donation. Last year, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) proposed regulations that would have had devastating effects on community-based transplant programs by prohibiting states from offering organs to their own sickest residents before making them available nationwide. In response to the overwhelming concerns of patients and health care professionals nationwide, Congress delayed the implementation of the regulations and commissioned a study by the Institute of Medicine to examine the impact of the regulations on the nation's current system. 
   The study drew several conclusions which demonstrate how the current system is effective and why the proposed regulations are misguided. For example, the study found that the current system of organ transplantation is reasonably equitable and effective for the sickest patients. It also found that the proposed regulations would increase the overall cost of transplantation in the U.S. Perhaps most important, the study found that the current system does not discriminate because of race or any other factors and that the waiting list for an organ transplant are treated fairly. 
   These conclusions support the long-held concerns of the organ transplant community that the regulations, which would direct the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) to develop a system which removes geography as a factor in organ donation, may actually increase waiting times in states, like New Jersey, with efficient systems. 
   These unintended consequences will be felt most greatly among patients with disadvantaged backgrounds. In New Jersey, we are extremely fortunate to have a system that is fair and efficient. New Jersey's unique system of certificate of need and charity care ensures that the most critical patients get organs first regardless of insurance. A national organ donation system will force the smaller transplant centers that serve the uninsured and underinsured to close as the vast majority of organs go to the handful of the nation's largest transplant centers with the longest waiting lists. Without access to smaller programs, many patients will be faced with the hardship of registering with out-of-state programs that may turn them away due to lack of insurance. Those who are accepted will be forced to travel out of state at great medical risk and financial hardship. 
   In light of these concerns, the conferees of the FY 2000 Labor, Health, and Human Services, and Education bill included language extending the moratorium on the regulations for a period of three months. While this is a very positive step, I am concerned that this moratorium would not provide sufficient time for Congress to consider this issue as part of the debate on the reauthorization of the National Organ Transplant Act. 
   I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators SESSIONS, HUTCHINSON, WARNER, MACK, SHELBY, NICKLES, INHOFE, THURMOND, ASHCROFT, MCCONNELL, ROBERTS, KOHL, FEINGOLD, CLELAND, HOLLINGS, BREAUX, GRAHAM, COLLINS, GRAMS, LAUTENBERG, ENZI, MURSKOWSKI, GORTON, LANDRIEU, ROBB, and LINCOLN to introduce the Organ Donation Regulatory Relief Act of 1999. 
   This bipartisan legislation will delay the Secretary's ability to issue regulations regarding the nation's organ donation system until Congress considers the complex issues surrounding organ procurement and allocation as part of the reauthorization of the National Organ Transplant Act. 
   For the past 15 years, the national organ procurement and allocation system has existed without federal regulation. During this time, each State has developed a unique system to meet their individual needs. Many states, such as New Jersey, have focused on serving uninsured and underprivileged populations. Clearly improvements can be made to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of organ donation nationwide. The legislation will ensure Congress has ample time to consider these important issues prior to allowing the implementation of far-reaching regulations that will revamp the system.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there are few matters of more importance to the nation than the safeguarding of our security. Every day, tens of thousands of men and women wear the American uniform proudly in all the world's time zones while guarding against threats to American citizens and our interests. Perhaps there is no more perilous environment in which our servicemen and women operate than beneath the oceans. Because of the secrecy demanded by the myriad missions, Navy submariners have come to be known as the silent service. Often reluctant to speak on their own behalf, I commend to my colleagues attention the following article which is of great importance, not only to our nation's undersea warriors, but to the nation's security. 
   The commentary in Defense News touches upon an important opportunity. It is the chance to secure more useful life from four Ohio-class submarines slated for retirement. The article suggests the possibility of converting them from their strategic nuclear duties into tactical Tomahawk shooters able to provide our overseas warfighting commanders additional striking capability.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank Senator GRASSLEY for what has been a valuable partnership in crafting what I believe to be extremely important legislation. It would be fair to conclude that without the tenacity of Senator GRASSLEY, this Senate would not be considering bankruptcy legislation. Without his reasonableness in reaching some of these provisions, it would not be the kind of progressive legislation that I believe is before us today. 
   I also note that I am a successor to Senator DURBIN who, like Senator GRASSLEY, has invested not months but more than a year in crafting this legislation. Senator DURBIN's contributions are on virtually every page. Working with Senator DURBIN and, indeed, with Senator GRASSLEY has not only been a pleasure; it has been a productive exercise. For that, I am very grateful. 
   These are unusual times in our country, such an extraordinary combination of economic circumstances. Unemployment is low, home ownership is at record levels, and, for the first time in years, the Federal Government is operating with a surplus. This would lead many to believe these are not only good economic times but perfect economic times. This, of course does bear closer scrutiny. 
   There are several troubling aspects with the modern American economy. They are not unrelated. One is a rapidly declining rate of personal savings--indeed, in the last quarter, the lowest savings rate by American families in our history. 
   The second is the rapid, almost inexplicable rise in consumer bankruptcies. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection. This represented a 20-percent increase since 1996 and a staggering 350-percent increase since 1980. 
   We can differ on the reasons. We can have our own theories. But something is wrong. That ``something'' is not only jeopardizing the economic security of American families, it is providing a staggering financial burden on small businesses and American financial institutions. 
   It is estimated 70 percent of the these bankruptcy situations were filed in chapter 7, which provides relief for most unsecured debt. Just 30 percent of these petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a repayment plan. 
   There are, obviously, disagreements about what has caused this dramatic increase. It is probable there is no one reason but a confluence of problems. Some suggest that culturally the stigma of bankruptcy has been removed and people no longer feel any inhibition in admitting their financial circumstances and seeking total relief from personal obligations. Others believe it is simply abuse of a system in which it is too simple to avoid responsibility. Others argue that a reliance on debt and a decrease in personal savings has left record numbers of Americans vulnerable to this change and leading to these extraordinary levels of bankruptcy. 
   Obviously, in the complexities of modern life--with low savings rates, high levels of debt, attentions of our current culture, unexpected events, divorce, a health crisis, given the enormous cost of health care in the Nation, the loss of a job or the loss of job skills because of changes of technology--any one of them, no less a combination of them, can take an American family who believes it is living with financial security and force them under a crushing debt into bankruptcy. 
   The reality, of course, is a majority of these bankruptcies are hard-working American people, low- or middle-class families, who largely, through no fault of their own, sometimes due to these circumstances that I have outlined, find themselves with overwhelming financial problems and they simply cannot deal with the crushing blow. For all the abuses, the fact remains that accounts for most of these bankruptcies. 
   At the same time, in a recent study the Department of Justice has found that 13 percent of all those debtors filing under chapter 7, or an incredible 182,000 people, can afford to repay a significant amount of this debt. This would mean to creditors, family-owned businesses, small retailers, and important financial institutions, an incredible $4 billion that could be returned to creditors but is avoided through what I perceive to be a misuse of the bankruptcy system. 
   These are the factors, the statistics, and the concerns that led Senator GRASSLEY and I to offer this comprehensive bankruptcy reform. 
   The bill before the Senate strikes a balance making it more difficult for the unscrupulous to abuse the system, while ensuring that bankruptcy protection for families who need it will find it available. 
   These abuses which result in this $4 billion loss to creditors is not paid by some distant institution off our shores separated from the realities of American life or our economy. This is money avoided through the unscrupulous use of the bankruptcy system that is added onto every piece of clothing you buy in the store, every automobile you purchase from a show room, every credit card you use, and every bank loan that you take. 
   Those hard-working Americans who pay their bills are forced, through bankruptcy, through no fault of their own, to 
   share these costs. That is what brings us here today. 
   At its core, the Grassley-Torricelli bill is designed to assure that those with the ability to repay a portion of their debts do so by establishing clear and reasonable criteria to determine repayment obligations. 
   It provides judicial discretion to ensure that no one genuinely in need of debt cancellation will be prevented from receiving a fresh start. Recognizing that a fresh start and an ability to have a new life have been at the core in this country, that has been the reason for bankruptcy protection since the establishment of the Republic. We believe in second chances in life. We also don't believe in people escaping obligations they can meet or misusing the legal system. 
   It is because, however, of our concern that vulnerable people who genuinely use the system for a new start in life would have their position jeopardized by our legitimate efforts to find those who are abusing the system that we have designed a flexible means testing system in the bankruptcy bill for the first time. Under current law, virtually anyone who files for complete debt relief under chapter 7 will receive it. 
   The Grassley-Torricelli bill creates a needs-based system by establishing a presumption that a chapter 7 filing should be either dismissed or converted to a chapter 13 when the debtor has sufficient income to repay at least $15,000, or 25 percent of their outstanding debt. That is the essence of the needs-based system. It is a simple presumption. You can pay $15,000, or 25 percent. It is not closed to you. There is no prohibition. But there is a presumption that you can pay. You need to meet that presumption only for those individuals. 
   I believe this is a flexible yet very efficient screen to move debtors to the ability to repay a portion of their debt into a repayment plan, while at the same time ensuring judicial discretion and a fair review given the debtor's individual circumstances. 
   In addition, the bill contains several important consumer safeguards to prevent unfair harassment by creditors. It requires the Attorney General and the FBI Director to designate one prosecutor and one agent in every district to investigate reaffirmation practices that violate Federal law. 
   This is an important element of this bill to ensure that individual creditors do not seek their own remedy outside of the law, forcing people who cannot repay or should not be repaying, given their individual circumstances and income, to do so. 
   It penalizes creditors who refuse to negotiate reasonable repayment schedules prior to bankruptcy. 
   The emphasis remains on settlement through negotiations--not litigation and conflict. 
   Importantly, the bill also does everything possible to guarantee that child support payments in bankruptcy are not jeopardized, are a priority, and continue. 
   This was the priority in the Judiciary Committee--that we would reform this system, we would provide new opportunities for debtors to collect, new safeguards for people in bankruptcy, but that child support payments and family obligations will remain paramount. 
   I believe in the balance that is achieved in this legislation, and that Senator GRASSLEY and I have met that objective. It was critical to do so because more than one-third of bankruptcies in the United States involve spousal or child support orders. This bill will not be a vehicle for people escaping their family obligations. 
   In half of these cases, women are creditors trying to collect court-ordered support from their former husbands. These support orders are a lifeline for these families. I believe this legislation has protected it, recognizing the vulnerability of these families, and why this was a priority in the legislation. 
   Mr. President, 44 percent of single parent families with children under the age of 18 had incomes below the poverty line in recent years. The child support amounting to an average of nearly $3,000 is often the only thing that keeps a single parent and a dependent child off public assistance. Senator GRASSLEY and I have achieved this protection and I believe this fair provision of protecting these families by elevating child support from its current place as seventh on the repayment priority list to first place. This is critical for Members of the Senate to understand. Currently, these child support payments are seventh on the list of priorities. Under the Grassley-Torricelli legislation, it will now be first priority. No bank, no insurance company, no credit card company, no retailer--no one--will have higher priority than the children or the spouses involved in these cases. 
   There were other concerns in the Judiciary Committee which needed to be addressed, other balances that have been achieved that the Senate should recognize. First, the managers' amendment that will be offered incorporates the language offered by Senator FEINGOLD to remedy a provision in the bill carried over from the legislation of a previous year which would have made  debtors' attorneys responsible for costs and fees. That provision would have made it impossible for many middle-income people, people of modest means, to ever get an attorney. In cases where there is any judgment to be reached, any questions on the merits, it would have been impossible to get an attorney, disenfranchising many Americans from the entire bankruptcy system. A motion brought by the trustee to move the debtor from chapter 7 into chapter 13 and the original filing was, we found, not substantially justified. Those costs would have been incurred by the attorney. The managers' amendment will protect against this provision. 
   Second, the managers' amendment will include a safe harbor, exempting every debtor with income below the median income from the means test. This provision will ensure low-income people with no hope of prepaying their debts are not swept into the means test. 
   A final point I raised that is resolved by the managers' amendment is the use of IRS standards in the bill. Currently, the bill uses living expense standards formulated by the IRS in determining what portion of their debts an individual has the ability to repay. These standards were not formulated with bankruptcy in mind and provide virtually no flexibility to account for the debtor's actual expenses. They were, therefore, not appropriate. The managers' amendment will clarify the Justice Department and Treasury have the authority to draft bankruptcy appropriate standards and not use the IRS standards previously used. 
   For each of these provisions and their incorporation in this legislation, we are very indebted to members of the Judiciary Committee: Senator FEINGOLD, for his efforts in recognizing the possible abuses of putting these costs on to bankruptcy attorneys if the cases were lost; and Senator DURBIN, at his insistence and my own, we provided for an appropriate means test; and for the Department of Justice coming up with its own means test standards. Senator DURBIN, in particular, was very helpful with these provisions. Senator GRASSLEY, recognizing their merits, has brought them into the legislation. It is, therefore, far better legislation because of each of 
   these provisions. 
   There is, however, one final area which also must be addressed to ensure the bill is both balanced and bipartisan. It is critical the bill not only address the debtor's abuse of bankruptcy but also overreaching and sometimes abusive practices of the credit industry. Any American who gets their own mail understands some change is taking place in the American economy--the extraordinary solicitation of customers, by the 3.5 billion individual efforts by the credit card industry to get new customers. This represents 41 mailings for every American household every year; 14 for every man, woman, and child in the Nation. No one disputes both the right and the advisability of the credit card industry seeking solicitation of new customers who are creditworthy, have incomes and the need for available consumer credit. It is right and an important part of our economy. That is not the objective of this legislation. 
   Our concern in balancing provisions dealing with consumer abuse of the bankruptcy laws with credit industry abuse of consumers focuses instead on people of modest incomes who are offered credit they could never afford, debt they will incur that they can never deal with, young people and the elderly, in credit obligations they do not even understand. The situation, indeed, has become so serious with students that 450 colleges nationwide have banned the marketing of credit cards on their campuses. Low-income families are being targeted with the same frequency as students--the endless solicitation of debt they cannot meet and should not incur. 
   Since this decade began, Americans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their credit usage. The result is entirely predictable. Mr. President, 27 percent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of their income. Modest-income families, sometimes high school students, often people on public assistance, receiving hundreds if not thousands of credit solicitations by companies that should recognize with any due diligence that is fully available to the industry that these debts can never be paid. I have granted to the industry that unfortunate changes in our culture, abuses of the bankruptcy laws, and a host of other reasons have led to needed changes in the bankruptcy laws to avoid these abuses. No one can credibly argue there is not some need of the industry to do so as well. 
   In this legislation we offer the consumers must be given information about the consequences of their debt: fair disclosure if only the minimum debt is paid as required by the credit card company or the bank; how long will it take for repayment to be made; and what will it cost, information that should be made available to every consumer, people believing if they make the minimum payments they will actually ever be out of debt. We want them to recognize the years and the enormous costs of doing so. 
   Senator GRASSLEY, working with Senator SCHUMER, Senator DURBIN, and others, has reached an accommodation that I think is fair to the industry but will provide real consumer protection through disclosure. The adoption of that amendment is as vital to a balanced bill as the protection of child support, the moving of people into repayment schedules, and a means test. 
   This is an extraordinary piece of legislation. It is a challenge to all those who believe this Senate cannot operate on a bipartisan basis. There will be opposition to bankruptcy reform. It may be 5, 10, 15 or 20 votes, but it will be a small minority. This is genuinely bipartisan legislation. It can be adopted without rancor after months, if not years, of effort by Senators from both sides of the aisle. It is fair; it is balanced for the credit card industry and consumers. 
   I end as I began, expressing my gratitude to Senator GRASSLEY and members of the Judiciary Committee, and I compliment the Senate on what I believe will be a worthwhile and informative debate as we adopt this comprehensive bankruptcy reform. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator GRASSLEY on offering the amendment. I am proud to offer it with him. 
   We could not do comprehensive bankruptcy reform without dealing with the crisis in the health care industry. Last year, bankruptcies by health care providers were up 15 percent. One nursing home company alone, which has 300 nursing homes, left an estimated 37,000 people without beds when it filed for bankruptcy. One, the Doctors Network in California, when it went into bankruptcy, left 1.3 million people without health care. 
   As the Senator pointed out in his remarks, the bankruptcy laws are designed for creditors and they are designed for people who are debtors, but the customers, in this case the patients, are not provided for. 
   One of the worst cases in the country was when the HIP health care plan in New Jersey went bankrupt leaving 194,000 subscribers without clear health care provisions. Indeed, it has left New Jersey hospitals, almost all of them, in the red this year because their bills were not being paid. 
   I am very grateful we have been able to join together in offering this amendment to ensure there is an ombudsman; that there is help in getting people into new plans; that their records are protected in privacy. I believe we made a real contribution to helping in these difficult moments in the health care industry, and we will have a better bankruptcy reform bill because of it. I am very happy to work with Senator GRASSLEY and grateful for his leadership.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I express my gratitude to Senator HATCH for the drafting of the Hatch-Torricelli amendment that is before the Senate. Senator HATCH has reinforced his reputation by a commitment to American families and American children that is almost without peer. This is an extremely important amendment, and it strengthens the provisions of the bankruptcy reform legislation as they deal with families. 
   In drafting bankruptcy reform, Senator GRASSLEY and I were aware that many people were concerned that changes in the bankruptcy laws would  have the unintended consequences of making spouses or children more vulnerable as people sought protection from their family obligations. 
   Any change in the bankruptcy code obviously and importantly raises questions about family protection because, indeed, one-third of bankruptcies involve spousal and child support orders. In half those cases, women are creditors trying to collect court-ordered support from their husbands. Therefore, the sensitivity that Senator GRASSLEY and I in the general legislation and Senator HATCH and I now offer in this amendment is extremely important for Members of the Senate to have confidence in this bankruptcy reform. 
   It should be remembered by the Senate that these support orders for support of children and spouses are lifelines for thousands of families struggling to maintain self-sufficiency and remain off public assistance. 
   Forty-four percent of single-parent families with children under the age of 18 have incomes below the poverty line. With child support amounting to an average of nearly $3,000 a year, it is too often the only thing keeping families out of poverty and desperation. 
   With these facts in mind, Senator GRASSLEY and I drafted legislation in the managers' amendment that has a very important provision insisting that child support be elevated to first, rather than seventh, in the list of debts to repay by a debtor in bankruptcy. 
   Addressing the Senate this morning, I wanted to bring attention to this provision more than any other. Under current law, a child or a spouse is seventh in the list of debts to be repaid. Under our legislation, it will now be first, where it belongs. 
   The amendment Senator HATCH and I are now offering goes even further. With the help of women's groups and Government enforcement agencies, we have now been able to make several important new additions to this legislation. 
   Hatch-Torricelli, first, prevents civil cases regarding child custody, visitation, and divorce from being held up by an automatic stay. The automatic stay is designed to protect the debtor from coercion by creditors, not to provide the debtor a tactic for delay in dealing with support issues regarding their own children. 
   Our amendment will ensure that child custody and visitation issues are not held hostage by the filing of a bankruptcy petition. Bankruptcy petitions are not designed to interfere with or delay child support or other related issues in family disputes regarding children and spouses. We will not permit that to happen. Hatch-Torricelli reinforces the strength of that provision. 
   Second, the Hatch-Torricelli amendment cracks down on those who seek to avoid payment of child support obligations by requiring the trustee to give the person to whom support is owed and State collection organizations information on the debtor's whereabouts. By this provision, not only are we ensuring that bankruptcy reform not interfere with child support, we are making bankruptcy reform a strengthening provision in finding the whereabouts of those who are seeking to avoid family and child support. 
   It is a reflection of the reality that many people avoid child support by changing jurisdictions, by hiding from law enforcement. We will use the information in bankruptcy to find those who are responsible in avoiding obligations to their children. 
   Third, the Hatch-Torricelli amendment requires the debtor to pay all child support arrears before the conclusion of a bankruptcy plan unless the spouse agrees otherwise. Not only will bankruptcy reform not be used to complicate child support, people will meet that support, they will deal with their arrears before their bankruptcy petition is acted upon and completed. This will ensure the child support is paid, and paid in full, before the debtor is released from the bankruptcy system. 
   Importantly, however, we do have a safety valve. If the offended spouse believes this is not in their interest, they can indeed waive this provision. For example, if more money may be available for payment of support obligations after confirmation of the bankruptcy plan because other debts are discharged, then there can be a waiver. 
   I believe, though we already have good legislation that Senator GRASSLEY and I have offered which would further protect children and spouses, it is now enhanced by the provisions offered by Senator HATCH. I am very proud to be his cosponsor on this important amendment. I believe we have a better bill because of it. I believe American children and families will be strengthened in the bankruptcy proceedings because of it. I am proud to offer it, Mr. President. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. LEAHY addressed the Chair.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my sorrow at last week's tragedy in the Armenian National Parliament. Prime Minister Sarkissian, Speaker Demirchian, and six other legislators were killed. While we may never know what motivated the gunmen to storm the building, we do know that a single act of terror was directed against individuals who were attempting to build and strengthen Armenia's democratic institutions. Armenia has made positive movement toward widespread democracy and free markets, and the leaders who lost their lives had played important roles in these reforms. As a result, this tragedy is truly a great loss for the Armenian people. For this reason, I have joined Senator ABRAHAM in introducing a resolution condemning the incident. 
   After months of progress on a range of issues, from the rule of law, to Nagorno-Karabakh, to fighting corruption, Armenia is faced with a huge obstacle to overcome. Just this past week, Armenia held local elections nation-wide that were deemed free and fair by independent observers. These elections were not without minor irregularities, but the overall impact has been to reaffirm and further strengthen the commitment of the Armenian people to an open election process. 
   On the complex issue of peace in Nagorno-Karabakh, significant progress has been made recently. Bilateral meetings between President Kocharian and President Aliyev have been frequent and intensive in response to our encouragement for greater results. Just hours before the attack, Prime Minister Sarkissian had met with President Kocharian and Deputy Secretary of State Talbott to discuss the peace process. Clearly, it will be difficult for Armenia to move forward without Sarkissian's presence--difficult, but not impossible. 
   Given the tremendous amount of progress Armenia has made since declaring independence from the Soviet Union, I am confident that the Armenian people will move past this tragic event and continue to build upon their successes. But the key to doing so is ongoing support from the United States. Together, our two countries have built strong ties, focusing upon a prosperous, secure and democratic future. It is critical that, in the midst of such overpowering grief, we renew our support for the people of Armenia and their leaders. As they continue to build upon the principles that the victims had worked to fulfill, the people of Armenia should know that the United States supports their efforts. I hope my colleagues will join me in sending this message to the Armenian people.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in observance of ``National Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Week'' to highlight the problem of childhood lead poisoning and the deficiencies within the current system of detection and prevention. 
   Lead poisoning is the number one environmental health hazard to our children, despite a ban on the manufacture of lead paint and efforts to remove lead from gasoline and dietary sources. It is estimated that 800,000 children today suffer from elevated lead levels. Lead poisoning attacks a child's nervous system, impairing physical, mental, and behavioral development. Extreme exposure can cause seizures, brain damage, comas, and even death. And, inadequate diet and exposure to environmental hazards such as old housing make the threat greatest for those who possess the fewest resources to confront it--our nation's poor children. 
   This is why in 1992 Congress required states to test every Medicaid recipient under age two for lead poisoning. Mandatory screening would enable the highest-risk children to be tested and treated before lead poisoning impairs their development. However, many Medicaid providers are not conducting the required screening. A recent GAO study found that two-thirds of the children on Medicaid have never been screened for lead. In New Jersey, only 39% of children covered by Medicaid are tested. 
   A report issued this past summer from the Alliance to End Childhood Lead Poisoning and the National Center for Lead-Safe Housing provides new information regarding the extent of this problem. This report, a state-by-state analysis of follow-up care provided to lead-poisoned children, found that only 29 states have standards for how to care for lead-poisoned children. The report also found that only 35 states have developed specific strategies for investigating lead hazards in poisoned children's homes. And, 22 states reported that they lack the necessary funding to make a home safe for a lead-poisoned child. 
   This report presents compelling evidence in support of legislation, S.1120, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999, introduced by Senator REED and myself to strengthen lead screening policy. This legislation would ensure that every federal program which serves at risk kids is involved in the lead screening process. Our bill would require WIC and Head Start centers to determine if a child has been tested and ensure testing for those children who have not. As 75% of at-risk children are enrolled in federal health care programs, this would ensure that no child is overlooked. 
   Secondly, the Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999 would guarantee that Medicaid contracts explicitly require health care providers to adhere to federal rules for screening and treatment. Currently, many states are having Medicaid services provided by health maintenance organizations (HMO's). These HMO's, however, either are not conducting the required lead screening tests or are only conducting one of two required tests. This legislation would effectively stop this corner cutting. Our bill would also ensure that states and federal agencies have the resources and incentives to complete mandatory screening by requiring Medicaid to reimburse WIC and Head Start for screening costs. We must create a bonus program that rewards states who screen more than 65% of their Medicaid population. 
   But additional testing is only a first step. Our legislation would also focus on prevention by reducing the sources of poisoning and provide for follow-up care for those children identified as at-risk. This includes expanding Medicaid coverage to include treatment for lead poisoning and for environmental investigations to determine its sources. 
   I am extremely pleased to tell my colleagues that in response to the efforts of the Senator from Rhode Island and myself, the Department of Health and Human Services has initiated some important steps to address the problem. Their efforts include ensuring that state Medicaid agencies comply with existing Medicaid policies requiring lead screening and requiring states to report the number of children under age six screened for lead poisoning. These measures will help us to better understand the problem and how to respond to it. 
   However, enhancing screening and identifying children exposed to lead is only the first step. Identification must be followed with treatment and abatement, including controlling the source of lead poisoning. For example, my own state of New Jersey has made great efforts in the area of abatement. Specifically, New Jersey requires the renovation and maintenance of older housing as well as mandating landlords to periodically test for lead. New Jersey has also initiated statewide programs to educate families on how to find and eliminate lead sources from their homes. 
   Similarly, on the federal level, the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides grants to states and local governments to reduce lead hazards in housing. Yet, for every application, there are nine that go unfunded. This year, the House tried to cut funding for this program by $10 million. Although conferees ultimately restored funding equal to the President's request, this attempt demonstrates the need to provide greater awareness of the need for lead prevention efforts. 
   As the Alliance report suggests, there is more every state must do and there is clearly more the federal government can do to protect lead-poisoned children. I encourage my colleagues to examine the Alliance report and learn about what can be done in your states to improve lead poisoning treatment and prevention efforts. Finally, I would encourage Senator ROTH and Senator JEFFORDS to begin hearings not only on our legislation but also on this issue. In 1992, Congress  made a commitment to improving our children's health by reducing the prevalence of childhood lead poisoning and improving treatment. I urge my colleagues to join Senator REED and myself in fulfilling this commitment.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mayor Ronald Dobies of Middlesex Borough on his induction into the New Jersey Elected Officials Hall of Fame. After nearly 30 years in public service Mayor Dobies was inducted last January. He was first elected Mayor in 1979, and he has been re-elected four times since. Prior to this service, Mayor Dobies was a member of the school board for six years, as well as a four-year member of the Borough Council. 
   Through these years, Mayor Dobies' administrations have grappled with some basic suburban dilemmas, such as preserving open space while attracting development and keeping municipal services up and taxes down. Among his accomplishments, Mayor Dobies has secured flood-control measures and ongoing road projects, increased park and recreation areas, and overseen the construction of the borough's Senior Citizen Housing complex. 
   Mayor Dobies is originally from Scranton, Pennsylvania, and attended the University of Scranton. He graduated with a degree in chemistry and philosophy, and ultimately joined basic training at Fort Gordon in Augusta, Georgia. After serving in the military police corps overseas, Ronald and his wife Blanche returned to the United States. 
   Mayor Dobies has added to his impressive record of community service by demonstrating his abilities in the business world as well. He is currently the Director of Analytical Research for Wyeth-Ayerst Research in Pearl River, New York. While this job is a full-time one, he still finds the time to devote between 30 and 40 hours each week to his responsibilities as Mayor. Each Friday night, Mayor Dobies hosts meetings with his constituents, a tradition he began during his first term. Mayor Dobies has won the respect of both Republicans and Democrats in his borough, and his non-contentious style has promoted a successful bipartisan spirit at all levels of government in Middlesex Borough. This December, Mayor Dobies will conclude his fifth term, and he hopes to return for a sixth next year. I look forward to his continued service in this office, and I extend my congratulations to him on his honor by the New Jersey Elected Officials Hall of Fame.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the efforts of my constituent, Mr. Ramon de la Cruz, who serves as President of the Hispanic Bar Association, HBA, of New Jersey. Mr. de la Cruz is being honored on November 6, 1999 at the Annual Scholarship Gala of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey, and I am proud to congratulate him on a job well done. 
   Recently, we celebrated National Hispanic Heritage Month. I am proud today to recognize the efforts of a man and organization who illustrate so well the strong work ethic, deep affinity to service and commitment to our nation of the Hispanic American community. For countless years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role in our legal system, and I am proud to represent a state with a large concentration of Hispanic Americans. Their commitment to this country has not gone unnoticed. 
   Ramon de la Cruz has been active with the HBA for the past ten years and has served with distinction. He has lent his support to countless causes, including the promotion of qualified Hispanic lawyers for state and federal judgeships, creating scholarship opportunities for law students, and initiating professional exchange opportunities in conjunction with other bar associations. Additionally, Ramon has served as editor of ABOGADO, the official publication of the HBA, for four years. Furthermore, when it came time to consider candidates for the federal bench, Ramon was one of the people I turned to for assistance. I was proud to submit to the White House the nomination of Judge Julio Fuentes to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, and Ramon worked extensively with my staff to bring this to fruition. Ramon has been vital to the success of the Hispanic Bar Association of New Jersey. Through his efforts, membership has grown to approximately three times that of previous years.  
   Mr. de la Cruz is a resident of Guttenberg in the diverse County of Hudson, which is home to countless Hispanic Americans that I have the privilege of representing. Since its inception and through Ramon's leadership, the HBA has been dedicated to making a real difference in our state, and indeed the nation. Ramon has brought vision and new energy to this organization. 
   The judicial branch plays such a critical role in the life of our democratic institutions, and the industry is well served by true professionals like Ramon de la Cruz. His credentials and background are indeed impressive. 
   The HBA's positive impact on the Hispanic community has spread to other communities in a manner that transcends racial and ethnic differences. Mr. President, activism is important to creating a sense of personal responsibility for one's community. The HBA embodies this concept, and should be celebrated for successfully instilling it in others. I take pride in recognizing distinguished individuals in the great State of New Jersey like Ramon de la Cruz.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the St. Paul Baptist Church on the occasion of its centennial celebration. Over the past year, the church has been celebrating its more than one hundred years of service. I am honored to have the opportunity to join with them in their celebration of this tremendous milestone. For over one hundred years, the St. Paul Baptist Church has provided the African-American community with a strong sense of unity as the only black Baptist church in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey. 
   The church has experienced tremendous growth since it was founded by the Reverend M.R. Rosco in 1899. Today, it can boast not only of being a house of faith and worship, but also of its daily contributions to the community of Atlantic Highlands through its  Educational Center and the Vassie L. Peek, Sr. Educational Annex. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of St. Paul's pastor, the Reverend Doctor Henry P. Davis, Jr., to New Jersey's Baptist community. Over the years, Reverend Davis has been a shining example of devotion to his church. In addition to his commitment to his parish, the Reverend has served as Treasurer of the General Baptist State Convention of New Jersey, Moderator of the Seacoast Missionary Baptists Association of New Jersey, an Executive Board member of the New Jersey Council of Churches, and Secretary of the Moderator's Auxiliary of the National Baptist Convention, USA. 
   Once again, I would like to extend my congratulations and warmest wishes to Reverend Davis and his congregation on the occasion of the centennial celebration of St. Paul Baptist Church. The church's contributions to the residents of Atlantic Highlands is unmatched. I can only hope that the next one hundred years will be as rewarding as the first.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every Senator who has taken the floor has given the appropriate compliments to Senator FEINGOLD and Senator MCCAIN. I will be no exception. Congress has been considering campaign finance reform for more than a decade. There have been, by my estimation, 3,000 speeches made on the floor of the Senate for campaign finance reform, some 6,500 pages of CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, 300 pieces of legislation. Indeed, we would not be at this moment without Senator FEINGOLD or Senator MCCAIN. They deserve that credit. 
   I found their arguments in recent years so persuasive that I am today joining Senator DASCHLE in presenting their own legislation. The original McCain-Feingold bill, which found its way to the House of Representatives, is before the Senate now as the Shays-Meehan legislation. Similar in content and purpose, it is comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
   Regarding advocacy of that reform, I take a second place to no Member in my years in the Congress. I have never voted against campaign finance reform, and I never will. I believe the integrity of this system of government and the confidence of the American people is at issue. It is not by chance that only a third of the American people are participating in some elections. Even in the choice of the Presidency of the United States, with those not registered and those not choosing to vote in many of our localities and States, half of the American people are not participating. It is not that they do not recognize the choice is important. I do not believe they have a lack of confidence in our country. They do not respect the process because they believe they do not have an equal position, and it is money that is the heart of that problem. 
   When we entered into this new phase of campaign finance reform 2 years ago, along with most Members of this institution, I had great ambitions for how far we could go with reform. Indeed, in private conversation, almost every Member of this Senate knows the fundamentals of comprehensive reform. We started with such ambition. We were going to subject all independent advocacy groups in issue advertising to the rules of the FEC. We were going to require full and immediate disclosure by all contributors. We were going to ban soft money to the political parties. We were going to prohibit foreign interests. We were going to reduce the cost of television time. We even discussed the subsidies of mail to inform voters. 
   One by one almost every one of these reforms has been eliminated from the legislation. Political cultures in all of our States are different. In my State, in Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Texas, and California, I don't believe  real campaign finance reform is possible without reducing the cost of television advertising. There is a reason for the spiraling rise of campaign spending; it is the cost of television advertising. In each of the large metropolitan areas, 90 percent of the money goes to feed the television networks. That was the first reform to be eliminated. 
   Then there was the advocacy of subsidized mail. It went the way of public finance--one by one by one. Yet, because the need for reform is so overwhelming and the public confidence is so much in question, I joined in the last Congress with Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD and reluctantly supported their legislation. Although I believe these critical provisions for the reduced cost of television advertising were essential for reform in my area of the country, I joined in support of the McCain-Feingold. That was to be followed by the House of Representatives which reached the same judgment in a historic vote for Shays-Meehan. 
   That brings the Senate to this moment. In a frustration I share with other advocates of campaign finance reform, the mantra of the day has become: Do something, do anything. Pass some legislation. Call it reform. Let's put the problem behind us. 
   If only it were so easy. 
   The new legislation presented by Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD has a single objective: to eliminate soft money fundraising from Democratic and Republican Parties. It is a worthwhile objective, but it does raise the prospect that if passed it will eliminate the chance to have any further campaign finance reform. If history is any guide, every decade we get one chance to redesign this system. We are largely still governed by the Watergate reforms of 1974. Through a series of court rulings and FEC decisions, they clearly are no longer producing a system that was once envisioned. If we institute but this single change, we will not create a new system of our design but, in my judgment, be governed by the law of unintended consequences. 
   Let's look for a moment at this new national campaign system. If Senator DASCHLE and I fail and the House of Representatives legislation in Shays-Meehan is rejected and instead we adopt this very narrow reform as envisioned by Senators MCCAIN and FEINGOLD, we eliminate soft money fundraising by the political parties, but it is maintained for issue advocacy and independent expenditures. 
   The principal rise in campaign advertising in recent years is not the political parties; it is this independent advocacy expenditure. This chart tells the story. In 1998, the Democratic and Republican Parties spent $64 million in issue advocacy spending; nonparty advocacy groups spent $276 million, rising at a rate of 300 percent cycle to cycle. 
   In my hand I have the list of 70 advocacy groups. It begins alphabetically with the AFL-CIO and ends with the Vietnam Veterans. In between are many organizations I support and believe have a worthwhile contribution to the national political debate; some I note I do not believe have great contributions to the political debate. But they are all heard--in the last election cycle, $276 million worth of advocacy. 
   The legislation before the Senate by Senators FEINGOLD and MCCAIN does nothing about the expenditures, nothing. 
   Nothing. Many exist as nonprofit tax-free organizations under the IRS Code. From whom they raise money is unknown. As to the sources of their contributions, no one in this Senate could attest. They often exist before the public eye as names that misrepresent their purpose and are designed to shield their objectives. They are not just a part of the national political advertising debate; they are coming to dominate it. 
   What is this new campaign finance world that will be produced if Senator DASCHLE and I fail and the House of Representatives Shays-Meehan legislation is rejected? A national political debate that is fought by surrogates. The Democratic and Republican Parties will be within FEC rules, raising money only at $1,000 per person, $50 a person, $100 a person--a good system, where every name will be known, limits will be imposed to reasonable amounts. But over our heads will be a far larger contest fought by the AFL-CIO, with millions more dollars of expenditures, the Christian Coalition, anti-abortion groups, chemical companies, automobile companies, steel companies, that will spend millions, indeed, if history now is any guide, hundreds of millions of dollars of advocacy.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. It is the central point. The proper system is the full disclosures we have for the Democratic and Republican Parties; limit those political parties just to these hard money contributions within the law, but extend that to all Americans who participate in the national political debate. 
   The fact that my colleague, as a Senator, has accounted for every dollar he has raised, and he did so within limits, but these major groups enter his State either on his behalf or against his candidacy, yet my colleague doesn't know who they are or where their money is coming from and to whom they are accountable, is the heart of the problem.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I point out to the Senator from Nevada, this is not simply a problem with our adversaries; sometimes it is a problem with our allies. 
   When I go to the people of New Jersey, I want to present to them who I am and what I want to do, what my record is as a Senator. Groups whose support I am very proud of--AFL-CIO, National Abortion Rights League, Sierra Club, environmental groups--I am proud to have their support, but I don't want them presenting my campaign. Under the system that would be in place if Shays-Meehan were rejected, the political parties would be further restricted from advertising. I think they should be restricted with soft money. But if these advocacy groups were to take over, they would hijack your campaign; they would tell the people of your State what you were for and what you were against. 
   It is not only your adversaries who will be out there presenting a campaign against you with these enormous amounts of money, it is even your allies who are not so restricted.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Let me say to the Senator from Nevada, that is not atypical. Health care in this country has been undermined by advocacy of insurance companies whose principal interest is not the delivery of quality health care to people who are currently uninsured, but they stand behind these blind advertising campaigns where no one knows where the money comes from. 
   Just as in the campaign of my colleague from Nevada, we have polluters who are running ads on environmental protection; we have people on consumer safety who are representing groups that are damaging to individual consumers. That is because none of these groups is disclosable and none is accountable. 
   In the current system, bad as it is, while these groups can run these advertising campaigns, the political parties are also raising soft money and there is a chance to answer them. Now the political parties will no longer be able to raise these funds, but these advocacy groups will continue in an upward spiral of spending. Senator DASCHLE's point is, let's eliminate this gross fundraising and these soft money expenditures across the board within 60 days of an election by putting everybody under the FEC rules. 
   Senator MCCAIN has said, ``But that will not pass.'' It may not. But it passed in the House of Representatives, and 60 Republicans came to join with the Democratic majority in passing it. We are not 20 or 30 or 40 votes from passing it in the Senate, we are 7 or 8. I would come back here every week of every month of every year until we restored the integrity of this Government and got comprehensive campaign finance reform. 
   But the answer is not to lower our ambitions for campaign finance reform, to have a new, distorted system to make American politics fought by surrogates over the heads of candidates. The answer is to remain committed to this reform, reveal to the American people who is voting against it, who is stopping it, and let the American people decide.

   I note the problems of which I speak are not theoretical. Groups are already adjusting to the possibility that there will be a soft money ban in the political parties but no Shays-Meehan reform. They therefore are adjusting to this new reality. Let me give an example. 
   Congressman DELAY has now formed a group, Citizens For A Republican Congress. He has gone to the wealthiest donors in the Nation, promising them a safe haven for anonymous and limitless contributions to the 2000 elections. He is reportedly planning on spending $25 to $30 million in 30 competitive House races in soft money. 
   So Congressman DELAY will now, if this happens in the Democratic and Republican Parties, personally be directing a larger advertising campaign than the Democratic or Republican Parties in either House of Congress. 
   The former advisers to Congressman DELAY are also forming a Republican issues majority committee, which is planning on spending $25 million. 
   Already in a previous cycle, in the 1996 cycle, Americans for Tax Reform received $4.6 million from the Republican National Committee that they were able to spend on issue advocacy. 
   United Seniors Association spent $3 million in direct mail in seven States in the 1996 election. They are an IRS tax-exempt 501(c)(4) social welfare organization. 
   U.S. Term Limits, a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt charitable organization, spent $1.8 million in 1996; 
   Americans for Limited Terms, $1.8 million in seven States; 
   American Renewal, $400,000, a 501(c)(3). 
   These are charitable organizations. The Tax Code has these provisions for people who want to help churches, synagogues, and Americans who are hurt and damaged, and to help build communities. They are being used as a cover for political advertising and no longer simply a force on the fringes of American politics. 
   Look at the chart I have on my left: 1998 elections. Nonparty advocacy groups are two-thirds of all the issue ads in U.S. politics. The political parties, Democratic and Republican Parties, are one-third. If the sum total of the legislation offered by Mr. MCCAIN and Mr. FEINGOLD is that we will largely eliminate this third, when a Senator stands here a year from now going over this same problem, this entire pie chart will be advocacy groups, many of them tax-free organizations that are hiding who is contributing to them, who is running them, where their money is coming from, often using disguised names and running surrogate campaigns over the heads of political candidates.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I am aware of it, and if it was my design, I would have it apply to issue advocacy ads throughout the calendar so everyone is equal. To quote Senator MCCAIN, making the perfect the enemy of the good, if it is your argument that because I cannot bring all issue advocacy under FEC hard money limits, therefore we should do none, that, I think, is to surrender the point and we will not make any progress.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. My argument is, I believe, the Senator from Wisconsin and the Senator from Arizona are making a premature retreat. I concede  there may not be 60 votes in the Senate today for comprehensive campaign finance reform, but I do believe there is mounting public pressure. I believe Senators who vote against comprehensive campaign finance reform, who will vote against us on cloture on the amendment offered by Senator DASCHLE, are accountable to the people in their States. In the House of Representatives 2 years ago, the passage of comprehensive campaign finance reform was equally unlikely. Sixty Republicans crossed the aisle to vote with Democrats for real reform. 
   These numbers are untenable. You cannot explain to the American people that you allow this charade to continue of people hiding behind these groups and spending $1 million, $100,000 contributions that are not accountable. 
   I respect the Senator's work, but I believe we would do better to remain on this. I believe, in the alternative, you are going to establish a system where these groups dominate American politics as you silence the political parties.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Senator BENNETT raises a very worthwhile point. Indeed, as Senator MCCONNELL has noted in a number of cases, this is all an interesting debate. There are various sides trying to do good things, but the last word is in the Supreme Court, and, indeed, whether or not the Supreme Court will allow us to ban issue advocacy through soft money contributions to advocacy groups or even the political parties remains a question. 
   If the Senator's point is correct, we could end up in the same place with, I will concede to you, the current McCain-Feingold if the Court were to do so. Senator MCCONNELL has also pointed out it is a question of whether the Court will allow us to maintain the current limits on campaign fundraising in any case. Senators who vote on this should be aware that the Court, before we are concluded, will change probably much of what we are writing.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. We may not be on the same side of the debate for comprehensive reform, but I think our dialog can help Senators understand the world in which we are entering, because if we, indeed, reject Shays-Meehan and only go to this narrow reform, that single adjustment is going to change the American political debate as we know it. The Senator has raised some of the means by which it will change. 
   I will predict for the Senator the new environment in which we are going to live: The Democratic and Republican Parties that now receive great amounts of this soft money with a wink and a nod are simply going to direct it to favorite organizations. Instead of soft money contributions coming to the Republican National Committee, for example, people who are interested in a particular issue are going to give it to an advocacy group. You will never know who they are. The contribution will never be known, but the money will be redirected, and rather than leaders of the party deciding how to present the issue, those groups will do so. 
   Second, I predict to you the Democratic and Republican Parties will establish their own independent wings, 
   much like legally what Senator DAMATO did with the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. Down the hall, they put a new sign on the door, new incorporators, a new name, took money, and did issue advocacy. 
   As long as you do that fully at arm's length, it is fine to do. But the same soft money you think you are banning in the parties will now go to these independent groups or affiliated groups. Unless this is done comprehensively, you are only going to have money flow in through different windows. 
   What bothers me the most is that the people who are most honest about the process and most committed to stopping this abuse will suffer while those who are prepared to do the winks and nods, establishing the other organizations, working on some affiliated arm's-length basis will succeed. In any case, we are not going to stop this money; we are going to redirect it. The only way to stop it, in my judgment, is comprehensive reform.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I don't dispute that, although, indeed, if we were really doing comprehensive reform, which seems to be lost in the Senate, frankly, I would be going to that question on disclosability and tax deductibility and people remaining in tax-free status to do so. That would be comprehensive reform. But for the purpose of the argument, I will concede the point.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. That route will be blocked. Instead, the environment we create would be this. Is the Senator from Wisconsin, with his familiarity with American politics and American fundraising, generally of the belief that people who are now contributing $100,000 or $250,000 contributions, because they are advocating some perspective in American politics, when you pass this law, you are going to sit at home and say: You know, I guess I'm just not going to be heard; I'm going to remove myself from the process because that's the right thing to do? 
   I think the Senator from Wisconsin must at least be suspicious that that money, that same check, is going to work itself into Americans for Tax Justice or one of these other 70 organizations that are engaged in this political advertising. 
   It may not happen, as the Senator has appropriately written the bill, that a Member of Congress or a political party leader calls one of these contributors and says: Send your check to so-and-so. But certainly the Senator is aware it will not be very hard for political leaders to divert this money by a wink or a nod or some smile in the right direction, and we are going to end up, instead, having these surrogate organizations running these campaigns.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, I do not doubt there are some people who will not participate in doing so. But in what is a rising tide of soft money contributions in the country, they will be overwhelmed by people who will because it is not illegal. It will not be illegal. It will be fundamentally clear which of these affiliated organizations each political party supports and favors. 
   It certainly is not going to be lost upon many donors that the Democratic Party looks favorably upon the Sierra Club or NARAL. I 
   doubt that any major Republican contributor is not going to understand that Grover Norquist, Americans for Tax Justice, or term limits, or the antiabortion groups, or term limits are favored by the RNC. 
   No one is going to have to send out a letter or make a speech. Everybody is going to know where everybody stands. The same money just gets redirected, but not equally as bad as the party contributions--worse, no accountability; you will never know who they are. And the ads, I believe, become less and less responsible.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Nor, by the way, if I may continue, is this a theoretical problem. I do not cast aspersions, but entirely legally in the 1996 cycle, when the restrictions were out on the coordination of issue advertising, Senator DAMATO set up a separate division and did issue advertising. It is entirely appropriate, entirely appropriate. 
   This August, Grover Norquist had $4.5 million worth of advertising for his Americans for Tax Justice. In some of those advertisements, they used the same film footage as Republican candidates were using--on the same issues. That technically is not advisable, but it is happening. We have some responsibility here in the Senate to deal with the reality of how this process is going to evolve.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. My point to the Senator from Wisconsin is, he is not banning soft money. He is continuing the legitimization of a process where money from unknown contributors is distorting the American political process and undermining confidence. 
   I have great respect for what the Senator from Wisconsin has done, but it is a premature and unfortunate retreat. If the Senator believes we should be banning soft money, we should be banning soft money for people in the entire process, not the Democratic and Republican parties alone. 
   Could the Senator tell me, under your provisions, when Congressman DELAY simply takes his name off of this and he puts on his cousin, B.B.  DeLay, or his former chief of staff, how does your law protect his $25 million expenditures when he no longer has a name on it, but it is very clear to anyone in the country the organization that he favors?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. The Senator knows I am aware. But to go back to Senator MCCAIN's point, his argument of making the perfect the enemy of the good, no; I can't control every abuse in American politics by the Shays-Meehan bill. I can't control advertising 
   throughout the entire 2 years. I can't control advertising where someone wants to buy a soft money ad to show the virtues of his grandmother. I can't do that. That may not be important. But what we did accomplish in the original McCain-Feingold bill is, in that 60-day period when elections are most influenced, we were making sure the American people knew who was doing the advertising and where the money was coming from if they were attempting to influence their votes. That was a high standard, not an impossible standard, and a worthwhile goal. It never should have been abandoned. That is what leads us to the floor today. 
   I want to ask one final question, and then I will yield to Senator BENNETT.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I want to ask the Senator from Wisconsin one more question. A group of unaffiliated citizens decides they are going to rent a building next to DNC headquarters. In that building, they are going to call themselves Democrats for a Better America. Democrats for a Better America is going to file as a charitable organization along with the Red Cross and the Boy Scouts. No one in the current DNC leadership is going to be on their board of directors, but they are right next door. They are going to have the same seal as the DNC except they are going to take one toe off the eagle and they are going to change the color tone a little bit, but they are going to be right next door. They are going to take $200,000 contributions, million-dollar contributions. And unlike the Democratic Party, they are not going to disclose them. No one is going to know where the money is going to come from. 
   Can the Senator tell me how legally we are going to restrict American citizens from doing this constitutionally under your provision, unless we had Shays-Meehan, which applied these soft money bans to everybody's efforts?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator. It is illustrative that we can be on different sides politically in the campaign finance debate and see emerging the same future. The Senator has described the future of American politics, where large donors choose their favorite organization, or create one of their own. Rather than be part of a political campaign, they create their own issue advocacy group, fund it with their own money, and run their own advertising. You, as a candidate, will sit in the leisure of your home, sending out postcards or mail with your thousand dollars in federally restricted funds, while on your side the Chamber of Commerce, or on my side the AFL-CIO, fights a war in the airwaves over our heads. You won't control content; you won't define yourself; you won't answer to your opponents. You will be a spectator in your own campaign. 
   We may have different prescriptions for the problem--mine is Shays-Meehan--to put everybody on the same plain. You may have a different formula, but we see the same future.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I think the Senator from Kentucky makes a good point, that neither will be in a position to fund challengers. I don't know about the spending priorities of the Republican organization, but I can tell you soft money, largely raised by the DNC and the DSCC, also goes for things such as voter registration, for get-out-the-vote efforts, which are not necessarily things for which to use Federal moneys. That soft money, in our case, almost exclusively goes for those outreach programs. Indeed, our States are all different, but in my State, soft money goes almost entirely to minority communities for get-out-the-votes and registration. 
   Having said that, the Senator and I agree on his analysis. Nevertheless, where we part is I would be prepared to have the DSCC and the DNC forego all soft money and operate only on hard money. But my concern is, I don't want to do so while the National Rifle Association or the Christian Coalition or the right-to-life organizations are running soft money campaigns against our candidates or challengers.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to this legislation. It does not provide adequate relief to farmers across this country. It fails to address issues which will decide the fate of tens of thousands of family farms. It fails to give relief to an entire region with a significant farming community. The drought afflicting farmers in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions is as severe a threat to their existence as low crop prices are to others. The farmers of my state wish they had crops to receive low prices for. Yet this bill fails to remotely begin to address their concerns. The entire relief package of $8.7 billion is primarily focused on low crop prices in the South and to a much lesser degree the Midwest. Only $1.2 billion or slightly over 10% is for ``weather-related disaster relief''. 
   To put this in perspective, let me explain the extent of the drought damage. Despite recent rains, New Jersey is in the middle of its driest season in 33 years. From June to August the State received less than 2 inches of rain. Normally, we receive more than 8 inches during this period. Reservoir levels in Northern New Jersey dipped to 10% below normal--and despite the  recent ``rains'', farmers have not recovered. The impact of the drought on New Jersey agriculture is devastating. 400,000 acres on 7000 farms have sustained damage from 30%-100%. Damage estimates are $80 million, and expected to reach $100 million. 
   But let me be clear that New Jersey is not alone. Secretary Glickman estimates that the need for drought relief in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions is over $2 billion. Governors of our States estimate the damage to be closer to $2.5 billion. But even the limited amount of funds offered in the Agriculture Conference report isn't designated for drought--the entire country including losses from Hurricane Floyd will compete for this funding. 
   Mr. President, my region of the country has a long tradition of helping out other regions in need. I recall my House colleagues referring to the Great Midwest Drought of 1988. Many considered this drought the worst in the Midwest since the Great Depression. That year, we passed an emergency relief bill which provided direct disaster payments to farmers in the amount of $3.4 billion. I voted for this bill because it was the right thing to do. I realized that farmers in these states needed drought relief, and I gave my vote of support, because it was needed. 
   In 1992, Hurricane Andrew, one of the most destructive storms of this century, ripped through Florida, inflicting $30 billion in damage. I voted for the Emergency Supplemental bill which brought $9 billion to Florida, to help the citizens of that state recover from the enormous damage to infrastructure, homes, businesses, and crops. 
   1993 was another horrible year for the Midwest, this time, hit by flooding. Many call it the Great Midwest Flood of 1993. Midwestern states were horribly damaged by the breaching waters of 
   the Mississippi. I voted for this $2.5 billion supplemental for farm disaster payments. Mr. President, New Jersey was not hit with severe flooding in 1993. In fact, New Jersey only received $5.5 million in the bill. But I voted for this package nonetheless. Because farmers in the Midwest needed it, and it was right to provide them with adequate relief. 
   In January of 1994, the Northridge Earthquake rocked Southern California, causing in excess of $30 billion. I voted for H.R. 3759 which provided $4.7 billion in supplemental funding to assist Californians in their time of need. My point, Mr. President, is to illustrate that I have voted to assist the people of other regions of this country in their time of need, despite the fact that my state may not reap substantial benefit. I ask that my colleagues respect that New Jersey and other Northeast states have endured a prolonged drought that threatens our remaining agriculture. 
   Over the August recess, I visited farms and county fairs and spoke to New Jersey farmers about the effect of the drought on their livelihood. They understand weather and they accept the difficult life of a farmer but they cannot understand how Congress, which repeatedly sends billions to the South and Midwest, can ignore them in their time of need. I don't have an answer for them but I can only imagine it is because Members do not realize the extent of the agriculture community in my State and our region. 
   So I would like to educate this body to the significant agriculture community in New Jersey and the Northeast. There is a reason why they call New Jersey the Garden State. The $56 billion food and agriculture complex is New Jersey's third largest industry, behind only pharmaceutical and tourism in economic benefit. Last year, New Jersey's 9,400 farms generated over $777 million in sales. Nearly 20% of the entire state of New Jersey is productive farmland. That's one million acres of working farms in New Jersey. And in an era of increasing consolidation in the agriculture industry, virtually all of New Jersey's farms are family-owned. The average farm size in New Jersey is just over 100 acres. At $8,370 an acre, our farmland is the most valuable in the nation. 
   Farmers in the Garden State produce more than 100 different kinds of fruits and vegetables for consumption locally in New Jersey but also for export around the world. Nationally, New Jersey is one of the top ten producers of cranberries, blueberries, peaches, asparagus, bell peppers, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, sweet corn, tomatoes, snap beans, cabbage, escarole and eggplant. Mr. President, in addition to the fruit and vegetable farmers of my state, a small number of individuals from Warren, Salem, Sussex, Burlington, and Hunterdon counties are the backbone of agriculture in New Jersey. These are New Jersey's dairy farmers. The dairy industry is an important segment of our agricultural economy, supplying almost one-fifth of the fluid milk and dairy products used by over 7.5 million residents in New Jersey. The industry is comprised of 180 dairy farmers. Farmers who get up early to milk 7 days a week, 365 days a year, starting out long before dawn, before most of us are up. 
   However, this pales in comparison to what the dairy industry used to be. New Jersey has lost 42% of its dairy farms in the past decade. New Jersey dairy farmers produced 300 million pounds of fresh, locally produced milk in 1997, with a value of $41.3 million. 
   If we do not re-authorize the New England Dairy Compact and allow for New Jersey's entrance 
   the remaining 180 farmers will be gone in the next decade. New Jersey's state legislature has already approved entry into the compact. The loss of dairy farms--whether from inadequate relief from this summer's drought or from an inability to enter the Dairy Compact means more that just a loss of business in New Jersey. This is more than just a nostalgia about the decline of a time in America when agriculture was dominated by family farms, it is also about the practical reality of the loss of open space. It is about farms being sold to developers and turned into parking lots & strip malls. It is a story we know all too well in New Jersey. An average of 10,000 acres of rural/agricultural land is being developed piecemeal every year in New Jersey. In 1959, New Jersey had 1,460,000 acres of farmland; today we have but 800,000. In 1959, New Jersey had 15,800 farms. Today we have 9,400. 
   As I said earlier this horrible drought has crippled the fruit and vegetable farmers in my state. Unfortunately, it has also had a devastating impact on New Jersey's already very tenuous dairy industry. It has compounded the dire circumstances affecting dairy farmers from low prices. Erratic fluctuations in dairy prices is forcing many out of business. For example, in March dairy farmers across the country experienced a 37% drop in milk prices. When the price drops, the price family farms must pay to feed their cows, hire help, and pay utility costs stays the same. As prices decline and costs increase, farmers need a mechanism to ensure stable prices for milk or they will go out of business. 
   In addition to the erratic market, New Jersey's family farms face a threat from a pricing system introduced by the Department of Agriculture. This system, Option 1B, would almost surely be the death knell for New Jersey's dairy farmers. Option 1B, would reduce dairy farmer income in New Jersey by $9 million a year. 
   New Jersey's membership in the Compact would set a floor on dairy prices and reimburse farmers in times of financial trouble. It would provide protection in the event of another drastic price drop. Compacts would also help maintain environment efficiency and open space by preserving the more than 100,000 acres of New Jersey farmland for agricultural use and preventing development. 
   Unfortunately, the Dairy Compact and Option 1A pricing provisions are not included in this Conference Repot. This will force dairy farmers in my state out of business. Like real drought relief, the dairy provisions necessary to sustain farmers in our region are simply not present. 
   I urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report and send a message that we should implement farm policy for a nation of farmers, not to serve certain regions at the expense of others.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I first note my appreciation, and I suspect all Senators, for the manner in which Senator WARNER and Senator BIDEN have conducted a debate of profound national importance. It speaks well of the quality and tone of debate in the Senate. 
   There are always moments in our lives we suspect we will always remember, those times that punctuate our activities and our experiences. Several nights ago, on the eve of the Senate's consideration of this treaty, President Clinton, sitting in the residence, reminded some of us that the last time the Senate rejected a treaty was in 1920, the Treaty of Versailles. The Treaty called for the establishment of a League of Nations. The United States, as reflected by the Senate, was so traumatized by the First World War, so anxious for the creation of a time that it would never visit again, that it drew all the wrong lessons from the First World War. As a consequence, it defeated the Treaty. A Treaty that was, in Woodrow Wilson's words, ``the last hope of mankind.'' 
   We now find ourselves in this debate 80 years later. Yet having emerged from the cold war, the trauma and sacrifices of generations in dealing with that enormous national struggle, I fear that, once again, we are drawing all the wrong lessons. Essentially, it is the belief of many of my colleagues that the arms control regimes of the last 40 years were successful; that the bipartisan foreign policy from Eisenhower to Clinton, based on a concept of nonproliferation and arms control regimes, could provide real security for the United States; and, that seeking security in arms races and technological military dominance was illusory. 
   It is extraordinary that, during this debate, we demonstrate a lack of confidence in arms control regimes or believe the United States is better defended outside of these treaties because that is such a contradiction with national experience. 
   In the last 40 years, the United States, from Eisenhower to Nixon, Kennedy, Johnson, Carter, Bush, and Reagan have ratified START I and II, SALT I and II, the ABM Treaty, the Chemical Weapons Convention, Biological Weapons Convention, the Nonproliferation Treaty, the Limited Test Ban Treaty, the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty, Partial Test Ban Treaty, the Open Skies Agreement, the Outer Space Agreement, and signed the Missile Technology Control Regime. The nation is profoundly more secure because of each and every one of those treaties and regimes. 
   Every Senate and each President at a moment in history faced the same judgment we face today. Are we better off by allowing other nations and ourselves to develop weapons outside of these regimes or should we have confidence in our ability to verify and be more secure within their limits? 
   It appears the Senate may, for the first time in a generation 
   and for the second time in this century, believe that it is better to reject a treaty negotiated by an American President and operate outside of its regime. It is a profound decision with enormous consequences. The simple truth is, arms control regimes have enhanced the security of the United States; indeed, they have enhanced the security of all nations. 
   Since 1945, despite their development, possession, and deployment by a variety of nations, nuclear weapons have never been used in a hostile environment. It may be the first or certainly the longest period in human history that weapons were developed and not used. Indeed, nations have even gone to war with each other or been in severe conflict and not used these weapons. It is the ultimate testament that arms  control works to protect national security. 
   I would understand if the leader of the Iranian Parliament or the North Korean Supreme People's Assembly were to rise in their respective chambers and argue passionately against this treaty. They would have their reasons. The treaty will allow the United States to maintain the preeminent nuclear stockpile in the world, having the only effective means of continuing to test its weapons by simulation, while the treaty would make it difficult for those nations to continue to develop and modernize their nuclear arsenal. Their opposition would be rational. Our opposition is irrational. 
   It would be understandable if members of the National People's Congress in Beijing would rise in indignation against China becoming a signatory to the treaty. The thought that China, a great power, possessing 18 missiles capable of delivering a weapon, now on the verge of developing important new and dangerous technology both to deliver these weapons and to miniaturize them to threaten a potential adversary in the United States or Russia or Europe, would join this treaty would be troubling to them. 
   The Chinese, by entering into this treaty, would be unable to test those weapons, making it difficult to know their effectiveness or their reliability. Their opposition would be understandable; it would be rational. Ours is not. 
   This treaty is an endorsement of the international military status quo, and at this snapshot in time in the life of this planet, the military status quo is that the United States is the preeminent military power with an abundance of weapons, sophistication of weapons, delivery of weapons. If this current arrangement and distribution of power is to be preserved for a generation, it means that every nation is accepting American preeminence. By their endorsement of this treaty and their signature of this treaty, extraordinarily, every other nation seems to be willing to accept that preeminence, ironically except us. We would reject the treaty and allow other nations at a relative disadvantage to test, develop, or deploy effective weapons. 
   There are several important consequences in the defeat of this treaty the Senate needs to consider: first, the damage, not necessarily militarily, but diplomatically to the leadership of the United States. This country has recognized for more than 50 years the only real security of this country is an alliance based principally on the foundation of NATO rested on the credibility of American political leadership. 
   The defeat of this treaty will put us at variance with the leaders of Germany, France, and Britain, who even on this day have appealed to the Senate to endorse this treaty. France and Britain have communicated their strong desire. They have reminded us that they have made changes in their own doctrine, and their own weapons choices, based on this treaty. They have also reminded us that if we defeat this treaty, we are in some measure separating not simply our judgments but our future planning and security from our traditional allies--the foundation of our international alliance system of our security. It will cause damage to our credibility and our leadership that will not be easily repaired. 
   Second, defeat of this treaty, for all practical purposes, is an end to our efforts, undertaken on a bipartisan basis for a generation, on nonproliferation. It is a practical end to our nonproliferation efforts because it sends a message to each rogue regime, every nation that possesses the capability to develop nuclear weapons, that there is this new sense of legitimacy in them doing so, because the United States has rejected a treaty that would have contained this threat. The United States will lose credibility with nations, like India and Pakistan, when we argue that they should not test again or deploy weapons. 
   Third--perhaps most profoundly and immediately--it will lead to the possibility of the testing and the development of the technologies that China has obtained from the United States, through espionage or other means, and allow them to develop a full capability. 
   There is a final factor. The Senate has convened to debate the question of a treaty on a comprehensive test ban. But it is not the only treaty that is at issue. The defeat of this Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty will certainly mean that the START agreement pending before the Russian Duma will never be adopted. 
   Our chance, with a stroke of a pen, to destroy thousands of Russian nuclear warheads, potentially aimed at the United States--the greatest single threat to the security of this Nation under changed political circumstances--will never be destroyed. We debate one treaty, but we are deciding the future of two. 
   Earlier in this day debates centered on procedures and hearings, whether or not the treaty was fully considered. I serve as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. I, too, must express my profound disappointment, as a representative of the State of New Jersey, and as a member of that committee, of not being given the opportunity to fully debate, to consider, to hear witnesses on what potentially could be the most important vote I will ever cast as a Senator. 
   People of good judgment might be able to differ on the merits of this treaty, but no one can defend that an issue of this profound importance to the life of this country did not receive the consideration it deserved or Senators within the comity of this institution were not given the due consideration to learn, debate, and be heard. 
   Because I believe, however, this issue is so important--while I am convinced of its merits and the need for immediate ratification--I end much as I began with that memory of 1920. 
   Most of us are probably convinced the Senate made the wrong judgment on the League of Nations, setting the world on a dangerous downward spiral of confrontation, having come to the false conclusion that America would be secure alone behind her oceans, that in isolation somehow we would find peace. It was wrong. 
   But in truth, if the moment could be revisited, President Wilson, while right on the issue, should have been less proud, more willing to meet his adversaries, and given them extra consideration on the treaty. While I profoundly believe President Clinton was right to endorse this treaty and to urge its adoption, I urge him to do the same today. 
   Let us make it unequivocally clear that the President of the United States, upon being told by the Director of the CIA that he 
   cannot provide complete assurances that any unexplainable explosions of any source within Russia or China--by our national technical means--that it cannot be identified, it will cause the United States, unless explanations and inspections are made immediately available, to abrogate the treaty. 
   Second, the President make abundantly clear that any refusal to allow inspections, even if not absolutely required by the treaty, because it is in the national interest, would cause us to abrogate the treaty. 
   Third, the President commit the United States immediately to develop a national technical means to distinguish between different forms of explosions and small-level nuclear testing, and a program begin immediately. 
   And fourth, that if, indeed, as I believe is provided in the treaty, this President is informed by lab Directors that they can no longer assure the safety or the operational capability of our weapons, we will abrogate the treaty. 
   Let that be clear to the Senate and to the American people, let there be no question. And if there is no question on those issues, then there is no argument against this treaty. 
   I can remember as a boy asking a history teacher why it was, if history occurred as a continuum, from generation to generation through the centuries, history was written in chapters and in volumes, which both began and ended? And I remember she told me: Because that is how it occurs. 
   We are between the volumes of history. If this Senate is to decide that the bipartisan commitment to arms control as an element of national security for the last 40 years has been an error, we are ending not only a chapter but a volume of the military and diplomatic history of this country, we are entering into a very uncertain future, for our security is dictated only by what weapons are designed, deployed, and used--a lawless time that is not safer than the 20th century, but where the 21st century will be profoundly less safe.  
   It will be a time in which, I believe, Members of this Senate will have difficulty looking in the eyes of their children and their children's children explaining how there was a brief moment when we could commit all the nations of the world not to test these nuclear weapons and therefore as a practical matter to be unable, by many nations, to deploy them or ever to use them--and we lost the moment. 
   You may feel confident in your vote today; it may make political sense. You may be convinced of your own rhetoric, but you will never ever--if one of these weapons is ever used in a hostile environment; if one of these rogue regimes, from North Korea to Iran, ever tests one of these weapons--you will never look your own children in the eye with confidence in your judgment or feeling that you served them or your country. 
   I have not been in this institution long, but long enough to know this treaty does not have enough votes to be ratified. 
   The President of the United States, recognizing the enormous potential diplomatic damage of its defeat and the consequences militarily of sending a message to other nations that there will be no further proliferation efforts or control on testing, has asked, as the Commander in Chief, the elected representative of the American people, that this vote not occur. What have we come to as a Senate, if the President of the United States makes such a request in the interest of our national security and our diplomatic position in the world and we turn a deaf ear? If you cannot do good by voting for this treaty, do not do harm by defeating it. Allow the moment to pass. At least allow the world to live with an ambiguous result rather than a definitive conclusion to our national commitment to arms control. 
   We vote on this treaty, but, indeed, we vote on whether to ratify or reject a national strategy of a generation and whether arms control will continue to be part of the security of the United States and our strategy of dealing with potentially hostile nations. It is not a judgment I would have had to mark the beginning of the 21st century. It shows a profound failure to learn the lessons of the 20th century, but it is what it is. At least we should be able to lose this moment and go on to debate and make judgments another day. I beseech of other Members of the Senate, do not hold this vote.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise to ask the distinguished managers of the bill if they would consider a request I have concerning the conference. Knowing the great difficulty they faced in reporting a bill that would not exceed this year's stringent budget restrictions, I understand why they were not able to provide funding for the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey's (UMDNJ) Child Health Institute. However, I hope that funding for the Children's Health Institute can be found in conference. 
   The increased attention to childhood disease clusters in various communities throughout New Jersey and other states require molecular studies for an explanation and solution. In that regard, UMDNJ of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School developed the Child Health Institute of New Jersey as a comprehensive biomedical research center focused on the development, growth and maturation of children. 
   The mission of the Institute is to improve child health and quality of life by fostering scientific research that will produce new discoveries about the causes of many childhood diseases and new treatments for these diseases. Researchers will direct their efforts toward the prevention and cure of environmental, genetic and cellular diseases of infants and children. The Institute will work closely with both the Cancer Institute of New Jersey and the Environmental and Occupational Health Science Institute--two NIH-designated centers of excellence. Organizations which also played a part in developing the Child Health Institute. 
   The Institute is seeking funds to develop three components: a program in Molecular Genetics and Development; (2) a program in Development and Behavior; and (3) a program in Environment and Development. These programs will study human development and its disorders, noting the changing environmental conditions which alter gene function during development, maturation and aging. Institute scientists will also study human growth and development and the emergence of cognition, motion, consciousness and individuality. 
   The hospitals in central New Jersey birth nearly 20,000 babies each year. The founding of the Child Health Institute has created an extraordinary  health care resource for those hospitals and the patients they serve. The new Children's Hospital at Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital is scheduled to open in 2000 and the Child Health Institute in 2001. Together these institutions will provide state of the art clinical and scientific research and treatment complex to serve children and their families, not only in New Jersey, but throughout the nation with cutting edge care and the latest scientific developments.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for his efforts on this project. I believe that the work of the Institute is an appropriate focus for the committee because the research focus will be of enormous value for the nation as a whole. Indeed, the Child Health Institute will be one of the world's only research centers to examine not only the biological and chemical effects on childhood, but also the effects of behavioral and societal influences as well. 
   The Child Health Institute's request is for $10 million in one time funding from the federal government for the construction of the Institute building. Total building costs are estimated at $27 million. The Institute has already raised more than $13 million from private sources including $5.5 million from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and $5.5 million from Johnson and Johnson. Also, the Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital has made a $2 million in-kind contribution of the land on which the Institute will be built. At maturity, the Child Health is expected to attract $7 to $9 million in new research funding annually, as well as provide $52 million in revenue for the local economy. 
   Mr. President, funding for the Child Health Institute in this bill would be entirely appropriate under Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) account. Indeed, it would be money well spent. 
   Senator LAUTENBERG and I simply ask that when the bill goes to conference the managers remember this request for funding the UMDNJ Child Health Institute.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding. I thank him in behalf of the dairy farmers in New Jersey and agricultural interests in our State and region for his extraordinary leadership in what is a defining moment for those of us in the Senate as to whether or not we will stand with agriculture in the Northeast or the dairy farmers and the farmers who remain in our region of the country are simply to dwindle and die as did so many who came before them. 
   I could not feel more strongly about this issue at this moment in the Senate. As the Senator from Vermont, year after year I have come to this well--or in my service in the House of Representatives--as an American feeling the need and the pain of others who suffered from hurricanes in Florida, earthquakes in California, tornadoes in the Midwest, floods in the upper Northwest to get assistance to people in need. 
   Through the years, I voted for agricultural appropriation after agricultural appropriation because I understood the hard work of American farmers in our heartland and the difficulties they face in flood or in diseases to crops, whatever the problem might be. 
   You can imagine my surprise to find, when the State of New Jersey, New England, and the Mideastern States have suffered the worst drought in generations, that our farmers are not receiving the same consideration. 
   From June through August, in a normal year, the State of New Jersey would receive 8 inches of rain. This year, New Jersey received 2 inches of rain. Our reservoirs were severely drained. The crops of many fruit and vegetable growers were devastated with losses of 30 to 100 percent. 
   Yesterday, Senator SANTORUM noted that this legislation deals with the falling prices of crops in the Midwest and offers relief. He appropriately said: We wish we had falling prices at which to sell our crops. 
   The crops of New Jersey farmers are destroyed. Yet this legislation, which offers $8.7 billion in relief, goes largely for low crop prices in the South and to a lesser degree in the Midwest. Only 10 percent is for natural disaster assistance for the entire Nation. 
   Not only is it not adequate, it is an insult to the hard-working farmers in New Jersey and New England who have been devastated by the drought. In my State, 400,000 acres of farmland, on 7,000 farms, have sustained what is estimated to be up to $100 million worth of damage. 
   Secretary Glickman has estimated there could be $2 billion worth of damage in the entire Northeast. The Governors of our States, including Governor Whitman in my own State, have estimated it could be $2.5 billion. That was before Hurricane Floyd brought its own damage to North Carolina and New Jersey and other agricultural interests. This legislation offers but 10 percent--less than half, probably less than a third--of what the need really is at the moment. 
   It will surprise some around our country to understand why a Senator from New Jersey would take this stand attempting to block the entire agricultural appropriations for the whole Nation because of farmers in New Jersey. 
   New Jersey has not been identified as the Garden State by chance. Agriculture in New Jersey is a $56 billion industry. It is the third largest industry in the entire State. It matters. The nursery industry alone is a $250 million annual business. The sale of vegetables, such as tomatoes, peppers, and cucumbers, is a $166 million industry. And the sale of fruits, such as cranberries, peaches, and blueberries, is a $110 million business. Our field crops, such as corn, winter wheat, and soybeans, generate $66 million in sales while our dairy industry is a $41 million business. 
   This is not some ancillary problem in the State of New Jersey. It is the economic life of whole counties, entire communities, and thousands of people. At $8,300 for an average acre of land in New Jersey, our farmland is the most valuable in the Nation, growing 100 different kinds of fruits and vegetables for local and national consumption. 
   I take a stand against this legislation because I have no choice. I join with the Senator from Vermont because of the devastation of our agriculture industry but also because I share the Senator's deep concern for the future of dairy. The dairy industry was once one of the largest and most important in the State of New Jersey. There are now no more than 180 dairy farms left, with hard-working people in Salem, Warren, Sussex, and Hunterdon Counties. 
   I know if the Senator from Vermont does not get consideration for his dairy farmers, his dairy industry will become tomorrow what the dairy industry has come to be today--prices that do not sustain a quality of life and do not allow people to keep the land. Those dairy farms will be destroyed. 
   In the last decade alone, 42 percent of the dairy farms in New Jersey have been destroyed--beautiful lands that sustained families and communities and are now parking lots and shopping centers or simply vacant, idle land. The fact is, a dairy farmer today in New Jersey cannot get a price to sustain the costs of his business. Without  the compact that the Senator from Vermont is advocating, they never will. New Jersey dairy farms have experienced a 37-percent drop in the price of their product. It is not sustainable. 
   So I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding the time. I pledge to return to this floor with him to fight for disaster assistance for New Jersey farmers who have lost their crops and need help--not a loan, because they cannot sustain a loan; they cannot pay interest on a loan. These are small family farms that simply need a Federal grant, a fraction of the kind of expenditures that will go to the South and the Midwest--a fraction--so they can plant their crops again in the spring and have a new crop next year to feed their families and feed our communities. For this dairy compact, we need to make sure these few remaining dairy farmers are not lost and the 20 percent of the fresh milk that goes to New Jersey families can continue to come from our own farms. 
   For those people who live in the urban areas of New Jersey and in suburban communities, who think they are far away from these dairy and agricultural needs, this remaining agricultural land in New Jersey must not be destroyed, because with every dairy farmer who goes out of business, every family farmer who has to sell their land, that open space is lost to suburban sprawl, and it affects the quality of life of every family in our State. 
   So I thank the Senator from Vermont for yielding the time. I pledge to return again and again with him to try to fight this legislation and, if by chance we should fail, to urge the President to veto it. I thank the Senator for yielding the time. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. JEFFORDS addressed the Chair.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the Reverend Gregory J. Jackson as he celebrates his 15th year as pastor of the Mount Olive Baptist Church in Hackensack, New Jersey. Reverend Jackson has been an ordained minister for over twenty-three years and has ministered to the Hackensack community since 1984. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments. 
   Since his ordination on May 16, 1976, Reverend Jackson has worked to help those less fortunate throughout New York and New Jersey. During his career, Reverend Jackson has shown commitment to public service as well as dedication to the disabled. These life experiences have proved invaluable in his ministry. His activism is widely known and admired throughout the State of New Jersey. 
   In addition to his ministry in Hackensack, Reverend Jackson has played a very active role in strengthening the political and economic life of New Jersey. He has served on a number of civic organizations including the NAACP of Bergen County, Fair Housing Board of Bergen County, and the Advisory Board of the Office on Aging. He has also served as the President of the Hackensack Board of Education, Treasurer of the North Jersey Baptist Association, Vice-President of the Fellowship of Black Churches and as Vice-President of the Bergen County Council of Churches. Reverend Jackson recently been named as Director of Promotions of the Lott Carey Baptist Foreign Mission Convention. 
   Although Reverend Jackson has dedicated so much time to civic organizations, he has never lost sight of the need to serve his community. During his fifteen year tenure as the pastor of Mount Olive Baptist Church, the parish has grown by more than 1,000 new members. In addition, Reverend Jackson has implemented ministry programs to improve the Hackensack community both spiritually and educationally. 
   I am pleased to recognize a leader of great stature in New Jersey, and a close friend. Through all of the years  we have spent, working to strengthen New Jersey's communities, I have always known Reverend Jackson to stand on principle, loyalty, and commitment. I look forward to continuing to work with Reverend Jackson, and I wish him the best as he celebrates this momentous occasion.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision in S. 82, the FAA Reauthorization Bill, that will provide an additional $36 million over three years to the National Airspace Re-Design project, and to thank Chairman MCCAIN and Senators HOLLINGS, and ROCKEFELLER for their critical role in securing this funding. 
   Many of my colleagues may not realize this, but the air routes over the U.S. have never been designed in a comprehensive way, they have always been dealt with regionally and incrementally. In order to enhance efficiency and safety, as well as reduce noise over many metropolitan areas, the FAA is undertaking a re-design of our national airspace. 
   In an effort to deal with the most challenging part of this re-design from the outset, the FAA has decided to begin the project in the ``Eastern Triangle'' ranging from Boston through New York/Newark down to Miami. This airspace constitutes some of the busiest in the world, with the New York metropolitan area alone servicing over 300,000 passengers and 10,000 tons of cargo a day. The delays resulting from this level of activity being handled by the current route structure amount to over $1.1 billion per year. 
   While many of my constituents, and I am sure many of Senators HOLLINGS' and ROCKEFELLER's as well, are pleased by the FAA's decision to undertake this difficult task, they are concerned by the timetable associated with the re-design. The FAA currently estimates that it could take as long as five years to complete the project. However, my colleagues and I have been working with the FAA to expedite this process, and this additional funding will go a long way toward helping us achieve this goal. 
   In fact, I had originally offered an amendment to this legislation that would have required the FAA to complete the re-design process in two years, but have withdrawn it because it is my understanding that the Rockefeller provision will allow the agency to expedite this project. 
   I want to recognize Senator ROCKEFELLER again for including this funding in the bill, and ask Chairman MCCAIN and Senator ROCKEFELLER if it is the Committee's hope that this additional funding will be used to expedite the National Re-Design project, including the portion dealing with the ``Eastern Triangle's'' airspace.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize an outstanding woman in the State of New Jersey. Joan Flatley is being honored with the prestigious Spirit of Asbury Award for her activism and commitment to the Asbury Park community. Joan is recently retired as the Executive Director of the Asbury Park Chamber of Commerce, and her legacy in the community will be felt for years to come. 
   For over twelve years, John used her depth of knowledge and breadth of experience to contribute to the successful functioning of the Chamber. It is through her effort that the Chamber became a dynamic force in the Asbury Park business community, and the State of New Jersey as a whole. Joan has been the main force behind the Chamber's development and growth. She has consistently been receptive to the community's need, and has responded to them under the auspices of the Chamber. The Chamber is now a respected source of information, both in Asbury Park and across the country, for business and community events. Without Joan's unyielding commitment, the Chamber's development would not have been as pronounced. 
   Joan's continued and unwavering service to the people of Asbury Park is indicative of her love of the community in which she lives. Whether she was giving out travel information, sending out newsletters or organizing a business meeting, Joan met every task with an unbridled enthusiasm and pleasantness that made the community around her a better place to live. Indeed it is a testament to her service that New Jerseyans from every walk of life from across the state have come to celebrate the end of her distinguished career. 
   Joan's dedication to community service has always been clear, and the people of Asbury Park have benefitted from her involvement. I can think of few individuals more worthy of this distinguished award than Joan Flatley, and I am pleased to extend my congratulations to her.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   On the question of education in America, there are both those exhilarated by our progress and those who are frustrated by our failures. It really is a tale of two cities: America has the finest universities in the world, the best colleges, proof that we know how to educate and build institutions. However, we have secondary and grade schools which simply, by any accounting, are not making the grade. 
   Forty percent of our fourth graders failed to attain basic levels of reading; 40 percent of eighth graders could not attain basic levels of math; and 76 percent do not even reach proficiency levels. 
   The fact is, we are not meeting an international standard. We are debating the fact that there is an educational crisis, but, if unaddressed, it will in our own generation become an economic crisis. 
   The Senator from Connecticut is correct: There are schools in my State of New Jersey for which I have enormous pride. Many are succeeding. But in the world in which we live today and our economy, if schools are failing in Alabama or California or New York or some distant community in New Jersey, it is as much your problem as it is mine. It is an economic difficulty, a social difficulty, at some point in our country's history, even a political difficulty if unaddressed. 
   The truth of the matter is, our country suffers some from a false sense of complacency. Parents come to me and say: Senator, I don't understand your concern. The schools are as good as I remember them 40 years ago. Or, I think the schools in my community are as good as the schools in the community that is next to us. 
   That, I say to my friends, is not the point. The point is whether our schools are as good as countries halfway around the world. 
   A national education testing service recently concluded that in math and science our students were 19 out of 21. We do not need to compare our schools with ones we remember as children. We need to compare them with schools in Germany and Japan, and we are not meeting that standard. 
   I know every Senator has a different idea about what we should do about American education, and the truth is, they are all right. There is no one answer. Senator COVERDELL and I had an innovative program to bring private money to help private and public schools. There are others who have a variety of different answers. They are all part of the solution. But no one can construct a solution that does not involve the hiring of teachers. Your ideas may be right, but this idea is central. 
   The Department of Education estimates we will need 2 million new teachers.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. The Department of Education estimates we will need 2 million new teachers in the next decade. In my State of New Jersey, that is 109,000 teachers currently in shortage. When schools started this year in the city of Newark, there were 200 classrooms without teachers available. You can have your idea about American education, but the debate starts here. Empty classrooms, overcrowded classrooms, retiring 
   teachers are not part of the formula for American educational or economic success. 
   The fact is, if we did not have massive retirements, if there were not already shortages, we would still need Senator MURRAY's amendment. 
   The Department of Education in May 1998 also concluded that the one principal variable that we know in improving education in America is class size. Educational Testing Services found that smaller class sizes raised achievement from fourth to eighth grade students, it reduced drop-out rates, and increased performance. It is the one variable we know that works. 
   The strange thing about this debate, as the Senator from Connecticut has pointed out, is that a year ago, as Democrats and Republicans on this Senate floor, we accepted these arguments and we endorsed this program. For the last year, Democrats and Republicans, with pride, have noted that we spent $1.2 billion hiring 29,000 teachers to begin dealing with this educational crisis. You were proud of it, and we were proud of it. 
   I have not heard a single Senator come to this floor and say: You know those 29,000 teachers, they failed. They did not show up to work, they were not trained, the teachers did not perform, the students did not perform. No evidence, no argument, not even a contention, because it was not a failure. It worked. 
   But is this the extent of our national commitment? We deal with an educational crisis, and every Member of the Senate knows the greatest variable in America's economic future is the quality of education, and the sum total of our commitment as a Senate is 1 year for 29,000 teachers in a nation of a quarter of a billion people. That is quite a commitment, and now we are going to abandon the effort. 
   The strange thing about this is, this is not the first time the United States has had an educational crisis. One of the proudest things I know in the 20th century history of this country is that between 1890 and 1920, the United States of America opened a new high school every single day. That is a commitment. We did it through war, depression, recession, and stagnant economic growth. 
   Now the United States is experiencing the greatest economic growth in our Nation's history, nearly full employment and a budget surplus, and the response of this Congress is a 1-year  program of $1.2 billion to hire 29,000 teachers, and a year later we are going to fire them. Quite a commitment; quite a source of pride. 
   I know the alternative program is to return, instead, to block grants. Never in my experience has so much authority been given to people. I came to the Senate to deal with issues and national problems, not to give that authority to somebody else. 
   There is a national educational crisis. It requires the hiring of teachers on a national scale, and that is our responsibility. If the judgment of this Senate is simply to send money to the States and let them decide whether they want new football teams, more buses, athletic fields, or science teachers, hire an accounting firm and get rid of the Congress, not the teachers. That is not why I came to the Senate. 
   Senator MURRAY's amendment is not the end of the debate on education quality in America. It is not the completion of a national program, 
   it is the defense of a national program that started last year. It should be continued. And for her leadership on this issue, the Senator from Washington has both my respect and admiration. I urge the Members of the Senate to follow her lead. 
   Education should not be a partisan issue in the United States. Every schoolchild in America would benefit in a competition between Democrats and Republicans for educational leadership. I do not want to see that ceded to my party. Indeed, I hope we can all join in it. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of the Millville Girls All-Star Softball Team, who recently captured the first-ever Babe Ruth Softball World Series. This past year has seen tremendous accomplishments by American female athletes, including the 1999 Women's World Cup Soccer Champions. I am pleased that the state of New Jersey can now boast its own champion's in women's athletics through the Millville team. 
   The Millville team, comprised of girls 16 years old and younger, defeated several worthy opponents at the Softball World Series. The event, which took place in Kill Devil Hills, North Carolina, was the first Championship of its kind. All of the games were close, particularly the championship game. Millville won this in spectacular fashion, 1-0, on a two-out, ninth-inning-single which scored the winning run. The girls demonstrated outstanding skills and sportsmanship throughout the tournament. From pitching a no-hitter, to numerous diving catches, to clutch hitting; the Millville team proved themselves to be superb players, and model young athletes. 
   The character and manners displayed by the thirteen girls on the Millville team throughout the Softball World Series should be a source of pride for the Millville community, the Southern New Jersey region, and the State as a whole. The values of the parents, teachers, officials, and volunteers of Millville are clearly reflected in the play and conduct of the World Champions. 
   I am proud to recognize the accomplishments and contributions of Rachel Barber, Amy Holliday, Jil Conner, Constance DeSalvo, Tara Haines, Colleen Scholl, Rachel Mudry, Danielle Weber, Megan Lore, Adina De Hainaut, Jodi Dick, Christin Carpini, and Debra Vento. I know they will continue to make New Jersey proud for years to come, and I look forward to watching them defend their title next year.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to say, before Senator BYRD leaves the floor, however, how much I identify with his remarks. Like the Senator from West Virginia, year after year, with natural disasters around this country, in the House of Representatives and now in the Senate, I have come to the floor as an American, as part of a national union to respond to their emergencies. 
   Like the Senator from West Virginia in advocacy of his small farmers, I will not allow, as long as I serve in the Senate, the State of New Jersey to be a caboose on the train of the national union. We have a farming crisis. The Appropriations Committee not only reducing but eliminating any assistance for farmers who are being bankrupt and forced from the land is inexcusable. Like the Senator from West Virginia, at the appropriate time, I will come to the floor and if it requires standing here day after day, night after night, I will not see them abandoned. 
   I apologize for taking the time. I wanted to comment on the Senator's comments.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with some considerable regret to discuss the bankruptcy reform bill that was pulled from the floor of the Senate last week. Senator GRASSLEY and I have worked for over 8 months to craft what I believe is a broadly bipartisan bankruptcy bill. Indeed, Senator GRASSLEY has worked tirelessly for years to craft this legislation. He deserves the considerable gratitude of every Member of this institution. 
   I regret that after all these months of work, last week we were forced to vote on a cloture motion. I do not believe that the cloture vote was in any way indicative of support for the bill. It is important that that be understood. 
   Bipartisan support for this bankruptcy legislation is broad and it is deep. The legislation has seven cosponsors; five of them are Democrats. The legislation was voted successfully out of the Judiciary Committee with support from both parties. The inability to move forward on a bankruptcy reform bill is entirely due to unrelated events. The legislation on its merits still stands. 
   I believe it is important that Senator GRASSLEY and I make clear to people, both within the institution and outside the institution, that we are absolutely committed in this Congress, in this year, to continuing to have bankruptcy legislation considered and passed. Indeed, I believe if the majority leader brings bankruptcy reform to the floor of the Senate, in a matter of only a few days we can resolve the outstanding issues. 
   I also think it is important that our colleagues understand why we are so motivated to have this bankruptcy reform legislation passed. There are considerable reasons. 
   We are, to be sure, living in the most prosperous economic period in our Nation's history. The facts are renowned: Unemployment is low, inflation is low, the Nation has created 18 million new jobs, and now the Federal Government is having a burgeoning budget surplus. 
   But amidst all this prosperity, there are some troubling signs, things that deserve our attention. One is a rapidly declining personal savings rate. Indeed, that is what motivated me to vote for tax cut legislation: To stimulate private savings in America so Americans will prepare for their own futures. 
   But second is an issue that relates to this legislation: A rapid, inexplicable rise in consumer bankruptcies. In 1998 alone, 1.4 million Americans sought bankruptcy protection--this is a 20-percent increase since 1996 and a staggering 350-percent increase in bankruptcy filings since 1980. 
   It is estimated that 70 percent of the petitions filed were in chapter 7, which provides relief from most unsecured debt. Only 30 percent of the petitions were filed under chapter 13, which requires a repayment plan. 
   No matter what the cause of so many bankruptcies, what every American needs to understand is that somebody is paying the price. If people are availing themselves of chapter 7, rather than chapter 13, which ultimately requires the repayment of many of these debts, the balance is going to be paid by somebody, and that somebody is the American consumer. 
   Indeed, I believe this is the equivalent of an invisible tax on the American family, estimated to cost each and every American family $400 a year, as retailers and financial institutions adjust the prices of their products and their costs to reflect this growing tide of bankruptcy. 
   The reality is that the majority of people who file for bankruptcy--low- to middle-income, hard-working people--do so to manage overwhelming financial problems. That is as it should be. That is why the United States has always had a bankruptcy code--to protect people and allow them to reorganize their lives, to give people a second chance in American society. 
   But just the same, with these staggering numbers of increase--20 
   percent in only 3 years--there must be something else going on in our society. That something is revealed in a recent study by the Department of Justice indicating that as many as 13 percent of debtors filing under chapter 7--182,000 people each year--can, indeed, afford to repay a significant amount of their outstanding debt. That amounts to $4 billion that would have been paid to creditors but is being avoided, inappropriately, by what amounts, in my judgment, to a misuse of the bankruptcy code. 
   I believe the Congress must act. This invisible tax impacts the health of our financial institutions, forces small business people to absorb these costs, forces some family businesses out of business, and it is a cost we can avoid. 
   The bankruptcy legislation that Senator GRASSLEY and I have crafted strikes an important balance, making it more difficult for the unscrupulous to abuse the system but ensuring that families who really need bankruptcy protection to reorganize their lives still have access to it. 
   At its core, the Grassley-Torricelli bill is designed to assure that those with the ability to repay a portion of their debts will be required to do so but that judicial discretion will ensure that no one who is genuinely in need of debt cancellation is prevented from having a fresh start in American life. 
   When this legislation passed the Judiciary Committee, there were those who had legitimate concerns about some of its other provisions. I was among them and stated so at the time. These ranged from the liability of a debtor's lawyer to ensuring that low-income debtors with no hope of repaying their debts were not swept into the means test. 
   Colleagues should understand that Senator GRASSLEY and I are prepared, with a managers' amendment, both to ensure that the debtor's lawyers are protected from liability and that low-income people are not inappropriately subjected to this means test. That managers' amendment, I believe, will pass and will make this far better legislation than the Senate considered previously or the legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee. 
   I am very pleased that we have come so far with this bill. It is critical for our financial institutions and, indeed, it is critical for American families. 
   There remains one other central issue, however, that must be in this legislation, and that is dealing with the other half of this balance. It is the question of the abuse, I believe, of credit in the Nation itself. 
   The credit card industry last year sent out 3.5 billion solicitations--41 mailings for every American household; 14 for every man, woman, and child. No one wants to interfere with poor or working people getting access to credit. They should have the availability to do so, but there is something wrong when 14 solicitations per person are being received; when college students, juveniles, poor people are solicited again and again and again, often for high-interest credit. Indeed, these solicitations for high school and college students are at record levels. 
   The result of this solicitation is not surprising: Americans with incomes below the poverty line have doubled their credit usage; 27 percent of families earning less than $10,000 have consumer debt that is more than 40 percent of their income. Indeed, it is not our intention to restrict access to credit for low-income people or even young people. Senator GRASSLEY and I have crafted legislation that will at least ensure that consumers are protected by giving them knowledge, by having full disclosure so people can make informed judgments, when receiving these solicitations, about how much debt they want and what it will take to repay it and on what kind of a schedule. 
   Taken as a whole--all of the provisions in the managers' amendment, the legislation from the Judiciary Committee--Senator GRASSLEY's work in consumer protection is a well-crafted and a very balanced bill. 
   My hope is it can receive early consideration but that, under any circumstances, this Senate does not adjourn for the year without providing  for American families this credit protection by full disclosure, by providing for American business protection against bankruptcy abuse, and by redesigning this code so that it is fair to our businesses and our consumers alike. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Mr. GRASSLEY addressed the Chair.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I want to pay my compliments to Senators BOND and MIKULSKI. They have each made the best of a very difficult situation. I compliment them on their leadership. I particularly thank Senator MIKULSKI, who continues to be of service to people of my State and whose own priorities are written throughout this bill, which for all of us in our region of the country is particularly important. It is in furtherance of their priorities, not in contradiction, that I rise in support of Senator KERRY's amendment. 
   This legislation does not contain any funding for new section 8 housing vouchers. This amendment will provide $288 million for 50,000 of those new vouchers. It is a modest but necessary addition. It does not increase authority or outlays. There are offsets for each and every one of those dollars. It is simply a reordering of priorities to recognize the state of housing in America. 
   Rising economic prosperity in America erodes the foundation of many of our most endemic social problems. Housing is a single exception. Prosperity is not solving the housing crisis in America; it is exacerbating the housing problem in America. Indeed, what was a housing problem in the last decade is a housing crisis in this decade. Rents are rising, costs are increasing, there is homelessness, and homelessness increases as the demand on people's income to accommodate housing also rises. 
   The single weapon the Federal Government has available to deal with the housing crisis in America is section 8 vouchers. This is not a giveaway; this is no free ride for the citizens of America. Between 30 and 40 percent of people's income must be dedicated to paying rent from their own resources as part of this program. In many of our urban areas, it is the single tool available to prevent children and families from going to the streets. 
   In Newark, NJ, over 172,000 families are paying more than 50 percent of their income in rent or living in substandard conditions. More than 1 million people are languishing on waiting lists for section 8 vouchers or affordable housing. And they are not waiting a few days or weeks or even a few months; the average is 28 months. You realize you are in trouble, you cannot provide affordable, decent housing for your children, and then you wait in substandard conditions, paying rent where you also cannot afford health care or food for your children. You wait 28 months--unless you live in Philadelphia, where you wait 11 years. In New Jersey, the average in our cities is 3 years. We have 15,000 people waiting for vouchers in Jersey City and 10,000 are waiting in Newark. 
   Every year, year in and year out, the numbers in America grow by 100,000. The simple reality is that this year, unless Senator KERRY's amendment is adopted, the number of section 8 vouchers will not increase--not by 100,000 to meet growing demand, not by 50,000 to meet half of the demand, but by none, not a single new family. The problem becomes a crisis, and the crisis deepens. 
   I strongly urge my colleagues to follow Senator KERRY's leadership to improve upon the work, the already considerable work, Senators MIKULSKI and BOND have done. 
   Also, as did the Senator from Rhode Island, I add my voice in defense of the Community Builders Program. This is America at its best, where young people, for modest remuneration, give their time and their talents to reach out to fellow citizens, to help them avail themselves of Government or private programs, to improve their own lives. In some cities of my State, virtually the only contact some desperate people in need of assistance for housing, drug abuse, educational services have is with these people. Their only contact with the Federal Government may be one of these young people giving a stage of their lives to go into a community and reach out. That program is not going to be reduced on the legislation. It could be eliminated. 
   This Senate voted to allow Andrew Cuomo to become a member of this Cabinet to provide leadership for HUD. This is one of his signature programs. His talents and his time have brought him to believe this is one thing we can  do for a modest cost that would make a difference. He deserves that support. This modest vote will allow him to continue with a program that he believes and I believe is critical. 
   I urge adoption of Senator KERRY's amendment. I express my thanks, again, to Senator BOND, and particularly Senator MIKULSKI, for improving this legislation and bringing us to this point. We are all very grateful. 
   I yield the floor. 
   Ms. MIKULSKI addressed the Chair.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National Hispanic Heritage Month. In my own state of New Jersey, we celebrate and recognize the proud history of a people who have a deep affinity to faith, a strong work ethic, and commitment to family values. Hispanic Americans share a diverse ancestry with countries spanning Europe, Africa, and South and Central America, and close cultural ties to Mexico, the Caribbean, Central America, South America, and Spain. This diversity has brought variety and richness to the American mosaic and has strengthened our national character with invaluable perspective, experiences, and values. 
   For countless years, Hispanic Americans have played an integral role in all walks of life and made our country stronger. Whether it is in the entertainment industry, business, medicine or public service, the contributions of Hispanic Americans cannot be understated. I am proud to represent a state with a large concentration of Puerto Ricans, Cubans, Dominicans and immigrants from countless countries in South and Central America. 
   In counties such as Hudson, Essex, Passaic, Union, Camden, Atlantic and Cumberland, Hispanic Americans have been contributing to my state's diversity for years. In our state legislature, we are proud to have four members of the General Assembly of Hispanic Heritage with Wilfredo Caraballo, Raul ``Rudy'' Garcia, Nilsa Cruz-Perez and Nellie Pou. At the county level, we have three distinguished members of the Board of Chosen Freeholders with Nidia Davila-Colon, Silverio Vega, and Neftali Cruz in Hudson County. And at the local level, countless Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans and Central and Southern Americans have achieved the office of council person and mayor. New Jersey was especially proud to elect its first Hispanic member of the House of Representatives with the election of Representative ROBERT E. MENENDEZ, who also serves in the House leadership. 
   Through my own Italian heritage, I share a special bond with people of Hispanic descent. When Christopher Columbus set sail to discover this continent, it was done so with the financial support of Spain. Hundreds of years later, the Hispanic heritage continues to be an important and critical aspect of our national accomplishments. Hispanic Americans comprise eleven percent of the nation's population. In just a few years, Hispanic Americans will be the largest ethnic group in the United States. Their commitment to this country has not gone unnoticed. Whether it is serving in our Armed forces or through their growing economic consumer strength, Hispanic Americans are indeed thriving and intertwined in the fabric that is this great country. 
   Activism is important to creating a sense of personal responsibility for one's community. The Hispanic American community embodies this concept, and should be commended for successfully instilling it in others. The contributions of Hispanic Americans has spread to other communities in a manner that transcends racial and ethnic differences, and I am confident they will continue to grow as a vital component of life in New Jersey and indeed the United States.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the FY 2000 Defense authorization bill. This legislation demonstrates a strong commitment to America's defense and to our ability to meet future military challenges. 
   I am particularly pleased by the committee's inclusion of $176.1 million to purchase 17 UH-60L Blackhawk helicopters. A coalition of eight companies in my state manufacture critical components for the Black Hawk, which is the Army's premier tactical transport helicopter. First produced in 1977, it is used for combat assault, combat re-supply, battlefield command and control, electronic warfare and medical evacuation. This year, the Black hawk provided critical support functions for our armed services in the Kosovo. This funding will ensure that our military has the ability to continue its current operations and sustain readiness for future dangers. 
   I am also pleased by the committee's support for high school ROTC programs. The additional $32 million for high school ROTC program will make a particular impact in my State where many programs have been approved for participation in ROTC but remain unfunded. Clark High School is an example of one such program which has remained on a waiting list of approved ROTC program but has been unable to participate because funding has not been available. I am hopeful that this funding will be appropriated, allowing the Department of Defense to immediately utilize this funding so that unfunded programs, like Clark High School, can begin operating as soon as possible. 
   Additionally, the additional benefits for all members of the military included in this bill deals with serious concerns I have had regarding quality of life and morale of our soldiers. The pay raise of almost five percent addresses serious inequities between military pay and civilian wages. In addition, the legislation creates a civilian-style 401(k) by allowing military personnel to contribute up to 5 percent of their pre-tax to a tax-shelter investment fund. These benefits will go a long way toward reaching our goals of recruiting and retaining highly trained personnel. Most importantly, it will give our soldiers and their families the quality of life they deserve.  
   I am also pleased by the $10 million in procurement funding for secure terminal equipment for the military services and defense agencies. This versatile equipments is the cornerstone of our multi-media secure digital communication. The new generation of secure terminal equipment, produced by a defense company in my State, is more effective technology and generates significant operations and maintenance cost savings. 
   Finally, I am extremely pleased by the committee's inclusion of a provision regarding the Economic development conveyance of base closure property. When an installation is recommended for closure, it is imperative that the transfer of property benefit the local community. This provision will accomplish this goal by allowing a more efficient transfer of property to the local re-development authority for job creation and economic development. 
   I again thank Chairman WARNER, Ranking Member LEVIN and Ranking Member INOUYE for their commitment and attention to these important issues.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of the achievements of the Toms River East Little League baseball team, who overcame great odds to return their team to the National Little League final for the second year in a row. 
   The Toms River squad, known as the ``Beast of the East'', were Little League world champions in 1998. This year, they sought to be only the second American team ever in the fifty-three year history of the Little League World Series to repeat as world champions. Unlike professional sports, where champions often repeat using much the same lineup from one year to the next, Toms River attempted to repeat as champions using almost an entirely new roster, with ten of the twelve players new to the team for the 1999 season. Although they fell one game short of returning to the Little League World Series, the fact that Toms River advanced to the national final in 1999 is an impressive accomplishment in its own right. 
   In the aftermath of their exciting run last year, I had the opportunity to meet many of the players and parents involved with the team. I was impressed not only by the skill, poise, and manners with which the team conducted itself on and off the field, but also by the way that the entire community of Toms River rallied around the team. The true character of the squad was demonstrated this year, when even in defeat, they displayed the good sportsmanship and class that is a hallmark of the Toms River community. 
   Truly, these ``boys of summer'' have given us another August to remember with their fine play and tremendous love of the game. I am proud to recognize the accomplishments and contributions of Steve Bernath, Jeff Burgdorff, Eric Campesi, Dave Cappello, Mike Casale, Bobby Cummings, Chris Cunningham, Zach Del Vento, Derrick Egan, Chris Fontenelli, Casey Gaynor, and RJ Jones and I know they will continue to make New Jersey proud for years to come.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of Judge Maryanne Trump Barry's confirmation to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals. As a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have followed Judge Barry's nomination closely as it has moved through the confirmation process. During this time, I have been impressed by her candor, intelligence, and qualifications for the position. She has moved through the process quickly, and I believe the overwhelming support for her nomination is evidence of her ability to ultimately fulfill the obligations of serving on the Third Circuit. 
   Those who know Judge Barry, and have had the pleasure of working with her, have spoken openly of her integrity and thorough knowledge of the law. Some have highlighted her decency, while others have focused upon her razor-sharp wit. However, everyone has agreed on one point--Judge Barry has developed a reputation as a skilled jurist with a judgment and temperament that are highly respected by her peers. The other members of the Senate Judiciary Committee agreed with this assessment, and I was pleased that Judge Barry's nomination was passed out of the Committee by voice-vote on July 29th. 
   For those who are unfamiliar with Judge Barry's distinguished career, she has graduated with Master's and law degrees from Columbia and Hofstra Universities respectively. Judge Barry first worked for the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey and quickly rose through the ranks. She served as Chief of the Appeals Division, and then as a first assistant to the U.S. Attorney. At the time, Judge Barry was the highest-ranking female prosecutor in any major U.S. Attorney's Office in the country. 
   In 1983, Judge Barry was appointed to the U.S. District Court by President Reagan. For almost 16 years, she has served as a pragmatic and vocal presence on the bench in Newark, New Jersey. As a former President of the Association of the Federal Bar of the State of New Jersey, Judge Barry has had a tremendous impact on policy across the State. She currently serves on its advisory board, and continues to be highly regarded for her insights and opinions. Judge Barry has consistently impressed me as an extraordinary woman, and one who will continue to distinguish herself. I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, the amendment before the Senate deals with the issue of trapping on Federal wildlife refuge lands. It recognizes the reality that trapping has been part of the economic and cultural life of the United States for generations and, indeed, an important part of the economic life of many communities. But as anything else in life, there is a right and a wrong way to have trappings on these Federal lands. 
   Overwhelmingly, trappers on Federal lands are using relatively humane methods of trappings that ensure the death of the animal so that there is no suffering. But in a small minority of these instances there are particularly egregious types of traps that continue to be used on Federal lands though many States have banned them for years. Most egregious of all are steel-jaw leg-hold traps and neck snares. These traps almost assure the suffering of an animal. The legislation before the Senate would ban these two specific types of traps and no others--traps used in a small minority of the trapping industry and no others, and not for all purposes. 
   Trapping for research is not included in this amendment. All scientific research can continue with any traps. 
   Subsistence: Many Native American tribes that live off these traps--live off the game they collect--should not be impacted and are not impacted. 
   Facilities protection, or conservation: For any of those purposes, trappers are free to use whatever type of traps they would like. But for recreational purposes or other subsistence purposes, we would ban these two specific types of traps. 
   I know some Senators have raised the question of whether or not banning any traps would cause a problem for the Government itself in maintaining stocks, endangered species, or other legitimate purposes of the Government itself. 
   It is important to note that Secretary Babbitt was asked to address this question, and he wrote:  
   The amendment would not impact the ability of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to manage refuges under the Organic Act of 1997.  
   Specifically, therefore, Secretary Babbitt had given testimony that banning these traps would not contradict the lawful purposes of the U.S. Government. 
   It should also be noted that it is not a new issue for the States. It is not a new issue for the Congress. The House of Representatives on July 14 was confronted with the identical issue on whether or not these two specific traps should be banned for these narrow purposes. By a vote of 259 to 166, with 89 Members of the Republican majority, it overwhelmingly passed this same prohibition. 
   The question arises: Why have the States, why has the House of Representatives, and why have so many of our colleagues expressed concern and support on this floor about a ban on these two specific forms of traps? 
   A leg-hold trap is simply designed to trap an animal by its leg with the force of this steel jaw and hold the animal until the trapper returns. There are several problems with this very old, very tested, but very cruel technology. The trapper may not return for days, or a week, in which case the animal starves to death, becomes dehydrated, and suffers over a period of days and days and days. 
   Second, the extraordinary power of this trap is nearly certain to cause a laceration, or to break the leg of the animal. The animal suffers. As is the case with 80 or 90 percent of these traps, the trap catches the wrong animal. It is not the animal the trapper wants. It is some other animal. If it were a live cage, as overwhelmingly trappers use, the trappers would then release to the wild the animal that was unwanted. But in 80 or 90 percent of the cases the trapper has an animal that he didn't even want. The leg is now broken, or the animal is bleeding to death. It cannot be released to the wild. And an unwanted species is destroyed for no purpose when another 
   technology--a live-bait trap, which most trappers use--would have avoided the whole problem. 
   Even crueler, what is often happening is, these animals caught in the leg-hold trap for days and the trapper does not return are chewing off their own legs--destroying themselves to get free. The reality is that it is destroying unwanted species, with extraordinary suffering, with animals maiming themselves, and for absolutely no reason. 
   This legislation, I repeat, does not deal with scientific reasons, subsistence reasons for Native American tribes, or other scientific purposes. It is only for recreation. It is only for a minority of trappers. It is only for these two kinds of traps, and it only deals with wildlife refuges. 
   What kind of wildlife refuges are the United States maintaining if we are to allow these particularly egregious and cruel types of traps? These are refuges. They are set up for the safety and maintenance of an animal species. It allows trapping and harvesting of species, but not with this one particularly cruel kind of trap. That is the purpose of the amendment. 
   Only 1 out of every 10 species actually gets caught in these traps. It is the intended species--1 in 10. 
   I brought before you a protected species of bird caught in a leg-hold trap. No one was trying to trap an eagle. No one wanted to do so. It was unlawful. There is no purpose in doing so. But the trap doesn't discriminate. When the trapper arrives, what is he to do? The leg of this bird is broken. You can do nothing but kill this animal, though it was no one's intention. 
   This has been endorsed by the American Veterinary Medical Association, the American Animal Hospital Association, hunting groups, and sportsmen. The States of California, Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts have already passed statewide ballot initiatives banning these specific traps. Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island have legislative or administrative bans. Eighty-  eight nations--virtually the entire industrialized world--developed nations, all have banned these traps. We, and we alone, use them. And we are not only using them, we are using them in wildlife refuges that we have had set up for 100 years to protect these animals. How could anyone rise in defense of this trap? 
   Mr. President, I ask that the Senate join the House of Representatives and the various States and impose this narrow prohibition on these two specific traps for these narrow recreational purposes and on these Federal lands. It is a modest request for what is an egregious problem. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is basic in this institution, indeed in our Union, that each of us, as representatives of some States, have respect for the economy, the culture, and the traditions of other States. 
   Indeed, this should not, and cannot, be a debate between Illinois and New Jersey against Montana and Alaska. Disproportionately, this would impact the great State of Alaska and several other Western States. Because of the gracious invitation of the Senator from Alaska, I have visited his State. I have been to Montana many times. I have enormous respect for their traditions and their cultures. It is because of that fact that this amendment was so carefully designed. 
   Senator BURNS has appropriately talked about the problem of ranchers and farmers who lose livestock and need to protect their own properties. The Senator from Montana need not be concerned. The management of species protection of those lands is exempt from this amendment. Private lands are exempt from this amendment. 
   There is no greater advocate of native peoples than Senator STEVENS. He appropriately has talked about the need for subsistence of people who live off the land. And while he has talked about the need to sell some of those species, to the extent that he is concerned about the need of people to trap for their own subsistence, he need not be concerned. That is exempt from this amendment. 
   Maintenance of species, dealing with predatory animals, research are all exempt from this amendment. Private lands are all exempt from this amendment. 
   We are talking about wildlife refuges set up by this Congress to protect species from two specific traps. The question was raised by the Senator from Montana whether or not it was accurate that 80 percent of the species caught in these traps are not the intended species. The life of the animal lost is wasted because these specific traps cannot distinguish between the fox or the mink or the coyote, whatever it is that is being hunted, and another animal. Indeed, 80 percent, upon further research, is not accurate. In 1989, a study by Tomsa and Forbes from the Fourth Eastern Wildlife Damage Control proceedings found that 11 nonintended animals were maimed or killed for every 1 that was being sought, 11 to 1.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Reclaiming my time, the Senator from Alaska cites an interesting point, but it is one that has been done to accommodate people concerned about trapping. Senator BURNS has noted the problem of maintaining stocks, of protecting ranchers. We have kept the power on these lands to use these traps by government or private citizens or scientists or universities or trappers or anybody else, if it is to manage the stocks, if it is to deal with predatory animals or research. 
   What is interesting about Senator STEVENS' points is, to identify the extent of what this amendment does in order to minimize the impact on ranchers, on the economy, on hunting, we are taking what in essence, by the Senator's own statement, is only 15 percent of all the activity with these traps, recognizing these traps only represent 10 or 15 percent of all trapping activity. We are dealing with 10 percent of 10 percent of trapping activity and then only on Federal wildlife lands. 
   Now, if the Senator from Alaska wants to offer an amendment to ban these traps on all lands and by everybody and for all purposes, I can assure the Senator from Alaska, he will have my vote. I have narrowly constructed this because I do not want to impact native peoples who are on subsistence. I do not want to interfere with predatory animals. I do not want to interfere with the management of these lands by the Government. My main purpose is to try to prohibit this for recreational purposes, only with these two traps, or other purposes where it is not necessary to protect ranchers or other legitimate objectives. 
   I yield to the Senator from Alaska.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. First, let me repeat my offer. If the Senator would like, for the sake of fairness, to abandon this, not only by the managers of the land and recreational, but also commercial people, I would be the first to vote for his amendment. This has been narrowly construed only for commercial purposes as an accommodation to the Senator from Alaska. 
   Now, I believe that, as you know, overwhelmingly, trappers are not using these two traps. Overwhelmingly, they are using alternate kinds of technology that are not inhumane, are recognized internationally, and by most other States. 
   If, indeed, by further banning these, we can encourage others to use these traps, I would be the first to do it. It is simply my belief that people who are in this for cash business, they are trapping for furs, getting cash for their furs, we have a right to ask them to spend the extra money to get different traps that either kill the animal outright or catch it alive and unhurt so it can be released and the wrong species are not caught. I think we can put that extra burden on a person who is trapping for cash dollars to buy the different trap. The subsistence people, who are eating the game they are trapping, are exempt from this, as the Senator knows--particularly native peoples who may not be able to afford to do so, or it is in their tradition to do so. They are exempt. 
   So we are dealing with a minority of a minority, only on wildlife refuge lands. I think that is fair; it is narrowly construed, and mostly to accommodate the Senator from Alaska. The Senator was probably unaware of this or he would not have put the earlier statement in the RECORD, but after the letters the Senator submitted for the RECORD, Secretary Babbitt wrote to me as he did to Congressman FARR, making clear that ``The letter dated July 20, 1999, from Mr. John Rogers and the enclosed effect statement do not represent the position of the Department of the Interior.''

   Mr. TORRICELLI. As the Senator knows, I have respect for him for his extraordinary advocacy in all interests of Alaska. We simply have a difference of judgment on what is a relatively narrow matter. You have pointed out that one-fifth of Alaska is in a Federal wildlife refuge. That means in four-fifths of Alaska you can use any trap you want, any way you want, for any purpose you want. But on those lands set up as refuges--20 percent of your State--in those few lands where, by political judgment, this institution in previous years decided it wanted wildlife to have a refuge, it is basic to the concept of a refuge that we try to use, at least for the killing of animals, a technology that is understood and accepted to be relatively humane in those lands and only for these narrow purposes. 
   For all the concerns that you legitimately bring and Senator BURNS brings about the destruction of livestock, or culture, people who live on subsistence, they are free to do what they want, even in the refuge. If we cannot make this narrow exception here, with a letter from the Secretary of the Interior making clear the position of his Department, something endorsed by the House of Representatives, by my party and 89 members of your party, by every other industrialized nation in the world, and we alone are doing this, all I am asking--and it is overwhelmingly in the United States--if you want to use a leghold trap, though it is inhumane and rejected by the rest of the world and most of the Nation, you are free to do so under my amendment. For all these purposes, I ask that, in those few narrow lands, these two specific traps be banned for these few narrow purposes. That is our fundamental disagreement. But that is our only disagreement on that narrow point. I wanted to clarify that.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. So our colleagues are clear on this narrow difference that we represent, two things have been said that deserve further attention. 
   One, if the trapping is to deal with a predator--and indeed this is part of the management of the refuge--my amendment does not affect them. They can trap.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Allow me to finish. 
   If it is a predator and it is for management of the species, they are free to use any trap they want. 
   Second, it was appropriately pointed out if they are in the business of getting furs, they are in that cash business. My amendment would impact them. However, if they are using these traps for subsistence for their own consumption, as the Senator knows, they are also exempt from my amendment. 
   There is a great deal of debate on this floor for a great number of people who have no relationship to my amendment. 
   We are dealing with two traps, one kind of land, narrowly defined, with six exemptions. We are dealing with a fraction of a fraction of the hunting that is going on, which will still leave the United States as the only developed nation in the world that is allowing the traps to be overwhelmingly used. If we cannot take the narrow stand for the wildlife refuge, my guess is we can take no stand at all. 
   I yield the floor and I thank the Senator from Alaska for what has been an enlightening discussion.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I believe we have defined the issue appropriately and at length. That ultimately is where we now differ. The technology of trapping has clearly moved. Eighty-five percent of those who are trapping in the country are not using these traps. The largest States in the Nation have now banned these traps, as have other nations. 
   What remain are those few on Federal wildlife refuge lands who continue to use these two traps identified as inhumane who would admittedly, as Senator STEVENS suggested, for purposes where they are in the cash business of killing the animal and getting the fur, have to change to use other traps. If they are eating the food, they can use the same trap. If it is against predators, they can use the same trap. If they are in management for wildlife species, they can use the same trap. If they are going to sell the fur and they are in the business of making money by doing so, they are going to have to move to a more humane trap. That is as narrow as I know how to write this. 
   That is the issue. That is our difference. I commend it to the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Mr. Bill Mullen, who has been chosen as the 1999 Grand Marshal of the Essex-West Hudson Labor Council AFL-CIO Labor Day March and Observance. The Labor Council is proud to honor Bill for his lifetime dedication to working families in the New Jersey Labor Movement, and especially Ironworkers Local 11. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments. 
   Bill Mullen served in the United States Army during 1967 and 1968, and was stationed in Korea. He was later discharged with the rank of Sergeant. Returning to New Jersey, Bill completed his apprenticeship, and worked as an Ironworker, Shop Steward, Journeyman, Foreman, and Superintendent for various construction companies throughout the state. 
   For over thirty years Bill has been an active member in the labor movement. In 1981, Bill was elected by his fellow colleagues to be the Vice President of Ironworkers Local 11, and later became President in 1989. He has also served as Trustee of the Ironworkers of Northern New Jersey District Council Pension Fund and an active member of the New Jersey Alliance for Action. Currently, he serves as President of the Essex County Building and Construction Trades Council, an organization with 17 affiliates that represents over 12,000 craftmembers throughout Essex County, New Jersey. Bill is a committed worker, colleague, and leader who exemplifies the best of New Jersey Labor Leaders. 
   It gives me great pleasure to recognize a leader of great stature in New Jersey's labor community. Through these years, fighting for the cause of working men and women, Bill has been known to stand on principle, loyalty, and hard work. It is with pride that I honor Bill on his selection as Grand Marshal.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in life you can extend your hand, but to make any real progress someone has to grasp it. For these several weeks, many of us have worked to try to find some reasonable middle ground in the cause of reducing taxes on the American people. It was a worthwhile effort. I believe, indeed, taxes on middle-income Americans are too high and it is the American people who worked hard and paid their taxes who have produced this extraordinary American surplus. They deserve a dividend for the American economic performance. 
   But a tax reduction is not all the American people deserve. They also deserve to know their children are getting educated in quality schools with good teachers. I am for tax reduction, but I want a tax reduction that allows teachers to reduce class size and the rebuilding of crumbling American schools. I am firmly committed that tax reductions for the middle class are required and should be enacted by this Congress. But I also believe the American people must have a health care system that provides for prescription drugs through Medicare for elderly Americans. 
   My point is simply we are at a time when the Nation can both afford and requires multiple objectives. In the bipartisan tax reduction plan of $500 billion, Senator BREAUX, Senator KERREY, and I, working with our Republican colleagues, fashioned a plan where we believed we could reduce taxes on savings to encourage the American people to invest in the new economy by reducing or eliminating capital gains taxes on modest investments and by eliminating taxes on interest on modest savings accounts so all Americans save for their own future for 
   security for their own families. 
   In our plan we expanded by 4 million families the number of people from the 28-percent tax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket because this Government has no right to tax at 28 percent the modest incomes of families who earn $50,000, $60,000, and $70,000, raising one and two children. Indeed, at this point in our history it is something we can afford--to allow people to keep that money for their own needs. 
   Perhaps it was always going to be so, but that bipartisan tax plan was not enacted. But I am not a man who is discouraged easily. When the bipartisan plan was introduced, we described it as the October plan because there are tax plans that are presented because they have political value and communicate a political message, and there are tax plans enacted because they can be attained and they change the law. This was never going to be a brief process and perhaps it was never going to consist of a single phase. Tonight, the first phase is concluded. A message is being sent to the President and to the American people by both political parties. The Democratic Party is committing itself to middle-class tax relief after protecting Social Security and allowing for national objectives of Medicare and education.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise with Senators SPECTER and SCHUMER in support of the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. This issue is one of critical importance to the dairy farmers of New Jersey. It is rare that I come before this body to talk about issues affecting our Nation's farmers, however this is an issue of extreme importance to my state and family farms nationwide. 
   Today New Jersey has less than 200 family dairy farms. These farms have been in families for centuries, and have been handed down from generation to generation. I've met with New Jersey's family farmers, from Sussex and Warren and Hunderdon Counties, and heard their concerns. I know how important they are to my State. Dairy farming is not an easy or lavish life. They milk 7 days a week, 365 days a year, starting out long before dawn, before most of us are out and about. 
   These courageous farmers want to keep their farms, and pass them down to their children. However, without our help, they will not be able to realize this dream. The family farm is the backbone of agriculture in New Jersey; however, today, it is on the verge of extinction. In fact, New Jersey has lost 42 percent of its dairy farms in the past decade. 
   Erratic fluctuations in the prices dairy farmers receive for their raw milk is causing such losses that these farmers are forced out of business. These farms produce over 289 million pounds of milk each year, but as prices decline and costs continue to increase, farmers need help to stabilize milk prices for survival. Without a mechanism to ensure stable prices for milk, New Jersey's family dairy farms will be forced out of business. 
   However, this problem is not unique to my State. Family farms all across the country are hurting. Our Nation's dairy farmers recently experienced a 37 percent drop in the price they receive for their milk. This presents a dilemma for family farms, which must still pay the same amount to feed their cows, hire help, and pay utility costs. This enormous strain will no doubt force some dairy farmers out of business. 
   We must protect America's family farms, and ensure the future vitality of America's dairy industry by re-authorizing and expanding the Northeast Interstate Dairy Compact. I am hopeful that my colleagues will consider the farmers of my state when this issue is debated in conference.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Ashcroft amendment. As every other Member of this institution, I understand the hardship in American agriculture. I know the suffering of American families, and I know something of the problem of the policy. This amendment is based on a false promise. We are telling the American farmer that with all of his problems, a significant difference in his life can be made if only we can stop these sanctions. 
   It is a false promise. All of these countries combined, their total importation of agricultural products is 1.7 percent of agricultural imports. 
   So even if they bought nothing from Canada, nothing from Argentina, nothing from Australia, and nothing from Europe, altogether it would be 1.7 percent of these imports. What is the potential of these countries that we are being told markets will open by the Ashcroft amendment? How much money is it that these people have to spend to help the American farmer? In North Korea, the total per capita annual income of a North Korean is $480. In Cuba, it is $150. 
   Mr. President, the American farmer is being told: There is a rescue here for you. Rather than deal with the substantive problems of American agriculture at home, we have an answer for you. We are going to open up importation and export to all these terrorist nations, and that will solve the problem. Really? With $150 in purchasing power in Cuba? The purchasing power of the North Koreans? 
   The fact of the matter is, to the extent there is any potential in these countries to purchase American agricultural products, the administration has already responded. There may not  be much of a potential, but what there is, we have responded to. 
   Last week, the administration permitted the limited sale of food and agricultural commodities to these countries by licenses on a country-by-country basis. We did so for a responsible reason. If the North Koreans are going to import American agricultural products, we want to know who is importing them and who is getting them--in other words, that they are going to go to the people of North Korea and not the military of North Korea. If they are going to Cuba, we want to know the Cuban people are getting them, not the Cuban military. The same goes for Iran and Libya. 
   The potential of what Mr. ASHCROFT is asking we have already done but in a responsible way. Indeed, potentially, with Iran, Libya, and Sudan, this could be $2 billion worth of sales to those countries--but ensuring that they go to people--not militaries, not terrorist sects, but the people. Here is an example of the policy the administration has had since May 10 with regard to Cuba. Regulations permit the license and sale of food and commodities on a case-by-case basis if they go to nongovernment agencies, religious organizations, private farmers, family-owned businesses. If your intention is to sell food to any of those entities, you can get a license and you can do it. To whom can't you sell? The Communist Party, the Cuban military for re-export by the Cuban Government for Fidel Castro. 
   The amendment offered by the Senator from Missouri solves no problem and simply contradicts the administration's policy of ensuring that this goes to the people we want to be the end users. The same is true in North Korea. Today, the United States is in a humanitarian assistance program to North Korea. Over $459 million worth of food has been donated to North Korea through the World Food Program. UNICEF has done the same. But we send monitors. When the food arrives in North Korea, we monitor that it is going to the people of North Korea, not the military. We want to know the end users. 
   The amendment by the Senator from Missouri will be a wholesale change in American foreign policy. Sanctions that have been in place since the Kennedy administration, through Johnson, Nixon, Carter, and Reagan, will be abandoned wholesale--a radical change in American foreign policy. 
   What are the nations and what are the policies that would be changed? I want my colleagues to walk down memory lane with 
   me. Before you vote to end the policy of 30 years of American administrations, I want you to understand who will be getting these food exports, without licenses, which are not required to ensure the end users. I cannot be the only person in this institution who remembers Mr. Qadhafi, his destruction of an American airliner, his refusal to bring the terrorists to justice who did so to Pan Am 103. We are now in an agreement with Libya to bring those terrorists to trial. Now, in the middle of the trial, while there is an agreement, this amendment would lift the sanctions and allow the exportation of those products. 
   The Sudan. Sanctions have not been in place long. In an act I am sure my colleagues recall, Mr. bin Laden's lieutenants plotted and executed the destruction of American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in August 1998; 224 people were murdered. The administration appropriately responded with sanctions, prohibiting the exportation of products of any kind to the Sudan. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would lift those sanctions. 
   North Korea. The intelligence community and the Japanese Government have put us on notice that, in a matter of weeks or months, the North Korean Government may test fire an intermediate to long-range missile capable of hitting the United States. We are in discussions with the North Koreans urging them not to do so. We have entered into a limited humanitarian food program to convince them not to engage in the design or testing of an atomic weapon. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would negate that program, where we already sell food, knowing its end use and end sanctions. 
   Iran. The administration has already entered into a program where we can license the exportation of food to Iran if we know its end use. But only this year, the administration again noted that Iran supports terrorist groups responsible for the deaths of at least 12 Americans and has funded a $100 million program to undermine the Middle East peace process, giving direct bilateral assistance to every terrorist group in the Middle East, undermining Israel and American foreign policy. 
   Cuba. In October 1997, the United States found that the Cuban Government had murdered four Americans and found them guilty of gross violations of human rights. Last year, 12 Cubans were indicted in Florida for a plot to do a terrorist act against American military facilities in Florida. The United States already licenses food to Cuba, where we know the end use. The amendment of the Senator from Missouri would allow the wholesale exportation of food to Cuba despite these indictments, gross human rights violations, and 30 years of American foreign policy. 
   I respect the concern of the Senator from Missouri for the American farmer. I understand the plight. But let's deal truthfully with the American farmer, his family, and his plight. The Cuban family who earns $150 a year, through their purchasing power, is not going to salvage American agriculture. If Cuba was capable of importing food today, they would do so from Argentina, Canada, or Europe. They don't because they can't, because they have no money. The same is true of North Korea. If North Korea had the money to import food, they would do so from every other nation in the world that does not have sanctions on them. They don't because they can't, because they can't afford it, because they have no money. You are making an offer no one can accept--an answer to the American farmer that has no substance. I don't believe there is a single farmer in America who either believes this argument or, even if it would be successful, even if they did have money, would want to profit off the misery of others who are victims of this kind of terrorism. 
   I, too, represent an agricultural State. Farmers in the State of New Jersey--the Garden State--are also suffering. 
   I have yet to find one American farmer--good Americans, patriotic Americans--who believes the answer to their problem is selling Qadhafi products, or the Iranians. American farmers--all of the American people--have long memories. 
   These people are outlaws. Every one of these nations is on the terrorist list. Is our policy to put nations on the terrorist list because they kill our citizens, bomb our embassies, destroy our planes, and then to say: It is outrageous but would you like to do business? Can we profit by you? We know our citizens have been hurt. But, you know, that was yesterday; now we would like to make a buck. 
   Please, my colleagues, don't come to this floor and argue that you are contradicting the foreign policy of Bill Clinton. You are. And you are undermining his negotiations as to the North Korean missile tests and atomic weapons, and you are undermining our efforts to bring people to justice in Libya and for human rights in Cuba. But don't come to this floor and just claim you are undermining Bill Clinton. Half of these sanctions were put in place by Ronald Reagan and George Bush. This is 30 years of American foreign policy with a single vote, with a stroke of a pen, that you would undermine. 
   Some of you may be prepared to forget some of the things through all of these years. Maybe some of these acts are distant. But my God. Saddam, the destruction of American embassies? Some of those families are still grieving. We haven't even rebuilt the embassies. We are still closing them because of terrorist threats. The man who masterminded it is still being hunted. 
   The Sudan? 
   This is our idea of how to correct American foreign policy? My colleagues, I want to see this amendment defeated. But, indeed, that is not enough. 
   If from North Korea to the Sudan to Iran there is a belief that you can just wait the United States out, that we are the kind of people who will forget that quickly, who will profit in spite of these terrible actions against our people, what a signal that is to others.  What a signal it is to others who engage in terrorism. 
   I do not hold a high standard with whom we do business. Business is business. Politics is politics. But there is a point at which they meet. These rogue nations, identified after careful analysis of having engaged in the sponsoring of international terrorism, deserve these sanctions. On a bipartisan basis, we have always given them these sanctions. Don't desert that policy. 
   Bin Laden in his cave in Afghanistan, Abu Nidal in the Middle East are even now plotting against Israel and the peace process. 
   I don't know whether the American farmer will know of or appreciate this vote. But I know that in those capitals in those countries where the people committed these acts it will be noted. 
   This is not a partisan affair. I am very proud that from CONNIE MACK, who has joined this fight for some years, to the distinguished chairman of the committee, Chairman HELMS, to BOB GRAHAM, to our own leadership in HARRY REID, to, indeed, the majority leader, Senator LOTT, they have all joined in defeating this amendment because it is right for American foreign policy. 
   Let's do justice to the American farmer by dealing with the substantive problem--not dealing with excuses, and not dealing with other matters. We do nothing by fooling the American farmer. The American farmer stands shoulder to shoulder with every other American against terrorism and the defense of our country and its interests. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a resolution regarding our extradition treaty with Mexico. This resolution expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States renegotiate our extradition treaty to allow for the possibility of capital punishment. The case of Jose Luis del Toro has made the need for this resolution clear. 
   When Sheila Bellush was brutally murdered in November 1997, her accused murderer, Jose Luis del Toro, fled to Mexico to escape prosecution in the United States. From this time forward, there has been little consolation for the Bellush family, and a great deal of hardship. While Del Toro was apprehended in Mexico just 13 days later, a nightmare of government delays and roadblocks prevented his extradition to the United States. 
   The details of Sheila Bellush's murder are shocking. By all accounts, her four 23-month-old quadruplets probably witnessed their mother's murder, and wandered around in her blood trying to wake her up for as many as 4 or 5 hours before the 13-year-old daughter came home from school and found Mrs. Bellush's body. 
   There is overwhelming evidence that Del Toro was involved in the murder. The Sarasota police believe that he was, in fact, the gunman in a murder-for-hire scheme. Del Toro's cousin works at a golf course where Bellush's ex-husband plays golf. That cousin and one of the ex-husband's golfing partners have been arrested as co-conspirators. On the day of the murder, Del Toro asked directions to the Bellush house and left a clear fingerprint at the scene. He had directions to the Bellush house in his car, which was seen near the crime, and he stayed in a nearby motel, where a .45 caliber bullet was found, like the one used in the murder. 
   The Mexican government refused his extradition unless the United States agreed to waive the death penalty. Amazingly, we approved such a provision in the U.S.-Mexico Extradition Treaty of 1978. This agreement allows Mexico the right to refuse extradition if the death penalty may be applicable in the case. In the Bellush case, this provision allowed Del Toro to evade prosecution for over a year while awaiting his extradition. 
   I became involved in this case when Jamie Bellush moved their six children to Newton, New Jersey, and sought my help with Del Toro's extradition. I was in constant contact with the Justice and State Departments and the Mexican Embassy urging them to move  quickly in returning Del Toro. The Mexican Government has since honored our request, and extradited Mr. Del Toro to Florida to stand trial. However, I believe that the U.S. should still move to renegotiate our extradition treaty with Mexico and prevent this unfortunate series of events from happening to other families in the future. I look forward to working with this Congress to pass this resolution.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Senator BAYH and I have joined with Senator COVERDELL on this amendment. It is simple on its face: to encourage people to engage in modest savings, eliminating $1,000 of capital gains tax for modest savers. Seventy-five percent of the people who will be affected by this earn less than $70,000. It is to encourage the culture of savings so people plan for their own retirements and security in their own families. 
   The Nation today is in the midst of a savings crisis. I know of no better way to encourage people to participate in the growth of this economy and investment than giving this simple $1,000 exclusion on their capital gains. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, thank you very much. 
   The Senate has had before it three very distinct blueprints for the American future, not a tax plan for the remainder of this year or next year but blueprints that will dictate many priorities and decisions for more than a decade. They are very distinctly different. 
   The Senate has before it a Republican tax reduction plan that will never become law because the President will never sign it. The Senate is considering a Democratic tax reduction plan that will never become law because this Congress will never pass it. And there is a bipartisan tax reduction plan of $500 billion now before the Senate. 
   It is termed a ``bipartisan tax reduction plan,'' but it should be better known as the ``October plan,'' because we may spend July and August debating our partisan proposals. 
   Members of the Senate may not endorse this proposal today, but I suggest that by the time we reach October, it is a plan such as this that will bring us together. 
   This plan, crafted by Senators BREAUX, KERREY, CHAFEE, SPECTER, COLLINS, SNOWE, BAYH, myself, and a group of others, is based on a belief that the Nation should have returned to it as much of its tax dollars as possible, while still being prudent to allow the development of a surplus, protecting Social Security and other national priorities. Reducing taxes is a national priority, but so is hiring 100,000 teachers, rebuilding American schools, providing for a pharmaceutical benefit in Medicare, improving the national infrastructure, and reducing the national debt. 
   Like any compromise, this plan is designed to accommodate many of these objectives, and I think we have succeeded. But it is also based on the belief that the American people, after 8 years of economic expansion that was built on hard work, high taxes, and sacrifices, deserve a dividend. 
   This $500 billion tax reduction plan is a fair and reasonable dividend. This surplus developed for a reason. In 1993, appropriately in response to burgeoning deficits, this Congress increased taxes by a quarter of a trillion dollars. In the years that followed, American businesses produced and American workers produced at unprecedented levels. They have provided an economic expansion and also a Government surplus, and they deserve now to have some of it returned. That is the foundation of this plan. But we accomplish nothing by returning these tax revenues if we only prestage a burgeoning deficit in the future or we deny other needs in the country as well. 
   Tax reduction is an economic imperative, in my judgment, but so is education and so is improvement of the national health care system, and so is expansion of the national infrastructure. There is before this Senate but one balanced plan that can achieve  
   these tax reduction goals while meeting these balanced national objectives, and it is this plan, the ``October plan.'' 
   This plan is also based on a recognition that even in good economic times, it is important to recognize that these are not perfect economic times. The United States today faces twin economic problems: 
   First, record levels of consumer debt. The current economic expansion is threatened by mounting middle-class consumer debt more than any other single indicator. Middle-income families with young children are shouldering more debt in home mortgages, credit card bills, and educational expenses than at any time in our national history. 
   This plan is designed to respond to that need by moving 4 million Americans, people who earn $50,000, $60,000, $70,000 in family income, with young children, and moving them from the 28-percent bracket to the 15-percent bracket where they belong. 
   This Government has no right to go to a family that earns $60,000 and $70,000 and struggles every month to educate its children, provide housing, clothing, and food, and take 28 percent of that income for the Federal Government. I do not believe it was ever our intention. 
   Prosperity and inflation moved people into these tax brackets. For a long time, some of us lived with the illusion that people who lived at these modest incomes somehow had expendable income, as if they were living lives of luxury. There is no luxury in American life today on an income of $30,000 to $70,000 with children. This bill recognizes that 
   fact. 
   We also recognize that many senior citizens and many young families supplement their incomes by modest savings--people who earn a few thousand dollars in capital gains, put a little bit of money in the bank, or they invest in the stock market for a little security to participate in American growth. The Federal Government should not be charging capital gains taxes on people who earn $2,000 and $3,000 a year. We should be doing everything we can to encourage these people to save for an emergency, prepare for the future, and this bill deals with that reality, in response to the fact that the other crisis in American economic life today, beyond high consumer debt, is a virtual collapse in national savings. This year, the United States has a national savings rate of minus 1.2 percent, the lowest rate since the second year of the Great Depression. We are the only developed nation in the world with a negative savings rate. 
   This legislation responds to that reality. We eliminate the capital gains taxes on the first few thousand dollars of savings, which, in part, takes 4 million taxpayers off the tax rolls entirely--young families and probably largely senior citizens who want a little security in life. They should pay nothing, and that is what this bill provides. 
   Those are the twin objectives we have: Reduce consumer debt by lowering taxes on the middle class by moving people from the 28-percent bracket to the 15-percent bracket; and, second, by encouraging savings, both as Senator ROTH has done by an expansion of the IRA, and in our case from $2,000 to $3,000. 
   This Government should be doing everything possible to encourage Americans to save money, if not for our larger economic purposes, then simply because 50 percent of Americans have no pensions; 60 percent of Americans retire only on Social Security. My colleagues and I know why there is such enormous pressure on this Congress to increase Social Security and other Government benefits: Because people are not saving money, and they do not save money because this Government has made it economically irrational to do so, and the Tax Code is the answer to changing that reality. 
   Our bill, I think, is easily defined and explained. It is simply $500 billion over the course of this next decade. It removes 3 million people entirely from the tax rolls by increasing the standard deduction and eliminating taxes on modest savings. Three million people, largely senior citizens, will pay nothing. 
   Second, as I suggested, we move 4 million people from the 28-percent tax bracket to the 15-percent tax bracket, meaning that a family of four earning $71,000 will now have their taxes arguably reduced in half and have money available for their own family needs. For a single person earning $37,000, this translates into a $600 tax cut. A family earning $71,000, as I suggested, receives a $1,300 tax cut. 
   We also do more. We eliminate the marriage penalty entirely in the standard deduction. We increase and expand the child care tax credit to remove American women from this dilemma where they have to choose between going to work to pay the mortgage and knowing their children are safe by allowing affordable child care.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, by any measure, this is an extraordinary time in the life of our country. It appears that as the American century comes to a conclusion, the chances are good that what the world is going to witness is simply another American century, where our dominance may be exercised by different technologies, our power may be measured by different means, but our dominance is just as certain. 
   The quality of life in America is rising to new heights. Our economic strength could be measured by many means, but it is considerable. Home ownership is now at the highest rate in the Nation's history. In 6 years the United States has created 18 million new jobs, more than all of Western Europe and Japan combined. Unemployment is near record lows in the postwar period--genuinely an extraordinary time. Nothing surprises Americans more than that we are witnessing not simply the growth of an economy, employment and economic opportunities, but the Federal Government itself is participating in this extraordinary transformation. 
   The United States is about to accumulate in our Government budget not only the largest surplus in American history but the largest surplus in the history of any nation in any government budget. Indeed, it is now projected to be $1 trillion larger than was anticipated only several years ago. By the year 2009, the total accumulated surplus of the U.S. Government could be an astonishing $2.9 trillion. 
   The fundamental question now before this Government as we begin to plan for the next decade, the beginning of a new century, is how to allocate these resources.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. For all of us who participated in the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act, it is probably the singular achievement and the greatest source of pride in our careers. For the American people, it is more than a source of pride; it is a source of new freedom. These surpluses allow us to dream again about rebuilding schools, providing child care, improving the quality of instruction, repairing American infrastructure, funding higher education. Things that were postponed by all these years of debt, struggle, and sacrifice have been made possible again. 
   But it is important to remember in this transformation, in these last 6 years, there are other heroes, too, more important than the Members of Congress who cast these votes--the people who gave up more and did more to create this new American prosperity. They are simple American families who did without Government programs, Government employees who saw Federal employment decline, people who suffered at declines in Government spending in all measures, and American taxpayers who paid more in Federal taxes to reduce the debt. 
   It is important to remember because, as we think about the opportunities for education and health care and other Government programs this Federal surplus provides, so, too, is the American taxpayer to be remembered. I do not quarrel with the administration--indeed, I support their notion--that the first obligation in committing these new surplus funds is to protect Medicare and Social Security. It is our first obligation. It is not our only obligation. 
   Of the approximately $3 trillion of Federal surpluses to be allocated in the next 10 years, $2 billion of it will be required to ensure that Social Security and Medicare are protected. But certainly, with the remaining $1 trillion in accumulated surpluses over the next decade, there is the ability in this Congress to provide some tax relief for working American families. The tax burden of the United States is now the highest since the Second World War. 
   Middle-class families, who were once in low-income brackets, through prosperity and inflation, have seen themselves, while still facing the enormous costs of education and housing and the requirements of an ordinary American life, facing tax brackets of 28 and 33 percent. Today, a family of four, living on a combined income of $72,000, which can be the simple income of a schoolteacher or a police officer or a public servant, is taxed at 28 percent, instead of the 15 percent which should, and once did, represent the Federal tax rate of middle-class Americans. 
   It is wrong--it is even unconscionable--to ask a young mother and father trying to raise children, with the high  cost of living in the United States, to postpone educational decisions or housing decisions, the requirements of building a family, to pay a 28-percent tax on a combined family income of $50,000, $60,000 or $70,000. It is not right. But mostly, with a Federal surplus of $1 trillion in the next decade, after protecting Social Security and Medicare, it is not necessary. 
   I believe the first obligation of a Federal tax relief is to expand the 15-percent bracket to genuinely include Americans who are in the middle class, to place them in the tax bracket where they belong. The Roth plan participates in this strategy by expanding the bracket and by lowering the 15-percent bracket to 14 percent. It is a good beginning, but it is not a complete plan. 
   The other twin tax crisis in America is not high rates but disincentives for savings which are causing a crisis in savings in America. The national savings rate in the United States is now the lowest since the Second World War. In May, our national savings rate was a minus 1.2 percent--a negative rate of savings not seen since the Great Depression. It has no corollary in the Western World, and it is a long-term, economic, Governmental and social problem. 
   Sixty percent of all Americans who retire rely solely on Social Security. More than 50 percent of Americans effectively have no net worth of any appreciable value, other than their home. It is a rational economic response to a tax system that provides discouragement for savings and encouragement for consumption. 
   I believe this tax reduction legislation about to be considered by the Congress can provide a new beginning, first, by expanding the traditional IRA from $2,000 to $3,000. It is notable that when the IRAs were first instituted at $2,000, had they merely kept pace with inflation all these years, it would now allow for a $5,000 deduction rather than the continuing $2,000 level. 
   Second, people who accumulate $10,000 in a savings account in America to provide themselves some security from the crisis of life, or for their retirements or to prepare for their children's futures, should not be taxed. The Federal Government has no business--indeed, it should have a disincentive--to ever tax an American family who wants to save a modest $5,000 or $10,000. We have an interest in them doing so and should not be providing a disincentive by taxing them on the modest interest they would accumulate. This simple provision of $10,000 in tax-free savings, exempting the first $500 in dividends and interest, would make the savings of 30 million Americans tax-free. 
   Third, every American should be encouraged to participate in the new prosperity, burgeoning industries, new technologies, and growing market. The Federal Government should not be taxing the modest capital gains of people who earn $1,000, $2,000, or a few thousand dollars in the stock market, or from the sale of real estate. We should be encouraging every American to participate by investing, to gather some wealth for their own security, so that in retirement they don't rely solely on the Government, or continue to live paycheck-to-paycheck. Even if this accumulates only modest amounts of money in savings or investment, it is a beginning for a new economic freedom for American families. 
   Many of these ideas were included in the tax reduction legislation I offered with Senator COVERDELL. I am enormously proud that in Senator ROTH's proposal, and indeed now in a bipartisan tax bill being discussed by Senator BREAUX and Senator KERREY of Nebraska, many of these same elements are included. I am glad Senator COVERDELL and I have made that contribution. 
   But now the question becomes not simply which elements of Federal taxes are to be reduced but by how much. Therein lies the argument. I believe, as many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle have come to believe, that this Congress can responsibly afford, while protecting Social Security and Medicare, to enact a $500 billion tax reduction program over the course of the next decade. That would allow an additional $500 billion for discretionary spending, a prescription drug benefit, or other national needs beyond protecting Social Security and Medicare. 
   It is modest. But it would have an appreciable impact on the quality of life of American families, and genuinely give tax relief to middle-income Americans. 
   Finally, every Senator must come to the judgment about not only the size of this tax relief program, which I believe should be $500 billion but, indeed, where it should be targeted. It is middle-income families who have seen the rates of their taxes rise through the years as they were pushed into higher brackets by the cost of living and our national prosperity. They should be our first priority. 
   Our principal national economic problem, even in extraordinarily good times, is the collapse of national savings. Reduction in taxes on savings should be a high priority. 
   But I believe, as many Democrats and Republicans have come to conclude, that most of this tax reduction program should be for people who are paying most of the taxes in America. 
   In the 1993 bill, this Congress can be very proud that with the earned-income tax credit we reduced the burden and, indeed, gave assistance to lower income Americans. They deserved and needed the help. This tax program should be for people who are paying taxes, bearing the burden, and need the help. 
   This is an important moment for this Congress. This vote on a tax reduction program will say a lot about our priorities. We will chart a course for another decade. 
   I believe we can reach across this aisle and find a reasonable compromise that gives genuine tax relief. 
   I want the people of the State of New Jersey to know that I have committed myself to be part of that effort. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to thank Chairman GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS for accepting an amendment I offered to the FY2000 Commerce, Justice, State Appropriations bill that will provide $500,000 for a truck safety program in New Jersey. This critical initiative will allow the State Police to finally purchase much needed portable scales and accompanying computer equipment that will enable them to better monitor and control large trucks that utilize local roads. 
   This amendment was necessary because more than 5,300 people, including 660 children, died in highway crashes with big trucks last year, and the number of carriers on local roads throughout the nation continues to rise. This problem has become particularly acute in New Jersey. For example, Route 31 in the northwest part of the state previously accommodated several hundreds trucks a day. That number has now grown to well over 3,000 trucks a day, and four people have died in truck related accidents on this road in the past 24 months. 
   In order to increase safety through improved enforcement efforts, I introduced this amendment to provide the New Jersey State Police with the modern equipment necessary to effectively regulate these oversized vehicles. This additional funding will be used to purchase almost 120 new mobile truck scales and 60 mobile data computers. The current scales, which often break down and require heavy, outdated batteries, will be replaced with lighter scales that are maintenance free. The new computers, which can be mounted in trooper's vehicles, would allow the police direct access to the Commercial Vehicle Information Safety Network and enable them to perform immediate checks on truckers who are violating the law. 
   This new equipment will go a long way towards keeping these oversized carriers off of smaller, undivided local roads and will send a strong message that we remain committed to protecting our communities. Again, I am grateful to Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS for their support.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, to introduce an amendment regarding the issue of area code conservation. The rapid proliferation of area codes is a problem facing the citizens of New Jersey, as well as the rest of the nation. 
   The extraordinary growth of the telecommunications industry in recent years has created a unique new problem. In just the last four years, the number of area codes in the United States has increased almost 60 percent. Continued growth will require that even the newest area codes be split and replaced again in the near future. 
   This problem has been particularly acute in New Jersey. Prior to 1991, the state went almost thirty years without a new area code. But in the last eight years, four new area codes have been added in the state and more are on the way. 
   While this is not the most pressing problem this country faces; it is a serious one. The costs and inconvenience of introducing new area codes are real. Small businesses must pay to reprint stationery, advertising, and signs, and to inform customers of new numbers. Communities throughout New Jersey, such as Willingboro, Medford, and Monroe, have faced the possibility of being split between two area codes, requiring many residents to dial an area code just to call a neighbor across the street. These costs get even higher when new area codes are introduced repeatedly in the same area after only a few years, forcing residents and businesses to make the same adjustments all over again. 
   Many people blame the demand for new phone numbers as the sole cause of so many new area codes. But there is another cause. Each area code has 7.9 million potential phone numbers. Today, less than half of the potential phone numbers in existing area codes are being used, leaving a total of 1.3 billion unused phone numbers in the United States. The real problem is that new area codes are being created before old ones are exhausted. 
   The inefficient use of available phone numbers is a product of the outdated system by which numbers are distributed within each area code. Phone numbers are allotted to telecommunications companies in blocks of 10,000, regardless of whether those companies have the capacity to use every number. Undoubtedly, this system made sense when there was only one telephone company because it would, eventually, use every number available. 
   But, as we all know, the new era of telecommunications competition has introduced dozens of smaller companies. Today, there are over 100 such companies in New Jersey alone. Under the current allocation system, these companies still receive phone numbers in blocks of 10,000. Even if a company does not use its full allocation, unused numbers remain dormant while new area codes are being created. 
   This unnecessary nuisance can be alleviated relatively easily. All it requires is a little planning and foresight. Given the enormous demand for new phone numbers and the growth of smaller phone companies, we should overhaul the system for allocating phone numbers. The Federal Communication Commission is currently reviewing ways to do just that. But, while their efforts are encouraging, the process may not work fast enough to prevent the next round of needless new area codes in New Jersey. 
   The Amendment I have introduced with Senator COLLINS expresses the sense of the Senate that the Federal Communications Commission should complete its ongoing rulemaking regarding number resource optimization by March 31, 2000. This action will help ensure that the FCC rapidly implements practical number conservation measures. 
   New area codes are inevitable as the population and electronic communications continue to grow. But there are  reasonable, practical ways to soften the impact of these changes. Ensuring that new area codes are implemented only when current ones have been exhausted will save time, energy, and money for countless residents and businesses, in New Jersey and around the country.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate one of the most tragic events of the 20th century. 25 years ago today, Turkey invaded Cyprus, and it has occupied part of the island ever since. In fact, 35,000 Turkish troops continue to occupy almost 40 percent of Cyprus' territory. Turkey's invasion forced the relocation of thousands of Greek Cypriots, it has led to the brutal treatment of the enclaved people in the Karpas, and it has resulted in greater instability in the region. 
   When Turkey occupied a portion of Cyprus in 1974, almost 200,000 Greek Cypriots were evicted from their homes and became refugees in their own country. 1,618 Greek Cypriots, including four Americans, have been missing ever since. After 25 years, the refugees have never been allowed to return to their homes in occupied Cyprus, and the missing are still unaccounted for. At the same time, Turkey has brought in over 80,000 settlers to the occupied part of the island. These settlers were given the lands and homes belonging to Greek Cypriots, in violation of international law. 
   For the few Greek Cypriots that were allowed to remain in the occupied Karpas Peninsula, the situation has been equally grim. A 1975 humanitarian agreement allowed 20,000 Greek Cypriots to stay in this area, but only 500 live in the Karpas today. These people have been subjected to harassment and intimidation despite the terms of the 1975 agreement. Land travel in the north is heavily restricted, as is secondary schooling and access to religious institutions. The United Nations itself has observed that the terms of the agreement have not been honored. 
   As we reflect on the past 25 years, it is clear that the rights of the Greek Cypriot population continue to be violated, that tensions have not lessened, and that instability has become a greater threat. Rather than lose hope, we must make a concerted effort to encourage dialogue and discussion among the parties. I have long advocated a just and peaceful resolution to the Cyprus conflict, and I hope that we will make progress toward a solution before the next anniversary comes to pass. Ending this impasse is in the best interests of the Greek Cypriot population, the region, and the international community as a whole. I urge this Congress and the Administration, as we mark the 25th anniversary of the Cyprus occupation, to evaluate the current situation and increase our efforts to ensure that a peaceful solution becomes a reality for Cyprus.

New Jersey to a place of honored retirement in her namesake state. After fifty-six years of service to our Nation, this proud ship is ready to serve America in a new and invaluable role as an educational museum and historic center.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in the last few days, the Senate has revealed a lot about itself and where it stands. 
   Members of the Senate have had a chance to respond to the needs of American women in allowing OB/GYNs to be their primary health care provider, and they failed. Members of the Senate have had a chance to protect traveling Americans across the country, allowing access to emergency rooms, and they declined. Americans have asked that doctors make final medical judgments. That issue was brought to the Senate. The Senate declined. 
   Senator DURBIN now brings to the floor of the Senate one last chance for the Senate to do something fair and decent for the American people in this plan to protect people in Health Maintenance Organizations--to give them the right afforded every other American with every other industry to bring their grievance to a court of law. 
   It is ultimately the choice between a Patients' Bill of Rights or an insurance protection plan. If we fail, make no mistake about it, this debate and this vote will be noted for the fact that the Senate balanced the interests of 120 million Americans against several dozen insurance companies and made the wrong choice. 
   In a nation in which we pride ourselves on access to the system of justice and equal rights for all people in this land, there are two privileged classes. By international treaty, foreign diplomats cannot be sued; and by ERISA, insurance companies in the health insurance industry cannot be sued. Here is a chance to reduce that list and make insurance companies and those responsible for our health accountable like everybody else. 
   Every small business in America is responsible if they do damage to a customer, every dry cleaner, every trucking company, every mom and pop store. This industry, and this industry alone, is treated differently. 
   Under the Republican proposal, that status quo is protected. 
   Under Mr. DURBIN's amendment, they will be held accountable. As other Members of the Senate, I have heard constituents come forward where an HMO has failed to diagnose cancer in a small child and months later, because they could not get access to an oncologist, a leg or an arm is lost. Tell that parent they cannot go to court.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator KERRY and I are introducing the Act to Save America's Forests. When this country was founded over two hundred years ago, there were hundreds of millions of acres of virgin forest land across what is now the United States. Today, 95 percent of those original virgin forests have been cut down. 
   Our Federal forests are unique and precious public assets. Large, unbroken forest watersheds provide high-quality water supplies for drinking, agriculture, industry, as well as habitat for recreational and commercial fisheries and other wildlife. The large scale destruction of natural forests threatens other industries such as tourism and fishing with job loss. As a legacy for the enjoyment, knowledge, and well-being of future generations, provisions must be made for the protection and perpetuation of America's forests. 
   Clearcutting, even aged logging practices, and timber road construction have been the preferred management practices used on our Federal forests in recent years. These practices have caused widespread forest ecosystem fragmentation and degradation. The result is species extinction, soil erosion, flooding, declining water quality, diminishing commercial and sport fisheries, including salmon, and mudslides. Mudslides in Western forest regions during recent winter flooding have caused millions of dollars of environmental and property damage, and resulted in several deaths. 
   An environmentally sustainable alternative to these practices is selection management: the selection system involves the removal of trees of different ages either singly or in small groups in order to preserve the biodiversity of the forest. 
   Destructive forestry practices such as clearcutting on Federal lands was legalized by the passage of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. From 1984 to 1991, an average of 243,000 acres were clearcut annually on Federal lands. During the same time period an average of only 33,000 acres were harvested using the protective selection management practices. Pro-clearcutting interpretations of forestry laws have also been used by Federal managers to promote even age logging and road construction. In addition, the laws are not effective in preserving our forests because in many cases judges do not allow citizens standing in court to ensure that the Forest Service or other agencies follow the environmental protections of the law. 
   I am introducing this legislation to halt and reverse the effects of deforestation on Federal lands by ending the practice of clearcutting, while promoting environmentally compatible and economically sustainable selection management logging. It is important to note this legislation would only apply to Federal forests which are currently supplying less than 6 percent of America's timber consumption. According to a recent Congressional Research Service report we can reduce timber supply from the national forests and still meet our nation's timber needs. The vast majority of the 490 million acres of harvestable timber are privately owned and unaffected by the bill. 
   This legislation puts forward positive alternatives that will achieve two principal policies for our Federal forests. First, the Act would ban logging and road-building in remaining core areas of biodiversity throughout the Federal forest system including roadless areas, specially designated areas and 13 million acres of Northwest Ancient Forests. Second, in non-core areas it would abolish environmentally destructive forms of logging such as clearcutting and even aged logging. 
   The Act requires selection management logging practices to be used. Therefore, timber companies would only be allowed to log a certain percentage of the forests over specified periods of time. Further it takes extra  steps to protect watersheds and fisheries by prohibiting logging in buffer areas along streams, lakes, and wetlands. The Act would also call for an independent panel of scientists to develop a plan to restore and rejuvenate those forests and their ecosystems that are damaged from decades of these logging practices. And finally, the legislation would empower citizen involvement in insuring compliance with environmental protections of forest management laws by making certain that all citizens have standing to pursue actions in court.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, every year, thousands of people are killed or maimed because of the use or misuse of illegal explosive devices, and millions of dollars in property is lost. Between 1991 and 1995, there were more than 14,000 actual and attempted criminal bombings. Three hundred and twenty-six people were killed in those incidents and another 2,970 injured. More than $6 million in property damage resulted. 
   One bombing in particular, is carved into the national memory. On the morning of April 19, 1995, in one horrible moment, an explosion devastated the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, OK, and took the lives of 168 Americans. This tragedy, together with the bombing of the World Trade Center in New York, took the lives of many innocent men, women, and children, left others permanently scarred, and caused great suffering for the families of the victims--as well as all of America. These crimes were intended to tear the very fabric of our society; instead, their tragic consequences served to strengthen our resolve to stand firm against the insanity of terrorism and the criminal use of explosives. 
   In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, I was stunned--as were many--to learn how few restrictions on the use and sale of explosives really exist. I soon after introduced legislation to take a first step towards protecting the American people from those who would use explosives to do them harm. That bill, the Explosives Protection Act, would bring explosives law into line with gun laws. Specifically, it would take the list of categories of people who cannot obtain firearms and would add any of those categories not currently covered under the explosives law. 
   Today, I am taking the next step by introducing the Dangerous Explosives Background Check Requirement Act requiring background checks before the sale of explosives material identical to those already mandated for firearms sales. Current law prohibits felons and others from possessing explosives, but does little to actually stop these materials from getting into the wrong hands. This failure defies logic when we already have a system in place to facilitate background checks and assure that persons who are legally prohibited from purchasing explosives are not able to do so. 
   In November, 1998, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) became operational. NICS is a new national database accessible to licensed firearms dealers that allows them to perform over-the-counter background checks on potential firearms purchasers. NICS, which checks national criminal history databases as well as information on other prohibited categories, such as illegal aliens and persons under domestic violence restraining orders, has already processed more than 3.7 million background checks and has stopped more than 39,000 felons and other prohibited persons from getting guns. In so doing, it has undoubtedly saved lives and prevented crimes from occurring. 
   Once again, it is time to bring the explosives law into line with gun laws by taking advantage of the success of the NICS system and expanding its use to include explosives purchases. In so doing, we will make it harder for many of the most dangerous or least accountable members of society to obtain materials which can result in a great loss of life. My hope is that this bill will, in some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by terrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even spouses involved in marital disputes.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator GRASSLEY, to introduce legislation that will provide Americans more choices and control in their health care decisions. 
   Since becoming available in 1996, medical savings accounts (MSA's) have proven to be an effective solution for Americans who are self-employed, unsatisfied with their current health plan or working for a company unable to provide health insurance. By allowing consumers to save money tax-free to cover medical expenses, MSA's have ensured that people who previously were unable to acquire health coverage, such as single parents, the self-employed, small businesses and their employees, and working families, now have affordable medical coverage. In fact, since MSA's became available, the General Accounting Office reports that 37 percent of all MSA's have been purchased by people who were previously uninsured. 
   Due to current restrictions, however, the size of the market is limited. Congress must allow the benefits from MSA's to reach more Americans. 
   Our bill, the Medical Savings Account Effectiveness Act of 1999, will make MSA's a permanent health care option for all Americans by expanding enrollment beyond the current cap. This legislation will allow both employers and employees to contribute to an MSA and will allow policyholders to fully fund the deductible. In addition, it will lower the individual deductible to $1,000 and the family deductible to $2,000. Finally, it will allow MSA's to be offered through ``cafeteria plans.'' 
   By expanding MSA's, this legislation will give policyholders direct control over medical expenditures, offer them a new freedom to select the physician or specialist of their choice, and make insurance affordable for millions of Americans.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I have this evening withdrawn consideration of an amendment that I offered with Senator LIEBERMAN, Senator DODD, and Senator LAUTENBERG. But I do so in the hope that in the intervening weeks the Finance Committee will consider this measure with the near certainty that my colleagues from Connecticut and I will return with Senator LAUTENBERG and offer this in the coming weeks. I rise tonight very simply and very briefly to make our case. 
   There is nothing more fundamental in this Federal union than the equal protection of all of our citizens. It is the very purpose of the union. A citizen can travel State-by-State, live anywhere in this Nation, and be subject to the same application of the law. 
   This principle, while 200 years old, is now tested again. Some weeks ago, the State of New York repealed the commuter tax for commuters into the city of New York. That tax had been in place for more than 30 years. But they did a peculiar thing that is offensive to our concept of national union. They repealed the tax for people who live in New York State and commute to New York City, but they retained the tax for the citizens of Connecticut, 80,000 strong, and 250,000 commuters in the State of New Jersey. Those people who I represent alone were contributing $110 million to the city of New York. 
   It is not as if the legislature of the State of New York in doing this did not recognize they were trampling upon sacred constitutional grounds, because indeed in their State legislation they put a provision that if this was found unconstitutional for anybody, the law would be revoked. It was a political statement. It was not a sincere effort to legislate. 
   Indeed, as could be predicted, last week a judge did, indeed, rule that it was not only unfair to repeal this tax for New York commuters while imposing it on Connecticut and New Jersey, but it was unconstitutional and a violation of the privileges in the immunity clause of the U.S. Constitution. 
   I quote the judge who called this residency tax ``arbitrary and irrational.'' The judge further recognized that ``the only substantial difference between the two classes of commuters is in the State in which they reside.'' 
   It might be argued that the State of New York, having recognized this might be unconstitutional, a judge now having ruled it is unconstitutional, that we might let the matter rest. I do not believe that would be in the best interests of the Congress. Indeed, last week, the House of Representatives on a voice vote, without apparent objection, unanimously found this is bad policy and it should never happen again. 
   The legislation, the Computer Tax Fairness Act, that I have introduced with Senators DODD, LIEBERMAN, and LAUTENBERG, would have this Senate reach the same conclusion. I rise tonight not to offer an amendment but in the hopes of asking the Finance Committee in the next few weeks to review, as the Ways and Means in the House of Representatives has done, to review this legislation, and to reach its own judgment, so in future weeks we can come back to the floor of the Senate and ask the Senate to make an informed judgment. 
   I believe it is important. Today it may be the people of Connecticut and New Jersey. This is a principle we will visit again. People who live in Indiana may one day commute to Chicago and find the city of Chicago thinks it is a good idea to tax somebody else for their services. I daresay the people of Alabama may one day find they are commuting to Mississippi and finding they are paying a tax subjected only on their own citizens. This is anathema to our national union. It is taxation without representation. It is a violation of privilege of immunities. It is a problem of equal protection. Indeed, it violates our sense of union. 
   While I do not insist on the amendment tonight, we will return to this moment in the hope that as the courts have found and as the House of Representatives has found, we can once again establish this principle.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, yesterday the citizens of South Florida watched in horror as live television cameras revealed an extraordinary spectacle. The hopes of freedom and the great traditions of America collided on the open seas with the harsh reality of the Clinton administration's arrangements with Castro's government in controlling immigration to the United States. 
   Six Cuban refugees who fought across the Florida straits came to within yards of the coast of the United States of America. Only a few feet from their destination, they leaped from the boat and attempted to swim to the shores of our country. They did so for the reasons that all of our ancestors and hundreds of thousands of other Cuban Americans came to the United States--with the belief that they could find freedom and security. 
   It was with horror, I am certain, on their part, but also by other Americans who watched this spectacle unfold as Coast Guard boats intercepted the swimmers. Men attempted to swim for their lives and were never given lifejackets. Surrounded by Coast Guard boats that generated large wakes, imperiling the lives of those who would swim to shore, Coast Guard crewmen used pepper spray against some of the swimmers. They were then taken into custody in handcuffs. Welcome to America. 
   It is essential that the Coast Guard, the Department of the Treasury, begin an immediate inquiry to revise these procedures to find out how this incident could have happened. Handcuffing refugees, using pepper spray, not helping those who were endangered on the high seas, subjecting them to the wake of large boats, allowing them to stay in the ocean for 15, 20 and, 30 minutes without assistance, no matter how you feel about Castro's government or immigration, no matter how you approach this issue, is not the role of the U.S. Coast Guard. It is not the policy of the U.S. Government. This is not how we treat refugees or people who are coming to our shores for freedom. 
   It reminds us that the problems of Castro's government are not yet addressed. This crisis is not yet over. In the last 6 months, Amnesty International has reported that the total number of political prisoners in Cuba is now 350. In the last 6 months, there has been the arrest of four human rights dissidents petitioning their own government to recognize basic human rights. In just the last 6 months, the Cuban government has now passed laws making it a felony, punishable by 20 years in jail, to cooperate with the U.S. Government or any of its agencies. Things are not getting better in Castro's Cuba. They are getting worse. 
   As people flee that island for freedom, they deserve more and the people of the United States expect more than to have the agencies of this government used to continue an oppression, not at the hands of Castro but to threaten the lives of these refugees at the hands of our own agencies. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of this amendment and the preservation of Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act. It is important that we maintain our commitment to the Armenian people. 
   One of the greatest foreign policy priorities in the post-Cold War world is to assist former Communist countries in making the difficult transition to democracy. The fall of the Soviet Union was not the final victory of the Cold War. That will come only when all of these former adversaries embrace liberty, free markets, and the rule of law. Senator BROWNBACK's underlying amendment has the potential to further economic and political progress in the Caucasus and Caspian Sea regions. In its current form, however, it severely weakens one of Congress' central achievements of the post-Cold War era. 
   The 102nd Congress in 1992, passed the Freedom Support Act. This bill acknowledged that we can help countries make the transition to democracy both with the carrot of economic aid and the stick of withholding such assistance. It included a provision, Section 907, which mandated that Azerbaijan will not receive any direct economic aid until it ceases the blockade of neighboring Armenia and the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh. Even still, the United States has supported the Azeri people with over $180 million in humanitarian assistance through NGOs since 1992. The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill itself also allows OPIC and TDA activities in Azerbaijan which we approved last year. 
   The Azeri blockade of Armenia and of Karabakh is a direct result of the dispute between the two countries over the status of Karabakh. This is the longest-running ethnic conflict in the former Soviet Union. So far, the human cost has been 35,000 lives and 1.4 million refugees. Outside of the conflict, the brutality of the Azeri blockade has been equally devastating for Armenia. As a land-locked country where only 17 percent of the land is arable, its ties to the outside world are its lifeline. Humanitarian assistance cannot get to Armenia, which is still trying to rebuild from the devastating earthquake of a decade ago. In Karabakh, the blockade has produced a critical shortage of medical equipment. 
   True regional cooperation is unrealistic as long as this conflict continues. By passing the underlying amendment in its current form, we are virtually guaranteeing that the OSCE peace process will fail. Armenia will have little incentive to participate in the future, and Azerbaijan will receive the message that its rejection of any future peace proposals is acceptable. I support Senator BROWNBACK's attempts to promote an East-West axis in the region, and I believe it is critical that we encourage these former republics to look westward. By allowing the blockade to endure, however, we are leaving Armenia with only North-South options. If our intent is to truly improve the quality of life in the Caucasus and the Caspian Sea, we must make a positive impact on the Caucasus without undermining our commitment to the Armenian people. I urge my colleagues to support the McConnell-Abraham amendment and allow Section 907 to remain in place.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, a case has been made that Americans cannot travel to Cuba. Indeed, the facts reveal that Americans travel to Cuba by the thousands. The policy that this Congress has endorsed, President Reagan, President Bush, and President Clinton have supported. 
   There has been a calculated policy of American contacts in travel to Cuba. Today American students, journalists, people with archeological interests, cultural interests, travel to Cuba by the thousands. Cuban Americans travel to visit family members who have problems, medical emergencies, by the thousands. The restriction of the U.S. Government is not about travel. 
   We are using travel as a weapon to help convince the Cuban people to put pressure on the Cuban Government, support for democracy, free markets, that their contact with Americans is helpful in changing the politics of the repression of Cuba. Restrictions in travel is not about denying Americans the right to go to Cuba. It is about denying Fidel Castro the economic benefits of American tourism. Travel that enhances knowledge, causes political difficulties, we not only allow but we have encouraged. 
   Travel that simply provides Fidel Castro with millions of dollars to support his regime, his military, his security forces, we are denying, and appropriately so. Nor is it a static policy. 
   On January 9 of this year, President Clinton revised the policy again, for the second time in 2 years, to add new remittances by American citizens to Cuba, so that people can send money and support their families at appropriate levels that are humanitarian, to help with medical or food emergencies but not so much that it would allow Fidel Castro to profit by it. President Clinton has allowed charter passenger flights to cities other than Havana for the first time, and the measure permits direct mail service to Cuba. The measure also authorizes the sale of food and agricultural inputs to independent nongovernment entities. 
   New regulations for all of this were issued on May 10--flights, new authority for travel, food and medicine--as  part of a calculated policy to always test Castro: When you are ready to talk about democracy, to respect human rights, American policy will begin to change. Several days after President Clinton announced these new initiatives, the Cuban Government responded and Castro announced that it constituted a policy of ``aggression.'' Once again, as President Carter found, as did Presidents Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, every time you make an act of concession--in this case, a legitimate concession--to test Fidel Castro to see whether he is interested in a bilateral relationship, we are denounced for redressing the Cuban nation by disallowing travel. 
   My colleagues offer an amendment now to remove these restrictions and open travel and allow Fidel Castro to get the full economic benefit of millions, potentially hundreds of millions of dollars worth of travel. 
   What kind of regime is it that they will be visiting? If Castro is to receive the benefit of our tourist dollars, what is it he would be doing with this money? It is worth taking a look at Cuba, not of 1961 when the cold war brought us to sanctions, but the Cuba of 1999. It is suggested by my friend and colleague from Vermont that the cold war is over, implying that perhaps we have no argument with this regime. 
   Our argument with Cuba is about more than the cold war. It is about all the things that have always motivated the United States: human rights, human decency, the nature of the regime itself. Our argument with Fidel Castro is not over. The causes of that argument still endure. 
   While the United States has been seeking to ease sanctions, look at the record in the last 24 months in response to our review and change of policy. In February, Fidel Castro criminalized all forms of cooperation or participation in any prodemocracy efforts--not a fine, not an arrest, but 20 years in jail if you participate in a prodemocracy effort. This is the Cuba you will be visiting. He imposes a 30-year jail term on anybody who cooperates with an agency of the U.S. Government. That includes Radio Marti, distribution of food or medicine by a government agency, or anyone acting on behalf of anyone associating with this Government. 
   On March 1, the law was tested. Four prominent human rights dissidents were tried in secrecy for their criticism of the Communist Party of Cuba. International diplomats who traveled to Cuba to witness the trial were barred from attending any of the proceedings. After being held without charges for 1 year--no foreign press, no foreign visitors, no diplomats, held in secrecy for 1 year--they were found guilty and sentenced for up to 5 years in jail. This is the Cuba of 1999. 
   Amnesty International, in its recent report, concludes that there are now 350 political prisoners in Cuba. Ten unarmed civilians, in the meantime, have been shot by Cuban security officials on the streets of Havana. 
   I do not ask the Senate to do anything it has not done before. Just on March 25, the Senate voted 98-0, stating that the United States should make all efforts to criticize Cuba and condemn its human rights record. What is the price of this conduct? They hold hundreds of political prisoners, people are shot in the streets, people are held in secret trials, and our response is: Let's go for a visit. Let's go see how they are doing and have a good meal in Havana. No. My colleague is right. There is no cold war, but there is a great deal at issue that this country cares a great deal about.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I will answer the question first and continue my remarks. I don't think travel restrictions on China would change Chinese policy. I oppose those restrictions. I do believe travel restrictions on Cuba will change Cuban policy. That is why I support them. I do believe that continued international resolve--for the first time, the Senator's amendment would weaken America's policy. We have gotten Europeans and Latins so outraged by the jailing of these dissidents and these secret trials that European and Latin nations that have voted against us for 20 years have joined with us this year in Europe in voting to condemn the Cuban Government. Just as they are joining the fight for human rights, the United States would abandon it. 
   There is one other thing that is important. I will finish making my case and I will be glad to yield. There is one other change. This isn't just about what Cuba does internally anymore. This is also about what they are doing to our country. The government that you would have us now visit, in lifting these restrictions, is a Cuba that has crossed a very important threshold. 
   Just this last year, indicted by the government of Cuba on May 7, were 14 Cubans captured in Miami. Let me suggest to you the nature of that indictment to see whether it makes an impression on the Senator and see whether or not he thinks this is an appropriate time to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba. The indictment of Cuban agents in Miami last fall was for attempting to penetrate the U.S. Southern Command and planning ``terrorist acts against U.S. military installations.'' The indictment was further revised to include 2 of the 14 with conspiracy to murder 4 American citizens by shooting down their aircraft over the Straits of Florida. 
   Let me suggest that I, as all of my colleagues, am prepared to respond to initiatives from Havana. The day there are elections, the day there are open trials, the day there is a free press, the day they respond to a request for extradition of people who murder American citizens, I will join you with my colleagues on that day on this floor matching the Cuban Government 2-to-1, 3-to-1, 1 of their initiatives to 3 of ours, 10 of ours, or 20 of ours. We will meet them 95 percent of the way down the field. 
   But, my friends, to ask this Senate to respond to the record of the last year of jailing dissidents, secret trials, shooting people on the streets, the indictment of 14 Cuban agents penetrating the United States military installations to commit terrorist acts against the United States, and the indictment of Cubans for murdering American citizens--this, my colleagues, would not appear to me to be the best time to suggest that it is time to forgive and forget, and have thousands--maybe tens of thousands--of Americans visit Cuba to rescue the Cuban economy from its current position of collapse, and provide Fidel Castro with the revenue to strengthen his regime. 
   These sanctions are having an effect. Fidel Castro has had to reduce his military by one-half. He cannot afford to keep them in uniform. The secret police have been reduced by nearly a third in their size. We are causing the collapse of the Communist Party of Cuba--not in a timely way, not as I would like it to be, but it is having an impact. 
   Why, given this record of indictments and terrorism and murder against American citizens, would we choose this moment? 
   Those in the world who have been the most critical of our policy--the Holy Father in the Vatican, who led an initiative himself to ease restrictions on Cuba, has now joined the chorus of those. Fidel Castro broke his promise about priests. The Holy Father appealed to him not to proceed with these jail terms, and he did it anyway. The Vatican is now joining the criticism. 
   The states of Latin America for the first time are voting against his human rights record. And we in the United States who led this effort for all of these years are about to change sides. 
   This Senate has been resolute on this issue in the past. 
   I will join with my friend from Kentucky, Senator MCCONNELL, I hope in a motion to table this amendment. 
   I think the debate has been worthwhile.  
   My friend from Connecticut and my friend from Vermont have made it very clear to the Cuban Government that we are ready, willing, and able to change our policy if they change theirs. But I believe the motion to table is the right way to proceed in the Senate at the moment. 
   I would be glad to yield to the Senator from Vermont.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I recognize that. I thank the Senator from Vermont. 
   Let me further present the case, in case the Senator misunderstood me, that this is not a case that Cuba spied against the United States. That we expect. This is a case where the President of the United States, in my judgment, rightfully sought to ease restrictions on travel to Cuba and did so in allowing charter flights, the expansion of flights throughout Cuba, the easing of restrictions on travel to Cuba, and the response that he received is that we now have 14 Cubans under indictment, not for responding but for attempting to infiltrate an American military installation and committing a terrorist act. 
   What I want the Senator from Vermont to do is put himself in the position of Fidel Castro. The United States makes concessions to allow greater travel, which we have now done twice in 24 months. The Cuban Government attacks those concessions with acts of aggression and attempts to commit terrorist acts against the United States. The human rights situation further deteriorates. People are jailed. Contact with the U.S. Government is criminalized. And now this Senate 
   returns not in outrage but says, Mr. President, we don't think you went far enough; let's go further and further and liberalize trade. 
   That is my concern, recognizing how this will be seen in Havana. 
   I agree with the Senator's analysis. The United States allows travel to many places. But the Senator has to concede to me that travel has often been an effective tool in altering international conduct. 
   This country participated in prohibiting flights to Libya after it shot down the Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland. We prohibited flights. After a period of 10 years, the Libyan Government relented and allowed extradition to an international court those who are responsible for the act. I don't ask anything with regard to the victims of Lockerbie that we are not asking now of those in the Cuban Government. 
   What is the difference? How do you look at the families of the young men shot down over the Straits of Florida and murdered by the Cuban Government, and tell them, well, we will overlook this, though we will resolve it with Libya? 
   When Americans have been in jeopardy, whether it was in Iran, or in Libya, or years ago in Vietnam, when they were arresting people and putting them in concentration camps, we prohibited travel. I suggest to the Senator that that prohibition is still an effective mechanism of policy. 
   In any case, I yield the floor to allow my friend from Connecticut to speak. 
   I urge my colleagues to join with Senator MCCONNELL on a motion to table. This is the wrong judgment with the wrong signal at the wrong moment--not undermining the historic American policy, but it is undermining the policy of the Clinton administration which has been well calibrated and very well defined. 
   This is not a partisan matter. It is bipartisan against the leadership of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate led by Senator HELMS and by President Clinton. It counters both policies. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I congratulate the Senator from Florida on his statement and his extraordinary leadership on this issue through the years and simply inquire of him, through this decade, American policy towards Cuba has largely been defined by the Cuban Democracy Act that the Senator from Florida joined with me in writing, the Helms-Burton Act that the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate, Senator HELMS, wrote, and now under the leadership of President Clinton. 
   This amendment would largely undermine the policies outlined in that legislation and by President Clinton. Indeed, the President recently has redefined his own policy of travel towards Cuba. But by a sweep of the pen, that bipartisan policy that the Senators and the President of the United States have written would largely be undermined, in my estimation. 
   Is that the Senator's conclusion?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. If the Senator would continue to yield, I think what is important about your statement is you recognize this policy isn't about travel; it is about money. It is about giving Fidel Castro millions of dollars of American tourist money to support his regime, his dictatorship, his armed forces, his security forces. That is what we are denying. 
   But the frustration that the Senator from Florida may have--and you probably know more about the Cuban economic experience and the travel experience than anyone in this institution by virtue of your constituency--and to  rely upon your expertise for a moment, it is my understanding, contrary to what the Senate may be led to believe today, that when tourists go to Cuba from European countries, they are put into tourist compounds. Cubans are not allowed to visit those hotels. They cannot talk to people in those hotels. So the notion that hundreds of thousands of American tourists are going to walk the streets of Cuba and democratize the island, spread the message of human rights--in fact, the average Cuban cannot get inside those compounds. They are walled off. 
   The Senator knows more about this, by far, than I do, but is that not the story of many of these beach-front hotels?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. A final question. And I am very pleased the distinguished minority whip, Senator REID of Nevada, is going to join with us on a motion to table. 
   But before I yield back, Senator KERRY of Massachusetts left a very appealing notion of the example of President Havel, that this exchange of visiting and talking to people about democratic ideas would somehow change the Cuban political reality. 
   Again, you know more about this than I do. It is my impression that under Cuban law, as Fidel Castro has now changed the law, if a would-be Havel walked up, in Havana, to an American tourist and talked to that tourist about democracy, he would be rewarded--not with information, a growth of knowledge--but he would go to jail because talking about democracy in Cuba to an American tourist will guarantee one thing--you will be arrested, you will be indicted, and you will go to jail. 
   Is that the reality of what a conversation about democracy with an American tourist is?

   Mr. TORRICELLI. The point is, Americans clearly do in Cuba have the freedom to leave the hotels and wander around the island. As Senator GRAHAM has pointed out, nearly 100,000 Americans went to Cuba last year. So this is not a question that many Americans cannot go. It has simply been the Clinton administration's view to restrict the number so as not to give Castro great financial rewards. One hundred thousand Americans go. 
   The point I was making with Senator GRAHAM was not to give people the illusion that Americans in a hotel on the beaches near Havana are going to receive Cuban visitors. The average Cuban is not allowed on the hotel grounds on these compounds. This is not going to be people visiting President Havel in his office. They are not allowed to go there. They can't spend money there. They can't be guests there. They are foreign compounds. You might as well be on a beach somewhere on a desert island in the Pacific. They are restricted. 
   I thank the Senator from Florida for yielding.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, once again my Democratic colleagues in the Senate have joined this week in a discussion of the overwhelming national need for reform of managed health care. Once again, Senators from States across the Nation have shared the experiences of their constituents, the frustrations of their families at being denied the treatment and care through managed care for which they are paying. 
   Once again, it has been a one-sided discussion. We have been talking about the need for reform of managed care while our friends and colleagues across the aisle have been preventing any real debate. The American people have waited long enough for a basic and fundamental reform of the managed health care system in America. We have allowed weeks, months and even years to pass while recognizing American families are in jeopardy and not receiving the care they need, deserve, or have even paid for. There is simply no further excuse for delay. 
   During this session of the Congress, this Senate has spent 7 days considering 38 amendments on the relatively simple concept of educational flexibility. The Senate had 8 days available for 52 amendments on juvenile justice; 4 days for 159 amendments on defense authorization; 13 days to consider 51 amendments on the Y2K problem. These were all important issues, all legitimate. But in each and every instance time was not an issue; the available amendments by Members of the Senate were fully considered. On this single issue, which affects as many or more Americans than any of these others, the Senate does not have time; it cannot give its attention. 
   Like other Members of the Senate who have come to the floor to discuss the experiences of their constituencies, I want to share the experience of one of mine: A young woman from Spotswood, NJ, Kristin Bolinger. Kristin suffers from a unique condition that causes seizures and scoliosis, but it can be managed with proper treatment. The genius of medical science in America, the care of her doctors, can prevent these seizures that are interrupting her life. Her family is enrolled in an HMO. She was denied access to a specialist, the one with the knowledge to treat her illness. The procedure was deemed unnecessary. She was denied critical home nursing, denied physical therapy, denied reimbursement. The fact of the matter is, the care her parents were paying for, she was paying for, the benefit of the genius of American medical science, was denied to her. 
   There are 161 million Americans just like Kristin, covered by managed care, who simply cannot wait any longer for this Senate to find their problems, the tragedies of their families, relevant. In my State, in New Jersey, 3.8 million people who are part of health maintenance organizations have no legal protections. Like their fellow citizens across America, they believe it is time for us to act. The American people have been polled and 79 percent are in favor of and demand some reform in the management of health care in America. They believe, as I believe, that doctors, specialists, people trained to care, should be making these medical judgments; not accountants, not financial managers. People should be making decisions to provide care who know what care is required. 
   There is a lot that has changed in American health care through the years. The family doctor who in the middle of the night knocked on your door to help may be gone. By necessity, it may all have changed. But we do not have to abandon that one principle  that has always been at the foundation of private health care in America--doctors make health care decisions. 
   Mr. President, 30 percent of the American people, an extraordinary number, claim they personally know someone who needed 
   health care, who had a problem, and was denied that care although they were enrolled in and had paid for a managed care plan. 
   Here is the answer. Here is the legislation we would like to bring to the Senate that addresses these problems--it is overwhelmingly supported by the American people--but we are denied the opportunity to do so. 
   No. 1, ensure that doctors, not the HMO, determine what is ``medically necessary.'' 
   No. 2, guarantee access to a qualified specialist for those who need one, even if that specialist is not part of the HMO. 
   No. 3, ensure independent medical appeals for treatment denied by the HMO, so when you are denied treatment, there is someone else to whom you can make your case to get care for yourself, your family, or your child. 
   No. 4, guarantee wherever you are in America, if you need to get access to an emergency room, you can get into that emergency room. 
   In sum, what this would provide is some new sense of security in health care in American life. Americans with cancer would be guaranteed access to an oncologist, not just a family doctor. If their HMO denied access, they could go on and appeal to ensure the right judgment was made, and the oncologist, not the HMO, would decide their treatment. In substance that is what this means. This is important for all Americans. 
   Let me conclude by saying there is a category of Americans for whom these reforms are the most important. Mr. President, 75 percent of all the medical decisions in families in America are made by women, for themselves and for their children. One of the things that is required in our legislation is that an OB/GYN can be a primary health care provider, can make the necessary judgments on first impression. It is, perhaps, one of the most important reforms in the Democratic Patients' Bill of Rights. It is overwhelmingly supported by American women. But we also prohibit drive-through health procedures like mastectomies and guarantee access by children to pediatric specialists. 
   From American children to American women to all American families, there is an overwhelming need to begin these reforms. It can be postponed for another year, another few years, maybe another decade. The only thing the Senate guarantees by postponement is that the list of millions of Americans who are not getting to specialists, who are denied access to emergency rooms, whose medical doctors are not allowed to make the ultimate determinations--that list is growing. It is growing, and so is the frustration of the American electorate. 
   I hope in this session, in this year, in this Senate, the need for a Patients' Bill of Rights finally comes to be recognized and accepted. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for a peaceful process of self-determination in East Timor. These are both exciting and troubling times in Indonesia as a whole, and the future of East Timor may be resolved in the coming months. President Habibie himself indicated that he would work toward resolution of East Timor's status by the end of the year. 
   The recent Parliamentary elections in Indonesia proceeded peacefully, and virtually without incident. It appears as if a democratic transition will be forthcoming, and I am hopeful that the people of Indonesia remain committed to free and fair elections. While we have supported these elections, and encouraged a fair process, we simultaneously receive reports of increased social unrest. Clashes between Muslims and Christians in Ambon are only one indication of the tensions which underlie relations between different ethnic groups. 
   The situation in East Timor has historically divided sympathies over an acceptable solution, and violent attacks in the region have become more prevalent since the beginning of the year. Evidence has indicated that anti-independence militias have been supported and armed by some members of the Indonesian military. The end result of such support can only be an increase in the political tensions and violence in East Timor. The militias have committed scores of human rights abuses against the ethnic East Timorese in an effort to suppress any movement towards full independence in East Timor. 
   It is as yet unclear how East Timor's status will ultimately be resolved. Solutions from greater autonomy within Indonesia to full independence are only two of the proposals that have been brought forward. The international community has sought to encourage an open decision process by the people of East Timor as to what their future status should hold, but the increased strength of the anti-independence militias threatens to undermine the process. In order for a free ballot to be held in the coming months, the United States must make an effort to ensure that the process is fair. 
   I co-sponsored a resolution offered by Senator LEAHY to encourage an open ballot on the question of East Timor, but this resolution also urges full access by international human rights monitors and the disbanding of the militias. Such steps are critical to the fair determination of East Timor's future, and I hope that this Congress will continue to show its support for the ballot process.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Frank M. Wade as he celebrates his retirement as the Executive Director of the New Jersey State Building and Construction Trades Council. Frank has served in this capacity for the past ten years, and he has a long history of commitment to labor organizations in the State of New Jersey. In fact, Frank has been a cornerstone for labor rights in New Jersey. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his accomplishments. 
   Since he started as a member of the Iron Workers Local #480 in 1954, through his election as Executive Director in 1989, Frank has fought hard to protect the rights of working men and women in New Jersey. His dedication to the New Jersey State Building and Construction Trades Council, and to labor causes in general, is widely known and admired throughout the State of New Jersey. 
   In addition to his position with the New Jersey Building and Construction Trades Council, Frank has played a very active role in strengthening the political and economic life of New Jersey. He has served on a number of civic organizations including the New Jersey Society for Environmental, Economic Development (NJSEED), the New Jersey Employment Security Council, and on the Advisory Committee on the Prevailing Wage Act. 
   Frank has never lost sight of the need to serve his community. Despite his responsibilities he has still found the time for charitable causes. Deborah Hospital Foundation is just one of the organizations that has benefitted from Frank's involvement. 
   So it gives me great pleasure to recognize a leader of great stature in New Jersey's labor community, but also a great friend. Through all our years together, fighting for the cause of working men and women, I have always known Frank to stand on principle, loyalty, and hard work. While he may be leaving this post, I know I can always rely on him to hold true to that standard in every endeavor he undertakes.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from Connecticut, Senator LIEBERMAN and Senator DODD to introduce the Tax Fairness for Commuters Act. Last month, Governor Pataki of New York signed legislation to ``repeal'' the New York City commuter tax. However, the legislation signed into law only repealed the tax for residents of New York. The over 300,000 residents of Connecticut and New Jersey will still be subjected to this tax. 
   I believe that the lawsuit jointly undertaken by New Jersey and Connecticut along with the city of New York and affected commuters will ultimately prevail and this attempt will be proven unconstitutional. However, I am concerned about the attempted precedent that has been set. 
   Our legislation will remove the temptation of any State or any city to impose higher taxes on non-residents than it does on residents. The bill is very simple. It says that a State or city may not impose a higher tax on the income earned by non-residents than it does on residents. I hope that each Senator, no matter what part of the country they are from, will recognize the inherent danger in discriminatory taxes of this nature and will support this effort.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, the Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999. This legislation seeks to halt an unintended and unwarranted series of public benefits payments to utlimately deportable individuals who assisted or otherwise participated in persecution sponsored by the Nazis or their allies during World War II. The bill also closes a loophole in the current law which allows some of these deportable individuals to avoid the suspension of their benefits by fleeing the United States. Such individuals who illegally gain access to the bounty of the United States, for example, by misrepresenting the facts of their wartime conduct, should not be allowed to benefit from their deceit at the expense of the Treasury, including the Social Security Trust Funds. So too, individuals who avoid entry of an order of deportation or removal by fleeing the United States should not be permitted to circumvent the intent of the law at the expense of the Trust Funds.  
   Recognizing the excellent work of the Department of Justice's Office of Special Investigations (OSI) in bringing and winning cases against those who participated in Nazi persecution, the Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999 delegates to the Attorney General the discretionary authority to initiate proceedings to prohibit the payment of public benefits to any benefits receipient or applicant whom the Attorney General has reason to believe may have been a participant in persecution sponsored by the Nazis or their allies. Although OSI's success in deporting former Nazi persecutors has resulted in the cessation of social security benefits payments to numerous persons, this bill will, among other things, permit termination of benefits even before (or without) an order of deportation. This bill will apply to persons eventually subject to deportation who have assisted in Nazi persecution in any way. Proof by a preponderance of the evidence of such assistance or other participation in persecution is required. The Attorney General need not prove that a particular respondent is or was a war criminal. Rather, this legislation adopts the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals' properly broad interpretation of the Holtzman Amendment (now Sections 212(a)(3)(E) and 237(a)(4)(D) of the Immigration and Nationality Act) terms ``participated'' or ``assisted'' in persecution. In Schellong v. I.N.S., the Sevneth Circuit properly interpreted the Holtzman Amendment, which is incorporated into this bill's statutory standard. The standard set out by the Sixth Circuit in Petkiewytsch v. I.N.S., ignores the plain language of the Holtzman Amendment and is specifically rejected by this bill. The Nazi Benefits Termination Act of 1999, like the Holtzman Amendment, applies to persons who assisted or otherwise participated in Nazi-sponsored persecution in any way, and does not require a showing by the government of personal or direct involvement in atrocities, voluntariness or motive. 
   Section 2(b)(2)(B)(1) of the bill is drafted to cover naturalized citizens whose admission to the United States was unlawful due, inter alia, to assistance in persecution or who otherwise procured their citizenship illegally or by concealment of a material fact or misrepresentation. 
   Section 3(a) of the legislation provides that Immigration Judges appointed by the Attorney General pursuant to the procedure established under the regulations implementing Section 1101(b)(4) of Title 8 will preside over the benefits hearings established by this bill. The rules, procedures, and rights applicable in these hearings are to be governed by the terms of this bill, existing regulations under Title 8, and any necessary additional implementing regulations. 
   The preponderance-of-the-evidence burden of proof will apply in hearings conducted under Section 3(a) of the bill. This standard is applicable in federal benefits revocation proceedings and most civil proceedings. Under this standard, we can avoid the delays incident to assembly of proof in denaturalization and deportation cases brought against this class, and consequently stem current depletion of the Treasury. 
   Section 3(f) of the bill makes clear that findings under section 3(c)(3)(A) of the bill may be based upon the collateral estoppel effect of denaturalization, deportation, or other appropriate judgments. 
   It is important to pass this legislation to help protect the public against unintended and unwarranted waste in paying benefits to ultimately deportable individuals. This measure will help to conserve resources so that future generations can continue to rely upon social security and other necessary public benefits payments.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an issue that is important to me, and many of my constituents, in the context of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act. The tragedy of Pan Am Flight 103 occurred over ten years ago. 270 people were killed as a result of the bombing over Lockerbie, Scotland, including 189 Americans. The bombing of Pan Am 103 was the worst act of international terrorism ever directed against the United States. Since then, we have fought a long battle to see the perpetrators of that crime brought to justice. I have personally spoken to the families of the victims and shared their outrage that the suspects were harbored by the Libyan government. 
   It now appears as if the indicted suspects, Abdel Basset Al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fhimah, may finally be tried for their crime. Colonel Qaddafi has turned over the two men to stand trial before a Scottish court, under Scottish law, and by a panel of Scottish judges in the Netherlands. Barring any unforseen problems, a trial of the two men suspected in the bombing of Pan Am 103 is all but certain to take place at the Hague. 
   This Congress and the Administration have been extremely supportive of the victims' families, but it would be fair to say that they have seen little  justice over the past 10 years. We have all been touched by this tragedy. In the State of New Jersey alone there are 38 family members who lost a loved one aboard Pan Am 103. As we move toward a trial, an appropriate gesture from this Congress to the families is the opportunity to witness the trial. The United States has made clear our determination in seeing these two men tried for their crime. Now we must be equally determined to let the victims' families, who want to, witness the trial. 
   I offered language during Committee consideration of this bill to authorize the release of as much money as is necessary from Libyan assets frozen in the United States since 1986. These funds would be used to cover the travel expenses for all immediate family members who wish to go to the Hague. I can think of no one more appropriate to cover the cost of the families' travel expenses than Muammar Qaddafi. 
   However, since the Foreign Relations Committee approved this bill, Congress has passed the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill. I am pleased that we were able to include language to allow money form the Crime Victim's Fund Act to be used to cover the costs of the trial. It is important that we make this important gesture to the families at such a critical time, and I look forward to seeing this provision implemented.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, in our constitutional government, it is the Congress that is entrusted to reflect both the desires of our people and it was envisioned that it is this Congress that would be the most responsive to immediate public need. 
   But there has arisen in recent years both a frustration with the Congress and a tendency to rely upon other institutions. Patterns emerged in the fight against tobacco and the health care crisis that have come from citizens, aggrieved parties who have relied upon the Federal courts to redress their grievances. Indeed, the same pattern is now occurring with regard to the problems of gun violence and the inability of Congress to respond to the legitimate needs of controlling these dangerous weapons in their design and in their distribution, leading citizens to, once again, rely upon the Federal courts. 
   I rise today because there is now a third rising frustration with the American people that is leading them to the Federal courts rather than to the Federal Congress. I am addressing the problem of lead poison. 
   Victims of lead poisoning are suing corporations that have manufactured this paint before its residential use was banned in 1978, recognizing that lead today is the leading health hazard to children in many communities around America. 
   Despite all of our efforts in the last 20 years to ban lead paint to protect American children, there are still estimated to be 890,000 children in America who suffer from elevated levels of lead poisoning in their blood. This lead poisoning in America's children leads to physical impairment, mental impairment, and severe behavioral problems in children. In 
   extreme cases, this leads to comas, mental retardation, brain damage, and even death. 
   In 1992, the Congress made a commitment to our children. It was our collective judgment we would mandate that States test every child under 2 years of age in America, using Medicaid, to determine the level of lead poison. This mandatory screening would limit the dangers of lead to children with the highest risk of exposure. We felt confident, because 75 percent of the highest risk children were already in Federal health care programs. 
   There was a recognition that these children were five times more likely than other children in America to be exposed to lead and to have these potential impairments because they lived in older housing and were less likely to have access to health care. The fact of the matter is that, despite 20 years of congressional good intentions and this mandatory program through Medicaid, children in America are not being protected. A recent GAO report indicates that two-thirds of children on Medicaid have never been tested for lead. Over 400,000 children with high lead in their blood are unidentified, and these children need our help. 
   Just like in the tobacco cases, and now with the gun cases, citizens are frustrated. The Congress expressed good intentions. It legislated. But there is no response. Indeed, citizens now are left with the thought of having nothing happen, or to pursue their grievances in the Federal courts. The Congress has not provided an answer. That is why Senator REED and I have introduced the Children's Lead Safe Act, S. 1120. 
   This legislation would ensure that every Federal program which serves children at risk in our country is testing them for lead. We are not asking. We are not hoping for the best. We are requiring an answer, and that every child in a Federal program today--Head Start and WIC--be involved; ensuring that we know whether or not these children have high lead levels; recognizing that every day that goes by and that every year of development of these children leaves them at risk for brain damage, developmental problems, or even death. 
   Our legislation requires that WIC and Head Start centers determine if a child has been tested. It guarantees that Medicaid contracts explicitly require health care providers to adhere to Federal rules for screening and treatment. It requires that States report to the Federal Government the number of children on Medicaid who have been tested. At long last, we will require the testing, ensure there is funding for the testing, and then finally know how many children are at risk and the nature of their risk. 
   This legislation will also ensure that States and Federal agencies have the resources. This is not a mandate without a financial alternative. Reimbursement to WIC and Head Start will be provided for screening costs; and, indeed, we go further and create a bonus program to reward States for every child screened above 65 percent of the Medicaid population. But, indeed, screening, reimbursement for screening, and mandatory screening is only part of what Senator REED and I would provide. 
   Finally, we will do this: expand Medicaid coverage to include treatment for lead poisoning. If we identify a child who has an elevated lead poisoning level, that child is given immediate treatment before brain damage, paralysis, or learning disabilities become permanent. 
   Second, we improve information on lead poisoning so parents who live in older housing in our older cities where the risk is greatest know how to identify the dangers, change the living environment, and deal with the problem. 
   We encourage the CDC to develop information-sharing guidelines to health departments, drug test labs, and official health programs. 
   These are all part of a comprehensive program to fulfill the promise that this Congress made 20 years ago to deal honestly with the problem of lead poison: Inform parents, give health care alternatives, assure that children in programs such as WIC and Head Start actually are given the screening that they know is necessary and that they deserve. 
   I hope the parents and advocacy groups which are now going to the Federal courts on the well-beaten path of tobacco advocates and gun control advocates before them can now have confidence that this Congress will not wait on the sidelines in frustration, recognizing that a program we implemented 20 years ago is not working; we are now demanding and providing the resources for a mandate that, indeed, can have meaning for the life of these children and for their parents. 
   I urge our colleagues to recognize the advantages of S. 1120. I hope Members join with Senator REED and me in offering this worthwhile and important program to deal with lead poison. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the FY 2000 Military Construction Appropriations Bill. This legislation demonstrates a considerable investment in our military's infrastructure, and a strong commitment to improving the quality of life of our soldiers that will go a long way toward achieving retention and recruiting goals. I especially thank and acknowledge the efforts of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator STEVENS, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee Senator BYRD, the chairman of the Military Construction Subcommittee, Senator BURNS, and ranking member, Senator MURRAY. 
   I am particularly pleased that the committee included $1.9 million for the Armament Software Engineering Center, ASEC, at Picatinny Arsenal in my home State of New Jersey. Throughout our Nation's history, Picatinny Arsenal has provided our men and women with the high-technology weapons that have helped achieve our military victories. The new ASEC will consolidate many of the Arsenal's operations, thus enhancing Picatinny's capability to test and upgrade ``smart'' weapons. In 1998, the Senate supported ASEC by providing funds for the initial design, but unfortunately, the Army has not yet moved forward with the project. I am pleased by the Senate's renewed support of the Center, and look foward to working with the Subcommittee and the Army to ensure that this state-of-the-art facility becomes a reality. 
   I also express my support for the committee's inclusion of $11.8 million to modernize several facilities at the United States Military Academy Preparatory School, USMAPS, at Fort Monmouth. Currently, the cadets attending USMAPs are housed in substandard facilities which have not been modernized since 1979. This funding will provide for much needed improvements that will allow USMAPS to continue training cadets for the Army and admittance into the U.S. Military Academy at West Point.  
   I am extremely pleased by the Senate's support of the ACFT/Platform Interface Lab, API Lab, at the Lakehurst Naval Air Warfare Center. The inclusion of $15.71 million for this project will allow for the consolidation of 14 labs and 5 different 40-70 year old facilities to build the new modern API lab. The consolidation of these facilities in one location will result in greater productivity and efficiency, and an increased ability for Lakehurst to fulfill its mission of ensuring our military's aircraft can take off and land safely from all Navy ships. 
   I thank the committee for supporting several projects at two other critical bases in my State. First, the $5.6 million provided for the Centralized Tactical Vehicle Wash Facility at Fort Dix will increase our ability to prepare military vehicles for missions overseas. Second, the funding for a Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Hangar, Visiting Quarters and additional units of housing at McGuire Air Force Base will improve the standard of living and increase productivity throughout the base. 
   Finally, while I am supportive of the projects included in this legislation, I look forward to working with the community to identify additional funding for another important project that was not included in the bill. This project, the National Guard Bureau Training and Training Technology Battle Lab, T3BL, at Fort Dix, will allow the Army National Guard to conduct cutting edge training through the application and use of critical training, aides, devices, simulators, and simulation. Currently, $9.5 million is needed to begin the second phase construction of the lab. 
   Mr. President, I again thank the distinguished chairman, Ranking Member BYRD, Chairman BURNS, and Ranking Member MURRAY for their commitment and attention to these important issues.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today out of concern for a provision in the Fiscal Year 2000 Energy and Water Development bill that rescinds funding for a critical flood control project being sponsored by the Hackensack Meadowlands Development Commission (HMDC) in Lyndhurst, NJ. This project first began receiving Federal funds in FY 1995, while I was still a U.S. Congressman, and is necessary to reduce damage to local areas caused by Hackensack River flooding. 
   Nearly 10 years ago, the HMDC analyzed a number of local areas which experience frequent flooding, and developed a list of improvements designed to reduce damage to the region. At my request, in FY 1995, the HMDC received $2.5 million to make this flood control project a reality, and the agency began to develop a plan to restore several drainage ditches in the area, install tidal gates and reconstruct a major dike system along the Hackensack River. 
   Regrettably, because of the Army Corps' difficulties in reaching an agreement with the local sponsor on the scope of the work, and with finding a source for the cost-share, only about $100,000 has been spent to date on this project. I understand that this year the subcommittee has targeted projects with unspent balances, and, as a result, the FY 2000 Energy and Water bill contains a rescission of $1.641 million for this initiative. 
   However, I have been informed that the local sponsor is now ready to sign a Project Cooperation Agreement and that the local cost-share is now available. As a result, I want to work closely with Chairman DOMENICI and Ranking Member REID to address the concerns about the unspent balance while ensuring that this project remains ready to move forward. 
   Again, I would like to thank Chairman DOMENICI and Ranking Member REID for their consideration and assistance with this initiative. I appreciate their personal involvement in trying to reach agreement on funding for this project, and am hopeful that by working together we can move forward in the effort to reduce flooding damage caused by the Hackensack River.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to establish the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund. This legislation will amend the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 by establishing a grant program that Marine Mammal Stranding Centers and Networks can use to support the important work they do in responding to marine mammal strandings and mortality events. 
   Since the enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972, 47 facilities nationally have been authorized to handle the rehabilitation of stranded marine mammals and over 400 individuals and facilities across the country are part of an authorized National Stranding Network that responds to strandings and deaths. 
   Mr. President, these facilities and individuals provide our country with a variety of critical services, including rescue, housing, care, rehabilitation, transport, and tracking of marine mammals and sea turtles, as well as assistance in investigating mortality events, tissue sampling, and removal of carcasses. They also work very closely with the National Marine Fisheries Service, a variety of environmental groups, and with state and local officials in rescuing, tracking and protecting marine mammals and sea turtles on the Endangered Species List. Yet they rely primarily on private donations, fundraisers, and foundation grants for their operating budgets. They receive no federal assistance, and a very few of them get some financial assistance from their states. 
   As an example, Mr. President, the Marine Mammal Stranding Center located in Brigantine in my home state of New Jersey was formed in 1978. To date, it has responded to over 1,500 calls for stranded whales, dolphins, seals and sea turtles that have washed ashore on New Jersey's beaches. It has also been called on to assist in strandings as far away as Delaware, Maryland, and Virginia. Yet, their operating budget for the past year was just under $300,000, with less than 6 percent ($17,000) coming from the state. Although the Stranding Center in Brigantine has never turned down a request for assistance with a stranding, trying to maintain that level of responsiveness and service becomes increasingly more difficult each year. 
   Virtually all the money raised by the Center, Mr. President, goes to pay for the feeding, care, and transportation of rescued marine mammals, rehabilitation (including medical care), insurance, day-to-day operation of the Center, and staff payroll. Too many times the staff are called upon to pay out-of-pocket expenses in travel, subsistence, and quarters while responding to strandings or mortality events. 
   Mr. President, this should not happen. These people are performing a great service to Americans across the country, and they are being asked to pay their own way as well. And when responding to mortality events, Mr. President, they are performing work that protects public health and helps assess the potential danger to human life and to other marine mammals. 
   I feel very strongly that we should be providing some support to the people who are doing this work. To that end, Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing would create the Marine Mammal Rescue Fund under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. It would authorize funding at $5,000,000.00, annually, over the next five years, for grants to Marine Mammal Stranding Centers and Stranding Network Members authorized by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS). Grants would not exceed $100,000.00 per year, and would require a 25 percent non-federal funding matching requirement.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last month for the first time in a generation, the Senate voted for some reasonable additions to the national gun control legislation. 
   We principally did three things of value to our country: We voted to ban the possession of assault weapons by minors; we voted to require background checks on the purchase of firearms at the 4,000 gun shows held nationally in our country; and to require that firearms come equipped with a child safety lock. 
   They were hard-won victories. Each in their own right was an important statement about our commitment to the safety of our citizens. Each represents America coming to terms with the level of gun violence in America. But it is important that they be held in some perspective, because none was particularly bold. While they make a contribution to dealing with the problem, they do not begin to end the problem. 
   Now the House of Representatives has another chance to build on the work of the Senate and respond to the needs of the American people, the desperate need to have some reasonable  levels of gun control to protect our citizens. The simple truth is that we have a great deal more to do. Every year, 34,000 Americans are victims of gun violence. Firearms are now the second leading cause of death, after car accidents, and gaining quickly. The lethal mix of guns and children is particularly disturbing. Fourteen children are dying every day from gunfire. Teenage boys are more likely to die from gunshots than all natural causes combined. It is not simply a problem. It is not enough to call it a crisis. There is an epidemic of gun violence that is consuming our citizens generally and our children in particular. 
   In truth, there are many causes. No one measure in either gun control legislation or in addressing this problem generally is going to solve the problem. Those who wait for a single answer to solve a complex societal problem will never be part of a solution. Our schools will play different roles. Our parents are learning the difficulties of raising children in a changing and complex society. 
   The media will learn new levels of individual voluntary responsibility. But, as certainly as each of those elements is a part of dealing with gun violence in America, and particularly the new problems of youth and school violence, so, too, this Congress and gun control is an element. 
   In the last 2 months the shootings in Littleton, CO, and Conyers, GA, have represented a potential historic turning point on this issue. Almost certainly, when the history of our generation is written, the events in Conyers and Littleton will be seen in the same light as the publishing of Rachel Carlson's ``Silent Spring'' is seen as the beginning of the environmental movement or the 1960s march on Washington is for civil rights. 
   It may be possible we have now reached a critical mass in this country where, as a majority of the American people have otherwise been relatively silent on this issue while a small minority seemed to control and monopolize both the national debate and the political judgments, now the balance may be changing. If, indeed, we have reached this point of change, then this Congress will respond by doing several things that are meaningful in ending gun violence: 
   First, restrict the sales of handguns to one per month. It is not unreasonable that Americans limit their consumption of handguns to one every 30 days, and it is a real contribution to dealing with this problem, because States such as my own, New Jersey, which have had reasonable gun control for 30 years, are being frustrated. Mr. President, 80 percent of the guns used to commit felonies in New Jersey are coming from five States that do not have similar gun control. Guns are being purchased wholesale in other States and taken to my State for use in the commission of a crime. Limiting purchases to one a month will prohibit it from becoming profitable for people to engage in this unseemly business. 
   Second, reinstitute the Brady waiting period. Even if we perfect the technology of an instant background check to assure that people with mental illness or felony convictions do not buy guns, a cooling off period is still valuable. In this nation, the most likely person to shoot another citizen is a member of his or her own family in a crime of passion or rage. A cooling off period to separate the rage from the purchase of the gun and the act could save thousands of lives. 
   Third, require that handguns be made with smart gun technology. We have the technology to assure that the person who fires a gun owns the gun--a thumbprint or another means of electronic identification. That technology is in hand. It can be perfected. If it is not available today, it can be available soon. It can separate criminals from guns that are being stolen out of our own houses, our own stores, and killing our own people. 
   Fourth and finally, to regulate firearms, as every other consumer product, to ensure that firearms are safely designed, built, and distributed, not only for the general public but specifically and, more importantly, for the people who are actually buying the guns. 
   Together, these four measures represent a comprehensive national policy of responding to the growing spiral of gun violence in our society. Individually, none of them will meaningfully solve the problem, but together they represent an important statement and a critical beginning, using our technology, our common sense, and our laws to protect our citizens. Ironically, they principally benefit the people who own and buy guns, who are most likely to be hurt by a gun 
   improperly made or distributed or stolen from their own home. 
   In recent months, we are recognizing that what the Federal Government is failing to do in dealing with gun violence other levels of government are doing, particularly the mayors of our cities--New Orleans, Chicago, Atlanta, Camden County in my home State, Philadelphia through Mayor Rendell--who are beginning lawsuits to hold gun manufacturers responsible for how they manufacture these guns and how they distribute them. I am proud they are doing so but not proud that the Federal Government is not part of this effort. The simple truth is, in a society in which the Federal Government regulates the content of our air, the quality of our water, virtually every measure of consumer product for its safety, its design and its content, the single exception is guns manufactured in the United States. By statute, the ATF is prohibited from engaging in the regulation of the design and distribution of firearms. 
   A toy gun is regulated for its design: The size of its parts, to protect an infant child, the contents of the materials. A toy gun is completely regulated by the Federal Government. But the actual gun, including the TEC-9 used in Columbine High School, is not. No one could rationally explain that contradiction, but it is the truth. Indeed, as I have demonstrated on this chart, a child's teddy bear is regulated for its edges, its points, small parts, hazardous materials, its flammability, but a gun--which 14 times a day takes a life--that may be in the same home, in proximity to that child is not. 
   I want to point out that in the Firearms Safety Consumer Protection Act we deal with each of these issues. I urge my colleagues to consider it and lend their support.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the FY 2000 appropriations bill. This legislation demonstrates a strong commitment to America's defense and to our ability to meet future military challenges. I especially thank and acknowledge the efforts of the distinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee and the Defense Subcommittee, Senator STEVENS, the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee, Senator BYRD, and the ranking member of the Defense Subcommittee, Senator INOUYE, for their work and support of this legislation. 
   I am particularly pleased that the committee included $1 million for exciting new technology designed to make landmine detection safer and more effective. This technology, known as nonlinear technique for landmine detection, has been developed by engineers at the Davidson Laboratory of the Stevens Institute in my home State of New Jersey. This new method for detection of mines and other buried man-made objects has been devised in such a way as to differentiate between rocks, other solids and actual landmines through acoustics. This technology will increase our ability to meet our international obligations and dramatically improve the safety and security of our armed forces. 
   I also express my support for the committee's inclusion of an additional $121 million for the production of 11 new Black Hawk helicopters. A coalition of eight companies in my state manufacture critical components for the Black Hawk, which is the Army's premier tactical transport helicopter. First produced in 1977, it is used for combat assault, combat re-supply, battlefield command and control, electronic warfare and medical evacuation. Currently, the Black Hawk is providing critical support functions for our armed services in Kosovo. This funding will ensure that our military has the ability to continue its current operations and sustain readiness for future dangers. 
   I am also extremely pleased that this legislation represents a significant increase in our commitment to the Defense Health Program. The inclusion of $175 million for the breast cancer program, and the $75 million for the prostate cancer research programs, has special significance for the constituents I represent. New Jersey's breast cancer incidence rate is among the highest in the Nation; and, more than 1,400 of the 6,900 New Jersey men diagnosed with prostate cancer die each year. I am confident that these funding initiatives will bring us much closer to finding answers for the men and women of New Jersey and nationwide, who suffer from these devastating diseases. 
   Additionally, the pay raise of almost 5 percent for all members of the military included in this bill deals with serious concerns I have had regarding quality of life and morale of our soldiers. By addressing the inequities between military pay and civilian wages, this pay raise will go a long way toward reaching our goals of retaining highly trained personnel and assist in our ability to achieve recruiting goals. 
   Finally, while I am supportive of these important components of this legislation, I am extremely concerned with the committee's recommendation that the Army and the Marine Corps develop a plan to include the Rock Island Arsenal in all aspects of howitzer development, design, and production for the Lightweight 155mm. 
   Currently, critical research and development functions for the howitzer take place under the U.S. Army Tank-automotive and Armaments Command, Armament Research, Development and Engineering Center at Picatinny Arsenal, NJ. The howitzer, as well as other important military systems, require sophisticated software which may only be fielded by Picatinny Arsenal. If the committee's proposal is implemented, I fear that Rock Island Arsenal will ultimately assume important research and development responsibilities for the howitzer for which they have never before played a role and may be unqualified to preform. I encourage the committee to strongly consider these concerns which have similarly been expressed by the Army and Marine Corps. 
   Mr. President, I again thank Chairman STEVENS, Ranking Member BYRD, and Ranking Member INOUYE for their commitment and attention to these important issues.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation authorizing funding for extended school day and extended school year programs across the country. The continuing gap between American students and those in other countries, combined with the growing needs of working and the growing popularity of extending both  the school day and the school year, have made this educational option a valuable one for many school districts. 
   Students in the United States currently attend school an average of only 180 days per year, compared to 220 days in Japan, and 222 days in both Korea and Taiwan. American students also receive fewer hours of formal instruction per year compared to their counterparts in Taiwan, France, and Germany. We cannot expect our students to remain competitive with those in other industrialized countries if they must learn the same amount of information in less time. 
   Our school calendar is based on a no longer relevant agricultural cycle that existed when most American families lived in rural areas and depended on their farms for survival. The long summer vacation allowed children to help their parents work in the fields. Today, summer is a time for vacations, summer camps, and part-time jobs. Young people can certainly learn a great deal at summer camp, and a job gives them maturity and confidence. However, more time in school would provide the same opportunities while helping students remain competitive with those in other countries. As we debate the need to bring in skilled workers from other countries, the need to improve our system of education has become increasingly important. 
   In 1994, the Commission on Time and Learning recommended keeping schools open longer in order to meet the needs of both children and communities, and the growing popularity of extended-day programs is significant. Between 1987 and 1993, the availability of extended-day programs in public elementary schools has almost doubled. While school systems have begun to respond to the demand for lengthening the school day, the need for more widespread implementation still exists. Extended-day programs are much more common in private schools than public schools, and only 18 percent of rural schools have reported an extended-day program. 
   This bill would authorize $25 million per year over the next five years for the Department of Education to administer a demonstration grant program. Local education agencies would then be able to conduct a variety of longer school day and school year programs, such as extending the school year, studying the feasibility of extending the school day, and implementing strategies to maximize the quality of extended core learning time. 
   The constant changes in technology, and greater international competition, have increased the pressure on American students to meet these challenges. Providing the funding for programs to lengthen the school day and school year would leave American students better prepared to meet the challenges facing them in the next century.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Teacher Quality Enhancement and Incentive Act. I rise to focus the nation's attention on the potentially critical shortage of school teachers we will be facing in upcoming years. While K-12 enrollments are steadily increasing the teacher population is aging. There is a need, now more than ever, to attract competent, capable, and bright college graduates or mid-career professionals to the teaching profession. 
   The Department of Education projects that 2 million new teachers will have to be hired in the next decade. Shortage, if they occur, will most likely be felt in urban or rural regions of the country where working conditions may be difficult or compensation low. We cannot create a high quality learning environment for our students if they are forced into over-crowded classrooms with under-qualified instructors. If our students are to receive a high quality education and remain competitive in the global market we must attract talented and motivated people to the teaching profession in large numbers. 
   Law firms, technology firms, and many other industries typically offer signing bonuses in order to attract the best possible candidates to their organizations. Part of making the teaching profession competitive with the private sector is to match these institutional perks. 
   This bill would authorize $15 million per year over the next five years for the Department of Education to award grants to local educational agencies (LEAs) for the purpose of attracting highly qualified individuals to teaching. These grants will enable LEAs in high poverty and rural areas to award new teachers a $15,000 tax free salary bonus, spread over their first two years of employment, over and above their regular starting salary. These bonuses will attract teachers to districts where they are most needed. 
   On an annual basis, LEAs will use competitive criteria to select the best and brightest teaching candidates based on objective measures, including test scores, grade point average or class rank and such other criteria as each LEA may determine. The number of bonuses awarded depends upon the number of students enrolled in the LEA. 
   Teachers who receive the bonus will be required to teach in low income or rural areas for a minimum of four years. If they fail to work the four year minimum they will be required to repay the bonus they received. 
   By making this funding available. America's schools will better be able to compete with businesses for the best and brightest college graduates. These new teachers will, in turn, produce better students and lower the risk of a possible teacher shortage. With arguably the most successful economy of  any nation in history, we should be doing more to make teaching an attractive career alternative for qualified and motivated individuals. The Teacher Quality Enhancement and Incentive Act will be an excellent first step.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. Joseph A. Klingler as he retires after 36 years of service to the students and families of my hometown, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey. He served as a teacher, a principal, a mentor, and a leader in the educational field. 
   Throughout his thirty-one years, Dr. Klingler has shown unparalleled support and caring for his pupils. He provided each school he taught at with a unique personality that demonstrates caring, respect, interest in others, and academic challenge. He always encouraged his students to take an active role in school, whether academically, athletically, or through community activities. Because of his encouragement, staff members applied for mini-grants which contributed to the success of several middle school activities such as the Show Choir, FAYM, and the Drama Club. Dr. Klingler understands the importance of parents becoming involved in their children's school and has formed a close alliance with the PTA. 
   Dr. Klingler shaped our definition of a middle school, with mission statements, team concepts, and quality programs. He was active in local and national education associations. He chaired the FLOW area Regional Education Council several times, and participated in the national program for evaluating elementary schools. He is a member of Phi Delta Kappa, the National Professional Educational Fraternity, the American Association of School Administrators, the National Association of Elementary School Principals, the New Jersey Principals and Supervisors Association, and the National Mathematics Teachers Association.  
   Dr. Klingler has served as a role model for community activities, coaching baseball in the local recreation program, volunteering at the Bergen Community Regional Blood Center, participating in the Environmental Commission Clean-Up Day, and chairing the Franklin Lakes Juvenile Committee. He encouraged his students to take an active role in their community. 
   As one of his former students I was directly influenced by his teaching and leadership. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Dr. Klingler for his years of service to all his students in Franklin Lakes. He will be dearly missed, but I am certain that the values he instilled in his students will live on.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise with Senator REED to introduce legislation that will ensure that children enrolled in federal health care programs receive screening and appropriate care for lead poisoning. Our bill, the ``Children's Lead SAFE Act of 1999'' would go a long way to eliminate childhood lead poisoning. 
   We know lead exposure is one of the most dangerous health hazards for young children because their nervous systems are still developing. Lead poisoning in children causes damage to the brain and nervous systems, which leads to IQ loss, impaired physical development and behavioral problems. High levels of exposure can cause comas, convulsions, and even death. 
   Despite our success over the past twenty years to reduce lead poisoning in the U.S., it continues to be the number one environmental health threat to children, with nearly one million preschoolers affected. Poor and minority children are most at-risk because of diet and exposure to environmental hazards such as old housing. These children frequently live in older housing which contains cracked or chipped lead paint, where children primarily contract lead poisoning by ingesting paint chips or lead dust. 
   Mr. President, 75 percent of At-Risk children are enrolled in federal health care programs. Kids in these programs are five times more likely to have high blood levels. In 1992, Congress instructed Health Care Financing Adm. (HCFA) to require States to lead screen Medicaid children under the age of two. Despite this, the GAO report shows that mandatory screening isn't happening. Two-thirds of Medicaid children have never been screened (as required). And only 20 percent of all children in federal programs have been screened. 
   In fact, only half the States have screening policies consistent with federal law. In my own state of New Jersey, the GAO report showed that only 39 percent of Medicaid children have been screened. Despite federal requirements, for whatever reason--insufficient outreach, lax government oversight or parental ignorance, too many kids are not getting screened. 
   The Children's Lead SAFE Act would address this problem by establishing clear and consistent standards for screening and treatment and by involving all relevant federal health programs in this battle. Our legislation is modeled on the recommendations made by the GAO. 
   It requires all federal programs serving at-risk kids to be involved in screening. It requires State Medicaid contracts to explicitly require providers (HMO's) to follow federal rules for screening and treatment. It expands Medicaid coverage to include treatment services and environmental investigations to determine the source of the poisoning. WIC centers (with 12 percent of the at-risk population) will be required to assess whether a child has been screened and if they have not to provide the necessary referral and follow-up to ensure that screening occurs. Head Start facilities would similarly have the responsibility for ensuring that their children are screened. 
   In addition, our legislation would improve data so we can identify problems and use that information to educate providers about the extent of the problem. CDC would develop information-sharing guidelines for State and local health departments, the labs that perform the test and federal programs. It would also require each State to report on the percent of the Medicaid population they are screening. 
   Finally, our legislation would make sure agencies have sufficient resources to do screening by reimbursing WIC and Head Start for costs they incur in screening. The legislation would also create a bonus program whereby a state will receive a per child bonus for every child it screens above 65 percent of its Medicaid population. 
   Mr. President, the health and safety of our children would be greatly enhanced with the passage of this important legislation. Childhood lead poisoning is easily preventable, and there is no excuse for not properly screening and providing care to our kids. Our bill would accomplish this and ensure adequate care. I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing this problem and supporting its solution.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1999 along with my colleague from Maine, Senator SNOWE. 
   Osteoporosis and other related bone diseases pose a major public health threat. More than 28 million Americans, 80 percent of whom are women, suffer from, or are at risk for, osteoporosis. Between three and four million Americans suffer from related bone diseases like Paget's disease or osteogenesis imperfecta. Today, in the United States, 10 million individuals already have osteoporosis and 18 million more have low bone mass, placing them at increased risk. 
   Osteoporosis is often called the ``silent disease'' because bone loss occurs without symptoms. People often do not know they have osteoporosis until their bones become so weak that a sudden bump or fall causes a fracture or a vertebra to collapse. Every year, there are 1.5 million bone fractures caused by osteoporosis. Half of all women, and one-eighth of all men, age 50 or older, will suffer a bone fracture due to osteoporosis. 
   Osteoporosis is a progressive condition that has no known cure; thus, prevention and treatment are key. The Early Detection and Prevention of Osteoporosis and Related Bone Diseases Act of 1999 seeks to combat osteoporosis, and related bone diseases like Paget's disease by requiring private health plans to cover bone mass measurement tests for qualified individuals who are at risk for developing osteoporosis. 
   Bone mass measurement is the only reliable method of detecting osteoporosis in its early stages. The test is non-invasive and painless and is as predictive of future fractures as high cholesterol or high blood pressure is of heart disease or stroke. This provision is similar to a provision in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 that requires Medicare coverage of bone mass measurements. 
   Medical experts agree that osteoporosis is preventable. Thus, if the toll of osteoporosis and other related bone diseases is to be reduced, the commitment to prevention and treatment must be significantly increased. 
   Last year, Congress reauthorized the Women's Health Research and Prevention Act. This legislation authorized $3 million for a national resource center to increase public knowledge and awareness of osteoporosis, and $40 million for osteoporosis research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). This was an important first step in the fight against osteoporosis. Congress must now maintain its commitment to prevention by ensuring women have access to bone mass measurement tests.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will improve the lives of 30,000 Americans, 850 of whom live in my State of New Jersey, who are stricken with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). 
   Many of us know Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) as the disease that struck down the famed Yankees 1st baseman, Lou Gehrig, yet, few of us are aware of the tragic effects ALS has on its victims. Fewer still are aware of the inherent flaws in the Medicare program which further compound the suffering of those with ALS. 
   Despite the short life expectancy of three to five years, ALS patents must endure a two year waiting period in order to receive Medicare services. Forcing ALS patients to wait until the final months of their illness defies common sense and human decency. In fact, as a result of the Medicare waiting period, approximately 17,000 ALS patients remain ineligible for Medicare services right now, regardless of the severity of their condition. 
   My bill, the ALS Treatment, and Assistance Act waives the 24-month Medicare waiting period for ALS patients. A similar waiver is granted for victims of end-stage renal disease due to the rapid onset of symptoms. The immediacy of symptoms in ALS patients and extremely short life expectancy illustrate the need to extend the waiver for ALS. In addition, many ALS victims have had productive lives and will have paid into the Social Security system well before the onset of ALS. 
   The legislation also requires Medicare to provide coverage for all FDA-approved drugs that treat ALS. While Medicare typically does not provide coverage for prescription drug therapies, over the past few years, exceptions have been granted to provide drug coverage to treat osteoporosis and certain types of cancer. Due to the rapid onset of symptoms and the short life expectancy of ALS patients, the need for another exception is clear. In addition, expanding Medicare coverage for ALS therapies will stimulate further research. 
   ALS is a disease that strikes at every community, with the potential for striking every American. No one is immune, and everyone is vulnerable. I am pleased to be joined by my colleague Senator WELLSTONE in introducing legislation that represents a first real step toward improving the quality of life for people with ALS while bringing us much closer to finding a cause and a cure.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, along with my colleagues from New York and Illinois, Senator SCHUMER and Senator DURBIN, to introduce the Gun Kingpin Penalty Act of 1999. In introducing this bill, we hope that our colleagues will soon join us in sending a clear and strong signal to gunrunners--your actions will no longer be tolerated. 
   Mr. President, recent numbers gathered by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms clearly demonstrate what many of us already knew all too well--several of our nation's highways have become pipelines for merchants of death who deal in illegal firearms. 
   My own State of New Jersey is proud to have some of the toughest gun control laws in the nation. But for far too long, the courageous efforts of New Jersey citizens in enacting these tough laws have been weakened by out of state gunrunners who treat our State like their own personal retail outlet. 
   We learned from the ATF data that in 1996, New Jersey exported fewer guns used in crimes, per capita, than any other state--less than one gun per 100,000 residents, or 75 total guns. Meanwhile, an incredible number of guns used to commit crimes in New Jersey last year came from out of state--944 guns were imported and used to commit crimes compared to only 75 exported--a net import of 869 illegal guns used to commit crimes against the people of New Jersey. 
   This represents a one way street--guns come from states with lax gun laws straight to states (like New Jersey) with strong laws. It is clear that New Jersey's strong gun control laws offer criminals little choice but to import their guns from states with weak laws. We must act on a federal level to send a clear message that this cannot continue and will not be tolerated.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, on the morning of April 19, 1995, in one horrible moment, an explosion devastated the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and took the lives of 168 Americans. 
   Every year, thousands of people are killed or maimed because of the use or misuse of illegal explosive devices, and millions of dollars in property is lost. Between 1991 and 1995, there were more than 14,000 actual and attempted criminal bombings. 326 people were killed and another 2,970 injured in these incidents and more than $6 million in property damage resulted. 
   In recent years, the criminal use of explosives has moved in a new direction, as is evidenced by the bombings of the World Trade Center in New York and the Oklahoma City bombing. These two incidents took the lives of many innocent men, women, and children, left others permanently scarred, and caused great suffering for the families of the victims--as well as all of America. These crimes were intended to tear the very fabric of our society; instead, their tragic consequences served to strengthen our resolve to stand firm against the insanity of terrorism and the criminal use of explosives. 
   In the wake of the Oklahoma City bombing, I was stunned--as were many--to learn how few restrictions on the use and sale of explosives really exist. I soon after introduced this legislation, the ``Explosives Protection Act'' to take a first step towards protecting the American people from those who would use explosives to do them harm. I am introducing it again today in the hope that this bill will, in some small way, prevent future bombings--whether by terrorists of symbolic targets, malcontents of random ones, or even spouses involved in marital disputes. 
   While we have increasingly restricted the number of people who can obtain and use a firearm, we have been lax in extending these prohibitions to explosives. For instance, while we prohibit illegal aliens from obtaining a gun, we allow them to obtain explosives without restriction. And someone who has been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces can no longer buy a gun, but can purchase a truckload full of explosives. The same is true for people who have renounced U.S. citizenship, people who have acted in such a way as to have restraining orders issued against them, and those with domestic violence convictions. 
   Each of these categories of persons are prohibited from obtaining firearms, but face no such prohibition on obtaining explosive material. Many of these differences in the law are simply oversights--Congress has often acted to limit the use and sale of firearms, and has neglected to bring explosives law into line. And in so doing, we have made it all too easy for many of the most dangerous or least accountable members of society to obtain materials which can result in an equal or even greater loss of life. 
   Congress has already made the determination that certain members of society should not have access to firearms, and the same logic clearly applies to dangerous and destructive explosive materials. It is time to bring explosives laws into line with gun laws. My bill would simply expand the list of people prohibited from purchasing explosives so that it mirrors the list of people already prohibited from purchasing firearms.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today I rise today to introduce the ``Neighborhood Watch Partnership Act of 1999.'' This bill will broaden the eligibility of groups that may apply for essential funding for neighborhood watch activities. 
   Communities across the country are finding sensible ways to solve local problems. Through partnerships with local police, neighborhood watch groups are having a decisive impact on crime. There are almost 20,000 such groups creating innovative programs that promote community involvement in crime prevention techniques. They empower community members and organize them against rape, burglary, and all forms of fear on the street. They forge bonds between law enforcement and the communities they serve. 
   Unfortunately, many communities find it difficult to afford the often expensive equipment such as cellphones and CBs needed to start a neighborhood watch organization. While the COPS program within the Department of Justice provides funding for some neighborhood watch groups, an organization must incorporate to benefit from the current program. A mere 2000 of the nearly 20,000 groups incorporate, however, meaning that the vast majority of watch groups cannot apply for funding assistance. This makes very little sense. 
   The time has come to make a clear commitment to these groups. That is why I am introducing a bill to extend COPS funding to unincorporated neighborhood watch organizations. The bill would provide grants of up to $1,950 to these groups. Under current law, either the local police chief or sheriff must  approve grant requests by unincorporated watch groups. We would impose the same requirement on unincorporated groups, thus providing accountability for the disbursement of funds.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the ``Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act of 1999.'' This bill will begin the process of reforming the revered but antiquated system of bail enforcement in this country. 
   Throughout our nation's proud history, bounty hunters have proved a valuable addition to our law enforcement and recovery efforts. About 40 percent of all criminal defendants are released on bail each year, and in 1996 alone more than 33,000 skipped town. Police departments, no matter how efficient or determined, cannot be expected to deal with so many bail jumpers in addition to their other duties. Thus, while public law enforcement officers recover only about 10 percent of defendants who skip town, bounty hunters catch an incredible 88 percent of bail jumpers. 
   Because of the special, contractual nature of the relationship between bail bondsmen and those who use them to get out of jail, bounty hunters have traditionally enjoyed special rights--a nineteenth century Supreme Court case affirmed that while bounty hunters may exercise many of the powers granted to police, they are not subject to many of the constitutional checks we place on those law enforcement officials. As a result, bounty hunters need not worry about Miranda rights, extradition proceedings, or search warrants. 
   The ability to more efficiently track and recover criminal defendants serves a valuable purpose in our society. But the lack of constitutional checks on bounty hunters also opens the system up to the risk of abuse. Each of us has read or heard about cases in which legitimate bounty hunters or those simply posing as recovery agents have wrongfully entered a dwelling or captured the wrong person. 
   In one recent Arizona case, several men claiming to be bounty hunters broke into a house, terrorized a family and ended up killing a young couple who tried to defend against the attack. It now appears that these men were simply ``posing'' as bounty hunters, but there are other reported incidents in which ``legitimate'' bounty hunters have broken down the wrong door, kidnaped the wrong person, or physically abused the targets of their searches. And there is little recourse for the innocent victims of wrongful acts. 
   This legislaiton would begin the process of making bounty hunters more accountable to the public they serve, and would help to restore confidence in the bail enforcement system. The bill would not unduly impose the will of the federal government on states, which have traditionally regulated bounty hunters. 
   The ``Bounty Hunter Accountability and Quality Assurance Act'' directs the Attorney General of the United States to establish model guidelines for states to follow when creating their own bail enforcement regulations. In the course of her work, the Attorney General will be specifcially directed to look into three areas identified by the bill--whether bounty hunters should be required to ``knock and announce'' before entering a dwelling, whether they should be required to carry liability insurance (most already do), and whether convicted felons should be allowed to obtain employment as bounty hunters. 
   Mr. President, it is time to start the process of making rouge bounty hunters more accountable, while at the same time restoring America's confidence in the long tradition of bail enforcement that dates from the earliest days of this nation. I urge my colleagues to join me in taking this first step toward this process.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator from California for yielding. 
   Mr. President, all of us, after Littleton, grieved together. I believe all of those prayers and condolences were sincere. But we also pledged to finally take the issue of gun violence and young people in America seriously. Those pledges may not have been as sincere. 
   It was my hope in this debate that we would deal with some very fundamental issues--restricting the ability to buy handguns to one a month; stopping the wholesale transfer of these guns into our cities and small towns in States like my own of New Jersey. 
   I hoped we would extend the Brady period to give a cooling off period to people who buy these weapons. I hoped to regulate firearms like any other consumer product. 
   We decided not to do these things because we wanted to meet our opponents, those who are advocates for the gun lobby, halfway. So we restricted ourselves to the most reasonable, the least controversial. It might have been a mistake, because even those commonsense initiatives, which I think most Americans would subscribe to, are not succeeding. 
   Yesterday, this Senate failed in an effort to restrict sales at gun shows without background checks--4,000 gun shows that operate outside of the current checks for mental illness and previous legal convictions. Now we return again with another provision that should be equally noncontroversial. Most people in America wouldn't believe this provision is necessary. I would have a hard time convincing most people in New Jersey that this amendment is required, because most people would believe it was already law: That an 18- or 19-year-old can buy an assault rifle; that any child can buy a rifle or shotgun, including assault rifles such as the infamous street-sweeper; that any youth 18 to 21 can privately buy an assault pistol such as the TEC-9 used in Littleton. 
   Our country has recognized that there is an age of maturity to drive an automobile. We recognize there is an appropriate age of maturity to consume alcohol, to exercise the right to vote--the basic sovereignty of our people. Yet, with the power to take a human life by the exercise of the extraordinary power in these weapons, young people like those in Littleton who consumed so many lives operate without restrictions. 
   I believe those who responded to the massacre in Littleton were sincere in wanting to deal with this problem. But it requires more than words. It requires the one area of political life that I most admire and is in the shortest supply in our country--courage--the courage to go to those few advocates who believe they are so right and their privileges are so important that the larger good of the public must be compromised. I suggest to them they must compromise for the sake of the Nation. 
   That is the moment in which we now find ourselves. Senator FEINSTEIN has offered an amendment that would interfere with the rights of no parents who want to teach their child to use a firearm responsibly or want to have a firearm in their home. It deals only with that class of weapons for which there is no hunting purpose, no legitimate function for which any teenager in any school of America should want to own an assault rifle or a multibullet clip. That is all we deal with. Inexplicably, I do not know if we will succeed. 
   Last year, we lost over 3,500 young people to gunfire; 3,500 deaths. This is no perfect answer. It will not eliminate all of those deaths. It may not eliminate a majority of those deaths. But no one on this Senate floor can credibly argue that with the adoption of the Feinstein amendment some lives will not be saved; that the chances of a Littleton are not measurably reduced. 
   The Senate has a choice. Senator ASHCROFT has also offered an amendment and it would also restrict to minors access to some of these weapons.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I thank the Senator for yielding an additional minute. 
   But only the Feinstein amendment offers not only restricting this class of weapon to young people, but also closes the loophole that allows these multibullet clips that allow the rage of a child who would take a single life to destroy a school, an entire group of people--to commit a mass murder. 
   I do not argue this alone will stop these tragedies. No one here can argue that any one formula, any one idea will eliminate this problem. But I will tell you this, Senator FEINSTEIN has the one proposal that can address the rage, the inexplicable rage that must be dealt with--by families and schools and churches and synagogues, exploding on  such a level--by taking both these weapons of mass destruction and these multibullet clips out of circulation. 
   I congratulate her for her amendment. I ask the Senate, with all the rage you felt after Littleton, with all the conviction you felt to solve this problem, and all the compassion you felt for those children, have that strength, that courage and that conviction now. For once, at long last, let's take a stand and cast a vote so, as the years pass, we will have real pride that we made some contribution. Just as we ask those parents, those schools, those churches, those synagogues to play their role and be part of this solution, let the Senate be part of this solution, too. 
   I yield the floor.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators BOXER, FEINSTEIN, KERRY (Ma.), LAUTENBERG and I rise to introduce legislation to end the use of the conventional steel-jawed leghold trap. I rise to draw this country's attention to the many liabilities of this outdated device and ask for my colleagues support in ending its use. 
   While this bill does not prohibit trapping, it does outlaw a particularly savage method of trapping by prohibiting the import or export of, and the interstate shipment of conventional steel-jawed leghold traps and articles of fur from animals caught in such traps. 
   The conventional steel-jawed leghold trap is a cruel and antiquated device for which many alternatives exist. The American Veterinary Medical Association and the American Animal Hospital Association have condemned leghold traps as ``inhumane'' and the majority of Americans oppose the use of this class of trap. California became the fourth state in recent years to pass a statewide ballot initiative to ban steel-jawed leghold traps--Arizona, Colorado, and Massachusetts are the other three states to have decided the issue by a direct vote of the people. A number of other states, including Florida, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, have legislative or administrative bans on these devices. In addition, 88 nations have banned their use. 
   This important and timely issue now takes on added importance as the United States and the European Union (E.U.) recently reached an agreement to implement humane trapping standards. This agreement requires the U.S. to phase out leghold traps. Without this agreement, the E.U. would have prohibited the importation of U.S. fur from thirteen species commonly captured with leghold traps. Adoption of my legislation will fulfill the U.S. obligation to the E.U. and reduce tremendous and unnecessary suffering of animals. By ending the use of the conventional steel-jawed leghold trap within our borders, we will effectively set a humane standard for trapping, as well as protect the U.S. fur industry by keeping Europe's doors open to U.S. fur. 
   One quarter of all U.S. fur exports, $44 million, go to the European market. Of this $44 million, $21 million would be eliminated by the ban. This would clearly cause considerable economic damage to the U.S. fur industry, an important source of employment for many Americans. Since many Americans rely on trapping for their livelihood, it is imperative to find a solution which prevents the considerable damage that this ban would cause to our fur industry. It is important to note that since the steel-jawed leghold trap has been banned in Europe, alternatives have been provided to protect and maintain the European fur industry. 
   Our nation would be far better served by ending the use of the archaic and inhumane steel-jawed leghold trap. By doing so, we are not only setting a long-overdue humane standard for trapping, we are ensuring that the European market remains open to all American fur exports.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Young Women's Christian Association of Trenton, New Jersey, and their Tenth Annual ``Celebration of Women'' luncheon which will honor and recognize six award recipients for their outstanding contributions to the community. 
   The YWCA of Trenton was established in 1904 with its primary mission to provide a residence and recreational activities for women in the work force during the industrial revolution. Since this beginning, the Board of Directors and staff have developed the YWCA into community based organization committed to the empowerment of women and girls and to erase racism through diverse activities and programs. The YWCA provides leadership training, public advocacy, education, support services, health promotions and recreation within the city of Trenton and the surrounding communities. 
   The awards given have become a distinguished tradition in the New Jersey capital region since they were first introduced years ago as the Tribute to Women in Industry, or TWIN, awards. The recipients of this year's award embody the mission of the YWCA. 
   Eileen Thorton will receive the Woman of Achievement Award given to a woman who has achieved distinction in her field while using her power to encourage opportunity. J. Dolores Baker is this year's recipient of the Woman of Inspiration Award presented to a woman who has overcome insurmountable odds. Molly Merlino will receive the Meta Griffith Community Service Award, named after the prominent civic leader. This award is given to a woman who has effectively recognized and addressed community needs through exemplary volunteer service. Gwendolyn I. Long will be the recipient of the Ethel Downing Johnson Memorial Award, named in honor of a YWCA board member who died in 1992. The woman who receives this award has demonstrated an earnest and sincere commitment to mission and purpose of the YWCA. Cotempo Press is the recipient of the Organizational Commitment Award, presented to an organization or corporation which has provided innovative corporate policies and company attitudes enabling women to excel in the workplace. The Artist of the Year award will be given to Carl McClease whose piece, titled ``Trio Sublime,'' will become a permanent exhibit at the YWCA. 
   Each of these individuals have distinguished themselves this year in their chosen fields. They have made the city of Trenton and the State of New Jersey. I am pleased to recognize the YWCA of Trenton and the six award recipients for their continuing commitment to the people of New Jersey.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Mayor Gerald A. Calabrese of Cliffside Park, New Jersey as he is honored for a lifetime of distinguished service to the citizens of his community, county, and state by the Temple Israel Community Center, celebrating its 75th anniversary. 
   Gerry began his career in public service by enlisting in the Navy and serving his country during World War II. After returning to the United States, Gerry turned his focus to education and entered St. John's University where he was chosen as an All-American for basketball. Upon graduation, he continued playing basketball in the National Basketball Association for the Syracuse Nationals. 
   Gerry retired from his sports career and was quick to enter into public service as he was elected to the Cliffside Park Borough Council in 1955. In 1959, Gerry was elected to his first term as the mayor of Cliffside Park, a post he has retained for the past forty years. During his tenure, Gerry has been always ready and willing to meet with his constituents and listen to their concerns. He has raised the bar in constituent services, as he has always been ready and willing to help those in need. Continuing in this vein, Gerry served on the Bergen County Board of Freeholders from 1975 to 1985, as Bergen County Democratic Chairman from 1991 to 1998, the New Jersey Delegation to the National Democratic Convention in 1988 and 1992, on the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities from 1960 to 1987, and on the 1992 New Jersey Congressional Re-Districting Committee. 
   Gerry Calabrese is respected by all in and around his community and his activities extend beyond his public service career. He is a life member of the PBA Local 96, N.J. State Association of Chiefs of Police, Cliffside Park Little League, Polish American Democratic Club. Hackensack Unico and Cliffside Park B'nai B'rith named him ``Man of the Year.'' 
   Mayor Calabrese is a legendary public servant in New Jersey and is most deserving of this distinguished honor. I am proud to recognize Gerry and his many years of distinguished service.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, last week the sense of security that Americans had in their own communities, our sense of the strength of our culture, our ability to protect our families and our homes, was once again shattered. 
   The challenge did not come from Kosovo, and it was not from a computer problem with the new millennium. It was from the most basic form of human violence, striking us where we are most vulnerable, and taking the life of a child. 
   James Agee once wrote that in every child who is born, no matter what circumstances or without regard to their parents, the potentiality of the human race is born again. It may be because of the sense we possess that our own renewal is in the life of our children that the death of a child shakes us so dramatically. Rarely have we seen an America more traumatized by individual acts of violence than as a result of the murders in Littleton, CO. 
   All of us recognize that there is no one answer, no one explanation for this tragedy. The answer lies in the strengths of our families, the responsibility of parents, the roles of school administrators and parents and local police. Almost every critic has a point; virtually none has a complete answer. 
   The increasing level of violence in the entertainment industry, the new use of technologies which have sanitized the very concepts of death and murder, the failure of role models, the growing isolation of children from parents and siblings and extended families--all critics are right; no criticism is complete. 
   But in this constellation of problems there is the persistent issue of access to guns in American society. Only a few years ago, when a similar tragedy rocked the United Kingdom, the British Parliament responded in days. A gunman killed 16 students in Dunblane, Scotland. The Parliament was outraged. The British people responded. And the private ownership of high-caliber handguns was not regulated or controlled; it was banned. 
   This Congress can rightfully cite a variety of challenges to the American people to ensure that Littleton never occurs 
   again, though, indeed, we failed to do so after Jonesboro, Paducah, Springfield, and a variety of other cities and schools that had similar tragedies. 
   Now the question is, Do we visit upon this tragedy the same silence as after those other school shootings, or do we have the same courage the British Parliament exhibited 3 years ago in dealing with this problem? 
   The amount of death that this Congress is prepared to witness before we deal realistically with the problems of guns in America defies comprehension. Last year, 34,000 Americans were victims of gun violence. But the year before and the year before that, for a whole generation, the carnage has been similar. Every year, 1,500 people die from accidental shootings. Every 6 hours, another child in America commits suicide with a gun. No gun control can eliminate all of this violence. I do not believe any gun control can eliminate a majority of this violence. But no one can credibly argue that some reasonable gun control cannot stop some of this violence. 
   I am heartened that the majority leader has promised the Senate that within a matter of weeks there will be a debate on this floor and an opportunity to present some reasonable forms of additional gun control. At a minimum, this should include the question of parental responsibility for children who get access to guns. Where parents have knowledge or facilitate that purchase, they must bear some responsibility for the likely, in some cases inevitable, consequences of minors having those weapons. 
   Second, there is the question of whether or not minors should be able to purchase certain weapons at all. It is arguable that a minor should not be able to purchase a handgun. It is irrefutable, in my judgment, that a minor should not be able to purchase a semiautomatic weapon. 
   Third, the question of whether, through the new technologies of the Internet, it is appropriate that guns be sold or purchased in any form; if it is not an invitation to violate and avoid existing State and Federal laws; if a person does not have to present themselves in a retail establishment with credentials to purchase a weapon. Remote sales, in my judgment, should not be allowed. 
   Then there is the larger question of the regulation of all weapons through the Federal Government--whether, when we live in a society where everything from an automobile to a child's teddy bear has regulations on their designs and materials to ensure safety, that same regulatory scheme should not be used for weapons; whether a weapon is designed properly to assure its safety; whether its materials are the best possible; whether technology is being used to ensure that the gun is used properly. 
   One can envision that the Treasury Department or another Federal agency would require gun manufacturers to have safety locks so that children could not misuse them. Future technology may allow a thumbprint to ensure that only the owner of the gun is using the gun. More basic technologies might require better materials or that a gun does not misfire when it is dropped. Proper regulations might ensure how these guns are sold, to ensure that they are sold properly, that State gun laws are not being evaded by oversupplying stores on State borders with permissive laws so that they are sold into States with restrictive laws. Inevitably this must be part of the debate: the proper Federal role in ensuring the proper design and 
   distribution and sale of these weapons. 
   I am grateful, Mr. President, that the majority leader has invited the Senate to participate in this debate; proud, if the Senate responds to the challenge. 
   There were so many prayers throughout this country for the victims of the shooting in Littleton, sincere prayers on the floor of the Senate. The victims and their families and traumatized Americans need our prayers, but they need more than our prayers. They need the courage that comes from a people who recognize that change is both possible and required to avoid these tragedies from repeating themselves. 
   The victims of Littleton will be grateful for our prayers, but they will curse our inaction if political intimidation, the fear of change, results in the Senate offering nothing but prayers. This Senate has a responsibility to respond. We know what needs to get done. The President of the United States has challenged us. Americans are waiting and watching. 
   Every Senator must use these next few weeks to think about how they will vote, searching their own consciences on how they will answer their constituents, their families, and themselves, if Littleton becomes one more town in a litany of forgotten schools, forgotten children, and a rising spiral of carnage. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Early Treatment for HIV Act. In recent years, exciting scientific breakthroughs have led to an improved understanding of AIDS and provided powerful new treatments for Americans living with HIV disease. Commonly known as the protease cocktail, these drugs have helped transform HIV into a manageable chronic disease. To be most effective, the medical community and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommends the use of these treatments early in the course HIV infection, before the onset of symptoms. Tragically though, the high cost of these drugs means that only those of significant financial means have access to them. 
   In another tragic irony, vulnerable low-income HIV-positive Americans cannot receive AIDS-preventing drugs under the Medicaid program until they develop full blown AIDS. By that time, their preventive value has greatly diminished. To correct this glaring flaw in the Medicaid program, the Early Treatment for HIV Act will ensure that HIV positive, low income patients, will be eligible for medical services immediately. 
   The benefits of this legislation are overwhelming. A report released at the 12th World AIDS Conference in Geneva found that treatment for HIV early in the course of the disease is both medically and economically effective. Another report by the University of California found that expanding Medicaid to provide wider access to HIV therapies would prevent thousands of deaths and AIDS diagnoses, leading to 14,500 more years of life for persons living with HIV disease over five years. 
   In terms of economic savings, several recent studies have found that money spent ``up front'' on medications are offset by later savings on hospitalizations and other expensive care and treatments for AIDS-related illnesses. A report by the Medical Associates of Los Angeles found that each dollar spent on combination drugs therapies resulted in at least two dollars of savings and overall treatment costs. 
   Mr. President, the Early Treatment for HIV Act will help thousands of low-income people with HIV live longer, more fulfilling lives by allowing them to overcome the financial barriers to effective medical treatments.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senators MACK, GREGG, GRAHAM, MOYNIHAN, KERRY, BOXER, REED, FEINSTEIN, MURRAY, and I are introducing the National Estuary Conservation Act of 1999. I rise to draw this country's attention to our nationally significant estuaries that are threatened by pollution, development, or  overuse. With forty five percent of the nation's population residing in estuarine areas, there is a compelling need for us to promote comprehensive planning and management efforts to restore and protect them. 
   Estuaries are significant habitat for fish, birds, and other wildlife because they provide safe spawning grounds and nurseries. Seventy five percent of the U.S. commercial fish catch depends on estuaries during some stage of their life. Commercial and recreational fisheries contribute $111 billion to the nation's economy and support 1.5 million jobs. Estuaries are also important to our nation's tourist economy for boating and outdoor recreation. Coastal tourism in just four states--New Jersey, Florida, Texas, and California--totals $75 billion. 
   Due to their popularity, the overall capacity of our nation's estuaries to function as healthy productive ecosystems is declining. This is a result of the cumulative effects of increasing development and fast growing year round populations which increase dramatically in the summer. Land development, and associated activities that come with people's desire to live and play near these beautiful resources, cause runoff and storm water discharges that contribute to siltation, increased nutrients, and other contamination. Bacterial contamination closes many popular beaches and shellfish harvesting areas in estuaries. Also, several estuaries are afflicted by problems that still require significant research. Examples include the outbreaks of the toxic microbe, Pfiesteria piscicida, in rivers draining to estuaries in Maryland and Virginia. 
   Congress recognized the importance of preserving and enhancing coastal environments with the establishment of the National Estuary Program in the Clean Water Act Amendments of 1987. The Program's purpose is of facilitate state and local governments preparation of comprehensive conservation and management plans for threatened estuaries of national significance. In support of this effort, section 320 of the Clean Water Act authorized the EPA to make grants to states to develop environmental management plans. To date, 28 estuaries across the country have been designated into the Program. However, the law fails to provide assistance once plans are complete and ready for implementation. Already, 18 of the 28 plans are finished. 
   As the majority of plans are now in the implementation stage, it is incumbent upon us to maintain the partnership the Federal Government initiated ten years ago to insure that our nationally significant estuaries are protected. The legislation we are introducing will take the next step by giving EPA authority to make grants for plan implementation and authorize annual appropriations in the amount of $50 million. To insure the program is a true partnership and leverage scarce resources, there is a direct match requirement for grant recipients so funds will be available to upgrade sewage treatment plants, fix combined sewer overflows, control urban stormwater discharges, and reduce polluted runoff into estuarine areas.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today together with Senators THOMAS, REED, HELMS, WELLSTONE, COVERDELL, and KERRY, to submit a resolution on Indonesia's upcoming Parliamentary elections. These are both exciting and troubling times in Indonesia. The elections scheduled for June 7th could be the beginning of a new, democratic Indonesia. At the same time, though, we receive almost daily reports of increased social unrest and a bleak economic future. 
   While inflation and interest rates have fallen, the Indonesian economy remains unstable. Recent clashes between Muslims and Christians in Ambon remind us that Indonesia's ethnic tensions could overwhelm the country at any minute. The status of East Timor is an ongoing issue for the people of Indonesia, although President Habibie has vowed to come to resolution by the end of the year. Depending upon the outcome of the vote on autonomy, the Parliament elected in June could have a direct influence on East Timor's future. 
   The upcoming June elections are a critical benchmark for Indonesia's efforts to pursue democratic reform. A freely elected Parliament will further distance Indonesia from its past and help instill a democratic culture. If these elections are proven to be free, fair and transparent, Indonesia will be well on its way to having a government with popular legitimacy. 
   I applaud the Administration's efforts to ensure that the elections on June 7th are open and transparent. U.S. support for a fair election process will send a strong message to the participants. The pledge of $30 million to help Indonesia realize its goal of free and fair elections demonstrates an understanding of how important June 7th is, not only in Indonesia, but in Southeast Asia as a whole. While Indonesia's new election laws provide for monitors at the national, provincial and district levels, we must ensure that monitors are properly trained and educated. We must move quickly to maximize the interim period before the elections and encourage other nations to actively support our efforts to promote a free and fair process. 
   Producing transparent and legitimate election results is a responsibility that cannot be overlooked. However, we must look forward at the same time. The economic and social problems Indonesia is currently facing will be with the country past the election, and they need continued attention from this Congress and the Administration. The country's future will be uncertain if the pressing issues of today are ignored. 
   For this reason, I have introduced a resolution that supports Indonesia's efforts to hold free and fair elections. It calls upon all political, military and ethnic leaders to refrain from violence and work toward a peaceful campaign period. In addition, it urges all candidates to address some of these social problems and incorporate possible solutions into their election platforms. This Congress can have a positive impact on democracy in Indonesia by helping to keep its future leaders focused on achieving long term social and economic stability.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Dr. R. Gordon Douglas, Jr., President of the Vaccine Division of Merck & Co., Inc. as he prepares for his retirement after decades of distinguished service. As a leader in one of New Jersey's largest pharmaceutical companies, Dr. Douglas has been responsible for the research, development, manufacturing and marketing of Merck's vaccine line. In addition to his responsibilities at Merck, Dr. Douglas has helped improve the lives of thousands of people throughout the world through his leadership roles in his company's and the State's blood drives. 
   In 1998, Dr. Douglas encouraged over 3,400 Merck employees in New Jersey to give the life-saving gift of blood. He took a significant leadership role with the New Jersey Blood Services by chairing the Blood Donor Campaign in 1997-1998 and encouraging colleagues in other corporations to increase their blood drive efforts. Under his leadership, the Merck Blood Drive Program received the America's Blood Centers 1999 Platinum Award, the highest blood drive award given by the Nation's largest network of independent, community blood centers. 
   Dr. Douglas has served as a physician, academician, and world-class leader in the fight against infectious diseases. As a graduate of Cornell University Medical School, he has served as a clinical investigator at the National Institute of Health, a member of the faculty at the Baylor College of Medicine, and the School of Medicine at the University of Rochester, and later returned to Cornell as Chairman of the Department of Medicine in the Medical College before beginning his career at Merck. 
   In a career marked by many valuable achievements, I am pleased today to highlight Dr. Douglas' contributions to New Jersey and society.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 84th anniversary of the Armenian genocide. This is an event that has defined the Armenian people for the past 84 years, and my thoughts and sympathies are again with them as they remember these events. 
   It is with a great sense of sorrow that we mark the 84th year since the tragic genocide and exile of the Armenian people. The Turkish Ottoman Empire expelled nearly 1.5 million Armenians as part of a staged campaign. In doing so, the world witnessed one of the most sobering events in modern history. As the first genocide of the 20th century, the period between 1915 and 1918 deserves our attention and respect, and it should remind us of the need to keep all those who perished during the Genocide alive in our memory. 
   While humankind has the ability to sponsor acts of great kindness and sacrifice, we also have the capacity for great evil. By pausing to commemorate the Armenian Genocide, we ensure that it will never slip into the recesses of history. Along with the Holocaust, the Armenian Genocide signifies our ability to promote evil, but if we close our eyes to the tragedies of the past, we risk the chance of repeating them in the future. 
   Sadly, the Armenian American community has its roots in the Armenian Genocide. Many individuals living here in the United States either lost family members at the hands of the Ottomans, or are survivors themselves. They have risen above adversity to become prominent and successful citizens despite a tragic past. The Armenian American community has been vocal in expressing its anguish about the Genocide. It is my hope that their perseverance in marking this event each year, as well as our own efforts here in the United States Senate, will be enough to allow us to remember the lessons of the Genocide. We are constantly forced to relearn the effects of evil unchecked, but I hope, in this case, we will be guided to a better future.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, it is an unfortunate result of today's modern health care system that many health care providers face serious financial difficulties. Increasingly, these health care providers are filing for the protection of the bankruptcy system. This reality was demonstrated recently in New Jersey where the parent company of the HIP Health Care Plan went bankrupt, leaving the plan's 194,000 subscribers in health care limbo. 
   The bankruptcy system, for all of the benefits it provides to debtors, creditors and the public, does little to protect patients of insolvent health care providers. These patients have no choice when their provider files for bankruptcy, they are, quite literally, innocent victims. In some cases such as the HIP HMO in New Jersey, state insurance commissioners have stepped in to manage failing providers. However, such steps will not always be possible,  and in those cases patients must have adequate protections. Furthermore, this bill applies not only to HMOs, but also to hospitals, nursing homes, and long term care providers. 
   Senator GRASSLEY and I have worked diligently to craft a fair bankruptcy bill that addresses the true problems of the bankruptcy system. We believe that the increasing frequency of health care bankruptcy and the problems it creates for patients is a serious problem that deserves to be addressed in our bankruptcy reform effort. 
   Our bill would create several important patient protections. It would provide for the appointment of an ombudsman to monitor and assure continued quality of the care being provided to patients. The bill would set up procedures to ensure that the confidentiality of patient records is strictly maintained as a health care provider closes its operation. 
   Our legislation would also raise the priority in bankruptcy of the costs associated with closing a health care business. Those cost are often incurred by state agencies, and thus the taxpayers. Finally, the bill would require a bankruptcy trustee to use best efforts to transfer patients to alternative providers when a health care business fails. 
   The reality of today's health care system is that there will inevitably be providers who fall upon financial difficulties and seek the protection of the bankruptcy system. Given that reality, we must take the steps today to ensure that the patients of these providers have adequate protections.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Right To Know About Airport Pollution Act, and ask that my remarks be placed in the RECORD at the appropriate place. This important legislation will allow the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), in conjunction with the FAA, to conduct a nationwide study of air, water, solid waste and noise pollution generated by airports across the U.S. every day. In addition, the bill will direct the EPA to determine whether current air emission standards are sufficient to protect the environment, and will require airports to be listed under Community Right To Know laws governing the use of hazardous materials. 
   Many of my colleagues and I hear everyday from constituents who are concerned by the pollution, including noise pollution, created by airports in our states. In 1996, a Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) report confirmed that US airports rival smokestack industries in the amount of pollution they release into the environment. This growing problem affects every state in our nation and millions of our constituents. You do not have to be from a state with a large airport to understand that pollution associated with these facilities severely affects the health and impacts the quality of life of our constituents. 
   While we must recognize that airport expansion is an inevitable by-product of a vibrant economy, and that the government has a responsibility to foster economic growth and jobs, we also have an equal responsibility to mitigate the hazardous affects of pollution and noise on our constituents. The studies produced as a result of this legislation will give us a better idea as to the magnitude of the pollution problem caused by airports, and will allow us to prepare a commensurate response. 
   Again, I would like to thank my colleagues who have demonstrated interest in this issue and look forward to the passage of this important legislation.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Carl D. Sommers, a true leader and a dedicated spokesman for New Jersey's labor movement. He has served the many members of organized labor in my home state for over 25 years and at his retirement, he is to be honored for his contributions to the Sheet Metal Workers Union. 
   Born and raised in Lawrence Township, New Jersey, Carol graduated from the Trenton High Vocational Sheet Metal Program. He began his career by serving a four-year apprenticeship with Sheet Metal Workers Local #27, where he has remained a member until this day. He has served his union as a local Union Shop Steward, Trustee, Executive Board Member, and as a member of the Joint Apprenticeship Training Fund. Carl also served as a Trustee of the Education Fund, monitoring and managing the Financial Training Facility and Teacher programs. As a member of the Supplemental Unemployment Fund Board, Carl has helped his union colleagues during periods of unemployment. 
   Carl was elected as Business Representative of Local 27 in 1990. In this new position, he adeptly represented the concerns and the welfare of his Union in labor disputes and corrected violations of collective bargaining agreements. He was also responsible for the daily work assignments of all Local members and attended labor seminars in an effort to protect the union rights. 
   He has proudly served his members by serving on the Contract Negotiating Committee, and attending rallies to garner support for pro-labor legislation. He recently became a Trustee of the New Jersey State Labor Council of Sheet Metal Workers, a member of both the Camden County Building Trades Council and the Warren County Building Trades Council. For over two years, Carl has served as Financial Secretary-Treasurer of the Mercer-Burlington Counties and Vicinities Building Trades Council. 
   On the eve of his retirement, it brings me great pleasure to recognize the accomplishments of Carl Sommers and his actions and efforts should be commended. The New Jersey labor community should be proud to have had Carl as a member and should be assured that he will continue to monitor and participate in the labor movement.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Raimondo Family as they are honored by the Fort Lee Chamber of Commerce as Family of the Year. The Raimondo name and family are synonymous with the rich history of the Borough of Fort Lee. 
   Carmelo Raimondo, who emigrated from the Province of Coscenza in Southern Italy, founded Raimondo Construction with his wife Madeline Battaglia in 1923. In 1942, they moved to Fort Lee with their two sons Frank and Charles. Since that time, numerous members of the Raimondo family have helped build Raimondo Construction into the pinnacle of success that it is today. Raimondo Construction has been an integral part of the Fort Lee community, and the Raimondos have helped to make Fort Lee the Borough that it is. 
   The Raimondo Family is now spread throughout Bergen County and across the country, and every member of the family continues to be active in their community. Whether it is serving the United States in the Navy, caring for the sick as a nurse, or shaping the youth of our nation in the Boy Scouts, the Raimondo Family has contributed a great deal to society. They have worked on behalf of a diverse pool of civic organizations such as Christie Muhaw Scholarship Fund, the New Jersey Symphony, the Church of the Good Shepard, the York Street Project in Jersey City, the Bergen 200 Club, the Police Honor League of New Jersey, the Fort Lee Council of Youth and Community Services, and the Bergen County Catholic Youth Organization. The Raimondo Family has set a standard of community activism that we should all strive to meet. 
   The story of the Raimondo Family is the story of the American dream. It is the story of Carmelo Raimondo coming to America in search of the opportunity that this great country offers. The success that the Raimondos have experienced is a testament to the fact that America is truly the land of opportunity. My grandparents also came to America in search of opportunity, and it is this common experience that has built a bond between myself and the Raimondo Family. 
   I am proud to recognize the Raimondos on this occasion.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize Michael A. Ferrara, Jr. as he is honored as an Outstanding Italian American by the Sons of Italy organization. Michael has enjoyed a fruitful legal career, multiple philanthropic endeavors, and a beautiful family. 
   Michael was born in South Philadelphia to the children of Italian immigrants. His father worked hard for the Pennsylvania Railroad and his mother worked for Wanamakers once Michael and his sister, JoAnn, were grown. He was raised in this city and stayed close after graduating high school, attending Villanova University on a NROTC scholarship. Michael graduated from Villanova with a degree in Mathematics and soon after, began his naval service. 
   In the Navy, Michael served aboard both a submarine and a destroyer, visiting Ireland, Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia. His service was extended to five years due to the Vietnam War, which is where he spent his last year. While in DaNang, Michael taught English to Vietnamese children for the U.S. Information Agency and helped deliver Marines, tanks, and ammunition to river bases along the demilitarized zone. At the age of 23, Michael was in command of a mini-fleet of 25 boats and 250 men. His service in Vietnam was rewarded with several commendations including the Combat Action Ribbon, Navy Unit Commendations, Vietnam Campaign Medal and Vietnam Service Medal with three bronze stars. 
   After completing his military service, Michael attended law school at the University of San Diego. After graduation, he began his successful legal career. Michael has been elected President of the Association of Trial Lawyers of America, as well as President of the 2500 member New Jersey Trial Lawyer's Association. He has also served as President of the National Civil Justice Foundation. Recently he was selected, along with four other attorneys, to represent the Attorney General of New Jersey in the lawsuit against the tobacco industry. 
   In addition to his extensive legal career, Michael has served his community through various philanthropic endeavors, including the March of Dimes and the New Jersey State Aquarium's education program. As a fellow Italian American it gives me great pleasure to recognize Michael Ferrara and his achievements, both in his career and his community. He is a man most deserving of this award and his actions should be highly commended.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation that will help ensure that American soldiers are using American made products. ``Buy American'' laws guarantee that our nation's military has access to a reliable domestic supply of uniforms, coats, and other apparel. This critical national security requirement has allowed U.S. garment manufacturers to consistently provide our armed forces with high-quality, durable clothing products made to exact military specifications. 
   Last year, I was deeply troubled to learn that an Inspector General audit found that 59 percent of government contracts at 12 military organizations failed to include the appropriate clause to implement Buy America laws. The results of this audit indicates a high likelihood that there have been widespread violations of these laws throughout the military. 
   In response to these findings, I have introduced legislation directing the Inspector General of the Department of Defense (DoD) to conduct an audit of fiscal year 1998 procurements of military clothing by four installations of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps. These audits will help determine whether contracting officers are complying with the law when they procure military clothing and related items. 
   Mr. President, the Buy American laws are an invaluable tool for ensuring our military readiness while supporting American jobs. Most of these jobs are created by small U.S. contractors. This legislation will provide an important follow-up audit to determine whether DoD is effectively enforcing the Buy American laws.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today, with Senator LAUTENBERG, to introduce a bill to create a comprehensive flood management plan for the Passaic River Basin. 
   In 1990, Congress, with my support, authorized a plan to create a 21-mile long tunnel, which would have stretched from Wayne to Newark Bay to divert flood water from the Pompton and Passaic Rivers in New Jersey. At the time it was believed that the tunnel was the best method to end recurring floods that caused deaths and property losses for the region's 2.5 million residents. 
   Flooding has plagued the Passaic River Basin since colonial times. The State of New Jersey attempted to present solutions to the public as early as 1870 with no success. After major floods in 1902 and 1903, a series of engineering studies were completed but never implemented. In 1936, the Corps of Engineers were directed by Congress to solve the flooding problems. Since that time (63 years), several proposals have been presented only to be rejected. Flooding in the Passaic River Basin, in 1993, caused $15 million in damage. The last major flooding, in 1984, killed three people, caused 9,400 evacuations and $425 million in damage. 
   Ten years ago, I supported the tunnel plan. I believed that it was the best possible answer for the region. I understood the plan for the tunnel to be environmentally and economically sound, and the most protective option for the public's health. It promised to create jobs for the region and solve the persistent flooding within the Passaic River Basin, which encompasses 132 towns in 10 counties. 
   It has now become clear that this project is no longer viable and does not enjoy the support of the state or most of the surrounding communities. So last year, along with so many other of my fellow New Jerseyans, I came to the realization that the flood tunnel was not the answer for the Passaic. At a cost of $1.8 billion, the plan was too expensive. As a matter of engineering, it was too complex. As a matter of environmental protection, it was too uncertain. More importantly, after countless hearings, counties and municipalities within the Passaic River Basin rejected the current plan. 
   It will be far less costly and more environmentally sound to control the flooding by shoring up the banks of the Passaic and Ramapo Rivers and purchasing properties in the flood zone so the river's natural wetlands may rebound. We should also fund plans to reduce flooding from combined sewer overflow systems in the state's older, larger cities, which dump raw sewage into waterways during heavy rainfall. Our plan would be more cost effective and more environmentally acceptable than the flood tunnel. 
   The proposed Passaic River Basin Flood Management Program selects a qualified acquisition and hazard mitigation plan as the preferred alternative for flood control in the Passaic River Basin, superseding the Passaic River flood tunnel. 
   The plan calls for acquiring freshwater wetlands in the State of New Jersey and lands in the Highlands Province of the States of New Jersey and New York to prevent increased flooding. In key sections of the floodplain of the Central Passaic River Basin structures would be acquired, demolished, removed or floodproofed. The plan also calls for the acquisition of river front land from Little Falls to Newark Bay along the Passaic River Basin. The plan would also authorize assistance in the implementation of remedial actions for the combined sewer overflows in the lower Passaic River Basin from the Great Falls to Newark Bay. Finally, it established an Oversight Committee for the implementation of the Program, and reaffirms authorization for completion of Joseph G. Minish Passaic River Waterfront Park and Historic Area, New Jersey. 
   The original legislation that created the tunnel, the Water Resources Development Act of 1990, also authorized many other very important projects for the Passaic River Basin region. The Streambank project called for the construction of environmental and other restoration measures, including bulkheads, recreation, greenbelt, and scenic overlook facilities. The Wetlands Bank program developed initiatives to restore, acquire, preserve, study, and enhance wetlands. 
   I want to make clear that our interest in this legislation is only to replace construction of the tunnel with a more environmentally and economically appropriate plan. I still support, and will continue to support, those sections of the Water Resources Development Act of 1990 that address issues other than the flood tunnel. Programs, such as the Streambank project and the Wetlands Bank, remain important building blocks for creating an effective flood management plan for the Passaic River Basin.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, today, Senator LEAHY, Senator DASCHLE, and I introduced the Seniors Safety Act of 1999. Senator LEAHY has referred to this legislation as ``a new safety net for seniors.'' It is that, but it is also much more. Indeed, this bill is a potent weapon designed to track down and punish those criminals who would prey on the trust and good will of America's seniors. This bill puts the crooks on notice that crimes against seniors, from violent assaults in the streets, to abuses in nursing homes, to frauds perpetrated over the telephone lines, will not be tolerated. 
   Seniors represent the most rapidly growing sector of our population--in the next 50 years, the number of Americans over the age of 65 will more than double. Unless we take action now, the frequency and sophistication of crimes against seniors will likewise skyrocket. The Seniors Safety Act of 1999 was developed to address, head-on the crimes which most directly affect the senior community, including telemarketing fraud, and abuse and fraud in the health care and nursing home industries. It increases penalties and provides enhancements to the sentencing guidelines for criminals who target seniors. It protects seniors against the illegal depletion of precious pension and employee benefit plan funds through fraud, graft, bribery, and helps victimized seniors obtain restitution. Any finally, this bill authorizes the Attorney General to study the problem of crime against senors, and design new techniques to fight it. 
   Criminal enterprises that engage in telemarketing fraud are some of the most insidious predators out there. Americans are fleeced out of over $40 billion dollars every year, and the effect on seniors is grossly disproportionate According to the American Association of Retired Persons, ``The repeated victimization of the elderly is the cornerstone of illegal telemarketing.'' A study has found that 56 percent of the names on the target lists of fraudulent telemarketers are the names of Americans aged 50 or older. Of added concern is the fact that many of the perpetrators have migrated out of the United States for fear of prosecution, and continue to conduct their illegal activities from abroad. 
   In one heartbreaking story, a recently-widowed New Jersey woman was bilked out of $200,000 by a deceitful telemarketing firm from Canada, who claimed that the woman had won a $150,000 sweepsteaks--the price could be hers, for a fee. A series of these calls followed, convincing this poor woman, already in a fragile mind-state after her husband's death, to send more and more money for what they claimed was an increasingly large prize, which, of course, never materialized. 
   Our bill authorizes the Attorney General to effectively put these vultures, even the international criminals, out of business by blocking or terminating their U.S. telephone service. In addition, it authorizes the FTC to create a consumer clearinghouse which would provide seniors, and others who might have questions about the legitimacy of a telephone sales pitch, 
   with information regarding prior complaints about a particular telemarketing company or prior fraud convictions. Furthermore, this clearing house would give seniors who may have been cheated an open channel to the appropriate law enforcement authorities. 
   In 1997, older Americans were victimized by violent crime over 680,000 times. The crimes against them range from simple assault, to armed robbery, to rape. While national crime rates in general are falling, seniors have not shared in the benefits of that drop. 
   This Act singles out criminals who prey on the senior population and penalizes them for the physical and economic harm they cause. In addition, we intend to place this growing problem in the spotlight, an urge Congress and federal and state law enforcement agencies to continue to develop solutions. To this end, we have authorized a comprehensive examination of crimes against seniors, and the inclusion of data on seniors in the National Crime Victims Survey. 
   Seniors across the country have worked their entire lives, secure in the belief that their pensions and health benefits would be there to provide for them in their retirement years. Far too often, seniors wake up one morning to find that their hard-earned benefits have been stolen. In 1997 alone, $90 million in losses to pension funds were uncovered. Older Americans who depend on that money to live are left out in the cold, while criminals enjoy the fruit of a lifetime of our seniors' labor. The Seniors Safety Act gives federal prosecutors another powerful weapon to punish pension fund thieves. The Act creates new civil and criminal penalties for defrauding pension of benefit plans, or obtaining money from them under false or fraudulent pretenses. 
   The defrauding of Medicare, Medicaid, and private health insurers has become big business for criminals who prey on the elderly. According to a National Institutes of Health study, losses from fraud and abuse may exceed $100 billion per year. Overbilling and false claims filing have become rampant as automated claims processing is more prevalent. Similarly, the Department of Justice has noted numerous cases where unscrupulous nursing home operators have simply pocketed Medicare funds, rather than providing adequate care for their residents. In one horrendous case, five diabetic patients died from malnutrition and lack of medical care. In another, a patient was burned to death when a mute patient was placed by untrained staff in a tub of scalding water. These terrible abuses would never have occurred had the facilities spent the federal funds they received to implement proper health and safety procedures. This bill goes after fraud and abuse by providing resources and tools for authorities to investigate and prosecute offenses in civil and criminal courts, and enhances the ability of the Justice Department to use evidence brought in by qui tam (whistleblower) plaintiffs. 
   This Act delivers needed protections to our seniors. It sends a message to the cowardly perpetrators of fraud and other crimes against older Americans, that their actions will be fiercely prosecuted, whether they be here or abroad. And it clearly states that we refuse to allow seniors to be victimized by this most heinous form of predation.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, thank Senator MURKOWSKI, my distinguished colleague from Alaska, with whom I have worked many months in this effort. I also thank Senator BURNS, Chairman of the Communications subcommittee, who has greatly assisted us with this legislation and Senator REID for joining with us on this important legislation. 
   Last year, I recognized the growing threat to Internet commerce and communication posed by the proliferation of unsolicited junk e-mail, or so-called ``Spam.'' Junk e-mail is an unfortunate side effect of the burgeoning world of Internet communication and commerce. While Internet traffic doubles every 100 days, as much as 30 percent of that traffic is junk e-mail. 
   Like many other Americans, I have an America Online account and am inundated with unsolicited messages, peddling every item imaginable. Similarly, I receive junk e-mail daily at my official senate e-mail address, along with the complaints of dozens of constituents who forward me the Spam that they receive. 
   The incentive to abuse the Internet is obvious. Sending an e-mail to as many as 10 million people can cost as little as a couple of hundred dollars. Today, unsolicited commercial e-mailers are hiding their identities, falsifying their return addresses and refusing to respond to complaints or removal requests. Because the senders of these e-mails are generally unknown, they avoid any possible retribution from consumers. Their actions approach fraud, but our current law are not strong enough to stop them. 
   I have long been concerned about executive--indeed any--government regulation of the Internet. Many of the best qualities of American life are represented and enhanced by the Internet, and I fear government regulation has the possibility to stifle the creativity and development of cyberspace. 
   However, a failure to address the problem of junk e-mail now poses a greater threat to the Internet than do minimal regulations. The massive amount of junk e-mail in an already strained system is increasingly responsible for slowdowns, and even breakdowns, of Internet services. For example, just last March spammers crashed Pacific Bell's Network, leaving customers without service for 24 hours. 
   Let me be clear, this legislation is not a de facto regulation of the Internet. In fact, it does not go as a complete ban on junk e-mail as some have suggested. While I understand the concerns of those who seek a complete ban, I believe that the government should not hastily pass broad legislation to regulate the Internet. The Inbox Privacy Act will address the spam problem by giving citizens and Internet service providers the power to stop unwanted e-mail. But Congress must move quickly to address this situation before junk e-mail becomes a serious impediment to the flow of ideas and commerce on the Internet.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Martin Santini, an architect and planner who has literally helped New Jersey build and grow. His entrepreneurial spirit is to be commended as the firm he founded, Ecoplan, celebrates its 25th year in existence. Ecoplan is an award-winning architectural, planning, and design firm, whose clients include the State of New Jersey. His peers have recognized his talent, accomplishments, and contributions to the State as he has been elected as president of the New Jersey chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He is a registered architect in six States and licensed as a professional planner in the State of New Jersey. 
   After graduating with both Bachelor of Architecture and Master of Architecture, as well as an Urban Planning degree, Martin established his own firm in 1974. Ecoplan has been dedicated to providing quality design services and producing creative solutions that add lasting value to its client's projects. After 25 years of committed service, his firm has grown exponentially. Recently, Ecoplan was ranked as the 14th largest architectural firm in New Jersey by New Jersey Business Magazine. To date, Ecoplan has designed and built over 1,000 structures in the Tri-State region. As Ecoplan's president, Martin has been largely responsible for this success. 
   Martin and Ecoplan have served the State of New Jersey well. Ecoplan's clients include numerous municipalities, counties, boards of education, housing authorities, and police departments. They have served the public sector well by closely maintaining construction budgets and schedules, which are so important in Ecoplan has also served the private sector and various communities well, building schools, medical offices, YMCAs, condominiums, townhouses, apartments, single family homes, corporate headquarters, restaurants, commercial office buildings, warehouses, and a wide variety of additions, renovations, and interior design projects.  
   Martin and his firm have served the State of New Jersey by improving our schools, housing our citizens, and providing a workplace for our government employees. His dedication to the success of his firm and his steadfast commitment to his clients embody the entrepreneurial spirit. I am proud to recognize Martin's accomplishments and contributions today and I know he will continue to serve New Jersey well in the years to come.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, and on behalf of Senator DURBIN, Senator FEINSTEIN, and Senator REID of Nevada, to offer an amendment to bring some rational conclusion and fair determination to the issue of independent counsels in the U.S. Government. 
   I begin with a simple admission. In 1994, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I voted for and argued for the enactment of an independent counsel statute. I was not mindful then, as I am now, of the complete record and statements as to the likely outcome of the independent counsel statute. 
   Howard Baker, then a Member of this institution, argued that the independent counsel statute would ``establish a virtual fourth branch of Government, and would substantially diminish the accountability of law enforcement to the President, the Congress, and the American people.'' 
   Acting Attorney General Robert Bork, warned: ``What you are doing [with the independent counsel statute] is building an office whose sole function is to attack the executive branch throughout its tenure. It is an institutionalized wolf hanging on the flank of the elk.'' 
   Mr. President, I take no delight in admitting it, but it is inescapable. Mr. Baker, Mr. Bork, and other Members of this institution were right. And many of us in my party, and, indeed, President Clinton, who ultimately signed the law, were wrong. 
   It is now clear--I think unmistakably clear--that the independent counsel law, when it expires on June 30, 1999, will not be reauthorized. There is not only not the votes in this Senate or in the other body, but there is not a rationale based on the historic experience to allow this law to continue. 
   It brings me no pleasure to bring to the floor of the Senate the weight of the evidence that supports the conclusion that the law should expire. But it is overwhelming, and it isn't only Kenneth Starr. Independent counsels, from Walsh to Smaltz, have given us no choice but to close this unfortunate chapter. The list of abuses by independent counsels are daunting, and they are dangerous. Mr. Starr has no monopoly in his violations of law, ethics, or common sense. But the investigation that is now underway in the Justice Department of Judge Starr is still instructive. It teaches us a lot about the basic failings of this law, how it can be abused, and why the amendment that I offer today, along with Senator HARKIN, is of such value. 
   First, Mr. Starr apparently may have failed to inform the Attorney General about his contacts with Paula Jones' attorneys. Indeed, he may have misled the Attorney General on this issue. 
   Second, it is overwhelmingly clear that Mr. Starr, or his subordinates, leaked confidential grand jury information in direct violation of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedures.  
   Third, it is possible that Mr. Starr may have used questionable prosecutorial tactics by making an offer of immunity to Ms. Lewinsky contingent on her not contacting her attorney. 
   These may not be the only violations of procedure or law, but they tell us something about the fact that there is something institutionally wrong with how the independent counsel statute has functioned. 
   I do not raise these things out of any vendetta against Mr. Starr, or his tactics, or his office, because this is an institutional problem. Indeed, in the last few years, Donald Smaltz has spent $7 million investigating former Secretary of Agriculture Michael Espy. Last year, after a 2-month trial, in which the defense never found it necessary to call a single witness, that $7 million investigation resulted in a jury acquitting Mr. Espy on each and every one of the 30 counts in 
   the indictment. 
   C. David Barrett spent $7 million investigating former HUD Secretary Cisneros on allegations that he lied about payments to a former mistress. Mr. Barrett went so far as to indict the former mistress over misstatements on a mortgage application form. Nor is it limited to this administration. 
   In the previous administration, after a 6-year investigation, Lawrence Walsh indicted Casper Weinberger only 5 months before the 1992 Presidential election in either a moment of political convenience, or worse. Mr. Walsh had spent $40 million over 7 years in his investigation. 
   I believe it is now clear that, despite the best of intentions and our frustration with the Watergate experience, we now know the independent counsel statute is deeply flawed. It has created a prosecutor that is accountable to no one. It is a contradiction with the most basic lessons of our Founding Fathers in the Constitutional Convention. Indeed, in Federalist 51, Madison sums up the need for checks and balances of every office, every center of power in the Federal Government, with a simple phrase ``Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.'' 
   Mr. Walsh, Mr. Barrett, Mr. Starr, and Mr. Smaltz are ambitious men, but their ambition is met with no countervailing power. 
   There is, in theory, in the Office of the Attorney General the opportunity to dismiss for cause, to hold accountable, but in the political realities of our time no Attorney General could exercise that authority against an independent counsel investigating an administration in which he or she is a component part. 
   The Congress does not even control the ability of oversight of expenditures. As a Member of the Senate, and as a member of the Judiciary Committee with oversight responsibilities for the Judiciary, for the operation of the Attorney General, I wrote to Mr. Starr and to the Justice Department asking about how this $50 million had been spent and received nothing but a vague reply with broad categories. Mr. Starr's office remains the only functioning office in the entire U.S. Government where the people's representatives cannot inform on behalf of the people how millions upon millions of dollars are spent. But mostly, I suppose, if the money were wasted and power were exercised responsibly but the net result was still a rising level of public confidence in public integrity, it might be worth the abuse or the expenditure. But this isn't the case either. 
   The independent counsel statute has not succeeded in removing politics from prosecution. It has brought a new element to politics, the hijacking of these offices, the use of them for their own political purposes, only now without oversight. Public confidence in the administration of justice has not only not improved but it has completely failed. 
   Now it is being argued that the law will expire and there will never be independent counsels again. I believe that is an accurate portrayal of the situation, but the current five independent counsels should simply be allowed to continue in their work. The question remains, how long and for how much? 
   Mr. Starr has suggested his investigation may go to the year 2001. He has the power for it to continue until the year 2010, 2020. When will Mr. Barrett complete his case, in this decade or the next? And, if $50 million was an outrage by the public for the expenditures of Mr. Starr, there is nothing 
   between here and his expenditure of $100 million, $200 million. Is he the only person in the Federal Government who will retain the power to unilaterally spend unlimited sums of funds with no oversight for any purpose? 
   That is what brings me to the floor today with Senator HARKIN, to offer an amendment that allows Mr. Starr, Mr. Barrett, and the other three remaining independent counsels to continue with their investigation for 6 months after the expiration of the independent counsel statute on June 30. For the remainder of this year, they retain their authority, their budget appropriations, and they should complete their files and prepare their cases. During that 6 months, they should work with professional prosecutors in the Justice Department, the Public Integrity Section, as applicable, and prepare the transfer of their cases. The cases will continue. They will be in able hands with professional prosecutors, with ample resources. 
   This law is not intended to end any investigation. It will not end any investigation, but it will allow for the orderly transfer of these investigations and prosecutions within the Justice Department. Those two investigations which have not had independent counsels appointed for 3 years, involving Secretary Herman and Secretary Babbitt, are not affected by this amendment. It is our belief those independent counsels have not had at least 3 years to prepare their cases. We will give them every benefit: Take the time as independent counsels after the law has expired, prepare your cases, continue the prosecution if you have a case, or dismiss it if you do not. This amendment is reserved only for those cases where more than 3 years has expired and where, after the expiration of the independent counsel statute, there is a need to then proceed. 
   I believe this amendment is fair. It will help restore public confidence and allow the Congress to know the taxpayers' money is being spent properly. It will transition the Federal Government into the post-independent counsel statute method of dealing with these important questions. 
   I thank Senator FEINSTEIN and Senator DURBIN for joining with Senator HARKIN and with me in offering this amendment. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding. 
   I want to make certain that the record is complete and accurate. The  Senator has suggested that it would be interfering with an ongoing criminal investigation. The Senator understands that in these 6 months, the independent counsel would have time to take their cases, as they are now prepared, and their relatively small offices and give them to professional prosecutors in the Justice Department who have been pursuing similar or more important cases for years. There is no diminution in resources, quality of personnel, or ability to pursue the case. Ironically, this is probably bad news for the potential defendants, because they are going to be facing much more experienced prosecutors. 
   I just wanted to make certain that was clear on the record and the Senator understood that.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. The point was made, as well, as to whether 
   or not this is an unconstitutional interference. The right of the Congress to reassign responsibilities, to reassign appropriations, of course, is an innate part of the function of Congress. The Senator from Connecticut, as did the Senator from New Jersey, I am sure, voted, for example, for the State Department reauthorization, the Department of Energy reauthorization, where we simply reassigned executive responsibilities as part of our constitutional power. 
   Finally, I, too, was there for the Attorney General yesterday. The Senator from Connecticut may remember, I asked her, in my concluding questions, whether or not the Justice Department had the resources to deal with these cases. She was confident they would and could deal with these cases so that justice was done and there was no diminution of effort in the pursuit of justice in these cases. 
   I simply want the RECORD to reflect that her answer was affirmative. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for yielding and apologize to the Senator from Iowa for taking the time.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, before the Senate is the question of when the independent counsel statute expires. There is still the issue of the appropriations, and whether the poor continuing independent counsel will be able to spend, not just this year, but on into the future, $10 million, $20 million, $100 million. 
   We begin the orderly process, on 6-month notice, of moving those cases into the Public Integrity Section of the Justice Department where the Attorney General has assured us she is prepared to receive the cases. They will be pursued professionally and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. All we have provided for is the orderly transfer of those cases. Justice will be done. Every case will be pursued. It will be done within the Justice Department, and at long last there will be accountability of how much we spend. 
   If you have been asked by constituents: Isn't $50 million too much? Will it be $100 million? Will it be $200 million? This is the answer to your constituents' inquiry. It is control, but it also assures justice within the Department.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. Res. 57, expressing the sense of the Senate regarding the human rights situation in Cuba. 
   I am pleased to join Senator GRAHAM, MACK and my other colleagues in support of this resolution. This is a timely resolution. As the U.N. Human Rights Commission is preparing to meet in Geneva later this month, we are witnessing a new crackdown on human rights in Cuba. 
   This week, four prominent dissidents were sentenced to jail terms ranging from three and a half to five years by the Cuban government. Their crime--exercising their right to speak and support a peaceful transition to democracy. 
   These courageous people, Vladimiro Roca, Rene Manzano, Felix Bonne, and Marta Beatriz Roque, were arrested for their peaceful criticism of the Communist Party platform. They were held over one year without being charged. They were tried in a closed door proceeding that violated all standards of due process. Scores of human rights activists and journalists were arrested before and during their trial to prevent demonstrations of support for the accused. Fidel Castro ignored calls from the Vatican and the Canadian government for their release. Yesterday, the European Union issued a strong statement calling for their release. 
   The trial prompted international outrage, but came as little surprise for those who have followed Castro's policy of eliminating peaceful dissent. The government regularly pursues a policy of using detention and intimidation to force human rights activists to leave Cuba or abandon their efforts. The four dissidents bravely rejected the Cuban government's offers to go into exile rather than face trial. 
   One year after the Papal visit, an event which many hoped would bring greater openness to Cuba, Fidel Castro has slammed the door closed on the world and on the Cuban people. 1999 has brought about no change in Castro's unyielding policy of stifling human rights. To the contrary, Castro is tightening his iron grip on the Cuban people. 
   First, he began the year by rejecting the Administration's expanded humanitarian measures. Among other initiatives, the measures establish direct mail service between the U.S. and Cuba, and expand remittances to individual Cuban families and charitable organizations. These measures, designed to ease the suffering of the Cuban people caused by 40 years of  communism, were called acts of ``aggression'' by the Cuban government. 
   Second, a new security law for the ``Protection of National Independence and Economy'' was passed by the Cuban government in February. The law criminalizes any form of cooperation or participation in pro-democracy efforts. It imposes penalties ranging from 20 to 30 years, for those found to be cooperating with the U.S. government. Government officials have already warned human rights activists that violations are punishable under the new law. 
   And third, the State Department Country Reports on Human Rights Practices details the same human rights abuses as last year and the year before. One is hard-pressed to find any improvements. The Report repeats last year's finding that the Cuban government's human rights record remains poor. It reiterates the finding that the government continues to ``systematically violate fundamental civil and political rights of its citizens.'' Security forces ``committed serious human rights abuses.'' 
   The examples of human rights violations in the Report are numerous, and startling. Human rights activists are beaten in their homes and outside churches. People are arbitrarily detained and arrested. Political prisoners are denied food and medicine brought by their families. Even children are made to stand in the rain chanting slogans against pro-democracy activists. 
   I would, therefore, say to those countries seeking increased ties with Cuba--take a look at this record. Do not lend any credibility or legitimacy to a government that denies its people basic human rights, and punishes those seeking a peaceful transition to democracy. 
   While the Western Hemisphere gradually moves towards greater respect for human rights, Cuba remains mired in its communist past. Once again, it is the Cuban people who suffer. 
   This resolution demonstrates that the United States' Senate stands united, not divided, in condemning human rights abuses in Cuba. It also sends a strong message to not only the U.N. Human Rights Commission, but also to the Cuban people. We will stand with you and support you until the day that you are free. 
   I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this resolution.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. I am very proud to join with Senator BROWNBACK, Senator WYDEN, and my other colleagues in offering this resolution. I strongly support S. Con. Res. 5 and urge all of my colleagues in the Senate to adopt it. 
   S. Con. Res. 5 states not only our opposition to a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian state; it also urges the President of the United States to make very clear the opposition of this Government to such a unilateral action. 
   It is fair to state that the peace process in the Middle East has reached a critical point. Since the signing of the Wye River agreement, there has in truth been little progress. Some predicted that with the passage of the January 29 implementation date, the agreement might fail. All parties have a common interest that the Wye Plantation agreement not fail because the consequences would be enormous. The arguments for success remain overwhelming. 
   First, only implementation of the agreement will allow the parties to move to talks on final status, and only talks on final status hold the promise of ending this decades-old dispute. 
   Second, only implementation of the agreement will allow the parties to build of the basic elements of trust and confidence that are required for any complete and final agreement. 
   And finally, only a successful agreement will contribute to stability in the region, and bring an end to the use of the Palestinian dispute to fuel other conflicts. 
   Fifty years of negotiating for greater peace in the Middle East has taught us one lesson, peace requires' both words and deeds. Any deed that runs contrary 
   to written agreements has enormous consequences. 
   We have also learned through these 50 years that progress may be unsteady, but it is certain. It has been a very long road from Golan disengagement of the Syrians, to a Sinai agreement, to Egyptian peace, to the Wye Plantation, following Oslo. There were moments when it appeared it might come to an end, but it has been continuous. The process does work, and it yields results. Abandoning the peace process now by a unilateral declaration of Palestinian statehood runs contrary to everything we have learned. It is contrary not only to the interests of the peace process of Israel and the United States, but ironically, in the long term contrary to the interests of the Palestinians themselves. 
   I believe the consequences would be enormous: The destabilization of the peace process would perhaps be irrevocable; second, the declaration is almost certain to lead to renewed bloodshed and frustration--people would believe the peace process would never be resumed. And, third, tragically, it may damage the interests of the U.S. Government in the supplemental aid package that is part of the Wye River agreement, and the hope of economic progress on the West Bank and Gaza so the Palestinian people themselves believe there is a dividend in the peace process and their quality of life. It would be extremely difficult to return to the Congress and argue for that supplemental aid package, including funds for the Palestinians, if the peace process has been abandoned and a Palestinian state unilaterally declared. 
   Mr. President, both parties committed themselves to a continuous bilateral process of negotiation. In September 1993, Yasser Arafat said to then-Prime Minister Rabin, ``All outstanding issues relating to permanent status will be resolved through negotiations.'' That was not a simple statement of fact. It was a promise. It is on that promise that Israel entered into the Wye agreement. It is on that promise that the United States has lent its good offices. It is on that basis that Israel recognized the Palestinian Liberation Organization and began these negotiations. 
   A unilateral act by the Palestinians on statehood would undermine this process perhaps irrevocably. I urge my colleagues' support of this resolution. 
   Just as importantly, I urge Chairman Arafat to consider these consequences. Whatever frustration he may feel, whatever disappointment they all feel that the deadline of January 29 has passed, I urge Chairman Arafat to remember that while progress has been unsteady, it has continued. This process will go forward. Do not abandon it. The Israeli elections may have caused a delay, but a new Israeli Government will remain committed to the peace process no matter who is elected. Reject the advice of abandoning peace. Reject the temptation of a unilateral declaration of statehood. Await the outcome of the Israeli elections and then let us return to the only peace process that guarantees the Israeli and the Palestinian people final determination through permanent status talks. 
   That is the process that is now before us. I thank my colleagues for offering this resolution. I thank Senator WYDEN for yielding me time. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, there is understandably much discussion in our country about the ways and means to continue the rather extraordinary economic prosperity that has been visited upon our generation. Theories abound about how to maintain this economic growth that is providing employment, a growing Federal surplus, and a rising quality of life in America. 
   It is one thing upon which I suspect we can all agree, as we think about continuing the current economic expansion, that this prosperity is built upon a foundation of quality education. Indeed, I would argue that it is the investment of our parents' generation in quality schools, rising standards of excellence, attraction of good teachers, 30 and 40 years ago, that we are now reaping in dividends of prosperity. There is no question that in those years our parents understood that the security of our Nation and our prosperity would be no stronger than the investment we made in education. 
   I believe that as our parents recognized the opportunity and made the investment and that investment yielded these dividends, the problems of American education now stand like a dagger at the heart of our economy. Too many of our children are now attending schools that would be a source of embarrassment for any Member of this institution. I have visited schools across New Jersey where children meet in hallways, in gymnasiums, because there are no longer classes available. The very schools that our parents provided for us that helped build this prosperity are crumbling around our feet. 
   The GAO has reported that one-third of all schools in America, serving 14 million students, are in serious need of repair. Teachers, no matter how hard they try, no matter their level of effort, can only do so much with old textbooks and with the dearth of modern technology. All the inventions and services on the Internet in the world won't make any difference in American education when only 27 percent of public schools are even connected to the Internet. Far too few communities can any longer afford the extra curricular activities, the extra hours of instruction that we enjoyed as students ourselves. 
   Across America, school districts are canceling sports activities. The club activities, the tutoring activities, the activities where students excelled a generation ago are being lost, leaving between 5 and 15 million students left alone at home after school. The reality of the two-wage-earner family means that millions of these students not only do not have supervision in school or activities but are left alone. Even if they did not need the instruction, even if they did not need the socialization or activities, these students are going home, where we are laying the groundwork for drug abuse, teenage pregnancy, truancy, with a direct correlation between students who do not have activities after school and failing grades and dropouts. 
   Local schools are so overwhelmed with these social problems, the overcrowding, the crumbling schools, sometimes they have no choice but social promotion, take a student who is failing and send them through the system and on to the streets. The reality of this education debate is, there are a lot of good 
   answers, and they are represented by many Senators on this floor--efforts to help local communities deal with the cost of reconstructing our schools, dealing with the problems of social promotion, the problems of rising standards, the problems of getting better teachers, retaining good teachers. 
   What is unique about this education debate is--everybody is right--there is no one good idea. There are no two good ideas. This is a problem of such complexity that is so central to quality of life and economic opportunity in America that succeeding requires everybody's best efforts. What is most important is that it is a debate that requires a competition of the best ideas between Democrats and Republicans and liberals and conservatives. 
   There is no monopoly on creative thinking in dealing with the problems of education in America. Indeed, the underlying legislation, the Education Flexibility Partnership Act, is a good idea, it is a sound idea, but it is one idea that in and of itself does nothing about overcrowding or rising standards or new technology. It is one idea. I will vote for it, and this Senate should enact it. But at the end of the day it leaves us with this question: What do we do about these varieties of other problems? 
   Indeed, can this Senate say at the conclusion of the 106th Congress that we have dealt with educational flexibility, but that is all we have done, and seriously argue that we have dealt with the issue of education in America? 
   Last year, in this Senate, I joined with Senator COVERDELL in the belief that we should establish savings accounts to help fund private and public education. I believed it was a good idea. But even then, I argued, in answer to my own legislation, that if that is all that we have done, we haven't begun to address the problems of education in America. I return to that argument today. 
   Consider the dimensions of the problem, if you are to disagree and argue that educational flexibility alone will deal with this national dilemma. Forty percent of fourth grade students are failing to obtain basic levels of reading; 40 percent of eighth graders fail to obtain a basic level of mathematics. High school seniors across the Nation are ranked 19th out of 21 industrialized nations in math and science. Of course, I support legislation for educational flexibility, but I am also here to support the Murray amendment to hire more teachers and reduce class size, because we know, according to the Department of Education in their 1998 May report, that one element most directly relating to improved student performance is a reduction of class size in the early grades. 
   The Murray amendment is the one answer we know will improve student performance in early grades. The Murray amendment would finish the process we began last year of adding 100,000 new teachers in America to reduce class size. 
   Indeed, I would have liked to have today added to the efforts of Senator MURRAY with an amendment of my own, and that would have been to give  signing bonuses to people who will become teachers. Where our best college graduates will go to schools most in need, I would have offered them a signing bonus to get them into the classroom immediately. 
   It confronts the reality of the fact that a starting teacher in America today could hope to earn, in a public school, $25,000. For a software engineer, our leading high-tech companies are offering $50,000 to the same person, with a signing bonus. Teachers are prepared to make sacrifices because they are dedicated, but how much of a sacrifice? We know they are our most important asset in dealing with the issue of educational quality. 
   So, my colleagues, I urge that we all come together to support educational flexibility. But I would have liked to have offered my amendment, which will not be allowed today. I urge my colleagues to consider Senator MURRAY's amendment, and also Senator FEINSTEIN's to end social promotion in our schools--the passing of the problem along to the streets because we will not deal with it in the classroom--and Senator BINGAMAN's amendment to help stem the tide of dropouts. Unfortunately, one of the most important problems of all--deteriorating schools--we won't be able to vote on.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Donald DeRossi who is this year's recipient of the Distinguished Service Award at the Hendricks House's 5th Annual Awards Dinner. As a small business owner, he has set an outstanding example of quality, production, and leadership. These business qualities have been reflected in his extensive community and charitable activities. 
   Mr. DeRossi began working at DeRossi & Son Company in Vineland, New Jersey in 1960 under his father, Dominick and his grandfather, Angelo. From them, Mr. DeRossi learned all aspects of the clothing business. Today, DeRossi is seen as a premier clothing supplier of military dress coats for the US Defense Department. Under Mr. DeRossi, who currently serves as president, the company has received numerous awards. Most recently, DeRossi received the United States Small Business Administration ``Administrator's Award for Excellence,'' as well as the Defense Supply Center's Small Business contractor of the year award. 
   Mr. DeRossi has put the same enthusiasm and energy into his community and charitable work as he has put into his business. He has dedicated countless hours of service to such commendable causes as the United Way, the YMCA, the American Heart Association, the American Cancer Association, the March of Dimes, the 4H Club, and Muscular Dystrophy. He has sat on the Boards of such community organizations as the Urban Enterprise Zone, Ellison School, the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, and the Vineland Chamber of Commerce. 
   On the eve of his receipt of this award, Mr. DeRossi deserves to be recognized for his outstanding services to both the business community and his community of Vineland, New Jersey. He is an exemplary businessman, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to show my appreciation for all he has accomplished.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Herbert Tanzman, a man of many talents and accomplishments, who is a dedicated member of the Highland Park Conservative Temple and Center. From the time of his Bar Mitzvah in 1935; to his membership on the Board of Trustees for forty-four years; to his Vice-Presidency and Temple Finance Committee Chairmanship; and to his service as Gabbai, with his brother-in-law Charlie for over forty years, Herb has been committed to the temple. In recognition of this service, he was named to the select group of Honorary Life Members of the Board of Trustees, and he was on the Rabbinical Search Committees for both Rabbi Yakov Hilsenrath and Rabbi Eliot Malomet. 
   Herb has been active in civic and Jewish communal activities for many years, and he is currently Director of the real estate firm of Jacobson Goldfarb and Tanzman Associates. Having served Highland Park as both councilman and mayor, Herb is well-known in the community. In addition to his responsibilities at the temple, he has been active in the local chapter of the Multiple Sclerosis Association, Central New Jersey Jewish Home for the Aged, YM-YWHA of Raritan Valley, New Brunswick post #138 of Jewish War Veterans, National Executive Estate Commission, Job Corps, United Community Services, and Raritan Valley UJA Federation. In the past, Herb has been on the Executive Board of the Jewish Federation of Greater Monmouth County, and he currently serves as National Vice-Chairman and National Campaign Cabinet Member of the State of Israel Bonds. Herb is also President of the Ocean Cove Condominium Association in West End, New Jersey. 
   While these activities are impressive, Herb truly distinguished himself as a serviceman during World War II and has since been honored for his numerous achievements. As a combat veteran of the Battle of Iwo Jima, he was awarded the Navy Air Medal. Herb is also the proud recipient of the Jerusalem Covenant Award, the Humanitarian Award of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the Ben Gurion Award, and Israel's coveted ``Sword of the Haganah'' award for record breaking achievement in bond sales. Together with his son, Roy, Herb received the Family Achievement Award of the State of Israel Bonds last year at the International Prime Ministers Club Dinner. The Chaver Award, which Herb is to receive from his temple, is a testament to his continued service on behalf of the community.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the remarkable accomplishments of Charles Mandel as he prepares to receive the Chaver Award from the Highland Park Conservative Temple and Center. Charlie was born in Jersey City, where he graduated from William L. Dickson High School in 1935. He then went on to graduate from Rutgers University with a degree in ceramic engineering in 1939. For the next 42 years, Charlie worked as a plant manager and ceramic engineer with the Willett Company. Following his retirement, Charlie has continued to serve as a consulting engineer for New Jersey Porcelain Company and Lenape Products Company in Trenton, New Jersey. 
   Charlie has been affiliated with the temple since 1953. After officially joining the temple in January 1955, he was appointed Gabbai and continues as Senior Gabbai to this day. Charlie has also served on the Bimah with every temple President from Harry Kroll to the current President, Ed Guttenplan. In addition to these duties, Charlie has played an integral role in the temple's daily management. He was elected to the Temple Board of Trustees in 1955 and has remained there continuously, as a Trustee, Recording Secretary and Financial Secretary. In recognition of his loyalty and commitment, he was granted Honorary Life Membership to the Board of Trustees, a position held by only four other people. 
   Charlie has been active on the Religious Committee, House Committee, Bazaar Committee, and has had the unique experiences of serving on the Rabbinical Search Committees for both Rabbi Yakov Hilsenrath and Rabbi Eliot Malomet. In addition, he was chairman of the Special Fund Raising Committee for forty years. The Special Fund Raising Committee has long been a euphemism for Bingo, which balanced the budget for forty years. Charlie's dedication to managing Bingo resulted in his giving up a myriad of social and family functions on Tuesday evenings. 
   There probably is not an inch of the temple building that has not benefitted from Charlie's commitment and dedication. He has always been willing to give himself to the temple in any capacity whenever and wherever called upon. The entire temple community has been enriched by Charlie's presence, and they are grateful for his support through the years.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Patrick Campbell as he celebrates his retirement from the International Union of Operating Engineers. Pat has been a cornerstone of the labor movement in New Jersey for over fifty years, and he has made equally significant contributions to political and civic life. It is a pleasure for me to be able to honor his past accomplishments. 
   Prior to his career with the IUOE, Pat served admirably in the United States Navy, as a Navy Seabee in the South Pacific during World War II. Upon returning to the United States, Pat joined Local 825, International Union of Operating Engineers and quickly rose through its ranks to occupy numerous leadership positions. The membership of Local 825 recognized Pat's leadership when he was chosen as Business Manager in 1976, and reelected seven times. 
   Pat is Second General Vice President of the International Union of Operating Engineers. As General Vice President, he is delegated to attend many conferences and conventions of the Operating Engineers and also serves on joint committees of the Engineers/Teamsters, Engineers/Laborers, and Engineers/Iron Workers. In addition, Pat is President of the Northeastern Conference of Operating Engineers, and a Vice President of the New Jersey AFL-CIO. 
   Pat's leadership has advanced New Jersey's interests as well. He has served as Vice President of the New Jersey State Building and Construction Trades Council, and has been a delegate to numerous conferences and conventions with the council. Pat has also served on the Port Authority Development Advisory Committee of New York and New Jersey. 
   In addition to his union activities, Pat has served as a scoutmaster for the Boy Scouts of America, has coached Little League girls' softball, and has been Vice President of the Parents' Guild of Roselle Catholic High School. Pat has also been a member of the Catholic War Veterans, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, and the Knights of Columbus. Pat is currently a member of the Council of Regents of Felician College in Lodi, New Jersey, and a member of the Housing Commission of the Archdiocese of Newark. Pat and his wife, Adele, have been married for forty-eight years and are the proud parents of four children and ten grandchildren. 
   Pat's integrity and commitment to New Jersey are two of the qualities I admire most. He has worked to pass these same qualities along to the countless numbers he has faithfully served. Pat's contributions have done much for the future of New Jersey, and our nation as a whole. I congratulate Pat on a job well done, and I wish him the best in retirement.

    Mr. TORRICELLI. Mr. President, Senator MURKOWSKI and I have submitted a resolution that is critical to the future health and well-being of the people of Taiwan and the rest of the world. I rise today to express my support for the resolution regarding the Republic of China on Taiwan's participation in the World Health Organization (WHO). Improving health care in Asia, and around the world, is one of the most important issues facing the international community as we move into the 21st century. Despite the fact that many people are better off today than their parents and grandparents were years ago, we still face tremendous obstacles to establishing basic health care in a number of regions around the world. To this date, children are still not vaccinated, clean water and sanitation are still not available to hundreds of millions of people, curative drugs and treatments are still inaccessible, and over 500,000 mothers die unnecessarily each year in childbirth. 
   The WHO has been instrumental in helping to draw attention to these issues, and to bring needed relief to some of the most underprivileged people in the world. As we all know, sickness and disease span across borders and can affect anyone, regardless of where he or she lives. Here in the United States, we have been lucky enough to enjoy relatively easy access to the newest advances in medical technology and knowledge. However, the people of Taiwan have not been so fortunate. The 21 million citizens of Taiwan are currently barred from accessing the same technologies and techniques through the WHO that many other nations benefit from. 
   In addition, the Taiwan has been frustrated in its attempts to share its own medical knowledge with the rest of the world. Until Taiwan gains membership in the WHO, it cannot contribute its substantial expertise in health care to furthering the organization's goals. We can all benefit from the advances Taiwan has made on its own, and Taiwan can, in turn, improve its own situation by accessing the resources amassed by the WHO. The resolution that Senator MURKOWSKI and I have submitted addresses an issue of basic human decency, and I urge my colleagues to support our efforts to help Taiwan become a member of the WHO.
