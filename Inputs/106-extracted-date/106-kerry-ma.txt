   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey. He is very gracious in doing so. I know he wants to make some important comments that summarize his 18 years of work and commitment on this issue. He is generous to allow us to intervene. 
   I join in thanking the majority leader and the minority leader, Senator DASCHLE, Senator REID, particularly Senator BYRD and Senator STEVENS for responding to the request of a number of us from our region. I thank Senator BIDEN and Senator LAUTENBERG for their leadership again on this issue. 
   There was a lot of passion in our caucus earlier this afternoon, and the minority leader listened to all of us very carefully. Our caucus, I must say, was united in its commitment to the notion that those of us who cared about this issue needed to have some kind of response on the floor that indicated where we will go. I am grateful for this response. 
   The commitment on the floor openly, as it has been given, to proceed as we will proceed, particularly from the distinguished ranking member of the Appropriations Committee and the chairman, is as good a commitment as one can get in the Senate. 
   We have 56 sponsors of this legislation today in the Senate. With the new Senators coming in, I am absolutely confident we will have more than 60 sponsors of this legislation. I look forward to building on the legacy of Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator LAUTENBERG and completing what is absolutely essential for this country, which is a rail system of which the Nation can be proud. 
   I am very grateful to all those who have made this effort. I particularly say about the Senator from New Jersey and the Senator from New York, the two of them will be so missed with respect to their leadership and the vision they have expressed with respect to transportation issues as a whole, but particularly for those of us in the Northeast, what voices they have been in the Senate with respect to their vision for how we can more inexpensively and capably move people from here to  there and increase the productivity of our country. I pledge, along with my other colleagues, to build on their example and on that vision. The day will come when we will all have a better transportation network as a consequence of their leadership. 
   Mr. President, I know that every member of the Congress is anxious to end this session and get back to our states. We all have work to do and families waiting to celebrate the holidays. However, my colleagues Senator LAUTENBERG and Senator BIDEN are right to be angry and frustrated with this legislation. 
   There is a small but extremely significant item missing from this legislation--the High-Speed Rail Investment Act. The Act would allow Amtrak to sell $10 billion in bonds over the next decade and provide tax credits to bondholders in lieu of interest payments. Amtrak would use this money to upgrade existing rail lines to high-speed rail capability. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that the bill would cost just $95 million over 2 years. Over 5 years, the bill would still cost only $762 million. 
   The High-Speed Rail Investment Act has 56 co-sponsors in the Senate. This is not a partisan issue. It is not a regional issue. It is not an urban issue. The High-Speed Rail Investment Act has the support of the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors and the National Conference of State Legislatures. Nineteen newspapers, from the New York Times and Providence Journal, to the Houston Chronicle and Seattle Post Intelligencer, have called for the enactment of this legislation. 
   Let me explain why so many people and organizations support this legislation: 
   It is in our national interest to construct a national infrastructure that is truly intermodal. Rail transportation helps alleviate the stress placed on our environment by air and highway transportation. It is a sad fact that America's rail transportation, and its lack of a national high-speed rail system, lags well behind rail transportation in most other nations--we spend less, per capita, on rail transportation than Estonia, Myanmar, and Botswana. 
   There is a compelling need to invest in high-speed rail. Our highways and skyways are overburdened. Intercity passenger miles have increased 80 percent since 1988, but only 5.5 percent of that has come from increased rail travel. Meanwhile, our congested skies have become even more crowded. The result, predictably, is that air travel delays are up 58 percent since 1995. 
   In the air travel industry, bad weather in one part of the country very often results in delays in other parts of the country. There is consumer demand for more flights. But we know that our skyways and air traffic control systems are finite and that the system is overloaded. 
   Amtrak ridership is on the rise. More than 22.5 million passengers rode Amtrak in Fiscal Year 2000, a million more than the previous year. FY 2000 was the fourth consecutive year that ridership has increased. We should welcome that increased use and support it by giving Amtrak the resources it needs to provide high-quality, dependable service. 
   High-Speed Rail Investment Act is critical to the future of Amtrak. For half the cost of constructing the new Woodrow Wilson Bridge linking Maryland and Virginia, we can create 10 high-speed rail corridors in 28 states. For the cost of the St. Louis Airport expansion, we can improve intercity transportation in 28 states. In October we passed a $58 billion transportation appropriations bill for this fiscal year. What we are talking about today is an additional $95 million over the next two years, which will leverage $2 billion in funding. This is a sound investment. 
   There is an alarming misconception among some members of this body and around the country that Amtrak is a money pit, where taxpayer dollars simply disappear. Nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, the federal government has invested $380 billion in our highways and $160 billion in airports since Amtrak was created. By contrast, the federal government has spent only $23 billion on Amtrak. We have spent just 4 percent of our transportation budget on rail transportation in the last 30 years. 
   Those who criticize Amtrak for not ``turning a profit'' employ a double standard--a double standard that is misleading, unfair and unwise. Between 1985-1995, this country spent $17 billion more on federal highways than it raised through the federal gas tax and highway trust fund. During the same period, the nation spent $30 billion more on aviation expenditures than it received through the aviation trust fund. By their misguided logic, there can be only one solution: since neither of those trust funds operated at cost, we should eliminate these programs. That's nonsense. So why are we failing to adequately invest in rail transportation? 
   Mr. President, high-speed rail is a viable transportation alternative. There is a large and growing demand for rail service in the Northeast Corridor. Amtrak captures almost 70 percent of the business rail and air travel market between Washington and New York and 30 percent of the market share between New York and Boston. High-speed rail will undoubtedly increase that market share. 
   These new trains, like the Acela Express that debuted in the Northeast this year, currently run at an average of only 82 miles per hour, but with track improvements, will run at 130 miles per hour. 
   As a Nation, we have recognized the importance of having the very best communication system, and ours is the envy of the world. That investment is one of reasons our economy is the strongest in the world. And we should do the same for our transportation system. It should be equally modern and must be fully intermodal. And in order to do that, we must invest in rail transportation, invest in Amtrak and be certain to include this inexpensive legislation in the last bill of the 106th Congress.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 and the process to bring this legislation to the floor as part of the Fiscal Year 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill. First, however, I would like to thank Senate Committee on Small Business Chairman KIT BOND, House Small Business Committee Chairman JIM TALENT, House Small Business Committee Ranking Member NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, our staffs, Laura Ayoud with Senate Legislative Counsel and John Ratliff with the House Legislative Counsel's office for their efforts on reauthorizing programs vital to America's small businesses. We have all worked long and hard to get to this point. 
   The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, H.R. 5667, as included in the Fiscal Year 2001 Omnibus Appropriations bill, contains a good portion of the conference report negotiated by the Senate and House Committees on Small Business. Despite the rough start, partisan wrangling over unrelated issues, broken deals and lengthy delays, I am pleased that we can at last pass this legislation so critical to our nation's small businesses. Unfortunately, it is our small businesses that have suffered the most in this climate of uncertainty, waiting, anticipating and hoping that the Congress would complete its work and pass this reauthorization package. 
   While I am pleased that we have reached an agreement that will ensure continuation of valuable Small Business Administration (SBA) programs, I am greatly concerned with the breakdown in the legislative process that has prevented what is normally a bi-partisan reauthorization bill from passing in a timely manner. 
   To briefly elaborate on this, when the original agreement between the Senate and the House was concluded, our bipartisan legislation was commandeered by the Republican leadership and provisions dealing with tax cuts, assisted suicide and medicare give-backs to HMOs were added without my knowledge or consent. The President threatened to veto such a package. 
   Additionally, a Wellstone provision agreed to during negotiations was removed. The Wellstone provision would have created a 3 year $9 million pilot project to build the capacity of community development venture capital firms through research, training and management assistance. Senator WELLSTONE had already agreed to make this program a three year pilot project and cut the funding down from $20 million over four years. But the provision was removed from the Conference Report without consulting either of us. 
   I am also disappointed that some provisions included in the Senate passed version of the Small Business Reauthorization Act, as well as in the Administration's budget request, were not included in the final version of this legislation. The original Senate version contained several provisions important to the Administration, Members of the Senate Small Business Committee and the Senate in general. In the spirit of compromise, the Senate agreed to drop several of these important provisions, with an understanding, in many cases, to revisit these issues in the 107th Congress. 
   Chairman BOND agreed to remove his provision regarding the ``Independent Office of Advocacy Act,'' which I cosponsored, and which passed the Senate as a separate bill. This Committee has heard on more than one occasion that providing separate funding for the Office of Advocacy is the best means to ensure its autonomy. I look forward to working with the Chairman on this issue in the next Congress. A provision requested by Senator TED STEVENS setting up a HUBZone pilot program in Alaska and a provision requested by Senator DIANNE FEINSTEIN to allow fruit and vegetable packing houses hit by the 1998 freeze to participate in the SBA's Disaster Loan program were removed as well. I have assured Senator FEINSTEIN that the Committee will look further into this matter in the next Congress in an effort to allow the SBA to provide relief if it is warranted. 
   A provision requested by the Administration and strongly supported by Senator PAUL WELLSTONE and myself was also dropped. This provision would have created a Native American Small Business Development Center (SBDC) Network that would have worked together with the traditional SBDC Network, but would have been separately funded. I have received assurances from both Chairman BOND and the House Committee on Small Business that this issue will be addressed in the next Congress, along with concerns raised by Senator INOUYE about the participation of Native Hawaiian Organizations in the 8(a) program. The Senate and House Committees on Small Business are in agreement that this is an important issue for Native Americans, considered a disadvantaged group for the purposes of SBA programs, and one that needs greater focus. 
   Provisions regarding the Quadrennial Small Business Summit, the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act, Development Company Debenture Interest Rates, Fraud and False Statements and Financial Institution Civil Penalties were also removed. 
   The final version of this legislation does include some of the provisions I requested regarding improvements to the Microloan program. The changes to the Microloan program stemmed from the President's Fiscal Year 2001 budget request and had broad support in the Senate, as well the support of several Members of the House Committee on Small Business. I have long been a firm believer in microloans and their power to help people gain economic independence while improving the communities in which they live. With a relatively small investment, the Microloan program helps turn ideas into small businesses adding up to sel-sufficiency for many families and big returns for the taxpayers. 
   Changes to the program, which resulted from a roundtable Committee meeting in the Senate and discussions with the Administration and users of the Microloan program, will be a great  boon to the effectiveness and availability of Microloans. Specifically, provisions increasing the maximum loan amount from $25,000 to $35,000 and increasing the average loan size to $15,000 were included. However, changes to make the program more effective, such as increasing the number of intermediaries or authorizing reimbursement for peer-to-peer mentoring, were weakened or removed because the House did not have time to hold hearings and study them thoroughly. 
   I believe all of the changes in the Senate bill make sense, have broad bipartisan and bicameral support, and would go a long way toward providing increased access to capital, especially for minority entrepreneurs. I want to make it clear to my colleagues who support the Microloan program that I will continue my efforts to strengthen this program and will work with Chairman BOND and our House counterparts to make these remaining improvements in the next Congress. I also intend to revisit the Microloan funding issue before the end of the three-year reauthorization period if the level authorized is inadequate to meet program needs. 
   While I am disappointed that some of the Senate changes were not included in the final compromise, this legislation is crucial for our nation's small businesses. It reauthorizes all of the SBA's programs, setting the funding levels for the credit and business development programs, and making selected improvements. Without this legislation, the 504 loan program and the Small Business Innovation Research program would shut down; the venture capital debenture program would shut down; and funding to the states for their small business development centers would be in jeopardy. 
   The SBA's contribution is significant. In the past eight years, the SBA has helped almost 375,000 small businesses get more than $80 billion in loans. That's double what small businesses had received in the preceding 40 years since the agency's creation. The SBA is better run than ever before, with four straight years of clean financial audits; it has a quarter less staff, but guarantees twice as many loans; and its credit and finance programs are a bargain. For a relatively small investment, taxpayers are leveraging their money to help thousands of small businesses every year and fuel the economy. 
   Let me just give you one example. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers spend only $1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well known successes like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are clear examples of the program's effectiveness. 
   Overall, I agree with the program levels in the three-year reauthorization bill. As I said during the Small Business Committee's hearing on SBA's budget earlier in the year, I believe the program levels are realistic and appropriate based on the growing demand for the programs and the prosperity of the country. I also think they are adequate should the economy slow down and lenders have less cash to invest. Consistent with SBA's mission, in good times or bad, we need to make sure that small businesses have access to credit and capital so that our economy benefits from the services, products and jobs they provide. As First Lady and Senator-elect HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON says, we don't want good ideas dying in the parking lot of banks. We also want a safety net when our states are hit hard by a natural disaster. There are many members of this Chamber, and their constituents, who know all too well the value of SBA disaster loans after floods, fires and tornadoes. 
   Mr. President, I am extremely pleased that we included legislation to extend the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program for 8 more years as part of this comprehensive SBA reauthorization bill. While I am very sorry the process has taken this long, in no way should that imply that there is not strong support for the SBIR program, the Small Business Administration, or our nation's innovative small businesses. 
   The SBIR program is of vital importance to the high-technology sector throughout the country. For the past decade, growth in the high-technology field has been a major source of the resurgence of the American economy we now enjoy. While many Americans know of the success of Microsoft, Oracle, and many of the dot.com companies, few realize that it is America's small businesses, working in industries like software, hardware, medical research, aerospace technologies, and bio-technology, that are helping to fuel this resurgence--and that it is the SBIR program that makes much of this possible. By setting aside Federal research and development dollars specifically for small high-tech businesses, the SBIR program is making important contributions to our economy. 
   These companies have helped launch the space shuttle; conducted research on Hepatitis C; and made B-2 Bomber missions safer and more effective. 
   Since the start of the SBIR program in 1983, more than 17,600 firms have received over $9.8 billion in SBIR funding agreements. In 1999 alone, nearly $1.1 billion was awarded to small high-tech firms through the SBIR program, assisting more than 4,500 firms. 
   The SBIR program has been, and remains, an excellent example of how government and small business can work together to advance the cause of both science and our economy. Access to risk capital is vital to the growth of small high technology companies, which accounted for more then 40 percent of all jobs in the high technology sector of our economy in 1998. The SBIR program gives these companies access to Federal research and development money and encourages those who do the research to commercialize their results. Because research is crucial to ensuring that our nation is the leader in knowledge-based industries, which will generate the largest job growth in the next century, the SBIR program is a good investment for the future. 
   I am proud of the many SBIR successes that have come from my state of Massachusetts. Companies like Advanced Magnetics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, illustrate that success. Advanced Magnetics used SBIR funding to develop a drug making it easier for hospitals to find tumors in patients. The development of this drug increased company sales and allowed Advanced Magnetics to hire additional employees. This is exactly the kind of economic growth we need in this nation, because jobs in the high-technology field pay well and raise everyone's standard of living. That is why I am such a strong supporter and proponent of the SBIR program and fully support its reauthorization. 
   This legislation also includes my legislation establishing a New Markets Venture Capital program at SBA. This small business legislation is designed to promote economic development, business investment, productive wealth and stable jobs in ``new markets,'' low- and moderate-income communities where there is little to no sustainable economic activity but many overlooked business opportunities. The venture capital program is modeled after the Small Business Administration's successful Small Business Investment Company program. The SBIC program has been so successful that it has generated more than $19 billion in investments in more than 13,000 businesses since 1992. 
   With the passage of the ``New Markets'' legislation, low- and moderate-income areas will have increased opportunities to join the economic boom in America and this targeted venture capital will make a powerful difference in places like the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East Harlem, and rural areas like Kentucky's Appalachia or the Mississippi's Delta region. 
   This legislation also contains H.R. 2614, which reauthorizes SBA's 504 loan program, which passed the Senate on June 14, 2000. The bill and our improvements make common-sense changes to this critical economic development tool. These changes will greatly increase the opportunity for small business owners to build a facility, buy more equipment, or acquire a new building. In turn, small business owners will be able to expand their companies and hire new workers, ultimately resulting in an improved local economy. 
   Since 1980, over 25,000 businesses have received more than $20 billion in fixed-asset financing through the 504 program. In my home state of Massachusetts, over the last decade small businesses have received $318 million in 504 loans that created more than 10,000 jobs. The stories behind those numbers say a lot about how SBA's 504 loans  help business owners and communities. For instance, in Fall River, Massachusetts, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a custom packing plant for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to 30 employees in just two short years and is in the process of another expansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs. 
   Under this reauthorization bill, the maximum debenture size for Section 504 loans has been increased from $750,000 to $1 million. For loans that meet special public policy goals, the maximum debenture size has been increased from $1 million to $1.3 million. It has been a decade since we increased the maximum guarantee amount. If we were to change it to keep pace with inflation, the maximum guarantee would be approximately $1.25 million instead of $1 million. By not implementing such a sharp increase, we are striking a balance between rising costs and increasing the government's exposure. 
   I am pleased to say that this legislation also includes a provision assisting women-owned businesses, which I first introduced in 1998 as part of S. 2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. This provision adds women-owned businesses to the current list of businesses eligible for the larger public policy loans. As the role of women-owned businesses in our economy continues to increase, we would be remiss if we did not encourage their growth and success by adding them to this list. 
   Mr. President, the 504 loan program gets results. It expands the opportunities of small businesses, creates jobs and improves communities. It is crucial that it be reauthorized, I am pleased this legislation has been included in this package. 
   Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) are also reauthorized under this legislation. SBDCs serve tens of thousands of small business owners and prospective owners every year. This bill takes a giant step to retool the formula that determines how much funding each state receives. This is an important program for all of our states and we want no confusion about its funding. Without this change, some states would have suffered sharp decreases in funding, disproportionate to their needs. I appreciate and am glad that the SBA and the Association of Small Business Development Centers worked with me to develop an acceptable formula so that small businesses continue to be adequately served. As I said previously, I plan to revisit the Native American SBDC Network issue next Congress. 
   This legislation also reauthorized the National Women's Business Council. For such a tiny office, with minimal funding and staff, it has managed to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the impact of women-owned businesses in our economy. It has also done pioneer work in raising awareness of business practices that work against women-owned business, such as some in the area of Federal procurement. Recently, the Council completed two studies that documented the world of Federal procurement and its impact on women-owned businesses. 
   According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, over the past decade, the number of women-owned businesses in this country has grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms. These firms generate almost $3.6 trillion in sales annually and employ more than 27.5 million workers. With the impact of women-owned businesses on our economy increasing at an unprecedented rate, Congress relies on the National Women's Business Council to serve as its eyes and ears as it anticipates the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. Since it was established in 1988, the bipartisan Council has provided important unbiased advice and counsel to Congress. 
   This Act recognizes the Council's work and re-authorizes it for three years, from FY 2001 to 2003. It also increases the annual appropriation from $600,000 to $1 million, which will allow the council to support new and ongoing research, and produce and distribute reports and recommendations prepared by the Council. 
   The Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or ``HUBZone'' program, which passed this Committee in 1997, has tremendous potential to create economic prosperity and development in those areas of our Nation that have not seen great rewards, even in this time of unprecedented economic health and stability. This program is similar to my New Markets legislation in that it creates an incentive to hire from, and perform work in, areas of this country that need assistance the most. This bill would authorize the HUBZone program at $10 million for the next 3 years, which is $5 million above the Administration's request. 
   Additionally, this legislation includes very important provisions to allow those groups which were inadvertently missed when this legislation was crafted--namely Indian tribal governments and Alaska Native Corporations--to participate in the program. I appreciate the willingness of the Committee on Indian Affairs to work with our Committee to create increased HUBZone opportunities for Native Americans. 
   As I stated, the HUBZone section does not contain any provision addressing the interaction of the HUBZone and 8(a) minority contracting programs. I believe that the 8(a) program is an important and necessary tool to help minority small businesses receive access to government contracts. The Chairman and I agree that there is a need to enhance the participation of both 8(a) and HUBZone companies in Federal procurement. It is my intention that the Senate Committee on Small Business consider the issue of enhancing small business procurement in the next Congress. 
   This legislation also includes a provision relating to SBA's cosponsorship authority. This authority allows SBA and its programs to cosponsor events and activities with private sector entities, thus leveraging the Agency's limited resources. The legislation extends this authority for three additional years. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding my colleagues that all of our states benefit from the success and abundance of small businesses. This legislation makes their jobs a little easier. I ask my colleagues for their support of this important legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of provisions in the Consolidated Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 that would transfer a Coast Guard lighthouse on Plum Island to the city of Newburyport, Massachusetts and land on Nantucket Island from the Coast Guard Loran station to the town of Nantucket, Massachusetts. I wish to thank the conferees for including these provisions in this bill. 
   Mr. President, the Plum Island lighthouse is a national treasure. This conveyance ensures that this historic treasure will be preserved and protected for generations to come. This was included at the request of my constituents in the area. The Coast Guard has always been a good friend and neighbor in Massachusetts. I am pleased that this historic landmark will transferred to Newburyport so that it can be preserved and protected for the citizens and visitors of the City to enjoy for years to come. 
   Mr. President, the town of Nantucket needs a small amount of property from the Coast Guard Loran Station to build a sewage treatment plant. The Coast Guard has been working with local government officials on the Island to find a solution to this problem. Initially the Coast Guard considered leasing this property to Nantucket, however the Coast Guard later determined that a conveyance was the better solution. I applaud the Coast Guard for working with Nantucket to develop this workable solution.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision in the Consolidated Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001 that would transfer Coast Guard Station Scituate to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA. NOAA will use the facility to serve as the headquarters for the Gerry E. Studds Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary. Since the mid-90s the Coast Guard has shared the facility with both NOAA and the Massachusetts Environmental Police, MEP. Once the Coast Guard has relocated to a new facility NOAA and the MEP will jointly use the facility to both manage and study the marine sanctuary and to perform cooperative enforcement on the water. I am happy to report that NOAA is teaming with the MEP to share resources and facilities to improve fisheries and sanctuary enforcement. It is my understanding that NOAA will be offering the same working and living spaces to the MEP that have been provided in the past by the U.S. Coast Guard. In addition the MEP will have the same berthing and dock space for their vessels. Furthermore it is my understanding that this agreement between the two agencies will mirror the current U.S. Coast Guard agreement with the MEP with respect to terms and conditions. 
   The Stellwagen Bank Sanctuary is located at the mouth of Massachusetts Bay. It was first described in the diary of Captain Henry Stellwagen, a hydrographer for the U.S. Navy, as ``an important discovery in the location of a fifteen fathom bank lying in a line between Cape Cod and Cape Ann.'' The wealth of sea life that moved below the surface of Captain Stellwagen's vessel has drawn commercial fishing fleets for centuries. The continued use for maritime commerce, whether shipping, fishing or whale watching excursions, presents a major challenge in the enforcement of sanctuary rules. 
   Today the sanctuary draws as many as one million visitors a year, many of them whale watchers, intent on experiencing a close encounter with a whale--particularly the gregarious and acrobatic humpback. While its numbers at Stellwagen Bank are relatively strong, the species is nevertheless listed as endangered based on its worldwide numbers. The Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act have been enacted to help protect this and other species; but the oceans are large and enforcement is difficult. I applaud the cooperation shown by NOAA and the MEP to address this critical issue in the sanctuary. This conveyance of property form the Coast Guard to NOAA will solidify this relationship between the MEP and NOAA and will at the same time provide office space and research facilities for teams of scientists to study one of the true treasures of New England, the Stellwagen Bank National Marine Sanctuary.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of a provision in H.R. 2903, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act. This legislation authorizes a population study of Atlantic striped bass to determine if there is sufficient diversity in year classes to ensure successful recruitment and healthy stocks for continued commercial and recreational fishing. 
   The Atlantic striped bass is considered one of the success stories in recent fisheries management. Striped bass stocks along the Atlantic coast experienced precipitous declines during the 1970s and early 1980s. This decline was attributed to the increase in the number of recreational and commercial fishermen, and the use of increasingly efficient gear. Because the decline was widespread and encompassed multiple jurisdictions, recovery efforts were delegated to the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission (ASMFC) under the authority of the Striped Bass Conservation Act of 1984, and later the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Act of 1993. The ASMFC consists of coastal member states from Maine to Florida. 
   In an effort to rebuild striped bass stocks, the ASMFC halted both commercial and recreational fishing for striped bass beginning in the mid- 1980s. The ASMFC began to allow limited recreational and commercial fishing for striped bass in the early 1990s, when striped bass began to show signs of recovery. Today even though stock abundance remains high, cautious vigilance of coast-wide fisheries performance and its impact on resource conditions should continue to be a primary task of the ASMFC. 
   The Atlantic Striped Bass, or stripers as they are known in the Bay state, are the number one recreational fishery in Massachusetts. In 1999 recreational fishermen caught 4.7 million stripers in the Bay state, this represents 33 percent of all stripers caught along the East coast from North Carolina to Maine. While most states allow anglers to keep two fish, Massachusetts allows anglers one fish, so that even though 33 percent of all stripers are caught in Massachusetts, only 10 percent of the recreational landings occur in Massachusetts. The difference between caught and landed fish is fish caught and released. Massachusetts has a small commercial fishery for the striped bass as well. In 1999 commercial fishermen landed 40,000 stripers, which represented 4 percent of the commercial harvest on the East coast. 
   These figures do not even begin to represent what stripers mean to our economy. In a 1996 US Fish and Wildlife Service survey the agency estimated that 886,000 anglers spent 10.7 million days fishing for striped bass in salt water during 1996. Average expenditures for all Atlantic Coast saltwater trips were about $800 per angler in 1996, for a total estimated annual expenditure in this fishery of $762 million. 
   Stripers are an anadromous fish that frequents brackish waters and depends on a healthy estuarine ecosystem for its survival. As such, it is affected by non-point source pollution and habitat loss and degradation, more so than an offshore fish. I am very concerned that without a national program to identify and reduce sources of non-point pollution, that eventually our striper stocks will again crash as they did in the 1970s. On two occasions the United States Senate has passed S. 1534, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000.  This bill authorizes states to apply for funding that specifically targets non-point pollution, and in turn help striped bass populations. Mr. President, the sound policies of S. 1534 will help the striped bass.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is much to applaud in the bill we are taking up today, H.R. 5640, ``The American Homeownership and Economic Opportunity Act.'' I note that this legislation is identical to legislation I have cosponsored, S. 3274. 
   Some of the provisions of H.R. 5640 are contained in bipartisan legislation, S. 2733, which I have introduced with my colleagues Senator SANTORUM, Senator SARBANES, and others. These are designed to increase the stock of affordable housing for elderly and disabled Americans by expanding the pool of available capital. It will also expand the availability of services to help improve the quality of life for elderly and residents of HUD-assisted properties and other eligible people in the neighborhood. 
   The legislation also includes important reforms to the manufactured housing statute. These reforms provide significant new consumer protections for owners of manufactured homes. For example, the bill creates national minimum installation standards to make sure manufactured homes are not just manufactured correctly--an area that has long been under federal control--but that they are installed properly and perform as advertised to provide high quality, safe, durable, and affordable housing for their occupants. 
   In addition, the new law establishes a dispute resolution process which, for the first time, will enable a consumer determine whether a problem with a manufactured home is due to a manufacturing or installation defect, and then get the defect corrected. 
   Overall, the manufactured housing title of this bill will modernize the regulatory structure for the industry in a way that gives consumers a full and equal voice. Such modernization will help the industry incorporate new technologies more quickly, making this housing more efficient, more attractive, safer, and cheaper. Manufactured housing can and should be a bigger part of this nation's effort to address the rising need for affordable housing. This legislation will help make this a reality. 
   I also concur with remarks made in the House of Representatives by Chairman LEACH and Representatives LAFALCE and FRANK in the House on October 24, 2000, regarding the issue of contracting out certain monitoring and oversight functions required by the legislation. HUD needs to be able to manage these contracts in a way that allows them to get the work done. 
   Finally, I thank Senator SHELBY for his leadership on this issue. Senator SHELBY deserves great credit for making this legislation possible. He worked through every issue and concern raised by the various parties to make this day possible. I also thank Lendell Porterfield from the staff of Senator SHELBY. Mr. Porterfield was highly professional and extremely knowledgeable. He provided the leadership at a staff level that enabled this bill to become law. In addition, Senator EDWARDS and his staff, Josh Stein, were instrumental in negotiating the final compromise. They ensured that the interests of consumers were balanced with the needs of industry. Likewise, the leadership of Senator SARBANES and his staff helped ensure that this process would continue to be bipartisan and productive. Senator BAYH also played an important role. I want to make a special note of the work of Christen Schaefer of the Banking Committee staff, without whose hard work and dedication this legislation could not become law.  
   There are many other solid achievements in this legislation that will improve housing opportunities for many Americans. 
   However, as much as there is to welcome in this bill, it is as notable for what is missing. Most importantly, this bill does not include any of the numerous bipartisan proposals, some of which passed the House with overwhelming majorities, that would provide for the preservation of existing affordable housing that is fast being lost; nor does it include any of the bipartisan proposals to facilitate the construction of new affordable housing. In particular, I very much regret the exclusion of the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund legislation that I introduced with a number of my colleagues from both sides of the aisle. Finally, it does not include some important provisions that would encourage and support homeownership, such as low downpayment FHA loans for teachers, police officers, and other municipal employees. 
   Everyone who has looked at the issue of housing with an open mind, or has tried to purchase or rent a home, understands that we face an affordable housing crisis. A recent study issued by the National Low Income Housing Coalition highlights the fact that there is no city, county, or state where a minimum wage job is adequate to enable a working person to afford the typical rent on 2 bedroom home. In tight markets such as Boston, New York, Denver, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Austin, San Francisco, and many others around the country, affordable housing is out of reach to average working families. 
   The Federal Government has an important role to play here, and I will be working very hard in the upcoming Congress to make sure that we pass new legislation, such as my trust fund legislation, that will get the Government back in the business of encouraging the production of new affordable housing. 
   I support the legislation before us, and I hope that my colleagues will join me in the coming Congress to complete the effort we have begun here today.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly believe that reform of our bankruptcy laws is necessary. During the 105th and 106th Congress, I supported legislation to reform bankruptcy laws and end the abuse of the system. However, I am unable to support the conference report of the Bankruptcy Reform Bill because I believe it is unfair and unbalanced, was completed without appropriate consideration by the Minority party, and is unfair to many working families and single mothers. Sponsors of bankruptcy reform have justified the legislation by arguing that the bill is necessary because we are in the midst of a ``bankruptcy crisis.'' I am among those who believe that, too often, bankruptcy is used as an economic tool to avoid responsibility for unsound decisions and reckless spending. There has been a decline in the stigma of filing for bankruptcy, and appropriate changes are necessary to ensure that bankruptcy is no longer considered a lifestyle choice. However, I must point out that the current numbers show that the bankruptcy rate is lower than it was when the bill was first introduced. Indeed, if the bankruptcy reform act had been enacted into law, the sponsors would undoubtedly now be taking credit for this turnaround in the bankruptcy numbers. However, the current decline came about without Congressional intervention, demonstrating that to some degree, free-market forces work to correct any over-use of the bankruptcy system. The reason is that lenders and credit card companies, in an effort to maximize their profits, can and do respond to an unexpected increase in personal bankruptcies by curtailing new lending to consumers who are credit risks. However, there are still those who will game the system, and we should narrowly craft legislation to address such abuse. Unfortunately, this bill fails to take a balanced approach to bankruptcy reform. I had hoped that through a legitimate legislative process we would arrive at a compromise that would have ended the abuses but still provided our most vulnerable citizens with adequate protections. This bill does just the opposite: It harms those who most need bankruptcy protection and protects those who don't. For instance, the bill's safe harbor will not benefit individuals in most need of help. Because the safe harbor is based on the combined income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse, many single mothers who are separated from their husbands and who are not receiving child support will not be able to take advantage of the safe harbor provision. In other words, a single mother who is being deprived of needed support from a well-off spouse is further harmed by this bill, which will deem the full income of that spouse available to pay debts for the safe harbor determination. Moreover, the bill jeopardizes the post-bankruptcy collection of child support. By creating many new types of nondischargeable debts in favor of credit card companies, the bill would place banks in direct competition with single parents trying to collect child support after bankruptcy. In addition, the bill gives creditors new levers to coerce reaffirmations, in which debtors must agree to pay back debts that otherwise would have been discharged, so that those debts also will compete with child support obligations. Finally, the claim of the bill's sponsors that it ``puts child support first'' is an example of the worst kind of Washington cynicism. Although the bill moves child support claims from seventh to first priority in Chapter 7 cases, the provision is virtually meaningless because almost no Chapter 7 cases involve any distribution of assets to creditors. Few debtors have any assets to distribute to priority unsecured creditors after secured creditors receive the value of their collateral. Therefore, this change would affect fewer than 1 percent of cases. On the other hand, the conference report protects wealthy debtors by allowing them to use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. The homestead exemption has been used by wealthy individuals to shelter millions of dollars in expensive homes to avoid repaying their creditors. The Conference Report would delete the Senate amendment that provided a firm homestead cap of $100,000 and instead allow wealthy debtors to retain expensive homes while filing for bankruptcy, so long as the debtor owned the property for two years before the bankruptcy filing. Because wealthier debtors would have no difficulty tying up their creditors for a relatively short period of time, the two-year residency requirement would have no real effect on debtors moving to states with unlimited homestead amounts to take advantage of this loophole. The bill changes nothing, as long as the well-counseled debtor makes his homestead purchase at least 24 months before filing. But, the 24-month rule unfairly differentiates between consumers who are sophisticated enough to plan in advance for homestead protection and which are not. 
   The whole point of bankruptcy reform is to create accountability for both creditors and debtors. The first part of that equation is missing entirely in H.R. 2415. At the same time, the bill fails in any way to impose any restrictions on these industries with regard to the way they provide credit to those who can least afford to incur a great deal of debt. The bill does not require important specific disclosures on monthly credit card statements that would show the time it will take to pay a balance and the cost of the credit if only minimum payments are made. This type of disclosure was included in the legislation passed by the Senate in 1998 and should be part of any reform bill. The conference report also excludes Senate-passed amendments that would have provided credit information in electronic credit card applications over the Internet and protections against finance charges being imposed on credit card payments made within the creditor-provided grace period. It also does nothing to discourage lenders from further increasing the debt of consumers who are already overburdened with debt. 
   I am also very disappointed that the conference report does not include an amendment offered by Senator COLLINS and myself, which was included in the Senate bill, that would make Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, which now applies to family farmers, applicable for fishermen. I believe that this provision would have made bankruptcy a more effective tool to help fishermen reorganize effectively and allow them to keep fishing while they do so. 
   Finally, this bill is the result of a conference process that was a sham. In October, the House appointed conferees for the Bankruptcy Reform Act and without holding a conference meeting, the Majority filed a conference report striking international security legislation and replacing it with a reference to a bankruptcy reform bill introduced earlier that same day. This makes a mockery of the legislative process and demeans the United States Senate. I  am hopeful that during the 107th Congress, we can develop bipartisan legislation that would encourage responsibility and reduce abuses of the bankruptcy system.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks in support of H.R. 5461, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, which will the Senate has passed today and which will be forwarded to President Clinton for his signature. 
   H.R. 5461 is identical to a provision I authored, along with Senator SNOWE, in Senate Amendment 4320. That provision was then introduced in the House by Representative CUNNINGHAM as a stand alone bill and passed the House on October 30, 2000. I want to thank Senators HOLLINGS and SNOWE, who helped move this legislation through the Commerce Committee and the Senate. And, I thank Representative CUNNINGHAM for his work. 
   Shark finning is the practice of catching a shark, removing its fins and returning the remainder of the shark to the sea. It is highly wasteful practice since only a very small portion of the shark is consumed and the rest is dumped back into the sea. The National Marine Fisheries Service already prohibits shark finning in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. This legislation would expand that ban into the Pacific and create a consistent national policy by amending the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. 
   Sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable species in the ocean. Their slow growth, late maturity and small number of offspring leave them exceptionally vulnerable to over fishing and slow to recover from depletion. At the same time, sharks, as top predators, are essential to maintaining the balance of life in the sea. While many of our other highly migratory species such as tunas and swordfish are subject to rigorous management regimes, sharks have largely been overlooked until recently. By ending the wasteful practice of finning, we will, I hope, protect shark populations. 
   However, it is important that the passage of this legislation is only the beginning of national efforts to protect sharks and their marine ecosystems. There are other threats to sharks in addition to finning in domestic waters. These include directed fisheries, by-catch and the use of non-selective gear. And, importantly, we must recognize that shark finning takes place in foreign and international waters, not just the United States waters. The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around the world. We must tackle these issues, as well. 
   I want to note that in the Commerce Committee we tried to address the issue of international shark finning more aggressively and, I believe, more appropriately. Senator HOLLINGS and I introduced S. 2831, the Shark Conservation Act of 2000. This proposal would have (1) mandated that the Secretary of Commerce report to Congress on progress being made domestically and internationally to reduce shark finning; (2) established a procedure to certify whether governments have adopted shark conservation measures; (3) banned the import of sharks or shark parts from countries that do not meet these certification procedures; and (4) provided technical assistance to foreign nations in an attempt to promote compliance. 
   Unfortunately, this comprehensive proposal was rejected by the House. We therefore sought the middle ground of the proposal in H.R. 5461. The legislation we will pass today (1) calls on the Administration to initiate or continue discussions with other countries to ban shark finning; (2) requires the collection of information on trade in shark fins and directing the Secretary of Commerce to report the findings to Congress; and (3) establishes a research program to help improve shark stock assessments, reduce incidental catch, and better utilize shark captured legally. This is a start, but only a start. I hope that my colleagues and the advocacy groups that advocated for this proposal will continue to work for additional international conservation measures. 
   Finally, my bill would authorize a Western Pacific longline fisheries cooperative research program to provide information for shark stock assessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or minimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of released sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade. 
   Mr. President, the United States is a global leader in fisheries conservation and management. I believe this legislation provides us the opportunity to further this role, and take the first step in addressing an international fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the U.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and international conventions to achieve coordinated international management of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning. I look forward to working with Committee members on this important legislation.

However, I am very disappointed that I am unable to support the conference report of the Bankruptcy Reform Bill because I believe it is unfair and unbalanced, was completed without appropriate consideration by the Minority party, includes an inequitable homestead provision and is unfair to many working families. 
   I am very concerned that the decision to file for bankruptcy is too often used as an economic tool to avoid responsibility for unsound business decisions and reckless acts by both individuals and businesses. There has been a decline in the stigma of filing for bankruptcy and appropriate changes are necessary to ensure that bankruptcy is no longer considered a lifestyle choice. 
   This legislation includes a number of important reforms which I support. I am pleased that the small business provisions originally included in the Senate bill have been changed to give small businesses adequate time to develop a reorganization plan during bankruptcy proceedings. I had previously included an amendment to the Senate bill that increased this time for small businesses. I am also pleased that the conference report includes my amendment to expand the credit committee membership under Chapter 11 bankruptcies to include small businesses. I believe this will ensure better access and information for small businesses creditors. Unfortunately, reasonable and necessary reforms were included in a bill that on the whole fails to take a balanced approach to bankruptcy reform. I had hoped that through a legitimate legislative process we would arrive at a compromise that would have ended the abuses but still provided our most vulnerable citizens with adequate protections. Instead, I believe that the conference report protects wealthy debtors by allowing them to use overly broad homestead exemptions to shield assets from their creditors. The Senate passed, by a bipartisan vote of 76-22, an amendment to create a $100,000 nationwide cap on any homestead exemption. However, this provision was not included in the Conference Report. Instead, the conferees included a meaningless cap with a two-year residency requirement that wealthy debtors could easily avoid. Moreover, the bill's safe harbor is illusory and will not benefit individuals in most need of help. Because the safe harbor is based on the combined income of the debtor and the debtor's spouse, many single mothers who are separated from their husbands and who are not receiving child support will not be able to take advantage of the safe harbor provision.

I believe that this provision would have made bankruptcy a more effective tool to help fishermen reorganize effectively and allow them to keep fishing while they do so. 
   In addition to its failure to protect many consumers, the bill fails to require that the credit industry share responsibility for reducing the number of bankruptcy cases. It does not require specific disclosures on monthly credit card statements that would show the time it would take to pay off a balance and the cost of credit if only minimum payments are made. It also does nothing to discourage lenders from further increasing the debt of consumers who are already overburdened with debt. 
   Finally, this bill is the result of a conference process that violated and deprived the rights of Senators. In October, the House appointed conferees for the Bankruptcy Reform Act and without holding a conference meeting, the Majority filed a conference report striking international security legislation and replacing with a reference to a bankruptcy reform bill introduced earlier that same day. This makes a mockery of the legislative process and demeans the United States Senate.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are beginning debate this morning on what is ostensibly the conference report of the Small Business Committee of which I have the pleasure to serve as the ranking member. Obviously, nobody has any illusions that what the debate on the floor of the Senate today is about is small business issues. This is the so-called tax bill that has been attached to the Small Business conference report. But let me say a word, if I may, about the process by which how this package was made a part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000. 
   Despite being named a conferee, and despite the inclusion of provisions that are important to small business, and despite the fact that this conference report contains the work of the Small Business Committee and which I devoted a considerable amount of time effort and energy to negotiating, I will be voting against the overall conference report before us today.

   Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my colleague from Nebraska, he is absolutely correct. That is exactly what has happened. That is exactly the state of affairs. In point of fact, let me say as a matter of courtesy, in terms of the process of the Senate, as ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I was never called, never asked, never even presented this conference report for signature, never even told as a matter of courtesy what would go into this package and happen to the hard work of the Small Business Committee. It was simply done in the dead of night and presented to us, fait accompli, to the Congress. 
   I think all of us have the right to ask, as Senators, what kind of courtesy is this we are being afforded as a matter of just collegial relations within the Senate. I think this process shows a fundamental disrespect for this institution, for the constitutional process and members of the Senate. 
   But, let me say to my colleague from Nebraska, here is what has been stuffed in this bill, to use the term by which he has appropriately described it. This is a small business bill. But, without any hearings, without any appropriate bipartisan decision, this bill is brought to the floor of the Senate today with H.R. 5538, as it was introduced, the Minimum Wage Act; 
   H.R. 5542, as it was introduced, the Taxpayer Relief Act, which goes to the issue of the tax cuts; H.R. 5543, the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act, entirely outside the purview of the Small Business Committee; it comes with H.R. 5544, the Pain Relief Promotion Act, an entirely controversial and, as we will discuss through the course of this day, potentially very dangerous and damaging measure with respect to the delivery of quality medical care in this country; and, H.R. 5545, the Small Business Reauthorization Act, which was already mentioned. 
   The Senator from Nebraska is absolutely correct about the impact, the substance, and the process here.

   Mr. KERRY. I say to my colleague from the State of North Dakota, he is again absolutely correct, in that the only portion of this bill discussed amongst the conferees was the Small  Business Reauthorization Act. I was never consulted as to what additional measures were included. And, in many respects, it is even worse than he has described. As I said, there was a conference on which we worked hard with respect to small business legislation itself, but that conference is not even properly reflected in the small business bill that has been brought here because this is a changed small business bill. It is not completely the Reauthorization package that we had conferenced. It has been changed without the courtesy of involving those of us on this side of the aisle, obviously without the debate that would have had the impact the Senator from North Dakota cites. 
   I have here the letter from the President of the United States in which he promises this report will be vetoed. I know the leadership on the other side of the aisle has read this and notwithstanding that the President has promised that this will be vetoed and notwithstanding the fact that the President is making it very clear to the American people and to our colleagues why it will be vetoed, they, nevertheless, have seen fit to simply bring this to the floor and, so to speak, stuff it through the Senate. Why? To create a political issue or perhaps simply to be stubborn and try to set up the President for some possible political gain. 
   This is precisely what George Bush himself has been talking about: partisanship, bickering, the very kind of thing that supposedly he says he could control here and on which he has been campaigning. He was asked to make one phone call to stop this and he will not even make that phone call. Here we are debating, and people are wondering why we are here. Why debate this measure just so it can be vetoed. Why not bring up the Patients' Bill of Rights, or provide a prescription drug benefit for seniors under Medicare instead of wasting time?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the President said:  
   While we have already reached substantial agreement in important areas, such as replacement of the Foreign Sales Corporation regime, your legislation--  
   He is writing to the House and Senate Republican leaders--  
   your legislation has substantial flaws in key areas. As I stated yesterday--  
   This is the President of the United States saying this--  
   I believe it is absolutely essential that we do as much as possible to meet America's need for safe and modern schools. It is estimated that there may be as much as a $125 billion financing gap in meeting the school construction and modernization needs of our children. The bipartisan Rangel-Johnson proposal to finance $25 billion in bonds to construct and modernize 6,000 schools is, quite frankly, the very least we should do, given the magnitude of this problem and its importance to America's future. Unfortunately, your proposal falls far short of the mark.  
   So yesterday, and in prior discussions for weeks, the President made it very clear this falls short; this will not be sufficient; he will veto it. Nevertheless, we are here. 
   The President goes on to say:  
   We should not sacrifice thousands of modernized schools to pay for inefficient tax incentives that help only a few. For example, the arbitrage provision encourages delay in urgently needed school construction and would disproportionately help wealthy school districts.  
   Health care is perhaps one of the most important components of this bill. The Senator from Nebraska raised this same point--we are talking about the health care system of the country. It has been an enormously divisive and complicated issue within the Finance Committee. Suddenly, in the dead of night, it is just snatched out, a proposal is sent to the floor as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 and people are surprised that the President may decide he is going to veto it and that those of us on this side of the aisle might have objections to that piece of legislation coming to the floor in this manner. 
   Nobody should be surprised about our concerns under these unusual circumstances.  
   This is what the President says:  
   On health care, my offer sought to lay a path to common ground by coupling both of our priorities on health and long-term care.  
   In other words, the President sought to find the common ground. The President sought compromise. The President sought to try to address the needs of both Republicans and Democrats on health and long-term care. 
   He writes:  
   Unfortunately, your health care proposal completely ignores our proposal to cover millions of uninsured, working Americans. Instead, you put forward a series of tax cuts that, particularly, when standing alone, would be inequitable, inefficient, and even potentially counterproductive to health care policy.  
   The reason they would be counterproductive to health care policy is because the Republican proposal gives tax cuts to people who already have health care, who already have a high level of income, who are already covered by employers, and what you do by doing that is provide an incentive for employers to turn to them and say: We do not need to cover you anymore; you can go out and get your own health care because you are getting a tax cut--while it leaves millions of Americans who are uninsured without any insurance options whatsoever. That is so patently counterproductive, as well as patently unfair, that it begs our coming to the floor of the Senate to stand with the President and 
   suggest this ought to be vetoed.

   Mr. KERRY. I say to my colleague from Nebraska, he is again perceptive in seeing the extraordinary contradiction in the actions taken by the majority party, the Republicans in Congress, compared to what their own nominee for President is suggesting is the appropriate way to proceed. Indeed, the very criticism leveled by George Bush against AL GORE that he is, in fact, trying to target appropriately--appropriately, I underline ``appropriately''--is really critical because what the Republicans are doing here is targeting, which is precisely what their candidate has criticized, but they are targeting inappropriately. They are targeting, once again, to reward those already most rewarded. They are targeting to reward those who already have health care. They are targeting in a way that ignores the concern of the President and most of us here, which is: How do you provide coverage to those people who are without coverage or having the greatest difficulty in providing for their health care with HMOs that are cutting them out.

Let me answer the Senator from Nebraska by saying, in the 16 years I have been in the Senate--in the debates we had in 1986 on tax simplification--in almost every single tax proposal we have worked on in those years, I have never heard the word ``fairness'' come from that side of the aisle. I have never heard them suggest that the plan they are offering America is based on a fundamental notion of what is fair for all Americans.

If you look at the distribution here to the HMOs, and if you look at what happens to community hospitals, to home health care delivery, to the nursing homes, to those people who are part of a community and stay in a community, and who are not there for profit, versus what they have done to provide the lion's share of funding to those who work for profit but at the same time have cut off 400,000 senior citizens from getting health care, it is an extraordinary imbalance on its face.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say to my colleague, the question he raises should not be treated by my colleagues as simply political posturing or somehow a statement that suggests that there is simply a point to be scored here. 
   In the years I have been here, I have never seen the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD--who I think most people in the Senate would agree is really the custodian of the institution--he is the Senator who has written the most, thought the most, and perhaps stood the strongest for the rights and prerogatives of Senators, and the rights and prerogatives of 
   this institution. 
   What the Senator from Nebraska is raising in his question really goes to the core of the conscience, if you will, of the Senate, of what is right, of what is the controlling legal authority for the Senate. 
   Is it appropriate to have a process that excludes and distorts and diminishes the institution in the way this process has? 
   The distinguished minority leader is on the floor of the Senate. I saw him as angry yesterday and as visibly upset as I think any of us in our caucus have ever seen him because of his sense of this violation of process, of the ways in which the rights of individual Senators are being denied. 
   Now, people may not like a particular vote around here, and people may not want to vote because they don't like the fact they have to stand by that vote, but the fact is, this legislation that comes to the floor of the Senate today is a violation of our rights, of the sort of conscience, if you will, that the Senator is talking about, about doing what is right.

   Mr. KERRY. May I say to my friend from California, she is one of the champions in the Senate for that kind of fairness and for her sensitivity to the notion of what happens to our seniors. Obviously in California it is vital to have that kind of sensitivity. 
   Let me underscore what she just said, because not only do the tens of billions of dollars go to the HMOs in a disproportionate share--one-third in the first 5 years, 50 percent in the second 5 years--the Senator from South Dakota, the distinguished minority leader, led an effort in the Senate to try to secure $80 billion as the appropriate balanced budget fix here, with a recognition that we would do away with the 15-percent cut which has been mandated inappropriately by almost everybody's agreement. 
   What we are winding up with is $30 billion, which has now been divided by the majority party completely inappropriately to one of the greatest sources of the problem in the delivery of health care in the country. 
   What is absolutely extraordinary in this situation is that, as the Senator from California mentions, there is only one sort of minor requirement here about what kind of behavior the HMOs might be held to. 
   All of us in the Senate have been fighting for months to try to get a Patients' Bill of Rights and establish a real set of principles and standards by which people in the United States will know what they are going to get from HMOs, what they can expect from HMOs, and how they will be treated by HMOs. But here we are with a great big grab bag giveaway to the HMOs, without any of those standards being embraced here. 
   If you want to talk about the conscience, and doing what is right, which is what the Senator from Nebraska talked about, here is an incredible example of the way in which they have sort of flagrantly chosen how to satisfy their constituencies, their sense of who ought to get something, and have left out completely the rights we have been fighting for that would have accrued-- 
   the basic rights, a woman's right to know she can keep her own OB/GYN she has had for a number of years, a person's right to go to an emergency room of their choice, a right to a second opinion. Think about that, to get a second opinion and not to have some HMO bureaucrat in a State that isn't even associated with your particular health care problem not make the decision but have your doctor make a decision. We can't even come to the floor of the Senate and do that here. We have to give away money to the folks who already have health care rather than taking care of the people who are uninsured which could be done cheaper. 
   In fact, what the President says in his letter is really interesting. I will share this completely with my colleagues as we put it into the RECORD. 
   The President said, before this came to the floor, before we were put in the predicament of having to vote against something that has a lot of good in it, many of us like components of what is in this bill. Many of us worked hard to get components of this bill. We are going to be forced to vote against it because of the fundamental unfairness. The President of the United States makes that very clear in his letter. I will continue to read what the President says to both leaders:  
   Instead you put forward a series of tax cuts that, particularly when standing alone, would be inequitable, inefficient, and even potentially counterproductive to health care policy. For example, while our FamilyCare proposal would expand coverage to 4 million uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per person, your proposal would provide additional coverage to one-seventh the people at six times the cost per person. Moreover, your proposal would give the least assistance to moderate income families that need the help the most, while even raising concerns that those with employer-based coverage today could lose their insurance. 
   Similarly, on long-term care, I offered to embrace your proposed deduction for long-term care insurance in exchange for inclusion of my proposal to give families, who are burdened today by long-term care needs, a $3,000 tax credit.  
   That sounds pretty bipartisan to me. The President said: I offered to embrace your proposed deduction if you would embrace my effort to give families who have long-term care problems a $3,000 tax credit. 
   What happens? Rebuffed. 
   The President says:  
   Unfortunately, your legislation ignores the bipartisan package I suggested and instead would provide half the benefits of my proposal for financially pressed families trying to provide long-term care for elderly and sick family members. Surely we can agree on this bipartisan compromise that has already been endorsed by a broad array of members of Congress, advocates for seniors and people with disabilities and insurers. Similarly, I am perplexed that we cannot agree to include the bipartisan credit for vaccine research and purchases that is essential to save lives and advance public health.  
   Let me say a word about that, if I may, because I wrote that legislation. We have been struggling in the Congress to get this considered. I wrote it with Senator BILL FRIST. This is an effort to try to guarantee that the great AIDS crisis will be properly addressed. Millions of people are dying in Africa, countless hundreds of thousands are affected here in our own country by this ravaging disease. Unfortunately, the pharmaceutical companies have no incentive because people in those countries cannot afford to buy the drugs. It is much more profitable to produce Viagra or any number of other drugs that are advertised now--Claritin, whatever. There are a whole set of drugs that have quick return and that make money. But poor countries cannot afford to buy these 
   drugs. 
   We have already passed into legislation funding of some $500 million for AIDS vaccine distribution across the world. The problem is that there is no vaccine today, and there won't be a vaccine unless the companies have an incentive and a capacity to be able to develop it. It is not only AIDS, incidentally, it is also for tuberculosis, for malaria. There are infectious diseases for which we could have further research in terms of vaccine development. 
   What we want to do is provide the companies with a tax credit and the capacity to do that. It has broad bipartisan support. It is only $1.5 billion over 10 years. But that is not even in here. That is ignored in here. The President of the United States is suggesting it ought to be in here. They are perfectly prepared to take a huge percentage of the $30 billion and give it to the HMOs, but they are not prepared to provide the $1.5 billion in an effort to provide incentives foe AIDS vaccine research. 
   The President also says:  
   I also am disappointed that you have made virtually no attempt to address the concerns my Administration has expressed to you about the pension provisions of your bill. By dropping the progressive savings incentives from the Senate Finance Committee bill, you have failed to address the lack of pension coverage for over 70 million people. Moreover, employers may have new incentives to drop pension coverage for some of the low- and moderate-income workers lucky enough to have pension plans today. 
   Finally, I remain deeply concerned that your Medicare and Medicaid refinement proposal continues to fail to attach accountability provisions to excessive payment increases to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) while rejecting critical investments in beneficiaries and vulnerable health care providers. Specifically, you insist on an unjustified spending increase for HMOs at the same time as you exclude bipartisan policies  such as health insurance options for children with disabilities, legal immigrant pregnant women and children, and enrolling uninsured children in schools, as well as needed payment increases to hospitals, academic health centers, home health agencies, and other vulnerable providers. Congress should not go home without responding to the urgent health needs of our seniors, people with disabilities, and children and the health care providers who serve them.  
   I read the newspapers today, and I saw a fairly typical sort of Washington response from someone on the other side of the aisle suggesting that the President's veto of this bill was somehow going to provide them with an upper hand in the last weeks of this election cycle. This is not about the last week of the election. This is about fundamental policy, which the President has described in this letter, which goes directly to the question of how this country is going to provide for health care for our citizens. There are 44 million or so Americans who have no health care whatsoever. What about them?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will gladly respond to the distinguished leader's question. I went into this a little bit before he came. Let me repeat: The distinguished Senator from Missouri and I worked hard on the small business components of this. But there was no consultation whatsoever, no phone call, no request for signature, no meeting, no discussion even about this bill being used, at least with this Senator, as the vehicle for these components being put in it. We were not in the room. We didn't know where the room was. We weren't even asked whether or not this was something we might or might not object to or what the impact might be on the bipartisan efforts that had taken place to have a complete small business reauthorization bill. 
   Moreover, the bill that comes to the floor today is not even the same small business reauthorization that we worked on. It has been changed, again, we had no consultation and no part.

Either way, that is not the intent of the Congress with respect to the minimum wage. I understand that it is a 6-month termination of the minimum wage, which I hope is by accident.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I voiced my concern about this to the leader yesterday and a number of times previously--that this is not the way to legislate. I think most of us understand that. I think it really calls to question the sort of good-faith, bipartisan efforts our friends often talk about. There is a simple matter of courtesy with which this institution and any institution essentially needs to run. I don't like to say this, but I have to say that it just sort of runs roughshod over anybody's notions of decency that there isn't even a phone call, there isn't even a discussion. Is there a way to work this out? Can we sit down? Can we have a meeting? What is possible here? None of those questions were asked--just an assumption that this is the way we are going to do it and we are going to proceed forward. I just think it is destructive and unfortunate.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the eloquent questions asked by the Senator from South Dakota make their own answers. I think any American dispassionately making a judgment about this process and looking at this legislation and measuring its impact would come to the conclusion that the fundamental sense of fairness, that the distinguished leader is talking about, is absent. 
   I am sure the distinguished majority leader, who is standing here, will have his response, and I understand that. He is going to suggest, wait a minute, fairness is fairness. But here is a letter from the President of the United States. The President of the United States says if we do this, he is going to veto this. He has proven previously he is prepared to veto bills when he says he will. 
   It seems to me that if we are not looking for a political issue, if we really want to legislate, we would sit down with the President of the United States and say, OK, Mr. President, we are prepared to offer this; let's have an agreement. But the President says that even his offer--I want to reemphasize this--even his offer was refused. The President says on long-term care:  
   I offered to embrace your proposed deduction for long-term care in exchange for inclusion of my proposal to give families who are burdened today by long-term care needs a $3,000 tax credit.  
   Let me ask my colleagues this: Long-term care, I have become particularly familiar with that over the course of the last year and a half. My father passed away last July and he had considerable care, as my mother does today. It is expensive. We are fortunate that we can pay for it. But it taught me firsthand what happens to those families who can't and how extraordinarily expensive and difficult it is. We have driven families out of hospital care and we have driven them out of nursing home care. We have increasingly, through the creation of the drugs we have in this country, made it easier for people to be treated at home and be kept out of the hospital. But here we are denying people the capacity to have a $3,000 tax credit for long-term care. 
   Why? So you can give more money back to the HMOs. Where is the fundamental sense of fairness? The President of the United States offered to the majority party the chance to say let's compromise. And what happens? We get legislation coming to the floor that seeks to just stuff it to the President of the United States and stuff it to the rest of us here and stuff it to the American people.

<DOCNO>106-kerry-ma-25-20001027</DOCNO>
<TEXT>
   Mr. KERRY. Well, I may say to the Senator from California--and I know the majority leader is going to point this out to us--we have a rule here, rule XXVIII, and I am confident he is going to talk about that and he is going to say, well, the Senate created a situation whereby this rule was replaced by a precedent allowing an unfortunate process whereby a piece of legislation like this ``can happen.'' That goes to what the Senator from Nebraska was talking about--the legal authority versus the sense of conscience and the question of what is right and what is wrong. 
   It also goes to the question of how one gets things done. I will readily acknowledge that there is a ``precedent'' that allows 
   last minute things to happen in the context of a conference. But the precedent and the rectitude with which it might be legitimately used does nothing to wipe away the question of the sort of moral or political legitimacy within the context of this institution or our own politics. When the President of the United States sends a letter and says: Don't do this; I will veto it because it is fundamentally unfair, but nevertheless people go ahead and proceed to do it anyway, that really calls into question motive, purpose, outcome, and why we are here today in this situation. 
   So I am going to readily acknowledge, sure, you can use some technicality of legitimacy to say it, but it is not legitimate in the larger context of what we are trying to get done. It is not legitimate when measured against the judgment of most Americans about what is fair and right. 
   It is clear that we have a health care delivery system problem. We have millions of Americans who have no insurance whatsoever. The President offered a way, a far less expensive way than that which has been exploited by the majority party, to provide care to those citizens. In his letter--and I want to emphasize this--the President says very clearly, ``Our family care proposal would expand coverage to 4 million uninsured parents at a cost of slightly over $3,000 per person. Your proposal''--this is the proposal of the majority side--``would provide additional coverage to one-seventh the people at six times the cost.'' One-seventh of the people at six times the cost. 
   That is what this fight is about. It is about uninsured people versus people who are insured. It is about unintended consequences, or maybe vague results. If you give a health care tax credit to people who already have coverage, you are giving an incentive to corporations that provide that coverage to turn to them and say we don't need to provide you with coverage anymore; you now have a handsome health care tax credit from the Federal Government; go buy your own. And you wind up reducing the number of those who are covered, not in fact encouraging further coverage. So there is a complete reversal of policy in a sense here, and I think it goes to the core of what this particular legislation is about. 
   Now, I said earlier--and I want to complete the part of my statement  about what is going in this bill and why I think we could find a common ground. It seems to me there is a common ground that could be found. First of all, the small business provisions are good. We worked at them, hard. I might also emphasize that the hard work is one of the reasons that they are good--and I congratulate the Senator from Missouri, Mr. BOND, and his staff for this--we worked together in order to try to accommodate people. We accommodated the Senator from Minnesota, Mr. WELLSTONE, on one component, which was a very important part of expanding the reach of programs into low-income communities, and that was how we came to a consensus agreement of bipartisanship within our committee. 
   But, again, without my knowledge, without one Senate Democrat being there, that entire provision was thrown and traded away in the middle of the night, in a room that I still do not know where it was, with those people who met without even inviting us. The consensus that had been built for the small business bill was traded away in exchange for other items that are in this legislation. I say to my colleagues, respectfully, that is not the way to build consensus. That is not the way to encourage the capacity to have agreement in the final results here. 
   There are important provisions in this bill. Provisions which I worked to include and worked with other members to get included. There is a reauthorization of the National Women's Business Council at $1 million a year. That is important. We should be doing that together. It enhances the procurement opportunities for women-owned businesses. We built an important consensus on that. We should be doing that together. It reauthorizes the very small 
   business concerns program. We worked hard for that. We should be doing that. It reauthorizes the Socially and Economically Disadvantaged Business Program, it extends the SBA's cosponsorship authority, and it has important provisions to increase veteran owned businesses. There were important changes to the Microloan Program, which I included, specifically provisions that increased the maximum loan amount from $25,000 to $35,000, and increasing the average loan size to $15,000. These are important provisions that we worked on together. Its not a perfect document, but it has the support of nearly all members, because we all had a stake in it and were a part of the process. 
   There are good things in this bill. I regret the fact that I am put in the unfortunate position of having this sort of nonlegislative process crowd in on the legislative process and take away our ability to promptly pass important legislation for small businesses in this country. I regret that the Wellstone provision that would have created a 3-year $9 million pilot project to build the capacity of community development venture capital firms through research and training and management assistance was stripped out without our knowledge or consent. Again, without sort of our consent or participation whatsoever. 
   But let me focus finally, if I may, on underscoring a couple of aspects about the bipartisanship here. I introduced legislation earlier this year, with my distinguished colleague from Maine, Senator COLLINS, to try to address the lack of adequate funding for one specific service on which seniors depend, and that is home health care. We both shared a belief--shared by almost all of our colleagues in the Senate--that the crisis in home health care is becoming so glaring that we ought to be able to build a bipartisan consensus here to do something about it. And we laid out a sense of how the Senate could do that. 
   Unfortunately, in this legislation, we see a reluctance to try to properly address that home health care component, coupled with the nursing home care component--again, in favor of the HMOs themselves which have cut some 400,000 seniors from coverage in the course of the year. 
   We laid out the picture for the Senate: Funding for home health care has plummeted since enactment of the BBA of 1997. The original cuts in home health care payments included in the BBA totaled $16 billion, but estimates now show that the industry will sustain a cut in Medicare reimbursement of more than 4 times that--$69 billion. According to CBO, Medicare spending on home health care dropped 45 percent in the last two fiscal years--from $17.5 billion in 1998 to $9.7 billion in 1999--far beyond the original amount of savings sought by the BBA. The draconian cuts in home health care services mirror the cuts in funding for hospitals and nursing homes. These cuts have created a crisis in our country. 
   And many of us worked across the aisles to do something about it. But we didn't have a seat at the table when the BBRA was put together. 
   And I ask you, has the Majority responded adequately to this crisis? Have they provided, in the BBRA, sufficient funds to strengthen our local hospitals, nursing homes and home health agencies. No, they have not. 
   What, then, in spite of the obvious needs for remedies, what do the Republicans, do with the $30 billion in funding that they provide in the BBRA? Who benefits from this restoration of funding? Would you believe that the primary recipients of the increased Medicare funds are HMOs? That's right, the same HMOs who have dropped, this year alone, 400,000 seniors from their health plans because they could not turn a profit caring for the aged. The same HMOs that fight tooth-and-nail against adopting a Patient Bill of Rights which would ensure Americans have basic rights to quality health care. 
   The $30 billion in Medicare this add-back package is too heavily targeted at HMOs. Over the first 5 years, one-third of all of the relief in this bill goes to HMOs; over the second 5 years one-half of the relief goes to HMOs. 
   It is unconscionable to bolster Medicare funds for HMOs at the expense of our community hospitals, nursing homes, and home health agencies--providers that do not pick-up and leave a community just because they are not making a profit. HMOs' treatment of seniors has been deplorable--having dropped 400,000 from their plans this year--and should not be rewarded. 
   Yet that's all this bill does--and my hope is that after this bill is vetoed, when Congress returns, that we'll be able to do in home health care relief what we should have been doing all along--providing a meaningful lifeline to these home health care agencies which make such difference in the lives of our seniors. 
   Vaccines for the New Millennium Act--Omitted from Final Tax Package. 
   I want to also talk about an issue that I have worked on for 2 years, in one of the best bipartisan efforts I have been a part of in my 16 years here. 
   Democrats and Republicans have negotiated together for the past 2 years to create a strong bipartisan bill to provide assistance with the development and purchase of vaccines for AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. 
   I sat down with BILL FRIST, with the distinguished Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, JESSE HELMS, and with numerous colleagues on the Democratic side who wanted to address a global crisis having an extraordinary impact particularly on sub-Saharan Africa. 
   The Administration was strongly supportive of our efforts--as were our colleagues in the House. 
   And yet the Vaccines for the New Millennium Act was dropped from this conference report. 
   Let me just share with you what our legislation would have done--legislation dropped in favor of poison pill measures opposed by many members on both sides of the aisle: 
   We aimed to provide a 30 percent tax credit on R&D into vaccines against malaria, TB, AIDS and any other disease which kills more than one million people per year. This provision expanded and targeted the existing R&E tax credit. 
   It would also provide a tax credit on the sales of vaccines against malaria, TB and AIDS. Vaccine manufacturers would receive a 100 percent credit on the value of their sale of vaccine to qualified international health organizations, like UNICEF, for distribution to developing countries. 
   Let me emphasize again why we believed it was so critical to act now. There is great need for further vaccine research. Every year, malaria, TB and AIDS kill more than 7 million people. Preventive vaccines are our best hope to bring these destructive worldwide epidemics under control. The NIH is conducting vital research at the basic science level, but private sector pharmaceutical companies have the lion's  share of expertise in bringing vaccines to the market place. But the market fails in the case of vaccines against diseases which strike primarily the developing world. This measure would have addressed this market failure by reducing the high cost of R&D as well as by creating a market for the vaccines once they are developed. The American Public Health Association, the Global Health Council, AIDS Action, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric AIDS Foundation, the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition, the Alliance for Microbicide Development and the President's Advisory on HIV/AIDS all support the measure. 
   And yet it is nowhere to be found in a tax package that found room for all sorts of complicated tax cuts for those who need them the least in our society--while ignoring the needs of an entire continent teetering on the brink of being entirely wiped out. 
   Our politics can be better than this. We can address the real needs of a country in Medicare, in the health care crisis of our nation, in the global pandemic of AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria--or we can play politics. 
   This bill is headed for a veto. And it deserves it. 
   The American people deserve better than this.

At the conclusion of my brief remarks, the Senator from Oregon be recognized, following him, Senator NICKLES to be recognized, with the time to be selected by the managers for how much time they allocate, and subsequent to that, someone on our side, to be named, to be recognized, and then the Senator from Texas.

We will go, immediately following my comments, to the Senator from Oregon, and then back to the majority side, Senator NICKLES, and then back to our side to a person to be yet named, and then back to the Republican side to the Senator from New Mexico, and then back to our side, which follows Senator GRAMM. And that is the order with the time to be determined by the managers on each side.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I will be very brief. I simply want to respond very quickly to the comments made by the distinguished majority leader who appropriately cited many items within the legislation that we all ought to support. Indeed, that is precisely what I said in the course of my comments. We do support a great deal of what is in the legislation. 
   But what the majority leader never did, in the course of his comments, was address any of the issues we raised with respect to the health care system, the fundamental fairness, and the issues of contention raised by the President of the United States. 
   He dismissed that rather quickly and cavalierly, suggesting that the President got a lot of what he wanted. Let me be very precise. Of 119 individual tax provisions in this bill, 35 of them are from the President's budget; that is 30 percent of the provisions, not the 80 percent that the majority leader talked about. Mr. President, and of the $240+ billion in tax cuts in this package, only $48 billion, or 20 percent of the total, is from the President's proposals. 
   No one should be misled by the comments of the majority leader to believe that this is somehow a fair division, and that the President, in offering to veto, is not vetoing it on substantive, clear, and distinct differences of policy. 
   Secondly, the majority leader suggested that much was included in this, and this is sort of mostly a bill that is somehow beneficial. What he neglected to address was the issue that we raised  about how this bill came together and what is in it as a total. 
   As a total, it represents, in a sense, a consensus of what the majority wanted to put in. But it was arrived at without discussion with the minority, and so there are whole bills in here that raise very significant issues. 
   One of them is the issue to which the Senator from Oregon is going to talk. I just want to take about 2 minutes to say something about it. 
   There is, in this tax bill, a whole piece of legislation called the Pain Relief Promotion Act. My colleagues ought to listen to that title very carefully: Pain Relief Promotion Act. That title is an extraordinary, almost cynical, play on words. It completely distorts the notion of what happens in this legislation. 
   First of all, this Pain Relief Promotion Act completely preempts State law with respect to the definition of a legitimate medical purpose with respect to State medical regulations. The implications of that with respect to this are to require the Drug Enforcement Agency's agents to determine whether a physician's prescription of a controlled substance for pain relief medication was intended to relieve pain or to assist in suicide. I hope my colleagues focus on that. 
   The Pain Relief Promotion Act is asking DEA agents to make a judgment of intent about what a doctor intended to do in prescribing a prescription drug to a patient who is terminally ill in a hospital. 
   Are we seriously going to go down that road and DEA agents to have the potential to provide a 20-year prison sentence for a doctor for making a judgment about pain medication to an ill patient in a hospital? I find that extraordinary. Yet the majority leader tried to suggest on the floor that this is just some innocuous conglomeration of legislation that has no major impact on the lives of Americans, except 80 percent of it is good and what the President wanted. That is a fight worth fighting on the floor of the Senate today. 
   I am not going to go into all the details. I just went through a long hospitalization issue with a parent. I know what that pain medication meant for cancer. I know how difficult it was in the hospital to get the proper pain medication, to have people comfortable with what was being dealt. If we suddenly layer that kind of legal structure over the delivery of medical care in America, we are taking an extraordinary step that at least ought to be properly debated on the floor of the Senate in the context of hearings, the process, and so forth. 
   A recent New England Journal of Medicine article said the following:  
   If the Pain Relief Promotion Act becomes law, it will almost certainly discourage doctors from providing adequate doses of medicine to relieve the symptoms of dying patients.  
   That does not belong in a tax bill, conglomerated in a room without the consent of Democrats. That is why we are here. That is why we are fighting about this legislation. 
   My final comment is, with respect to the tax components of this, major components of fairness were stripped out of this bill. The majority leader talked about how important it is to provide savings for Americans. Yes, it is important. There is not one of us on this side of the aisle who won't vote to encourage Americans to save money. There is not one of us who does not support a 401(k) program. But when we are making a choice about how much money we can allocate to people based on the overall amounts of money available and that choice was made by the Republicans alone to encourage 401(k)s to the exclusion of middle- and low-income Americans to be able to save, that is a fight worth fighting. That is a question of fundamental fairness. 
   The 401(k)s are terrific for lawyers and doctors and high-income people, but the kind of Americans we were trying to reach--at the $30,000, $25,000, $20,000 income level--have a lot harder time gaining benefit from a 401(k). What the President had in his proposals was a credit that would have gone directly to those hard-working Americans. That was stripped out. That is why we are here now raising these issues regarding this legislation. It is a question of fundamental fairness. 
   I regret that in all of his comments this morning, the majority leader did not address the fundamental issue of fairness that we are raising and over which the President has threatened a veto. 
   My absolute last comment: The President made clear that he would veto this. So the majority leader comes to the floor and says, well, we will come back, and we will work this out down the road. 
   Why? Why work it out down the road? Why not work it out now? Why not work it out in the last month before we came to the floor knowing it would be vetoed? If we can work out these other issues, if we weren't seeking a political advantage, we could certainly work that out. 
   People may not like the fact that the President of the United States is who he is and is of the party that he is, but he has the veto. We have been through this since 1995, when the Government of the United States was shut down for the first time in American history over this very same challenge. And here we are again, in the year 2000, with the same sort of sense of frustration over the fact that he has the veto pen that brings us to this point of confrontation. The fact is, he does have that pen. He has the constitutional right. He made it clear he would do it. And the reasons he has chosen to do it are substantive and important to the American people. That is what this debate is about. 
   I thank my colleague for his courtesy. I yield such time, up to the 30 minutes, as he might consume to the Senator from Oregon.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased that the controversy surrounding Section 12 of this bill, Section 1012 of Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary Appropriations conference report, has been resolved. Although I believe the new provision is unnecessary, I hope that requiring a technical demonstration to resolve harmful interference questions in the 12.2 GHz band will put this issue to rest. However, let me be clear that I support Section 12 with the understanding that it does not supercede or otherwise impact relevant provisions in the Satellite Home Viewers Improvement Act (Public Law 106-113, 113 Stat 1501)) which require the FCC to complete by November 29, 2000, the processing of applications and other authorizations for local facilities that can provide local television and broadband services to rural and underserved areas. 
   Northpoint Technology and its 69 Broadwave affiliates applied on January 8, 1999, to provide lower cost multi-channel video and data services in every television market in the United States. Northpoint's technology is particularly innovative and accomplishes something that is unique in telecommunications history. Using Northpoint's patented system, the Broadwave affiliates will be able to re-use the 12.2-12.7 band without the need to relocate existing users DirecTV and Echostar.  
   Northpoint Technology through its Broadwave affiliates will offer consumers in Boston and several other markets the benefits of true competition in the marketplace for multichannel video programming and data services. In the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress established March 1999 as the sunset on the FCC's authority to regulate the price of basic cable service. Congress took this action with the anticipation that competition would replace regulation in restraining prices and improving quality in the video programming marketplace. The rapid introduction of Broadwave service to communities across America will go a long way toward achieving the goals of the 1996 Act and ensuring that consumers enjoy the fruits of competition including greater choice, lower prices and quality service.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the record the intent of language included under funding for the National Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the Agriculture Appropriation fiscal year 2001 bill. I want to point out that interagency coordination of federal resources is desirable and certainly something many of us have been supporting as a way to eliminate unnecessary activities and spending. We don't want to spend money in Washington duplicating positions and processes. We want money in the field helping local communities. The NRCS ``Conservation Operations'' and ``Watershed Surveys and Planning'' funding sections contain specific language that refers to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, which is coordinated by an interagency committee to assist communities seeking technical assistance and opportunities for Federal grants. I would like to point out that this initiative has proven to work well for participating communities in my state and others.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on H.R. 3417 and amendments to it that will pass the Senate today. It is a package of several bills all designed to benefit our coastal  and marine environment. It is my hope, Mr. President, that the House of Representatives will consider and pass the bill immediately. They are sound proposals with broad support. 
   Since the day I first arrived in the Senate more than 15 years ago, I have worked hard to address the many challenges confronting our common ocean and coastal resources. After all, few states draw as much of their national and regional identity from their coasts as does Massachusetts. And I have been fortunate that the Commerce Committee includes members of both parties who are ready and willing to work together, to find compromise and pass sound legislation. In that regard, I want to thank Senators SNOWE, MCCAIN and HOLLINGS for their work on this bill. 
   The major provisions of H.R. 3417, as amended, are the Pribilof Islands Transition Act, the Shark Finning Prohibition Act, the Atlantic Striped Bass Conservation Act, the Atlantic Coastal Fisheries Cooperative Management Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Fishermen's Protective Act Amendments, the Coral Reef Conservation Act and the Marine Mammal Rescue Assistance Act. Each of these major proposals in the bill, except the corals bill, has already passed the House, the Senate or both. The bill also includes a ban on the use of spotter aircraft in certain bluefin tuna fishery categories. This proposal has passed the Senate. 
   I would like to make a few short comments on the Coastal Zone Management Act. To begin, I want to thank Senator SNOWE, our chairman on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for putting this legislation on the Committee agenda this Congress and working for its enactment. 
   Mr. President, when Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972, it made the critical finding that, ``Important ecological, cultural, historic, and esthetic values in the coastal zone are being irretrievably damaged or lost.'' As we deliberated CZMA's reauthorization this session, I measured our progress against that almost 30-year-old congressional finding. And, I concluded that while we have made tremendous gains in coastal environmental protection, the increasing challenges have made this congressional finding is as true today as it was then. 
   It is clear from the evidence presented to the Committee in our oversight process and from other input that I have received, that a great need exists for the federal government to increase its support for states and local communities that are working to protect and preserve our coastal zone. To accomplish that goal, the Committee has reported a bill that substantially increases annual authorizations for the CZMA program and targets funding at controlling coastal polluted runoff, one the more difficult challenges we face in the coastal environment. 
   This reauthorization tackles the problem of polluted coastal runoff. This is one of the great environmental and economic challenges we face in the coastal zone. At the same time that pollution from industrial, commercial and residential sources has increased in the coastal zone, the destruction of wetlands, marshes, mangroves and other natural systems has reduced the capacity of these systems to filter pollution. Together, these two trends have resulted in environmental and economic damage to our coastal areas. These effects include beach closures around the nation, the discovery of a recurring ``Dead Zone'' covering more than 6,000 square miles in the Gulf of Mexico, the outbreak of Pfiesteria on the Mid-Atlantic, the clogging of shipping channels in the Great Lakes, and harm to the Florida Bay and Keys ecosystems. In Massachusetts, we've faced a dramatic rise in shell fish beds closures, which have put many of our fishermen out of work. 
   To tackle this problem, the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000 targets up $10 million annually to, ``assist coastal communities to coordinate and implement approved coastal nonpoint pollution control strategies and measures that reduce the causes and impacts of polluted runoff on coastal waters and habitats.'' This is an important amendment. For the first time, we have elevated the local management of runoff as national priority within the context of the CZMA program. Runoff is not a state-by-state problem; the marine environment is far too dynamic. States share the same coastlines and border large bodies of waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Chesapeake Bay or the Long Island Sound, so that pollutants from one state can detrimentally affect the quality of the marine environment in other states. We are seeing the effects of polluted runoff both in our coastal communities and on our nation's living marine resources and habitats. Mr. President, I'm pleased that we've included the runoff provision in the bill. It's an important step forward and I believe we will see the benefits in our coastal environment and economy. 
   The Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, Mr. President, has been endorsed by the 35 coastal states and territories through the Coastal States Organization. It also has the endorsement of the Great Lakes Commission, American Oceans Campaign, Coast Alliance, Center for Marine Conservation, Sierra Club, Environmental Defense, California CoastKeeper and many other groups. It's a long list that makes clear that this is a consensus proposal. We heard from all sides and did our best to fine compromise, and I believe that we succeeded. 
   I also want to make a short statement on shark finning. H.R. 3417 would prohibit the practice of shark finning. Sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable species in the ocean. Their slow growth, late maturity and small number of offspring leave them exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover from depletion. At the same time, sharks, as top predators, are essential to maintaining the balance of life in the sea. While many of our other highly migratory species such as tunas and swordfish are subject to rigorous management regimes, sharks have largely been overlooked until recently. 
   The bill bans the wasteful practice of removing a shark's fins and returning the remainder of the shark to sea. National Marine Fisheries Service regulations in the Atlantic Ocean prohibit the practice of shark finning, but a nationwide prohibition does not currently exist. Shark fins comprise only a small percentage of the weight of the shark, and yet this is often the only portion of the shark retained. The Magnuson-Stevens Act and international commitments discourage unnecessary waste of fish, and thus I believe this bill ensures our domestic regulations are consistent on this point. Another goal of the Magnuson-Stevens Act--the minimization of 
   bycatch and bycatch mortality--is an issue that I have been particularly committed to over the years. Because most of the sharks caught and finned are incidentally captured in fisheries targeting other species, I believe establishing a domestic ban will help us further reduce this type of shark mortality. 
   The next step in this process is to act internationally. At present, foreign fleets transship or land approximately 180 metric tons of shark fins annually through ports in the Pacific alone. The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around the world. International measures are an absolutely critical component of achieving effective shark conservation. 
   Finally, the bill authorizes a Western Pacific longline fisheries cooperative research program to provide information for shark stock assessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or minimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of released sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade. 
   The United States is a global leader in fisheries conservation and management. I believe this legislation provides us the opportunity to further this role, and take the first step in addressing an international fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the U.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and international conventions to achieve coordinated international management of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning. 
   Mr. President, this package also includes a provision to ban the use of spotter aircraft in both the harpoon and general categories of the Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery. This has been an  ongoing issue in New England since 1996. Several of my Senate colleagues, including Senators SNOWE, KENNEDY, GREGG, and COLLINS, have asked the agency to ban aircraft in the past. Unfortunately Mr. President, because aircraft do not catch fish, our legal system has determined that the agency cannot regulate these aircraft. Let me point out that the fisheries service has gone through two rounds of public rulemaking on this issue and in both instances an overwhelming number of public comments were in support of this ban. The Atlantic bluefin tuna fishery is one of the last open fisheries in New England, and spotter aircraft provide an unfair competitive advantage to those fishermen who use them. Banning spotter aircraft will level the playing field and provide the opportunity for thousands of New Englanders to experience the thrill of landing a 400 pound bluefin tuna that, depending on the quality of the fish, can easily be worth $10,000. 
   Mr. President, H.R. 3417 also includes an authorization for the Secretary of Commerce to acquire fishery research vessels in 2002, 2003, and 2004 at a cost of $60 million. These state-of-the-art fishery research vessels will replace a fleet of vessels that are becoming technologically obsolete and reaching the end of their useful lives. In New England, the primary vessel used for our stock assessments is the 38-year old Albatross IV. Over the years NOAA has assumed increased responsibilities for managing our marine resources under the Magnuson-Stevens Fisheries Conservation and Management Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and the Endangered Species Act. It is absolutely imperative that we give NOAA scientists the tools necessary to carry out the mandates Congress has given them. 
   Mr. President, I sincerely hope that the House will move to pass this legislation. This is a very reasonable proposal. Indeed, it includes several proposals the House has initiated and passed. We have made every effort to act on their priorities and we ask that they do the same with our priorities.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from California. I had not expected to speak on this matter. I came to the floor to speak on the VA-HUD bill as a whole. 
   Let me share a couple of quick observations about these riders. 
   I congratulate my colleague from California for the fight she is making because it is an important fight as a matter of principle, and also it is a matter of science and common sense. These riders don't find their way into this legislation accidentally. There are powerful interests in the country that made sure these riders were here. We consistently see these attacks on environmental enforcement efforts in the country because there are people who just do not want a change. 
   On the air quality standards and nonattainment designations, the American Trucking Association is waiting for litigation with the EPA and wants to stop the EPA from keeping accountability with respect to the Clean Air Act. 
   That is what this is about. I have great respect for truckers and great respect for their efforts across the country. They are important to our economy. No one here is going to suggest otherwise. But every American has seen what happens at stoplights where they are sitting in a car that is living up to emission standards and a truck starts out at the stoplight. There is a great plume of black smoke that comes out of that truck. It is all over our highways. We know it. SUVs are presenting us with an increased problem because they come in under the light truck exception. 
   The fact is that the air standards of the country are not reaching the levels they ought to reach. The EPA is our chosen entity to enforce the Clean Air Act and to make sure that 
   Americans are not subjected to pollution and air quality standards that are less than high. 
   We are told by the EPA what happens with this delay. There is the exposure of some 15,000 premature deaths in the country. Some 350,000 more Americans will suffer asthma as a consequence of the lack of air quality standards. That is the risk the Senate will take by allowing this kind of rider. However innocuous it may seem or however people make it sound going forward, there is a diminishment of the capacity of the EPA to enforce the law Congress has already passed to allow Americans to live by the highest air quality standards. 
   With respect to the dredging, I understand where that comes from. We have all been through that struggle in Massachusetts to try to clean up the Husatonic River. We are going to do some dredging there. There is now a struggle about the Hudson River, and other rivers, about whether or not those are going to be cleaned up. 
   The fact is the National Academy of Sciences has already provided us with not one but two studies that show dredging is a legitimate and important mechanism for cleaning up polluted areas. We are trying to do that in the Bedford-Hartford area where we have PCBs. They fear if this rider passes, that cleanup may in fact be jeopardized because people will use the excuse to say we don't have to proceed. 
   That is what is at stake. I know it is difficult to pull these bills together. There are a lot of different interests that have to be satisfied. But the fact is the Senate ought to take a vote on these riders. We ought to vote appropriately--that they don't belong in this legislation. 
   I thank my colleague for her efforts.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the legislation we will vote on shortly, the VA-HUD bill, with mixed feelings. I want to be clear to my colleagues, the distinguished Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri, those feelings have absolutely nothing to do with the level of leadership they have provided on this legislation. I think they have done an outstanding job under exceedingly difficult circumstances. When I say ``difficult circumstances,'' they know better than anybody in the Senate what we are talking about. 
   This bill is traditionally knocked around, almost always begins with a significantly below realistic cap which makes it almost impossible for them to do their work for months on end. And then at the last minute they get some kind of a reprieve and they are allowed the opportunity to try to fit the pieces together, satisfy their colleagues, satisfy national priorities, and come to the Senate. 
   I think they have produced a housing budget that in light of recent years--I emphasize this--is a very strong budget. They have done an exceptional job with respect to the existing housing programs that we have in this country. They have increased funding for almost every significant Federal housing program that is already run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. For that, I thank them--not just for me but for countless numbers of people across the country who depend on one or another of those efforts to have decent shelter and a competent housing program for their communities. 
   Let me share quickly a couple of examples where the work has been exceptional. They have provided about $6.2 billion for operating and capital costs in public housing, which is an increase over the administration's request. The HOPE VI program, which has been enormously successful in turning some of the Nation's worst public housing developments into healthy, mixed-income communities, including a number in my home State of Massachusetts, has received an additional $575 million. 
   The HOME program and the CDBG received significant funding increases. Any of us can go home and talk to a mayor and we will learn quickly how important those particular programs have been to the discretionary capacity of mayors to be able to make a difference for their communities. 
   The Community Reinvestment Act has been able to extend credit. That has assisted the communities. The bill also brought the homeless budget back up to where it was. 
   But let me just discuss, if I may, an area in which I know both the Senator from Missouri and the Senator from Maryland share with me a sense of frustration and a sense of a priority not met by this legislation. There is something the Congress of the United States could have done about this, and has chosen not to do. 
   Very simply, we need a production program in this country. We used to have a production program, but over the last years we have seen a retreat from the commitment by the Federal Government to provide production. 
   Last night, in the debate between Vice President Gore and Governor Bush, there was an exchange where the Vice President said to the Governor that he didn't doubt his heart, or his goodness as a person but that he questioned his priorities. I come to the floor today to question the priorities of all of us in Washington, the Congress and the administration, with respect to one of the most evident, compelling needs that we face in this country, in community after community after community. This is not a Boston or a Massachusetts issue. It is not a New  England issue. There is not a community in the United States of America that you go to today where there are not people having an extraordinarily difficult time being able to find adequate housing. 
   The reason is partly something we can celebrate, in the sense it comes out of an economy that is so extraordinarily strong. But, on the other hand, because it is so strong and so many people are able to afford the few available places, the rents have risen to a point where even some vouchers are being refused. So we are upping the number of vouchers in this legislation to some 80,000 new vouchers, but there is no place for anybody to take them. 
   The result is, even as we live in a time of extraordinary economic expansion, too many of our fellow Americans are not sharing on the up side and are finding it increasingly difficult to find decent housing. HUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have what we call worst case housing needs. These families are paying over half their income towards housing costs or they are living in severely substandard housing. 
   Since 1950, the number of families with worst case housing needs has increased by 12 percent. That means 600,000 more of our fellow citizens cannot afford a decent and safe place to live, even though the United States of America has the best economy we have had in maybe half a century. For these families, living paycheck to paycheck, one simple unforeseen circumstance such as a child getting sick or a big car repair bill or some other kind of emergency can send them into homelessness. That is not an exaggeration. 
   Earlier this year, on the front page of the Washington Post, an article detailed these problems right here in our own backyard, the Nation's Capital. That article detailed the plight of low-income families living in apartments that are no longer affordable because the owners decided to no longer accept Federal assistance. For those families, the loss of their affordable housing unit meant they could go without a home. 
   We have mistakenly viewed this crisis as limited to certain demographic groups. I really caution my colleagues not to fall into that stereotype. There is not one metropolitan area in the country where a minimum wage earner can afford to pay the rent for the average two-bedroom apartment. The minimum wage 
   today--is it $5.15? You would have to earn over $12 an hour to afford the median rent for the average two-bedroom apartment in this country. That figure rises dramatically in many metropolitan areas. 
   An hourly wage of $28 is needed in San Francisco; $23 on Long Island; $19 in Boston; $17 in Washington, DC, $16 in Chicago and in Seattle, and $15 in Atlanta. In every one of these cases, the affordability crisis has grown worse over the course of the past year. Working families are increasingly finding themselves unable to afford a house. A person in Boston would have to make over $35,000 a year just to afford a two-bedroom apartment, and we know that is well above the median earnings of folks in that area--as well, I might add, as most of the country. 
   In Cape Cod, MA, a working mother of three children has been forced to live in a camper. The children actually live in a tent because the camper is not large enough. The mother cooks on an outdoor grill. She cleans the campground toilets to help pay the rent on her campsite. She works 40 hours a week, earns $21,000 annually, and she cannot find affordable rental housing. 
   There was another article in the Washington Post this week which emphasizes the impact of this issue. Because of the ability of higher wage earners in this area who have benefited from the booming economy to pay higher housing costs, we have seen a rise in the number of building owners who refuse to rent to households that are assisted by section 8 vouchers. In Prince Georges County, 300 tenants in an apartment complex were recently told they have to move because the owner is no longer going to accept section 8. 
   I know the Senator from Missouri understands everything I have thus far said and supports the notion that we need a production program. I am grateful to the Senator from Missouri for having not just seen that, but put $1 billion into this bill for housing production. That is how this bill went to the conference level. That bill could have received support from the House and the administration that would have left us in a position to fund. 
   When people say: Senator, what about the cap? What about the total amount of money? In this year, the 2001 budget cycle, as a matter of priority, the administration and others are choosing to pay down $200 billion of debt. I am all for debt paydown. I know that is a tax cut to all Americans. I have been one of those here who has supported the concept that we ought to pay off the debt as rapidly as we possibly can. But the key is in the words ``as rapidly as we possibly can.'' Maybe we should add words such as ``as is appropriate,'' or ``as is measured against other priorities of the country.'' 
   I do not know where it is written in stone or otherwise made an edict of the budgeting process that we have to choose to pay down $200 billion instead of paying down $199 billion or $198 billion, or some other figure. Would it really be so bad if the United States took 1 year longer to pay off the entire debt while sufficiently addressing the question of adequate housing for American families today? 
   The Senator from Missouri sought to put $1 billion into this bill. So we are making our own priorities. I say to my colleagues, as a matter of common sense and sound investment policy in the future of the country, it makes sense to invest in production of housing for people who cannot afford it because the alternative is that you have a lot of kids who are dragged 
   out of schools, moving from community to community, often becoming at risk as a consequence of the lack of adequate housing. We will pick up their costs. We will pick up their costs when some Senator comes to the floor and says we need more Federal assistance to build prisons; or we need more Federal assistance for the juvenile justice system to take care of those kids who are getting into trouble; or we need more Federal assistance for the drug program because we have too many crack houses and too many communities that are magnets for crime. 
   Why? Because we don't allow them to become the kinds of communities we want them to be by investing up front in creating the kind of housing the country needs. It is inexcusable, in a nation as rich as we are, doing as well as we are, that we cannot find $1 billion to make certain we have a production program to help build the kind of housing that will release the pressures on the marketplace and can be felt all up and down the ladder in housing costs in the country. 
   Some colleagues will say: Why should the Federal Government do that? Years ago, we made a commitment in this country about housing. We have come to understand that there are certain things the marketplace doesn't always do very well. I happen to believe we have the most efficient allocation of capital of any economic system anywhere on the face of the planet. I am proud of that. I support that in dozens of ways--through the Small Business Committee, Banking Committee, Commerce Committee, tax incentives, various ways in which we allow the private sector to do what it does best, which is create jobs. But sometimes there are certain sectors of the economy where the marketplace does not work as efficiently. We have always recognized that with one kind of tax incentive or tax credit or direct grant or other kind of incentive or another. Housing just happens to be one of them. 
   When the supply is very tight and the demand is very high, you have a capacity for rents to rise and you have builders targeting their building to that place where they can make the most money. That is a natural instinct in a marketplace where you are looking for the greatest return on investment. You do not get your great return on investment from the sectors where the people can least afford the rents. 
   That is why we need a production program, and that is why I hope in these final days before the Congress adjourns we will find our way to include in the omnibus bill the production program we need so desperately. I thank the Chair.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to commend the President for issuing Executive Order 11625, designed to help strengthen the Federal Government's commitment to providing contracting opportunities to disadvantaged businesses. 
   In 1998, I took to the floor to successfully defend the Transportation Department's Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (DBE) program from those who sought to weaken it. Today, I am pleased to speak out in favor of the President's efforts to strengthen programs like the DBE, along with all minority-owned business government contracting programs. 
   It should come as no surprise to anyone in this Chamber familiar with small businesses, especially minority owned firms, that government contracting can help provide a strong foundation to build a prosperous small business. As any successful graduate of the Small Business Administration's 8(a) program will tell you, it provides the opportunities, but you have to supply the entrepreneurial spirit and hard work. 
   And this hand-up approach is what I mean by assisting minority-owned firms. These programs are not a handout. Rather, they exist to help level the playing field and to combat the inequities in our society that may prevent these firms from receiving the same opportunities available to other businesses. 
   These contracts are beneficial not just because they provide initial contracts to small disadvantaged firms, they also help minority firms establish a record of providing goods and services to the Federal Government. This is of critical importance because it assists these businesses in obtaining future contracts. In turn, these firms help provide jobs and competition to larger businesses, saving the taxpayers money through reduced costs and time saving innovations. Thus, these programs have direct and indirect benefits to our economy at all levels. 
   The Executive Order signed by President Clinton on Friday will help strengthen minority business ownership by directing Federal agencies to take affirmative steps to increase contracting between the Federal government and Small Disadvantaged Businesses, 8(a) Businesses, and Minority Business Enterprises. The Executive Order also holds Federal agencies accountable for carrying out the terms of the Order by requiring them to develop a long-term strategic plan and to submit annual reports to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) of their efforts to increase contracting with disadvantaged businesses; requires Federal agencies to ensure the participation of small and disadvantaged businesses when procuring information technology and telecommunications services; and directs Federal departments and agencies to ensure that all creation, placement, and transmission of federal advertising are fully reflective of the nation's diversity. 
   I applaud President Clinton's action to help ensure the vitality of minority-  owned small businesses. As the Senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Small Business and a long time supporter of these programs, I urge OMB to forward the agencies' plans and their implementation reports to the House and Senate Committees on Small Business for further review.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have been aware of this story since July. Many of the bonds for this project are held through mutual funds in which Americans have invested their savings. This is not just a question of inequity for the U.S. developer of the project but also for millions of Americans who are the bondholders, and many of whom are my constituents. 
   In response to a letter written on August 7 to the Chinese ambassador, the charg&#233; d'affaires indicated that he had met with both the U.S. developer and representatives from the U.S. bondholders, had conveyed the concern back home, and would be--quote--making efforts to facilitate a satisfactory solution to this problem--end quote. It has now been almost two months, and we have seen no resolution of this problem, but rather delay and discrimination. 
   I note that the Democratic Leader has joined us, and I would like to suggest to him a report by the Administration, but first I would yield the Floor to my colleague from Montana, Senator BAUCUS.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks on the Coastal Zone Management Act of 2000, legislation to reauthorize the Coastal Zone Management Act. This bill, S. 1534, was passed last Thursday evening by unanimous consent. 
   To begin, I want to thank Senator SNOWE, our chairman on the Oceans and Fisheries Subcommittee on the Commerce Committee, for putting this legislation on the Committee agenda this Congress and working for its enactment 
   When Congress enacted the Coastal Zone Management Act in 1972, it made the critical finding that, ``Important ecological, cultural, historic, and esthetic values in the coastal zone are being irretrievably damaged or lost.'' As we deliberated CZMA's reauthorization this session, I measured our progress against that almost 30-year-old congressional finding. And, I concluded that while we have made tremendous gains in coastal environmental protection, the increasing challenges have made this congressional finding is as true today as it was then. 
   At our oversight hearing on this legislation, Dr. Sylvia Earle testified on the current and future state of our coastal areas. Dr. Earle has dedicated her career to understanding the coastal and marine environment, and knows as much about it as anyone. She warned us that, ``We are now paying for the loss of wetlands, marshes, mangroves, forests barrier beaches, natural dunes and other systems with increasing costs of dealing somehow with the services these systems once provided--excessive storm damage, benign recycling of wastes, natural filtration and cleansing of water, production of oxygen back to the atmosphere, natural absorption of carbon dioxide, stabilization of soil, and much more. Future generations will continue to pay, and pay and pay unless we can take measures now to reverse those costly trends.'' 
   The Coastal States Organization, represented by their chair, Sarah Cooksey, told the Committee that, ``In both economic and human terms, our coastal challenges were dramatically demonstrated in 1998, by numerous fish-kills associated with the outbreaks of harmful algal blooms, the expansion of the dead zone of the Gulf coast, and the extensive damage resulting from the record number of coastal hurricanes and el Nino events. Although there has been significant progress in protecting and restoring coastal resources since the CZMA and Clean Water Acts were passed in 1972, many shell fish beds remain closed, fish advisories continue to be issued, and swimming at bathing beaches across the country is too often restricted to protect public health.'' 
   It is clear from the evidence presented to the Committee in our oversight process and from other input that I have received, that a great need exists for the federal government to increase its support for states and local communities that are working to protect and preserve our coastal zone. To accomplish that goal, the Committee has reported a bill that substantially increases annual authorizations for the CZMA program and targets funding at controlling coastal polluted runoff, one the more difficult challenges we face in the coastal environment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me say a few words about the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 and the managers' amendment that the Senate is considering today. While I applaud the House for their action to ensure the continuation of important Small Business Administration (SBA) programs, the managers' amendment offered by Chairman BOND and myself includes key provisions extending and improving important SBA programs. This bill, with the inclusion of the managers' amendment, is comprehensive. It reauthorizes all of the SBA's programs, setting the funding levels for the credit and business development programs, and making improvements where needed. Without this legislation, the 504 loan program would shut down; the venture capital debenture program would shut down; and funding to the states for their small business development centers would be in jeopardy. The list goes on. I just can't emphasize enough how important this legislation is. 
   The SBA's contribution is significant. In the past eight years, the SBA has helped almost 375,000 small businesses get more than $80 billion in loans. That's double what it has loaned in the preceding 40 years since the agency's creation. The SBA is better run than ever before, with four straight years of clean financial audits; it has a quarter less staff, but makes twice as many loans; and its credit and finance programs are a bargain. For a relatively small investment, taxpayers are leveraging their money to help thousands of small businesses every year and fuel the economy. 
   Let me just give you one example. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers spend $1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well known successes like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are clear examples of the program's effectiveness. 
   Overall, I agree with the program levels in the three-year reauthorization bill. As I said during the Small Business Committee's hearing on SBA's budget earlier in the year, I believe the program levels are realistic and appropriate based on the growing demand for the programs and the prosperity of the country. I also think they are adequate should the economy slow down and lenders have less cash to invest. Consistent with SBA's mission, in good times or bad, we need to make sure that small businesses have access to credit and capital so that our economy benefits from the services, products and jobs they provide. As First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton says, we don't want good ideas dying in the parking lot of banks. We also want a safety net when our states are hit hard by a natural disaster. There are many members of this Chamber, and their constituents, who know all too well the value of SBA disaster loans after floods, fires and tornadoes. 
   I will only take a short time to talk about some of important the provisions of this bill and our managers' amendment. 
   I am pleased that we are considering legislation to extend the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program for 8 more years as part of this comprehensive SBA reauthorization bill. As many of my colleagues may know, this program is set to expire on September 30, along with many other important programs critical to our nation's small businesses. While I am sorry the process has taken this long, in no way should it imply that there is not strong support for the SBIR program, the Small Business Administration, or our nation's innovative small businesses. 
   The SBIR program is of vital importance to the high-technology sector throughout the country. For the past decade, growth in the high-technology field has been a major source of the resurgence of the American economy we now enjoy. While many Americans know of the success of Microsoft, Oracle, and many of the dot.com companies, few realize that it is America's small businesses that are working in industries like software, hardware, medical research, aerospace technologies, and bio-technology that are helping to fuel this resurgence--and that it is the SBIR program that makes much of this possible. By setting aside Federal research and development dollars specifically for small high-tech businesses, SBIR is making important contributions to our economy. 
   These companies have helped launch the space shuttle; found a vaccine for Hepatitis C; and made B-2 Bomber missions safer and more effective. 
   Since the start of the SBIR program in 1983, more than 17,600 firms have received over $9.8 billion in assistance. In 1999 alone, nearly $1.1 billion was awarded to small high-tech firms through the SBIR program, assisting more than 4,500 firms. 
   The SBIR program has been, and remains, an excellent example of how government and small business can work together to advance the cause of both science and our economy. Access to risk capital is vital to the growth of small high technology companies, which accounted for over 40 percent of all jobs in the high technology sector of our economy in 1998. The SBIR program gives these companies access to Federal research and development money and encourages those who do the research to commercialize their results. Because research is crucial to ensuring that our nation is the leader in  knowledge-based industries, which will generate the largest job growth in the next century, the SBIR program is a good investment for the future. 
   I am proud of the many SBIR successes that have come from my state of Massachusetts. Companies like Advanced Magnetics of Cambridge, Massachusetts, illustrate that success. Advanced Magnetics used SBIR funding to develop a drug making it easier for hospitals to find tumors in patients. The development of this drug increased company sales and allowed Advanced Magnetics to hire additional employees. This is exactly the kind of economic growth we need in this nation, because jobs in the high-technology field pay well and raise everyone's standard of living. That is why I am such a strong supporter and proponent of the SBIR program and fully support its reauthorization. 
   This legislation also includes H.R. 2614, which reauthorizes SBA's 504 loan program, which passed the Senate on June 14, 2000. The bill and our managers' amendment make common-sense changes to this critical economic development tool. These changes will greatly increase the opportunity for small business owners to build a facility, buy more equipment, or acquire a new building. In turn, small business owners will be able to expand their companies and hire new workers, ultimately resulting in an improved local economy. 
   Since 1980, over 25,000 businesses have received more than $20 billion in fixed-asset financing through the 504 program. In my home state of Massachusetts, over the last decade small businesses have received $318 million in 504 loans that created more than 10,000 jobs. The stories behind those numbers say a lot about how SBA's 504 loans help business owners and communities. For instance, in Fall River, Massachusetts, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a custom packing plant for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to 30 employees in just two short years and is in the process of another expansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs. 
   Under this reauthorization bill, the maximum debenture size for Section 504 loans has been increased from $750,000 to $1 million. For loans that meet special public policy goals, the maximum debenture size has been increased from $1 million to $1.3 million. It has been a 
   decade since we increased the maximum guarantee amount. If we were to change it to keep pace with inflation, the maximum guarantee would be approximately $1.25 million instead of $1 million. Instead of implementing such a sharp increase, we are striking a balance between rising costs and increasing the government's exposure and only seeking to increase the cap to $1 million. 
   I am pleased to say that this legislation also includes a provision assisting women-owned businesses, which I first introduced in 1998 as part of S. 2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. This provision adds women-owned businesses to the current list of businesses eligible for the larger public policy loans. As the role of women-owned businesses in our economy continues to increase, we would be remiss if we did not encourage their growth and success by adding them to this list. 
   The 504 loan program gets results. It expands the opportunities of small businesses, creates jobs and betters communities. It is crucial that it be reauthorized, and that is what this legislation does. 
   Another important program reauthorized under this legislation and strengthened by the managers' amendment is the Microloan program. I have long been a believer in microloans and their power to help people gain economic independence while improving the communities in which they live. This bill authorizes lower levels for the microloan program than the Administration requested. Of course, I would prefer to have full funding because I believe it is important to expand the program so that it is available everywhere. But, compromise is part of the legislative process, and a moderate increase is better than none at all. Nevertheless, I will be monitoring usage of microloan technical assistance and have told Chairman BOND that the Senate Committee on Small Business should revisit the issue before the end of the three-year reauthorization period if the level authorized is inadequate to meet program needs. 
   In addition to funding, our managers' amendment also makes important changes to the microloan program. We have heard from intermediaries and economic development activists around the country that with some administrative and legislative changes, this program could have a greater impact. This bill takes some important steps in the right direction. Right now we have 156 microlending intermediaries. This bill will permit the program to grow to 250 in FY 2001; to 300 in FY 2002, and to 350 in FY 2003. It also increases loan levels and technical assistance levels over three years. With more technical assistance, we will be able to increase the number of intermediaries, and therefore reach more borrowers in rural areas or large states. I also support the provision to raise the cap on microloans from $25,000 to $35,000, making it adequate to help micro-entrepreneurs in states and urban areas where operating costs are more expensive. Senator SNOWE's provision to establish $1 million for peer-to-peer training for microlenders is also included. I strongly support this concept because it will help the program grow while maintaining its high quality and low loss rates. 
   Small Business Development Centers (SBDC) are also reauthorized under this legislation. SBDCs serve tens of thousands of small business owners and prospective owners every year. This bill takes a giant step to retool the formula that determines how much funding each state receives. This is an important program for all of our states and we want no confusion about its funding. Without this change, some states would have suffered sharp decreases in funding, disproportionate to their needs. I appreciate and am glad that the SBA and the Association of Small Business Development Centers worked with me to develop an acceptable formula so that small businesses continue to be adequately served. 
   This legislation also reauthorized the National Women's Business Council. For such a tiny office, with minimal funding and staff, it has managed to make a significant contribution to our understanding of the impact of women-owned businesses in our economy. It has also done pioneer work in raising awareness of business practices that work against women-owned business, such as some in the area of Federal procurement. Recently, they completed two studies that documented the world of Federal procurement and its impact on women-owned businesses. 
   According to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, over the past decade, the number of women-owned businesses in this country has grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms. These firms generate almost $3.6 trillion in sales annually and employ more than 27.5 million workers. With the impact of women-owned businesses on our economy increasing at an unprecedented rate, Congress relies on the Council to serve as its eyes and ears as it anticipates the needs of this burgeoning entrepreneurial sector. Since it was established in 1988, the bipartisan Council has provided important unbiased advice and counsel to Congress. 
   This Act recognizes the Council's work and reauthorizes it for three years, from FY 2001 to 2003. It also increases the annual appropriation from $600,000 to $1 million. The increase in funding will allow the council to: support new and ongoing research; produce and distribute reports and recommendations prepared by the Council; and create an infrastructure to assist states develop women's business advisory councils, coordinate summits and establish an interstate communication network. 
   The Historically Underutilized Business Zone, or ``HUBZone'' program, which passed this Committee in 1997, has tremendous potential to create economic prosperity and development in those areas of our Nation that have not seen great rewards, even in this time of unprecedented economic health and stability. This program is similar to my New Markets legislation in that it creates an incentive to hire from, and perform work in, areas of this country that need assistance the most. This bill would authorize the HUBZone program at $10 million for the next 3 years, which is $5 million above the Administration's request.  
   Additionally, the managers' amendment included very important provisions to include those areas which were inadvertently missed when this legislation was crafted--namely, Indian tribal lands. I appreciate the willingness of the Committee on Indian Affairs to work with our Committee to create HUBZone opportunities in the states of Alaska and Hawaii, and in other Indian tribal lands. 
   The HUBZone section does not contain any provision addressing the interaction of the HUBZone and 8(a) minority contracting programs. I believe that the 8(a) program is an important and necessary tool to help minority small businesses receive access to government contracts. The Chairman and I agree that there is a need to enhance the participation of both 8(a) and HUBZone companies in Federal procurement. It is my intention that the Senate Committee on Small Business consider the issue of enhancing small business procurement in the next Congress. 
   The Senate managers' amendment also includes a provision relating to SBA's cosponsorship authority. This authority allows SBA and its programs to cosponsor events and activities with private sector entities, thus leveraging the Agency's limited resources. The managers' amendment extends the authority for three additional years. This provision also adds ``information and education'' to the types of assistance that can be provided to small businesses by public and private sector organizations working with the SBA. This provision was recommended by the SBA as an effective change to training programs that are jointly run by the SBA and partner organizations. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by reminding my colleagues that all of our states benefit from the success and abundance of small businesses. This legislation makes their jobs a little easier. I ask my colleagues for their support of this important legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take this opportunity to commemorate the 30-day period from September 15 through October 15, which was designated by the President as Hispanic Heritage Month. Hispanic Heritage Month was first initiated by Congress in 1968 to celebrate the diverse cultures, traditions, and valuable contributions of Hispanic people in the United States.  
   We are living through the longest and strongest economic boom in American history. Since 1992, our economy has created 22 million new jobs--and Hispanics in Massachusetts and around the country are sharing in our national prosperity and contributing to this marvelous growth. Since 1993, Hispanic employment has increased by nearly one-third nationwide, and median weekly wages for Hispanics have risen more than 16 percent. The unemployment rate for Hispanics is the lowest since we began tracking it, and the median income for Hispanic households has risen 15.9 percent over the last three years. 
   But for all our progress, we know that many challenges remain. The dropout rate for Hispanic youth is astonishingly high. There are far too many young people with nothing to do after school, and the unemployment rate is still too high in many predominately-Hispanic communities. We cannot ignore or turn our backs on these young people, because they are truly the future of this nation. And prosperity that is not broadly shared is not true prosperity. 
   In February of 1994, President Clinton signed Executive order 12900, ``Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans,'' specifically, ``To advance the development of human potential, to strengthen the Nation's capacity to provide high-quality education, and to increase opportunities for Hispanic Americans to participate in and benefit from Federal education programs.'' I am proud to tell you about an initiative in my state, the Massachusetts Education Initiative for Latino Students (MEILS), which was created to implement the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for Hispanic Americans in Massachusetts. MEILS created a Steering Committee responsible for developing and implementing a comprehensive approach for dealing with Latino educational issues statewide. MEILS has formulated a partnership between the state, federal, and local government to ensure high-level educational achievements for Latino students, from preschoolers to lifelong learners. MEILS has already established working groups in 13 of the communities with the highest percentages of Hispanic populations in the state of Massachusetts. Last Fall, MEILS held a conference in Worcester, Massachusetts, expecting approximately 300-400 participants, but ultimately drawing 700. They are currently planning their second conference, anticipating over 1,000 participants. 
   By 2050, one-quarter of all Americans will be Hispanic. In Massachusetts, Hispanics comprise 6% of the population and have made significant contributions to our communities, to our workplaces, to our public schools, and to academe. One of those contributors, Juan Maldacena, an Associate Professor of Physics at Harvard University, recently secured a MacArthur Foundation ``genius'' grant for his work on ``string theory,'' a method for describing gravity in the same terms as other forces in the universe. A colleague of Mr. Maldacena's from the University of Chicago was so taken by this theory that he penned a new version of the ``Macarena'' called the ``Maldacena.'' 
   We know that the key to growing and staying strong is making sure that every American participates in our nation's prosperity. I will continue, and I hope the Congress will continue, to work closely with the Hispanic community because, together, we bring Massachusetts and America closer to the vision of a nation where all citizens are free to reach their potential.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senate is debating an important question with tremendous ramifications for our relationship with China and the American economy: whether to extend Permanent Normal Trade Relations status to China (PNTR). 
   The opponents of PNTR argue that China is not worthy of receiving PNTR. They offer a laundry list of reasons. Its track record on human rights has not only not improved but has gotten worse. It continues to ignore commitments made in the nonproliferation area, particularly with respect to the spread of missile technology. Its intimidation of Taiwan continues, with little indication that Chinese leaders are prepared to avail themselves of Taiwanese President Chen Shui-bian's offers to begin negotiations. Its compliance with existing agreements leave a lot to be desired. They speak passionately about those concerns. And these issues should never be overlooked in any thoughtful analysis of our relationship with China. They must productively be incorporated into a policy of engagement; but make no mistake: we must have a policy of engagement. 
   I support PNTR and I intend to vote for it. I will admit to you that when I read recent press accounts of yet another crackdown on religious practitioners in China--this time members of a Christian sect called the China Fang-Cheng Church--and of the deaths of three Falung Gong members who have been imprisoned--I understood once more the temptation to reverse my position and vote against PNTR. But I am not going to do that Mr. President, because PNTR is not an effective tool for changing China's behavior at home or abroad--and as much as we detest the behavior in China with regard to religious freedom, it is not symbolic protest that will bring about change, but thoughtful approaches and a new and different kind of engagement--economic as well as diplomatic--that will leverage real change in China in the years ahead . 
   So let me say once more, there is no question that the issues raised by the opponents of PNTR are serious and real. We are all outraged by the repression of Chinese citizens who simply want to practice their spiritual beliefs or exercise political rights. But denying China PNTR will not force the Chinese leadership to cease its crackdown on religious believers or political dissidents. It will not force China to abide by the principles of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) or slow down its nuclear or military modernization, or reverse its position on Taiwan. Denying PNTR will NOT keep China out of the WTO. But I am certain that denying China PNTR will set back the broad range of U.S. interests at stake in our relationship with China and undermine our ability to promote those interests through engagement. 
   China has the capacity to hinder or help us to advance our interests on a broad range of issues, including: nonproliferation, open markets and free trade, environmental protection, the promotion of human rights and democratic freedoms, counter-terrorism, counter-narcotics, Asian economic recovery, peace on the Korean peninsula and ultimately peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region. It is only by engaging with China on all of these issues that we will make positive progress on any and thereby advance those interests and our security. Engagement does not guarantee that China will be a friend. But by integrating China into the international community through engagement, we minimize the possibility of China becoming an enemy. 
   Over the last three decades, U.S. engagement with China, and China's growing desire to reap the benefits of membership in the global community have already produced real--if limited--progress on issues of deep concern to Americans, including the question of change in China. 
   There are two faces of life in China today: 
   The first face is the disturbing crackdown on the Falon Gong and the China Fang-Cheng Church, the increase of repressive, destructive activities in Tibet, the restraints placed on key democracy advocates and the harassment of the underground churches. The second face is that of the average citizen who has more economic mobility and freedom of employment than ever before and a better standard of living. 
   More information is coming in to China than ever before via the Internet, cable TV, satellite dishes, and western publications. Academics and government officials openly debate politically sensitive issues such as political reform and democratization. Efforts have begun to reform the judicial system, to expand citizen participation and increase choices at the grass roots level. 
   While China's leaders remain intent on controlling political activity, undeniably there are indications that the limits of the system are slowly fading, encouraging political activists to take previously unimaginable steps including the formation of an alternative Democracy Party. On the whole, Chinese society is more open and most Chinese citizens have more personal freedom than ever before. Of course, we must press for further change, but we should not ignore the remarkable changes that have taken place. 
   China's track record on weapons proliferation is another issue of serious concern. Senator THOMPSON has introduced sanctions legislation targeted at China's proliferation policies, and I understand he will be offering that as an amendment to PNTR. With this legislation, Senator THOMPSON has done the Senate and this Nation a great service, by forcing us to take a hard look at the reality of China's commitment to international proliferation norms. And that reality, particularly over the last  eighteen months, is disturbing. But I do not believe that a China-specific sanctions bill is an effective response to the challenge of weapons proliferation. And we should not scuttle PNTR just to make a point--however valid--about China's continuing export of missile-related technology. 
   Our concern about recent Chinese activities related to the transfer of missile technology should not lead us to overlook the totality of China's performance in the arms control area. The fact is China has taken steps, particularly in the last decade, to bring its nonproliferation and arms export control policies more in line with international norms. China acceded to the Biological Weapons Convention in 1984. In 1992, China acceded to the Nonproliferation Treaty, NPT. China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, CTBT, and the next year promulgated new nuclear export controls identical to the dual-use list used by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. In 1997 China joined the Zangger Committee, which coordinates nuclear export policies among NPT members. The same year it ratified the Chemical Weapons 
   Convention and began to enforce export controls on dual-use chemical technology. In 1998 China published detail export control regulations for dual-use nuclear items. These developments have also been accompanied by various pledges, for example not to export complete missile systems falling within MTCR payload and range and not to provide assistance to Iran's nuclear energy program. China's commitment to these pledges has been spotty but the fact is, China's record today is dramatically different from what it was in the 1980s or the three decades before. Then we were faced with a China exporting a broad range of military technology to an array of would-be nuclear states including Libya, Syria, Iran, Iraq, Pakistan and North Korea. Today, our principal concern is Chinese exports in the area of missile-related technology--not complete missile systems--and to two countries: Pakistan and Iran. That, it seems to me, is progress, and progress made during a period of growing engagement between China and the international community. 
   Some in this body, frustrated that our current engagement with China has born little fruit, are offering amendments in an attempt to use the presumed leverage in PNTR as a means of changing China's policies. I believe that engagement offers the best prospects for promoting our interests with China but I understand and share their frustration over the way in which the current administration has engaged China. The next administration must engage with greater clarity of message, consistency of policy, pragmatism about what can be achieved and over what time frame, and determination to hold China accountable when it misbehaves or ignores commitments made. 
   However, we should not let our frustration with the benefits of engagement lead us to undermine that policy by delaying or denying PNTR in a vain quest to change China overnight. PNTR is not a ``reward'', as the opponents of PNTR suggest. It is a key element in our economic engagement with China and an affirmation of our intention to have a normal trading relationship with China, as we do with the overwhelming majority of our other trading partners. Many of China's most outspoken critics including Martin Lee, the head of Hong Kong's Democratic Party, Bao Tong, one of China's most prominent dissidents; and Dai Qing, an engaging writer and environmental activist who was jailed in the wake of Tiananmen Square for her pro-democracy activities and writings, want us to give PNTR to China. They want it because they know that drawing China deeper into the international community's institutions and norms will promote more change in China over time. As Dai Qing told U.S. when she testified before the Foreign Relations Committee in July: ``Firstly, PNTR will help to reduce governmental control over economy and society; secondly, PNTR will help to promote the rule of law; and thirdly, PNTR will help to nourish independent political and social forces in China.'' 
   The opponents of PNTR have argued that we are giving up leverage over China because we are abandoning our annual review of U.S.-China relations. This argument ignores two critical points: first, there has been little leverage in the MFN review because China can simply do business with others; and second, Congress has never revoked the status in the last 12 years. So how meaningful is this review in reality? There is nothing in the action we are contemplating here that prevents Congress from acting in the future, if it so desires. In fact, the pending legislation sets up a commission to review China's performance on key issues including human rights and labor rights and trade compliance so that if Congress wants to act, we will be better informed at the outset. 
   This vote on extending PNTR is not a referendum on the China of today. It is a vote on how best to pursue all of our interests with China including our economic interests. Extending PNTR will allow the United States to enjoy economic benefits stemming from the bilateral agreement negotiated between the United States and China. I am concerned that critical labor, human rights and environmental protections were left out of the agreement. However, I believe the agreement undeniably forces China to open its doors to more trade, and if we fail to vote in favor of PNTR, we risk forfeiting increased trade with the largest emerging market in the world to other countries in Europe and Asia. 
   This would be no small loss for the United States. Just consider the facts which underscore the importance of trade with China. By granting PNTR status to China, the U.S. will be able to avail itself to China--to make American goods and services available to one-fifth of the world's population. China is the world's second largest economy in terms of domestic purchasing power. It is the world's seventh largest economy in terms of Gross Domestic Product and is one of the fastest growing economies in the world. Simply put, China's economy is simply too large to ignore. 
   It is of course true that there has been sharp growth in the U.S. trade deficit with China, which surged from $6.2 billion in 1989 to more than $68 billion in 1999. But it is also true that the deficit is in large part due to the fact that China has closed its doors to U.S. products. 
   I believe that only by granting PNTR to China will U.S. businesses be able to open those doors and export goods and services to China, so that our economy can continue to grow and our workers be fully employed. U.S. exports to China and Hong Kong now support 400,000 American jobs. Trade with China is of increasing importance in my home state. China is Massachusetts' eighth largest export market. The Massachusetts Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Massachusetts calculated that in 1999, Massachusetts exported goods worth a total of nearly $366 million to China. That represents an increase in total exports to China of more than 15 percent from the previous year and translates into more jobs and a stronger economy in my state. 
   The bilateral trade agreement between the U.S. and China will give businesses in every state the chance to increase their exports to China, ultimately leading to more growth here at home. Under the agreement, China is committed to reducing tariffs and removing non-tariff barriers in many sectors important to the U.S. economy. China has agreed, for instance, to cut overall agricultural tariffs for U.S. priority products--beef, grapes, wine, cheese, poultry, and pork--from 31.5 percent to 14.5 percent by 2004. Overall industrial tariffs will fall from an average of 24.6 percent to 9.4 percent by 2005. Tariffs on information technology products--which have been driving the tremendous economic prosperity our country is currently enjoying--would be reduced from an average level of 13.3 percent 
   to zero by the year 2005. China must also phase out quotas within five years. The U.S. market, on the other hand, is already open to Chinese products. We have conceded nothing to China in terms of market access, while China must now open its doors to increased exports. This is a one-way trade agreement favoring the United States of America. 
   China has made other concessions that are likely to be extremely beneficial to the U.S. economy. It has agreed to open service sectors, such as distribution, telecommunications, insurance, banking, securities, and professional services to foreign firms.  China has agreed to reduce restrictions on auto trade. Tariffs on autos will fall from 80-100 percent to 25 percent by 2006, and auto quotas will be eliminated by 2005. Perhaps most importantly, the agreement and this legislation provide that China must accept the use by the United States of safeguard, countervailing, and antidumping provisions to respond to surges in U.S. imports from China that might harm a U.S. industry. 
   A favorable vote on PNTR will also benefit the agriculture industry. China is already the United States' sixth largest agricultural export market, and that market is expected to grow tremendously in the 21st century. China is a major purchaser of U.S. grain, meat, chicken, pork, cotton and soybeans. In the next century, USDA projects China will account for almost 40 percent of the growth in U.S. farm exports. 
   We must recognize that the U.S. will not be able to sell its wheat, provide its financial services, or market its computer software in China unless we grant China PNTR status. Let there be no mistake, China will become a member of the WTO whether or not we pass PNTR. Under the Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, the United States can and does extend Normal Trade Relations treatment to China annually. If Congress fails to amend its laws to provide permanent, rather than annual, normal trade relations, we will not be able to satisfy the requirement that normal trade relations be unconditional. The U.S.-China agreements could therefore not be enforced and the U.S. would not be able to avail itself to the dispute resolution procedures of the WTO. 
   The benefits of the WTO agreement extend beyond more open Chinese markets to the application of a rules-based system to China, a country that has historically acted outside the world's regulations and norms. Under the terms of this agreement, the Chinese government is obliged to publish laws and regulations subjecting some of China's most important decisions to the review of an international body for the first time. WTO membership will force China to accelerate market-oriented economic reforms. This will be a difficult and challenging task for China, but an important one that will result in freer and fairer trade with China. 
   Despite the likely benefits that the United States will reap if it grants PNTR to China, we must pay attention to the concerns expressed by those in the labor, environmental and human rights communities about the impact of this vote. We must hear their voices and heed their warnings so that we are on alert in our dealings with China. In China, workers cannot form or join unions and strikes are prohibited. There are no meaningful environmental standards and the prevalent use of forced labor make production in China extremely inexpensive. Because they cannot bargain collectively, Chinese workers are paid extremely low wages and are subject to unsafe working conditions. 
   No one on either side of the aisle, not even the most ardent supporter of PNTR, supports these most undemocratic, morally reprehensible conditions in China, and we have a duty and a responsibility to pay attention to the conditions there. It is my hope and belief that as U.S. firms move into China, they will bring with internationally-accepted business practices that may actually raise labor and environmental standards in China. I also hope that they will provide opportunities for Chinese workers to move from state-owned to privately-owned companies, or from one private company to another, where the conditions are better. These steps are small, but important. Nevertheless, the international community in general and the United States in particular must remain vigilant in order to ensure that standards are rising in China and it is simply not the case where the only benefit to come from freer trade with China is that the corporate coffers of large companies are being lined with money saved on the backs of Chinese laborers. 
   We must also be vigilant in ensuring that once China becomes a member of the WTO, it complies with the rules of the WTO and lives up to its commitments under trade agreements. There are many critics of PNTR with China who rightly point out that China has an extremely poor record of compliance with current trade agreements with the U.S., and that it ``can't be trusted'' to live up to commitments once it is in the WTO. China's trading partners worldwide must cooperate to police China so as to ensure its adherence to the trade concessions it has made. 
   The environment is another area in which we must be vigilant in our efforts to encourage the Chinese government to begin to promulgate and enforce environmental standards. Right now, levels of air pollution from energy and industrial production in Shanghai and Shenyang are the highest in the world. Water pollution in regions such as Huai River Valley is also among the worst in the world. In 1995, more than one half of the 88 Chinese cities monitored for sulfur dioxide were above the World Health Organization guidelines. It is estimated that nearly 178,000 deaths in urban areas could be prevented each year by cleaner air. We simply cannot allow this complete degradation of the environment in China to continue unabated. 
   Denying PNTR to China won't stop its unfair labor practices or its environmental devastation. So while I would have liked to see these issues addressed in this legislation or in the bilateral agreement, I believe that, on balance, the risk of not engaging China at this time far outweighs any value we would gain by signaling to China that we still do not approve of its practices and policies. That symbolic signal would only strip U.S. of the leverage that WTO membership brings with it to hold China accountable and effect real progress. If the U.S. fails to support PNTR, and thus fails to take advantage of the benefits of China's inevitable membership in the WTO, U.S. companies stand to lose market share and U.S. workers may lose jobs to European and Asian companies that gain a strong foothold in China. We would also lose the opportunity to engage China and advance our positions on all of our interests including human rights and security. And that would be far too high a price to pay in this new global economy for the short term rewards of merely sending a message with far more negative consequences for U.S. than for China. 
   Engagement, is the course we must pursue--intelligently, with strength and a commitment to accountability. Engagement is a course best pursued by granting China Permanent Normal Trade Relations and bringing it into the WTO. It is in the best interests of our economy and it is in the best interests of our foreign policy, and I hope we can all join together in moving the United States Senate and our Nation in that direction.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I speak today to make note of the anniversary of the signing into law of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. Twenty years ago today, the Reg Flex Act, as it is better known, was signed into law after its passage by the 96th Congress. This historic piece of legislation explicitly recognized the importance of small businesses to the economy and their contributions to innovation and competition. 
   With the Reg Flex Act, Congress intended that no federal action taken in  the name of good public policy would undermine the nation's equally important commitment to preserving competition and to maintaining a level playing field for small businesses. The law established an analytical framework in which regulatory agencies were directed to consider the impact on small businesses of their regulatory proposals and consider alternatives that would have a more equitable impact without compromising public policy objectives. The Reg Flex Act had bipartisan support, as well as the support of the small business community. 
   In 1996 the Senate Small Business Committee led the effort to strengthen the Reg Flex Act with the passage of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act. Under SBREFA, for the first time, the courts were given jurisdiction to review agency compliance with the law and impose remedial action where necessary. This and other changes have truly altered the culture within regulatory agencies. Federal government agencies are learning that they must balance diverse public interest concerns when developing regulations and they must ensure that their actions do not adversely affect small businesses and competition. Nearly every regulation is now examined for its impact on small businesses. Although they may never know it, small businesses have saved billions of dollars and countless work hours thanks to agency compliance with the Reg Flex Act. 
   Mr. President, the Reg Flex Act clearly helps small businesses every day by compelling agencies to reduce their compliance burdens. The Senate should take pride in the innovative Reg Flex Act, which has helped to create the best climate in the world for small business growth and prosperity. As the Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Small Business, I am pleased to have played a key role in strengthening this legislation and ensuring its effective application for the benefit of our nation's small businesses.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to pay tribute to someone who has been a good friend to those of us in Massachusetts who are committed to quality higher education, Dr. John DiBiaggio, for his service, his vision, and the academic leadership the he has shown--not just in Massachusetts, but nationwide. Dr. DiBiaggio has been the president of Tufts University, in Medford, Massachusetts, since 1993. Yesterday he announced that he will be retiring in June 2002 and I know that he will be sorely missed. 
   I think anyone who has spent time at Tufts in the last several years has seen Dr. DiBiaggio, or his wife, Nancy, walking their dogs on campus. When the DiBiaggio's moved to Medford in 1993, they moved into Gifford House, an on-campus residence. I think that that decision to live on campus, just like an incoming freshman, to have an sincere open-door policy, and to create a real sense of community, is an enormous testimony to his dedication to service. 
   Dr. DiBiaggio's tenure at Tufts has been an extremely successful one. Since Dr. DiBiaggio arrived at Tufts, the university has shored up its fiscal  condition by tripling the size of its endowment. The University has built six new buildings at its Grafton campus and a new fieldhouse. The school's student-faculty ratio has dropped to 8:1, one of the best of any major college or university. Since Dr. DiBiaggio became president, the University has established study abroad programs in Chile, Moscow, Japan and Ghana. 
   Most recently, he announced the creation of a new school of public service. In my judgment, The University College of Citizenship and Public Service will be one of Dr. DiBiaggio's most enduring legacies at Tufts. Despite the large increase in volunteer rates among Tufts students, Massachusetts residents and citizens nationwide, voter apathy and cynicism are at all-time highs. This new school will be a ``virtual college,'' which aims to incorporate the goals of public service into the school's curriculum. In April, the College of Citizenship and Public Service received a $10 million donation from Pierre and Pam Omidyar, the founders of the person-to-person online trading website, eBay. This gift allowed the College of Citizenship and Public Service to grant twenty-one scholarships to undergraduates to participate in programs geared to develop values and skills of active citizenship and covers the financial aid needs of students who are eligible for scholarship assistance. 
   Tufts is no longer one of Massachusetts' best kept secrets. Under Dr. DiBiaggio's guidance, Tufts' undergraduate, medical, dental, nutrition, international relations, and veterinary schools have grown in stature and are consistently ranked among the nation's elite. The number of applicants increased by more than 70 percent in just the past five years. The test scores, grades and class rank of the incoming freshmen continues to break school records. The University is now standard on U.S. News and World Report's annual list of top colleges and universities, rubbing elbows with Harvard, MIT and Boston College. 
   I again commend Dr. DiBiaggio on a successful term as President of Tufts University. All of us in Massachusetts know the tremendous vision and scholarship that will be the legacy of Dr. DiBiaggo's service at Tufts. I know that he will be missed by students, parents and alumni alike, but I thank him for his service, and I am genuinely happy for him and for Nancy. I wish them the best of luck in their future endeavors.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000. This legislation will protect patient access to home health care under Medicare, and ensure that providers are able to continue serving seniors who reside in medically underserved areas, have medically complex conditions, or require non-routine medical supplies. 
   Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, as a promise to the American people that, in exchange for their years of hard work and service to our country, their health care would be protected in their golden years. Today, over 30 million seniors rely on the Medicare home health benefit to receive the care they need to maintain their independence and remain in their own homes, and to avoid the need for more costly hospital or nursing home care. Home health care is critical. It is a benefit to which all eligible Medicare beneficiaries should be entitled. But, this benefit is being seriously undermined. Since enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, federal funding for home health care has plummeted. According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, Medicare spending on home health care dropped 48 percent in the last two fiscal years--from $17.5 billion in 1998 to $9.7 billion in 1999--far beyond the original amount of savings sought by the BBA. Across the country, these cuts have forced over 2,500 home health agencies to close and over 900,000 patients to lose their services. 
   In my own State of Massachusetts--a state that, because of economic efficiency, sustained a disproportionate share of the BBA cuts in Medicare home health funding--28 home health agencies have closed, 6 more have turned in their Medicare provider numbers and chosen to opt out of the Medicare program, and 12 more have been forced to merge in order to consolidate their limited resources. The home health agencies that have continued to serve patients despite the deep cuts in Medicare funding reported net operating losses of $164 million in 1998. The loss of home health care providers in Massachusetts has cost 10,000 patients access to home health services. Consequently, many of the most vulnerable residents in my state are being forced to enter hospitals and nursing homes, or going without any help at all. 
   To compound the problem, without Congressional action, Medicare payments for home health care will be automatically cut by an additional 15 percent next year. It is critical that we defend America's seniors against future cuts in home health services, and this bill will eliminate the additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments mandated by the BBA. However, we must do more than attempt to stop future cuts. Indeed, it is equally as important that we begin to provide relief to home health providers who are already struggling to care for patients. 
   During the first year of implementation of the Interim Payment System, IPS, agencies were placed on precarious financial footing because of insufficient payments, particularly for high-cost and long-term patients. Accordingly, it is critical that we bolster the efforts of home health care providers to transcend their current operating deficits, especially as they transition from the Interim Payment System to the Prospective Payment System, PPS. 
   The Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would ensure that providers are able to treat the sickest, most expensive patients who rely on home health care. Independent studies indicate that, under IPS, thousands of patients have been denied home health care benefits--while ``outlier'' patients (those who require the most intensive services) have been most at risk of losing access to care. To address the costs of treating the sickest homebound patients, this legislation provides additional funding for outliers under PPS. Specifically, this bill would set the funding level for outliers at 10 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made under PPS each year. This would double the current 5 percent allocation without reducing the PPS base payment. 
   In addition, the Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would remove the costs of non-routine medical supplies from the PPS base payment and, instead, arrange for Medicare reimbursement for these supplies on the basis of a fee schedule. PPS rates include average medical supply costs, but some agencies' patient populations have greater or lesser supply needs than the average. Thus, current rates would underpay agencies that treat patients with high medical supply needs and overpay agencies that treat patients with low medical supply needs. Agencies that treat our most ill, frail, and vulnerable should not be punished with low payment rates. 
   Agencies that treat patients in medically underserved communities also deserve equitable reimbursement for the services they provide. In order to address the unique costs of treating patients in underserved areas, the Home Health Refinement Amendments of 2000 would establish a 10 percent add-on to the episodic base payment for patients in rural areas, to reflect the increasing costs of travel, and a ``reasonable cost'' add-on for security services utilized by providers in our urban areas. These add-ons ensure that patients in all types of communities across the country continue to receive the home care they need and deserve. 
   Finally, this legislation would encourage the incorporation of telehealth  technology in home care plans by allowing cost reporting of the telemedicine services utilized by agencies. Telemedicine has demonstrated tremendous potential in bringing modern health care services to patients who reside in areas where providers and technology are scarce. Cost reporting will provide the data necessary to develop a fair and reasonable Medicare reimbursement policy for telehomecare and bring the benefits of modern science and technology to our nation's underserved. 
   Unless we increase the federal commitment to the Medicare home health care benefit, we can only expect to continue to imperil the health of an entire generation. We must act to deliver on that promise that President Johnson made 25 years ago--our nation's seniors deserve no less. 
   Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. GRASSLEY, and Mr. JEFFORDS):

   Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to oppose the Thompson amendment. I want to talk a little bit about the reasons I oppose it, and perhaps respond a little bit to some of the comments that have been made in the course of the afternoon. 
   Having been part of these debates now for some period of time, I have begun to notice the ebb and flow on how we approach these issues of concern about foreign countries, about issues of national security and how they do and do not impact us. It is interesting because we tend to go to the extremes. That is perhaps part of the nature of the Senate. It is part of the nature of the political process. But what is clear to me, after observing this over a long period of time, is that it is not always beneficial to furthering the larger national security concerns of the country. 
   I approached this issue originally with much the same concern as the Senator from Tennessee. I think all of us are deeply concerned about the degree to which certain countries seem to be contributing to the potential of instability in the world. Obviously, there is nothing more destabilizing or threatening than weapons of mass destruction. We have spent an enormous amount of time and energy focused on Iraq, on Iran, on Russia, on loose nukes, on nuclear materials, and of course on China and on the issue of the transfer of technology to Pakistan. 
   So I took the time to go to the Intelligence Committee briefing on this subject, to really get a handle and try to get a sense of how concerned should I be about this: Are we really at a point where this is so clear-cut and such an egregious violation of Presidential discretion that the Congress of the United States ought to step in and, in a sense,  take away from the President whatever flexibility he has been left with to date? 
   May I say I went into that briefing with a sense of: Boy, these guys have really screwed up and now is the time to bring the hammer down. I came out of it, however, with a much different sense of the road that has been traveled and of the choices we ought to be making and we face in the Senate today. 
   The fact is, on nuclear issues--separate from missile technology transfers--we have made rather remarkable progress in the last 8 years, with a country that very recently accepted no norms of international proliferation behavior. 
   On March 9, 1992--let's recollect here, this is only 8 years ago, a very short span of time in terms of the evolutionary process occurring in China, and particularly a short span of time in terms of our period of real engagement with China. 
   On March 9, 1992, China acceded to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. 
   Later in 1992, China agreed not to export complete missile systems which fall within the payload and range parameters governed by the Missile Technology Control Regime. 
   On January 13, 1993, China signed the Chemical Weapons Convention. 
   In May of 1996, China agreed not to provide any assistance to nuclear facilities not under the International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. 
   In September of 1996, China signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. 
   In September of 1997, China promulgated new export controls, and that control list is substantively identical to the dual-use list used by the Nuclear Suppliers Group. 
   On October 16, 1997, China joined the Zangger Committee which coordinates nuclear export policies among NPT members. 
   On April 25, 1997, China ratified the Chemical Weapons Convention and began to enforce export controls on the dual-use chemical technology. 
   In June of 1998, China published a detailed export control regulation governing dual-use nuclear items. 
   In 1998, China agreed to phase out all support for Iran's nuclear energy program, even support to safeguarded facilities, which was not prohibited by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 
   So that is a rather remarkable series of progressive movements towards the community of nations whereby China not only signed agreements but began to lay down a substantive record of making choices to enforce and to adhere to those standards. 
   With respect to missiles and missile control technology, I am not going to stand here in front of the Senator from Tennessee or my other colleagues and suggest there are not some concerns. I am not going to suggest that, with respect to the 1994 agreement under the Missile Technology Control Regime, that with respect to the complete production facility there is not a question about Pakistan being in violation. That is what, in fact, prompted me to suggest perhaps the administration had erred and we ought to be doing more. 
   After 1997, that progress clearly tapers off. But I ask my colleagues to think hard about this--how do you best build a relationship with a nation that is neither friend nor enemy but a nation with which you have a developing relationship? How do you best build the capacity to achieve the kind of national security standards you want adhered to. 
   I suggest very respectfully that this unilateral, rather draconian, inflexible approach that is being offered in the Thompson amendment is precisely not the kind of step we should be taking. 
   Some colleagues of mine will focus on the PNTR components of this, the clean PNTR component. I am not going to focus on that now. That is a pretty simple argument, and they have done their part in articulating it. 
   I know the Senator from Tennessee did not intend to wind up in this predicament, offering his amendment to PNTR. In fairness to the Senator, there are colleagues in the Senate who saw political advantage in guaranteeing we come to the floor in the particular parliamentary knot we are in. He would have preferred an alternative venue for considering his amendment. That does not mean the argument can be ignored. I want my colleagues to vote against the Thompson amendment not only to preserve a ``clean'' PNTR, but because there are substantive reasons that thoughtful foreign policy and thoughtful relationships between the Senate and the executive branch mandate we refuse to accept this amendment in its current form. Specifically, let me talk about that for a minute. 
   There are a number of questions the Thompson amendment in its current form presents the Senate with. One, and the most evident of all, is will this amendment cause China to clean up its act on the issue of proliferation? 
   I say to my colleagues, if you look at the record of China's statements with respect to the annex of the missile technology and control regime, and if you measure where China has traveled in these past years, I think this act could have the opposite effect. It could drive China away from this slow process of understanding we have been working toward on proliferation. 
   I ask my colleagues to remember that as recently as only 1997, China did not even have an office that dealt with the issues of missile technology exports. In the last 5 or 6 years, China had no record whatsoever of restraining its companies from making any sales whatsoever. Yet already, because the United States of America has raised this issue again and again in a diplomatic context, we now are at a point where companies in China are being refused export rights for certain kinds of technology that are deemed to be dual use. In other words, China is moving towards the international community in its efforts to enforce the spirit--not the letter because they have not signed on to the law yet--but to enforce the spirit of the law. 
   I say to my colleagues, if you want China to sign on to the letter of the law and to sit down and negotiate with you a realistic regime by which we can lay out a mutual agreement on these issues, I guarantee that adopting this amendment will end those discussions and push us in the opposite direction from the direction in which we are trying to move. 
   We should also ask ourselves the question: Will this legislation force the President to sanction China for a proliferation violation? Does this legislation accomplish the goal which it sets out to accomplish? For all of the talk on the floor of the Senate and for all of the rhetoric about we have to send China a signal and we have to make certain that China toes the line, the bottom line is that even if this were passed and signed into law, it simply will not force the President to do what it sets out to do, because it offers the opportunity for the President to define a waiver in national security terms that can not be overridden by the Congress, under the procedures outline in this 
   bill. 
   I will set out a series of reasons why I believe colleagues should oppose this amendment, strictly on substantive grounds. 
   No. 1, this amendment takes a piecemeal approach to the global problem of proliferation by focusing on just a few countries. Originally, it was focused on China. Russia and North Korea are add-ons, afterthoughts, if you will, to try to make it more palatable and to somehow suggest there is a rationale for doing what we are doing. But the fact is, if the rationale is proliferation, it ought to apply to every country. There is no reason to have a specific China-centric effort when, in fact, there are many other countries about which we are equally concerned. 
   No. 2, it uses the blunt instrument of mandatory, unilateral sanctions to respond to any violation of the law no matter how inconsequential or unintentional. 
   No. 3, it bases those sanctions on unreasonably low standards of evidence. 
   No. 4, it imposes a burdensome reporting requirement on agencies whose time is arguably better spent stopping proliferation rather than simply collating thousands of pieces of information, some of which is based on such a low standard with respect to ``credible information'' that it could literally tie you up forever, and I will show evidence of that a little later. 
   No. 5, it introduces the U.S. capital markets for the first time in history into proliferation policy, a concept that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has strongly questioned. 
   In short, in my judgment, this legislation as currently drafted, would hinder rather than help U.S. efforts to  address the problem of proliferation in China or particularly elsewhere in the world. 
   I think the problems with this amendment start at the very beginning. The legislation is titled ``The China Nonproliferation Act.'' While Senator THOMPSON has, as I said, included a couple of other countries as targets, China remains singled out in the title and China remains the focus, as everybody understands. 
   Whether or not he intends it, that will certainly be the way it is read by the Chinese, and I know no observer, neutral or biased, who would not agree that would, in fact, be the result of this legislation. 
   So rather than heeding the next President and his advisers when they tell China its proliferation of WMD and ballistic missile technology has to end, China's leadership is going to point to this legislation as evidence that the United States is simply using the proliferation as an excuse to single them out. 
   Again, I repeat, we have spent decades working to pull China into a serious dialog about serious issues. China has come to acknowledge that it is important to embrace some of these international norms. And we should not force the next administration, whoever it is, to waste valuable diplomatic energy persuading China that we take proliferation seriously, whatever the source, even though the Senate in the context of this particular treaty is singling them out. 
   I do not believe we should set aside U.S. national interests simply to avoid angering the nations targeted by this amendment. That is not what I am suggesting. But I do think it is foolish of us to ignore real sensitivities and real reactions that occur and which we have especially seen historically with China. 
   This amendment essentially sends a signal to the world that we are less bothered by proliferation that does not come from the three states named in this legislation: If you are not China, if you are not North Korea, and if you are not Russia, somehow there we care less about your proliferation activities. I think that is a mistake in terms of any messages sent by the Senate. 
   The second major flaw in the amendment is its reliance on mandatory unilateral sanctions. We have had a number of debates on the floor of the Senate in the last couple of years about the negative impact of mandatory sanctions. It has almost, I think, become a consensus in the Senate that we want to move away from mandatory unilateral sanctions. 
   The sanctions that have been proven to work globally are the sanctions that are applied multilaterally. That is what happened in South Africa with apartheid. We have a long list of sanctions unilaterally applied by the United States of America which simply open up opportunities to other countries to fill the vacuum created we are unilaterally taken off the playing field. The question is whether or not that really helps us in terms of our nonproliferation objectives. 
   There is, in effect in this legislation a sledge-hammer approach; there is no subtlety. There is no ability to provide a President with flexibility. There is no ability even to allow a sufficient amount of time for the diplomatic process to work. 
   Because the requirement of this legislation is that the President has to impose all of the sanctions simultaneously in response to one proliferation violation. This is a heavyhanded, one-size-fits-all approach that destroys some of the flexibility to calibrate appropriate responses to inappropriate proliferation behavior. It destroys any potential that we might be able to change China's behavior as we go down the road. 
   I know it is not easy to argue for that sort of approach. It is always easier to come to the floor and talk tough or pass a tough kind of signal. But every time we have done that in the Senate, we have come back later questioning why it is that other countries are not following us, questioning why it is that other countries are, in fact, engaged in an overt effort to circumvent what the United States is doing, questioning how, in fact, we could have had a more effective policy in the first place. 
   I will fault this administration on its lack of focus and energy on the proliferation issue as a whole. They will not like to hear that. Nevertheless, I am convinced that unless you have a more visible, multilateral effort, then you are simply opening a Pandora's box of opportunity for the competitive marketplace to undermine what you are trying to achieve and, in the process, making it far more difficult to achieve a larger set of goals which require a more sophisticated approach. 
   The Thompson amendment also does not allow the United States 
   to coordinate its proliferation response in China, North Korea, or Russia with our allies. By forcing the President to impose sweeping unilateral sanctions within 30 days of submitting a report to Congress on proliferation it severely limits the President's ability to consult with either the government of the covered country or with U.S. allies in order to develop the most effective response. 
   This amendment ensures that the United States will therefore come into conflict with key allies in Europe and in Asia over how to best manage important relationships with China, Russia, and North Korea. I think that is of enormous concern. It is also, I may say, almost guaranteed to fail in changing the proliferation activity of a particular country. 
   Let's say China were caught in some particular effort, and we were unsuccessful, and you wind up unilaterally imposing the sanction. Do you really believe that at that point you have made it more likely they are going to acknowledge it, at least in the near term, by suddenly putting up their hands and saying, OK, you caught us red-handed? No pun intended. 
   The fact is, you have a much greater opportunity of holding people accountable if you use diplomacy to allow people sufficient opportunity to back down or to find alternative forms of behavior. 
   The third major failing of this amendment is that it creates an unreasonable standard for imposing sanctions, targeting even inadvertent and immaterial transfers of technology. All of the power the President needs to be able to hold a country accountable for proliferation violations already exists in the law today. You do not have to do what the Senator from Tennessee is seeking to do in order to hold these countries accountable. 
   I understand why he is doing it. He is doing it because the administration does not seem to want to do it. 
   So supporters of this amendment are trying to legislate the political will for a President to do something that, for whatever reasons, the current President has decided not to do. They have every right in the world to try to do that. But I ask my colleagues if we ought to take the permanent normal trade relations and put that on the table with respect to achieving something that is already in the law? 
   We have the Arms Export Control Act, section 3(f). We have the Arms Export Control Act, section 101, 102. We have section 129 of the Atomic Energy Act. We have section 821 of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. We have section 824 of the Nuclear Proliferation Prevention Act of 1994. We have section 2(b)(4) of the Export-Import Bank Act. We have sections 72 and 73 of the Arms Export Control Act; section 11(b) of the Export Administration Act. We have section 498(a)(b) of the Foreign Assistance Act. We have section 81 of the Arms Export Control Act; section 11(c) of the Export Administration Act with respect to chemical and biological weapons proliferation. We have Executive Order No. 12938 with respect to all weapons of mass destruction technology and delivery systems. We have the Iran-Iraq Arms Nonproliferation Act of 1992 and the Iran Nonproliferation Act of the year 2000. 
   In fact, missile technology transfers are already subject to U.S. law, and the President has the authority to sanction those violations. 
   Senator THOMPSON will argue: Well, we are going to make the Administration do it because they haven't done it. 
   That is the whole purpose of being here. I understand that argument. But in fact he won't necessarily make them do it because, of course, there is the waiver. 
   Well, then they have a redress. They can have one-fifth of the Congress, either House, which is 20 Senators who don't particularly like trade with China, they can come back and tell the President: Well, we don't like the fact  that you haven't applied sanctions. So they can try to go around that decision, which means we could be tied up on a standard that simply doesn't make sense for the Congress of the United States to be tied up on with respect to the potential of some kind of ``credible information'' suggesting some dual-use technology transfer that might contribute to the creation of a missile or some kind of missile capacity. That is the standard in here. Those U.S. sanctions laws I cited--with only one or two exceptions--includes the standard that a violation must be a knowing transfer of sensitive technology that makes a material contribution to a weapon of mass destruction program. A knowing transfer with a material contribution. The standard in this legislation requires any kind of contribution made with no deliberate knowing whatsoever. 
   So you have all five mandatory sanctions that could be put in place absent, obviously, the waiver I described, or if the Congress wanted to fight over it, which we can all find 100,000 reasons why it might choose to do so, given the nature of this institution in the last years. I don't think we should open ourselves up to that situation. 
   The new standard under this is any transfer that ``contributes to'' instead of the ``materially contributes to,'' the design, development, production, or acquisition of weapons of mass destruction. That could mean that the President could be required to impose sanctions on a company that makes legal and legitimate sales to a person or a government engaged in WMD development. 
   Fourth, the Thompson amendment requires a rather remarkably burdensome report identifying every person in China, Russia, and North Korea for whom there is ``credible information indicating that that person is engaged in proliferation activity.'' The flood of information guaranteed by this amendment will tie up already limited resources in the executive branch that could, in fact, be doing a far more serious job of working on proliferation itself. 
   The low credible information standard, I know, is derived from the Iran Nonproliferation Act of 2000, but that doesn't make it an advisable standard, No. 1, and, No. 2, under that standard, any piece of information from a source deemed to be credible has to be reported without discretion, even if the information later proves to be false. 
   Now, Congress has yet to receive the first report that was required under the INA, in part because the intelligence community has so far generated 8,000 pages of information that is deemed credible just on chemical and biological weapons and missile proliferation alone. Analyzing that mountain of data to determine what should be included in a report to Congress requires obviously countless man-hours. And as burdensome as the reporting requirement for INA is proving to be, believe me, that law, since it focuses only on one country with a far more identifiable set of sources because of the limits of commerce, trade, presents us with a gargantuan task. The Thompson amendment applies the same reporting requirement to possible proliferation from three nations: Russia, a gigantic task; China, a gigantic task; and North Korea, a far more limited task but nevertheless real. 
   It will also require reporting on all dual-use exports by the United States and key allies. The amendment's reporting requirement is tied to a report by the Director of Central Intelligence on suppliers of dual use and other technology. And because that report covers global exports of these technologies, the 1997 DCI report included information about legal and legitimate exports by the United States, Italy, Germany, France, and the United Kingdom. 
   According to the DCI, these nations were ``favorite targets of acquisition for foreign WMD programs.'' So the report required under section 3 of the Thompson amendment will likely include information on Western countries just so long as the information is credible. Firms in these countries can probably avoid the mandatory sanctions because those countries qualify for exemption for membership in multilateral nonproliferation regimes. It doesn't mean you won't report; it simply means you won't have the sanctions. But you still have to go through the convoluted process of providing the reports themselves and analyzing the information. 
   Finally, the Thompson amendment introduces U.S. capital markets for the first time in history into proliferation policy. It will impose indirect sanctions against those entities included in the President's report that are publicly traded on stock markets regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. 
   Companies named in the President's report will have to so inform investors, according to the requirements of this legislation. Supporters of the amendment argue that those provisions are simply to provide transparency for American investors in entities that are active in U.S. capital markets and involved in proliferation activities. 
   In fact, because the reporting standard is so low, it is likely that many of the entities implicated in the report will, with further investigation, be proven innocent of engaging in proscribed proliferation activities. In short, the President must shoot first, and ask questions later--after the financial damage has been done to firms that are innocent. 
   I don't want to step over the line as to what was classified and what is not classified with respect to the briefings. I think it is fair to say that the intelligence community will tell you that this is not a clear cut and dry process by which there is a clear understanding at every level of government in China as to who is doing what. There are many people in the intelligence community who have a sense that because of the orders given to the military a number of years ago with respect to their dependency on revenue in order to survive, that there are certain military entities that weren't necessarily under direct orders to effect something. 
   There are certain companies that weren't under central control, and the process of education with respect to America's concern and their own interests in adhering to these standards has been an ongoing process, which has brought a greater level of understanding and a greater level of commitment. 
   Now, I would personally prefer that China formally adopt and embrace the full measure of the Missile Technology Control Regime. That should be the immediate and first priority of our diplomacy. That should be the immediate and first effort of our country and of the multilateral efforts of our allies to guarantee that we are all on the same page, that we are all operating from the same level of understanding. 
   But the intelligence community acknowledges that there is a difference of opinion as to precisely what the understandings were or what was agreed to with respect to certain kinds of transfers, and that there is clearly progress being made with respect to the development of that understanding. And while it is difficult sometimes to take this position in the Senate, I argue that we have a much greater opportunity of reaching a fuller understanding and of guaranteeing that we move down a road of multilateral understanding and interest if we do not pass the Thompson amendment at this particular point in time. 
   The truth is that the United States-China relationship is our most complex and difficult bilateral relationship. It is one of the most important that we have. It is yet to be fully defined. As I said earlier, China cannot be considered a friend; but China cannot yet--and should not, we hope--ultimately be considered an enemy. There are many adversarial aspects of our relationship. There is much we wish would change more rapidly in China. Thirty years of engagement with China has taught us that you can't necessarily advance one issue at the expense of another. 
   While I am under no illusions that supporting PNTR is going to produce overnight changes in other aspects of China's policy that we care about, I am absolutely confident that singling China out with this amendment will make it more difficult to draw China into an international nonproliferation regime, and it will undermine the limited success that we have achieved in the arms control arena over the last 10 years. I am absolutely convinced that in the near term it will make progress more difficult without bringing us closer to the goal that we may well be able to achieve in the near term through other approaches.  
   I believe Senator THOMPSON has done the Senate and the country a service by raising this issue. It is important for us in the Senate to talk about the degrees to which there are currently misunderstandings, or the degrees to which we believe there are just overt violations by China of understandings. It is important for China to understand the full measure of our concern and determination to hold them and other countries accountable to the international norms with respect to proliferation issues. 
   But I believe that will best be done not by singling out three countries, but rather by continuing in the Senate to push all nations toward a stronger regime and a better understanding. I think this amendment is flawed, therefore, in its current definition, for the reasons I have stated. It is not the right response. It is not the right forum for addressing this issue that does deserve thoughtful and full consideration. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to oppose the Thompson amendment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to make a short statement about the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000, which the Senate will pass tonight through unanimous consent. 
   Mr. President, to understand this legislation, you must understand the situation from which we started. The federal government, through the Department of Transportation, regulates more than 2,000 gas pipeline operators with more than 1.3 million miles of pipe and more than 200 hazardous liquid pipeline operators with more than 156,000 miles of pipe. To protect the public safety, the environment and maintain reliability in the energy system over that massive system is an enormous challenge. I don't doubt that. The responsibility for meeting that challenge, no matter how great it is, falls upon the industry and federal government, specifically, DOT's Office of Pipeline Safety. It is clear that both OPS and the industry have failed to raise to that challenge, and we have paid a high price. 
   According to the OPS, since 1984, there have been approximately 5,700 natural gas and oil pipeline accidents nationwide, 54 of them in my home state of Massachusetts. In the 1990s, nearly 4,000 natural gas and oil pipeline ruptures--more than one each day--caused the deaths of 201 people, injuries to another 2,829 people, cost at least $780 million in property damages, and resulted in enormous environmental contamination and ecological damages. Two accidents in particular show us the tragic consequences of pipeline accidents. On June 10, 1999, a leaking gasoline pipeline erupted into a fireball in Bellingham, Washington. The fire extended more than one and half miles, killing two 10-year-old boys and a young man. The second accident took place in August in Carlsbad, New Mexico. A leaking natural gas pipeline erupted killing 12 members of an extended family on a camping trip. My sympathies go out to all those involved in these incidents. They are truly tragic. 
   The Senate Commerce Committee and others have investigated the cause of this tragic record. What we found, sadly, is that OPS was simply failing to do its job. The head of the National Transportation Safety Board, Jim Hall, gave the OPS ``a big fat F'' for its work. And as we considered the legislation in the Commerce Committee, I found that OPS had fallen short in the area of enforcement, in particular. Enforcement is the backbone of any system of safeguards designed to protect the public and the environment. Without the threat of tough enforcement, companies, the unfortunate record shows, do not consistently comply with safeguards. The resulting harm to people and places is predictable. I will not outline all of the details here today, but I recommend to anyone interested that they read the General Accounting Office's investigation into OPS dated May 2000. 
   The Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2000 includes enforcement reforms and enhances the role of OPS and the Department of Justice in enforcement. These provisions, which I proposed in the Commerce Committee, will, I believe, put some teeth into our pipeline safety laws. They include raising the maximum fines that OPS can assess a company from $500,000 to $1,000,000; ensuring that companies cannot profit from noncompliance; clarifying the law regarding one-call services; and allowing DOJ, at the request of DOT, to seek civil penalties in court to ensure that serious violators can be punished to the fullest extent of the law. 
   The bill makes other significant improvements to existing law. My colleagues from Washington, Mr. GORTON and Mrs. MURRAY have outlined many of these improvements and how they will improve pipeline safety. However,  Mr. President, S. 2438, despite significant improvements, also falls short in some areas. This is, in part, a reflection of inadequacy of current protections. It is my hope that further improvements can be made in conference with House and in discussions with the Clinton Administration. These improvements include allowing OPS to delegate enforcement to states as we do with the Clean Air Act and other laws; establishing federal standards for testing, re-testing, and repairs, leak detection, emergency shut-off valves, and failsafe mechanisms to prevent over pressurization; establishing federal standards to improve corrosion prevention; and removing the cost-benefit provisions incorporated into the law during the 1996 reauthorization, which may limit development of pipeline safety standards by requiring any new standards to meet economic and judicial tests that no other federal agency's regulations must meet. 
   I do not mean to detract from the hard work of Mr. MCCAIN, Mr. HOLLINGS, Mr. GORTON, Mrs. MURRAY, Mr. BINGAMAN and Mr. DOMENICI with my remarks. They have done great work crafting this bill and bringing it before the Senate for passage tonight. The public and the environment will be better protected thanks to their work.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank my friend, Mr. HOLLINGS, for his question. It is the intention of this legislation to treat all information requests pursuant to a single incident investigation as ``related'' for purposes of applying the civil penalty cap under Section 60122(a). To increase the incentive for pipeline companies to cooperate during an agency investigation, the cap has been increased to $1,000,000 for a related series of violations. That $1,000,000 cap is not intended to separately apply to each and every information request--of which there could be many--but rather serves as a restriction on the total amount of civil penalties applicable to a particular incident for failure to comply with the reporting requirement of Section 60117(b)(3).

   Mr. KERRY. Mr, President, my friend, Mr. BROWNBACK, is correct that it is the intention of Section 60117(b)(3) to reach those companies that don't comply with a clearly written request for documents and information from the agency, but thwart the investigative process either by refusing to turn over relevant information or by dragging their feet in providing it. The bill does not contemplate that this penalty provision will be applied to a company that actively cooperates in an investigation and makes a good faith effort to provide all of the information requested only to find out later that, because of an ambiguously or poorly written request, the company technically failed to meet the requirements of Section 60117(b)(3).

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to support Senate passage of H.R. 820, as a amended by the text of S. 1089, the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2000. I would like to thank Senator SNOWE for her leadership on this very important legislation, of which I am proud to be a cosponsor. The legislation provides authorization of appropriations for fiscal years 2000 through 2002 for the U.S. Coast Guard, and is an important step to helping them further their responsibilities that are so important to all of us. 
   It is widely recognized that the Coast Guard is critically underfunded. Pursuant to the administration's request, H.R. 820 authorizes a substantial increase in the two largest Coast Guard appropriation accounts, operating expenses and acquisition, construction, and improvement of equipment and facilities. Operating funds are critically needed by the Coast Guard to protect public safety and the marine environment, enforce laws and treaties, ensure safety and compliance in our marine fisheries, maintain aids to navigation, prevent illegal drug trafficking and illegal alien migration, and preserve defense readiness. 
   H.R. 820 will also provide an increase of approximately $130 million for the acquisition, construction, and improvement of equipment and facilities. These funds would be used to support vital long-term projects such as the Deepwater System, which the Coast Guard launched in 1998 to modernize its aging, and now inadequate, deepwater-capable cutters and aircraft. H.R. 820 specifically authorizes $42.3 million of the $9.6 billion required over the next twenty years for this Integrated Deepwater System. 
   Increasing authorization levels for the Coast Guard is important, but we must continue to work together to ensure the increases in this bill become a reality for the agency in the coming years. The Coast Guard is facing a fiscal crisis as a result of a number of budgetary pressures. While demand for Coast Guard services continues to increase, there has been no parallel increase in the amounts available for the Coast Guard in our budget. We are only in the beginning stages of modernizing aging ships and aircraft through the Deepwater Project, and funding needs will increase in the coming years. At the same time, the number of jobs created by the new economy has severely affected Coast Guard recruitment, and it disturbs me to report that the Coast Guard is short nearly 1,000 uniformed personnel. Ever-increasing fuel and maintenance costs, along with these escalating recruiting costs to address personnel shortfalls, have placed increased pressure on Coast Guard operations. 
   This year, these pressures forced the Coast Guard to reduce days at seas and flight hours for a number of its missions such as environmental protection, fisheries enforcement, and drug trafficking; meanwhile, the demands of these missions grow daily. More commercial and recreational vessels ply our waters today than ever before in our Nation's history. International trade has expanded greatly, resulting in increased maritime traffic through our Nation's ports and harbors. Tighter border patrols have forced drug traffickers to use the thousands of miles of our county's coastline as the means to introduce illegal drugs into our country. In a typical day the Coast Guard will save 14 lives, seize 209 pounds of marijuana and 170 pounds of cocaine, and save $2.5 million in property. 
   The continued operation of all of the Coast Guard services is critical. The men and women of the Coast Guard do their utmost for us every day. We owe it to them to provide the resources necessary to carry out their missions effectively and safely. H.R. 820 is a good first step, and I would hope that my colleagues will join Senator SNOWE and me in our continuing effort to rebuild our Nation's oldest sea service.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe the United States must do more to stop international criminals from washing the blood off their profits from the sale of drugs, from terror or from organized crime by laundering money into the United States financial system. 
   That is why today, along with Senators GRASSLEY, SARBANES, LEVIN, and ROCKEFELLER, I am introducing the International Counter-Money Laundering and Foreign Anticorruption Act of 2000 which will give the Secretary of the Treasury the tools to crack down on international money laundering havens and protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system from the influx of tainted money from abroad. 
   I very much appreciate work of the Secretary of Treasury Lawrence Summers in the development of this legislation. Secretary Summers has been a leader in bringing the issue of money laundering to the attention of the American public and the Congress. Earlier this year, Secretary Summers said, ``The attack on money laundering is an essential front in the war on narcotics and the broader fight against organized crime worldwide. Money laundering may look like a polite form of white collar crime, but it is the companion of brutality, deceit and corruption.'' 
   I am deeply saddened that I will not have the pleasure of working with Senator PAUL COVERDELL, who was to be the primary cosponsor of this legislation. His passing is a tremendous loss to the both to the American people and the U.S. Senate. 
   Money laundering is the financial side of international crime. It occurs when criminals seek to disguise money that was illegally obtained. It allows terrorists, drug cartels, organized crime groups, corrupt foreign government officials and others to preserve the profit from their illegal activities and to finance new crimes. It provides the fuel that allows criminal organizations to conduct their ongoing affairs. It has a corrosive effect on international markets and financial institutions. Money launderers rely upon the existence of jurisdictions outside the United States that offer bank secrecy and special tax or regulatory advantages to non-residents, and often complement those advantages with weak financial supervision and regulatory regimes. 
   Today, the global volume of laundered money is estimated to be 2-5 percent of global Gross Domestic Product, between $600 billion and $1.5 trillion. The effects of money laundering extend far beyond the parameters of law enforcement, creating international political issues while generating domestic political crises. 
   International criminals have taken advantage of the advances in technology and the weak financial supervision in some jurisdictions to place their illicit funds into the United States financial system. Globalization and advances in communications and technologies allow criminals to move their illicit gains faster and farther than ever before. The result has been a proliferation of international money laundering havens. The ability to launder money into the United States through these jurisdictions has allowed corrupt foreign officials to systemically divert public assets to their personal use, which in turn undermines U.S. efforts to promote democratic institutions and stable, vibrant economies abroad. 
   In February, State and Federal regulators formally sanctioned the Bank of New York for ``deficiencies'' in its anti-money laundering practices including lax auditing and risk management procedures involving their international banking business. The sanctions were based on the Bank of New York's involvement in an alleged money laundering scheme where more than $7 billion in funds were transmitted from Russia into the bank. Federal investigators are currently 
   attempting to tie the $7 billion to criminal activities in Russia such as corporate theft, political graft or racketeering. 
   In November 1999, the minority staff of the Senate Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on Investigations released a report on private banking and money laundering. The report describes a number of incidences where high level government officials have used private banking accounts with U.S. financial institutions to launder millions of dollars from foreign governments. The report details how Raul Salinas, brother of former President of Mexico, Carlos Salinas, used private bank accounts to launder money out of Mexico. Representatives from Citigroup testified at a Subcommittee hearing that the bank had been slow to correct controls over their private banking accounts. 
   During the 1980's, as chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, I began an investigation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI), and uncovered a complex money laundering scheme. Unlike any ordinary bank, BCCI was from its earliest days made up of multiplying layers of entities, related to one another through an impenetrable series of holding companies, affiliates, subsidiaries, banks-within-banks, insider dealings, and nominee relationships. 
   By fracturing corporate structure, record keeping, regulatory review, and audits, the complex BCCI family of entities was able to evade ordinary legal restrictions on the movement of capital and goods as a matter of daily practice and routine. In creating BCCI as a vehicle fundamentally free of government control, its creators developed an ideal mechanism for facilitating illicit activity by others. 
   BCCI's used this complex corporate structure to commit fraud involving billions of dollars; and launder money for their clients in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. Fortunately, we were able to bring many of those involved in BCCI to justice. However, my investigation clearly showed that rogue financial institutions have the ability to circumvent the laws designed to stop financial crimes. 
   In recent years, the United States and other well-developed financial centers have been working together to improve their antimoney laundering regimes and to set international anti-  money laundering standards. Back in 1988, I included a provision in the State Department Reauthorization bill that requires major money laundering countries to adopt laws similar to our own on reporting currency, or face sanctions if they did not. Panama and Venezuela wound up negotiating what were called Kerry agreements with the United States and became less vulnerable to the placement of U.S. currency by drug traffickers in the process. 
   Unfortunately, other nations--some small, remote islands--have moved in the other direction. Many have passed laws that provide for excessive bank secrecy, anonymous company incorporation, economic citizenship, and other provisions that directly conflict with well-established international anti-money laundering standards. In doing so, they have become money laundering havens for international criminal networks. Some even blatantly advertise the fact that their laws protect anyone doing business from U.S. law enforcement. 
   Just last month, the Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental body developed to develop and promote policies to combat financial crime, released a report naming fifteen jurisdictions--including the Bahamas, The Cayman Islands, Russia, Israel, Panama, and the Philippines--that have failed to take adequate measures to combat international money laundering. This is a clear warning to financial institutions in the United States that they must begin to scrutinize many of their financial transactions with customers in these countries as 
   possibly being linked to crime and money laundering. Soon, the Financial Action Task Force will develop bank advisories and criminal sanctions that will have the effect of driving legitimate financial business from these nations, depriving them of a lucrative source of tax revenue. This report has provided important information that governments and financial institutions around the world should learn from in developing their own anti-money laundering laws and policies. 
   The Financial Stability Forum has recently released a report that categorizes offshore financial centers according to their perceived quality of supervision and degree of regulatory cooperation. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) has begun a new crackdown on harmful tax competition. Members of the European Union has reached an agreement in principle on sweeping changes to bank secrecy laws, intended to bring cross-border investment income within the net of tax authorities. 
   The actions by the Financial Action Task Force, the European Union and others show a renewed international focus and commitment to curbing financial abuse around the world. I believe the United States has a similar obligation to use this new information to update our anti-money laundering status. 
   The International Counter-Money Laundering and Anticorruption Act of 2000 which I am introducing today would provide the tools the U.S. needs to crack down on international money laundering havens and protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system from the influx of tainted money from abroad. The bill provides for actions that will be graduated, discretionary, and targeted, in order to focus actions on international transactions involving criminal proceeds, while allowing legitimate international commerce to continue to flow unimpeded. It will give the Secretary of the Treasury--acting in consultation with other senior government officials and the Congress--the authority to designate a specific foreign jurisdiction, foreign financial institution, or class of international transactions as being of ``primary money laundering concern.'' Then, on a case-by-case basis, the Secretary will have the option to use a series of new tools to combat the specific type of foreign money laundering threat we face. In some cases, the Secretary will have the option to require banks to pierce the veil of secrecy that foreign criminals hide behind. In other cases, the Secretary will have the option to require the identification of those using a foreign bank's correspondent or payable-through accounts. And if these transparency provisions were deemed to be inadequate to address the specific problem identified, the Secretary will have the option to restrict or prohibit U.S. banks from continuing correspondent or payable-through banking relationships with money laundering havens and rogue foreign banks. Through these steps, the Secretary will help prevent laundered money from slipping undetected into the U.S. financial system and, as a result, increase the pressure on foreign money laundering havens to bring their laws and practices into line with international anti-money laundering standards. The passage of this legislation will make it much more difficult for international criminal organizations to launder the proceeds of their crimes into the United States. 
   This bill fills in the current gap between bank advisories and International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) sanctions by providing five new intermediate measures. Under current law, the only counter-money laundering tools available to the federal governments are advisories, an important but relatively limited measure instructing banks to pay close attention to transactions that involve a given country, and full-blown economic sanctions under the IEEPA. This legislation gives five additional measures to increase the government's ability to apply pressure against targeted jurisdictions or institutions. 
   This legislation will in no way jeopardize the privacy of the American public. The focus is on foreign jurisdictions, financial institutions and classes of transactions that present a threat to the 
   United States, not on American citizens. The actions that the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to take are designated solely to combat the abuse of our banks by specifically identified foreign money laundering threats. This legislation is in no way similar to the Know-Your-Customer regulations that were proposed by the regulators last year. Further, the intent of this legislation is not to add additional regulatory burdens on financial institutions, but, to give the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to take action against existing money laundering threats. 
   Let me repeat, this legislation only gives the discretion to use these tools to the Secretary of the Treasury. There is no automatic trigger which forces action whenever evidence of money laundering is uncovered. Before any action is taken, the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with other key government officials, must first determine whether a specific country, financial institution or type of transaction is of primary money laundering concern. Then, a calibrated response will be developed that will consider the effectiveness of the measure to address the threat, whether other countries are taking similar steps, and whether the response will cause harm to U.S. financial institutions and other firms. 
   This legislation will strengthen the ability of the Secretary to combat the international money laundering and help protect the integrity of the U.S. financial system. This bill is supported by the heads of all the major federal law enforcement agencies. The House Banking Committee recently reported out this legislation with a bipartisan 33-1 vote. I believe this legislation deserves consideration by the Senate during the 106th Congress. 
   Today, advances in technology are bringing the world closer together than ever before and opening up new opportunities for economic growth. However, with these new advantages come equally important obligations. We must do everything possible to insure that the changes in technology do not give comfort to international criminals by giving them new ways to hide the financial proceeds of their crimes. I believe that this legislation is a first step toward limiting the scourge of money laundering will help stop the development of international criminal organizations.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Magnuson-Stevens Act Amendments of 2000. I would like to thank Mr. HOLLINGS for joining me as an original cosponsor of this legislation to reauthorize and update the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act. As my colleagues and I well remember, we last substantially reauthorized the Act only four years ago with the Sustainable Fisheries Act--a three-year effort in itself. As in 1996, I look forward to working with members of the Commerce Committee as we update and improve this most important legislation. 
   Mr. President, the fishery resources found off U.S. shores are a valuable national heritage. In 1998, the last year for which we have figures, U.S. commercial fisheries produced $3.1 billion in dockside revenues, contributing a total of more than $25 billion to the Gross National Product. By weight of catch, the United States is the world's fifth largest fishing nation, harvesting over 4 million tons of fish annually. The United States is also a significant seafood exporter, with exports valued at over $8 billion in 1998. In addition to supporting the commercial seafood industry, U.S. fishery resources provide enjoyment for about 9 million saltwater anglers who take home roughly 200 million pounds of fish each year. 
   Over the past year, the Commerce Committee under Senator SNOWE's leadership has been holding a series of hearings around the country in preparation for this year's reauthorization. These hearings have pointed to one central theme--while there is certainly room for improving fisheries management under the Magnuson-Stevens Act, the sweeping changes we made in 1996 are still being implemented in each region. In fact, a number of regions are showing good progress, including New England where the yellowtail flounder and haddock stocks are rebounding. For this reason, I believe this year's reauthorization should leave in place the core conservation provisions of the Act, and focus on providing adequate resources, and any organizational or other changes necessary for NOAA Fisheries and Regional Fishery Management Councils to achieve the goals we set forth in the Sustainable Fisheries Act. 
   Mr. President, the bill I introduce today outlines a proposal for making this a reality. While we have added increasingly complex technical and scientific requirements to the fisheries management process, we have failed in many cases to provide the resources necessary to meet these requirements. Effective fisheries management for the future will rely on committing adequate resources and direction to the fisheries managers as well as the fishing participants. These include providing necessary funding increases to both the agency and the Councils, creation of a national observer program, establishing a nationwide cooperative research program with the fishing industry, and ensuring that we are collecting the socioeconomic data we need to design management measures that  make sense for fishermen. This legislation aims to remedy this by providing a significant increase in funding, and specifying amounts required to support both the new initiatives and existing programs. 
   Over the years, we have reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Act many times, and each time we have wrestled with the question of how to improve the ability of the Regional Fisheries Management Councils to effectively and fairly implement the requirements of the Act. This bill suggests ways in which to begin remedying these concerns. First, the bill would clarify that the Secretary of Commerce must ensure representation on the Council of all qualified persons who are concerned with fisheries conservation and management. While fishermen are the source of tremendous wisdom and expertise needed in managing these fisheries, there are others such as scientists and those with other relevant experience who may also provide valuable service to the Councils. To help the Secretary meet this requirement, the bill requires Governors to consult with members of recreational, commercial, and other fishing or conservation interests within a State before selecting a list of nominees to send to the Secretary. We would like to see all those who can provide constructive attention to our fishery management problems to work together to forge innovative and progressive solutions. In addition, we must increase independent scientific involvement in the Councils, and my legislation would provide that Councils must involve Science and Statistics Committee members in the development and amendment of fisheries management plans. 
   I do know of the grave concerns expressed by conservation groups, fishermen, scientists and managers about problems with the existing fishery management process. I believe we need to address these questions, both with respect to the Councils and the Agency. I would like to work on this further with my colleagues as we go forward, but in the meantime this bill asks the National Academy of Sciences to bring together international and regional experts to evaluate what works and what may be broken in the current system, and what additional changes may be necessary to modernize and make more effective our entire fishery management process. 
   In our series of hearings around the country, we have consistently heard a call from both industry and conservation groups for observer coverage in our fisheries. We have failed to adequately provide funding mechanisms for observer coverage; each year, federally funded observers are deployed in as few as five to seven fisheries, and observer coverage is rarely over 20 percent. Without observer coverage, there is little hope that we will have statistically significant data, particularly data on actual levels of bycatch. I have included provisions to ensure that each fishery management plan details observer coverage and monitoring needs for a fishery, and created a new National Observer Program. This national program would address technical and administrative responsibilities over regional observer programs. I have also included provisions to allow Councils or the Secretary to develop observer monitoring plans, and have established a fishery observer fund which would include funds appropriated for this purpose, collected as fines under a new bycatch incentive program, or deposited through fees established under this section. 
   In the 1996 reauthorization, we took a first step in dealing with the issue of bycatch by instructing NMFS to implement a standardized bycatch reporting methodology. Nonetheless, I believe we have a long way to go in dealing with the bycatch problem in many of our fisheries. In addition to establishing a national observer program, my bill would establish a task force to recommend measures to monitor, manage, and reduce bycatch and unobserved fishing mortality. The Secretary would then be charged with implementing these recommendations. In addition, I have provided for the development of bycatch reduction incentive programs that could include a system of fines, non-transferable bycatch quotas, or preferences for gear types with low-bycatch rates. 
   It is also time for us to move forward on ecosystem-based fishery management. We do not yet have the data to actually manage most of our fisheries on an ecosystem basis, but I still believe we must begin the preparation and consideration of fishery ecosystem plans. We must strive to understand the complex ecological and socioeconomic environments in which fish and fisheries exist, if we hope to anticipate the effects that fishery management will have on the ecosystem, and the effects that ecosystem change will have on fisheries. My legislation would require each Council to develop one fishery ecosystem plan for a marine ecosystem under its jurisdiction. Each ecosystem plan would have to include a listing of data and information needs identified during development of the plan, and the means of addressing any scientific uncertainties associated with the plan. 
   One of the most resounding comments we heard at all of our regional hearings was the need to continually improve scientific information, and to involve the fishing industry in the collection of this information. My bill would establish a national cooperative research program, patterned after the successful cooperative research program in the New England scallop fishery, for projects that are developed through partnerships among federal and state managers, fishing industry participants, and academic institutions. Priority would be given to projects to reduce bycatch, conservation engineering projects, projects to identify and protect essential fish habitat or habitat area of particular concern, projects to collect fishery ecosystem information and improve predictive capabilities, and projects to compile social and economic data on fisheries. 
   Over the years, I have heard much complaint that NMFS does not communicate effectively with the fishing industry or the general public. To remedy this, my bill calls for the establishment of a fisheries outreach program within NMFS to heighten public understanding of NMFS research and technology, train Council members on implementation of National Standards 1 and 8 requirements of NEPA and the Regulatory Flexibility Act, and identify means of improving quality and reporting of fishery-dependent data. New provisions would also require improvement of the transparency of the stock assessment process and methods, and increase access and compatibility of data relied upon in fishery management decisions. I have required the Secretary to periodically review fishery data collection and assessment methods, and to establish a Center for Independent Peer Review under which independent experts would be provided for special peer review functions. 
   Mr. President, I have also included provisions to address one of our biggest problems in fisheries today--too many fishermen chasing too few fish. It is true that many of our fisheries are overcapitalized. A buyout in New England several years ago attempted to deal with this problem, and according to Penny Dalton, Assistant Administrator for Fisheries, in a recent USA Today article, the buyout ``jump started recovery in the New England groundfish fishery.'' A section of my bill would require the Secretary to evaluate overcapacity in each fishery, and identify measures planned or taken to reduce any such overcapacity. My legislation would amend the existing Act to ensure that capacity reduction programs also consider and address latent fishing capacity, and would allow the use of Capital Construction Funds and funds from the Fisheries Finance Program for measures to benefit the conservation and management of fisheries such as capacity reduction, as well as for gear and safety improvements. 
   In 1996, we enacted a new concept in defining, and requiring protection and 
   identification of, essential fish habitat (EFH). While there has been much outcry that essential fish habitat has been identified too broadly and that EFH consultation processes have resulted in regulatory delay, GAO reports very few real problems resulting from such designations. As a result, I do not feel it is necessary to significantly modify EFH provisions. Instead, I believe we can improve the current work of NMFS and the Councils to identify EFH, and areas within them called ``habitat areas of particular concern'' (HAPCs). I have added new provisions that would require Councils to protect and identify  HAPCs as part of existing requirements to identify and protect EFH. My bill would clarify that HAPCs are to be identified pursuant to the NMFS EFH guidelines, and that these areas should receive priority identification and protection, as they are oftentimes the areas most critical to fish spawning and recruitment. It is crucial that we improve our understanding of fisheries habitat, and my bill would establish pilot cooperative research projects on fishery and non-fishery impacts to HAPCs. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I would like to address the issue of individual fishing quotas, which have been the subject of much debate over the past few years. There is a moratorium on these programs in place until September 30, 2000, and we have been skirting consideration of this new management tool for too long. We must begin debate and consideration of the panoply of exclusive quota-based programs that have developed over the past several years, which must include adoption of legislative guidance for these programs. For this reason, the bill suggests a set of national criteria that would permit establishment of exclusive quota based programs--including community-based quotas, fishing cooperatives, and individual fishing quotas--but still protect the concerns of those who do not wish to employ these tools. I invite all those who are concerned about these issues to engage in a discussion with my colleagues and me on the appropriate way to address this national issue as we move forward this session. 
   I understand the many concerns of small fishermen in New England regarding the use of these tools. First, no region would have to implement an exclusive quota-based program without approval of a 3/5 majority of eligible permit holders through a referendum process. In addition, any exclusive quota-based program developed under my legislation would have to meet a set of national criteria. These national criteria would include provisions specifically aimed at protecting small fishermen such as the following: (1) ensuring that quota-based programs provide a fair and equitable initial allocation of quota (including the establishment of an appeals process for qualification and allocation decisions), (2) preserving the historical distribution of catch among vessel categories and gear sectors, (3) considering allocation of a portion of the annual harvest specifically to small fishermen and crew members; and (4) requiring programs to consider the effects of consolidation of quota shares and establish limits necessary to prevent inequitable concentration of quota share or significant impacts on other fisheries or fishing communities. To respond to the concern that we must ensure quota-based programs meet conservation objectives, my legislation would provide a 7-year review of the performance of quota holders, including fulfillment of conservation requirements of the Act. Finally any quota-based program would have to have a plan to rationalize the fishery--which in some cases would require a buyout of excess capacity under section 312(b) of the Act. 
   Mr. President, I believe this legislation provides the funding, tools, and programs to ensure the important changes made in the 1996 amendments are implemented effectively and improved where necessary. During the last reauthorization, our nation's fisheries were at a crossroads, and action was required to remedy our marine resource management problems, to preserve the way of life of our coastal communities, and to promote the sustainable use and conservation of our marine resources for future generations and for the economic good of the nation. We made changes in 1996 that were good for the environment, good for the fish, and good for the fishermen. We must stay the course, and this bill will help us do just that. In addition, the bill will provide us with innovative tools, such as exclusive quota-based programs and the new national observer program, to further advance fisheries management. Mr. President, I remain committed to the goal of establishing biologically and economically sustainable fisheries so that fishing will continue to be an important part of the culture of coastal communities as well as the economy of the Nation and Massachusetts.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I send to the desk a bill for introduction. The bill is entitled the Judicial Education Reform Act of 2000. Mr. FEINGOLD is cosponsoring the legislation. 
   Mr. President, as the arbiters of justice in our democracy, judges must be honest and fair in their duties. As importantly, if the rule of law is to have force in our society, citizens must have faith that judges approach their duties honestly and fairly, and that their decisions are based solely on the law and the facts of each case. Even if every judge were uncorrupt and incorruptible, their honesty would mean nothing if the public loses confidence in them. Court rulings are effectively only if the public believes that they have been arrived at through impartial decision-making. The judiciary must avoid the appearance of conflict as fastidiously as it avoids conflict. 
   Recent press coverage and an investigation by the public interest law firm Community Rights Counsel have revealed that more than 230 federal judges have taken more than 500 trips to resort locations for legal seminars paid for by corporations, foundations, and individuals between 1192 and 1998. Many of these sponsors have one-sided legal agendas in the courts designed to advance their own interests at the expense of the public interest. In many cases, judges accepted seminar trips while relevant cases were pending before their court. In some cases, judges ruled in favor of a litigant bankrolled by a seminar sponsor. And in one case a judge ruled one way, attended a seminar and returned to switch his vote to agree with the legal views expressed by the sponsor of the trip. 
   The notion that federal judges are accepting all-expense-paid trips that combine highly political legal theory with stays at resort locations from persons with interests before their courts creates an appearance of conflict that is unacceptable and unnecessary. At a minimum, it creates a perception of improper influence that erodes the trust the American people must have in our judicial system. 
   Fortunately, the problems posed by improper judicial junkets can be remedied and the appearance of judicial impartiality restored. The Judicial Education Reform Act will seek to amend the Ethics Reform Act of 1989 to close the loophole that allows for privately-funded seminars by requiring federal judges to live by the same rules that now govern federal prosecutors. The proposal is modeled after the successful Federal Judicial Center. It will ensure that legal educational seminars for judges serve to educate, not improperly influence. It will ensure that these seminars improve our judiciary through better-trained and better-informed judges, not undermine it by eroding public confidence in judicial neutrality. 
   Specifically, the legislation bans privately-funded seminars by prohibiting judges from accepting private seminars as gifts, providing appropriate exceptions, such as where a judge is a speaker, presenter or panel participant in such a seminar. The proposal establishes a Judicial Education Fund of $2 million within the U.S. Treasury for the payment of expenses incurred by judges attending seminars approved by the Board of the Federal Judicial Center. It requires the Judicial Conference to promulgate guidelines to ensure that the Board approves only those 
    seminars that are conducted in a manner that will maintain the public's confidence the judiciary. Finally, the proposal requires that the Board approve a seminar only after information on its content, presenters, funding and litigation activities of sponsors and presenters are provided. If approved, information on the seminar must be posted on the Internet. 
   Mr. President, in introducing this legislation, I am not charging the federal judiciary or any single judge with improper behavior. I do not question the integrity of judges, rather I question a system that creates the clear appearance of conflict. I understand the need for education. Our economy has mainstreamed once exotic technologies in communication, medicine and other fields, and it is important that judges have access to experts to keep current on technological advances. And I recognize the need for judges to be exposed to diverse legal views and to test current legal views. The Judicial Education Reform Act legislation provides  $2 million for precisely that purpose. No judge will be without access to continuing education. But, that education will not be funded by private entities with broad legal agendas before the federal courts, or, as has happened in some of the most unfortunate cases, private entities with cases pending before participating judges. 
   Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to place in the record a statement from the Honorable Abner J. Mikva on this subject. Mr. Mikva is a former Chief Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit and a current Visiting Professor of Law at the University of Chicago. His statement captures this the essence this issue and need for reform.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer the National Affordable Housing Trust Fund Act which would establish a Trust Fund to fill the growing gap in our ability to provide affordable housing in this country. 
   We are living through a time of great economic expansion. Many Americans are benefitting from the growing economy. On the flip side however, is that the economy is fueling rising housing costs. While these costs skyrocket at record pace, there are many families in this country who are unable to keep up. 
   HUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have ``worst case'' housing needs. These families are paying over half their income towards housing costs or living in severely substandard housing. Since 1990, the number of families who have ``worst case'' housing needs has increased by 12 percent--that's 600,000 more American families who cannot afford a decent and safe place to live. 
   For these families living paycheck to paycheck, one unforseen circumstance, a sick child, a needed car repair, or a large utility bill can send them into homelessness. Just this week, on the front page of the Washington Post, an article detailed these problems right here in our own backyard. The article details the plight of low-income families living in apartments which are no longer affordable because the owners have decided to no longer accept federal assistance. For these families, the loss of their affordable housing unit means they may go without a home. 
   We mistakenly view the housing crisis in this country as confined to specific demographics. This is untrue. There is not one metropolitan area in the country where a minimum wage earner can afford to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. A person needs to earn over $11 an hour to afford the median rent for a two bedroom apartment in this country. This figure rises dramatically in many metropolitan areas--an hourly wage of $22 is needed in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in Boston; $16 in the D.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and, $13 in Atlanta. 
   Working families in this country are increasingly finding themselves unable to afford housing. Using the numbers I just cited, a person in Boston would have to make over $35,000 just to afford a 2 bedroom apartment. This means teachers, janitors, social workers, police officers--these full time workers can have trouble affording even a modest 2-bedroom apartment. 
   A story from my home state of Massachusetts highlights the problems faced by working families. On Cape  Cod, Susan O'Donnell a mother of three, earns $21,000 a year working full-time. Nonetheless, she is forced to live in a campground because she cannot find affordable housing. The campground she is living at has time limits, so the only way she is able to stay for a prolonged period of time is through cleaning the campground's toilets. When her time runs out at the campground, she will again be forced to move with her three children, though it is not clear where she will be able to afford to move. Skyrocketing housing costs have pushed her, and other full time workers on the Cape out of their housing and into homelessness. 
   And, as I mentioned earlier, the problem is not only that we have failed to create additional affordable units. We have actually witnessed a tremendous loss in affordable housing. Between 1993 and 1995, a loss of 900,000 rental units affordable to very low-income families occurred. From 1996 to 1998, there was a 19% reduction in the number of affordable housing units. This amounted to a dramatic reduction of 1.3 million affordable housing units available to low-income Americans. 
   The Washington Post article I mentioned previously, helps to show the real impact of these losses. Because of the ability of higher wage earners to pay higher housing costs, building owners are now choosing not to rent to households assisted with Section 8 
   vouchers. 
   Right over the D.C. line, in Prince Georges County, Maryland, 300 tenants in a apartment complex were recently told that they would have to move because the owner will no longer accept Section 8. This means 300 families will lose their housing. And, it is not clear that there will be anywhere for them to go. The same article introduces us to a woman who experienced the same traumatizing eviction in Alexandria, Virginia. Ms. Evans is now living in a cockroach infested building with her children, because there are no decent units affordable to her. This, in part, stems from the fact that of 31 properties in Alexandria which accepted voucher holders in the past, 12 will not longer accept tenants with federal assistance. 
   The loss of this affordable housing has exacerbated the housing crisis in this country, and the federal government must take action. 
   However, the government has clearly not been doing enough. In fact, despite the fact that more families are unable to afford housing, we have decreased federal spending on critical housing programs over time. From fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1999, we engaged in what I call the ``Great HUDway Robbery,'' diverting or rescinding over 20 billion dollars from federal housing programs for other uses. With a few exceptions, the funding increases of this past year have gone primarily to cover the rising costs of serving existing assisted families. 
   We need to bring our levels of housing spending back up to where they belong. Between 1978 and 1995, the number of households receiving housing assistance was increased by almost 3 million. From 1978 through 1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing assistance each year. This number dropped significantly to 126,000 additional households each year from 1985 through 1995. 
   And, in 1996, this nation's housing policy went all the way back to square one--not only was there no increase in families receiving housing assistance, but the number of assisted units actually decreased. From 1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households dropped by 51,000. In this time of rising rents and housing costs, and the loss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we are not doing more to bring the levels of housing assistance back from the dead. 
   It is high time that we focused on housing policies in Congress and around the country because housing is an anchor for families. 
   It is no secret that housing, neighborhood and living environment play enormous roles in shaping young lives. Maintaining a stable home, made possible through housing assistance, has positive outcomes for low-income children. A child will be unable to learn if she is forced to change schools every few months because her family is forced to move from relative to relative to friend to friend because her parents can't afford the rent. 
   What I am doing today, is standing up before the Nation and saying, ``no more.'' We have the resources we need to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to live in decent and safe housing, yet we are not devoting these resources to fix the problem. 
   Today, I am proposing to address the severe shortage of affordable housing by establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund which uses excess income generated by 2 federal housing programs--the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) and the Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). These federal housing programs generate billions of dollars in excess income which currently go to the general Treasury for use on other federal priorities. It is time to stop taking housing money out of housing programs. These excess funds should be used to help alleviate the current housing crisis. 
   My proposal would create an affordable housing production, ensuring that new rental units are built for those who most need assistance--extremely low-income families, including working families. In addition, Trust Fund assistance will be used to promote homeownership for low-income families, those families whose incomes are below 80% of the area median income. 
   The Trust Fund aims to create long-term affordable, mixed-income developments in areas with the greatest opportunities for low-income families. 
   A majority of assistance from the Trust Fund will be given out as matching grants to the States which will distribute funds on a competitive basis like the low-income housing tax credit. Localities, non-profits, developers and other entities will be eligible to apply for funds. The remaining assistance will be distributed through a national competition to intermediaries, such as non-profits which will be required to leverage private funds for investment in affordable housing. 
   This proposal will bring federal, State and private resources together to create needed affordable housing opportunities for American families. 
   We can no longer ignore the lack of affordable housing, and the impact it is having on families and children around the country. It is not clear to me why this lack of housing has not caused more uproar. How many families need to be pushed out of their homes and into the streets, before action is taken. Earlier in this Congress, I proposed a program which would assist in maintaining the affordable housing stock that already exists. I hope that this preservation program is taken up this Congress and passed so that we can avoid losing anymore affordable units. However, we must also focus on producing additional housing, which is exactly what this Housing Trust Fund will do. 
   Mr. President, I asked of the housing policy experts and practitioners in Massachusetts to work with me to come up with a viable program which would put the government back in the business of producing affordable housing. This legislation is a result of collaboration among numerous organizations and experts. I want to thank in particular, Aaron Gornstein of the citizens Housing and Planning Association in Massachusetts for helping to bring all of the relevant actors to the table to formulate this proposal. I appreciate the help of many people and organizations, but want to mention some people in Massachusetts who were critical in shaping the ideas behind this legislation: Vince O'Donnell of the Community Economic Development Assistance Corp; Peter Gagliardi with the Hampden Hampshire Housing Partnership; Conrad Egan of the National Housing Conference; Joe Flately with the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation; Howard Cohen with Beacon Residential; and, Patrick Dober of Lendlease. 
   I urge you to support this legislation which restores our commitment to providing affordable housing for all families. We can no longer turn our backs on those families who struggle each month just to put a roof over their heads. 
   I ask unanimous consent to have the text of the legislation, along with a section-by-section summary, and letters of support from a number of organizations including the National Association of Homebuilders, the National Council of State Housing Agencies, the National Low-Income Housing Coalition, the National Coalition for the  Homeless, the National Housing Conference, and others put in the RECORD.

   Mr. KERRY. I am pleased to join the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. HELMS, and the Chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, Dr. FRIST, in bringing this very important bill to the Senate. 
   Mr. President, the human toll of the AIDS crisis in Africa is stupefying. More than 30 million people now live with AIDS and annual AIDS-related fatalities hit a record 2.6 million last year. Ninety-five percent of all cases are found in the developing world. AIDS is now the leading cause of death in Africa and the fourth leading cause of death in the world. In at least 5 Africans countries, more than 20 percent of adults are HIV-positive. 
   The AIDS epidemic is more devastating than wars: in 1998 in Africa, 200,000 people died from armed conflict; 2.2 million died from AIDS--more than 5,000 Africans died every day from the disease. 
   This week, the U.S. Census Bureau announced new demographic findings for Africa. Because of AIDS, Botswana, Zimbabwe and South Africa will experience negative population growth in the next five years. Without AIDS, these countries would have experienced a 2-3 percent increase in population. Children born within the past 5 years in Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe can expect to die before the age of 35. Without AIDS, their life expectancy would have been 70. In addition, a new and very troubling statistic was announced this week: UNAIDS reported that 55 percent of all HIV-infections were in women. So AIDS is not only robbing societies of young women but also of the child they might have had. 
   It is not hyperbole to say that this is Africa's worst social catastrophe since slavery, and the world's worst health crisis since the bubonic plague. 
   Other parts of the world are going down the same path as Africa. Infection rates in Asia are climbing rapidly, with several countries, especially India, on the brink of large-scale expansion of the epidemic. When I was in India in December, epidemiologist from our government as well as Indian officials admitted that the number of cases in Asia could surpass those of Africa by the year 2010. 
   In addition, countries of the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are especially vulnerable, as Russia is experiencing one of the highest increases in infection rates of any single country in the world last year. Is this the kind of world we want for the 21st century? In this age of remarkable biotechnical and biomedical breakthroughs, when we have cures of impotence and treatments for depression, do we want to ignore a public health crisis of biblical proportions? When we're talking about the democratization of the developing world, when we're talking about the triumph of capitalism and open markets, when we're talking about the benefits of globalization, we cannot remain silent--as rich as we are in talent, technology and money--about the threat AIDS poses to our national security. 
   Mr. President, last week, the 13th annual International Conference on AIDS was taking place in Durban, South Africa. It was the first time this international conference is being held in a country in the epicenter of the AIDS pandemic in the developing world. 
   A number of important breakthroughs have been announced from the Conference and the Senate should be aware of them: 
   Pharmaceutical companies have announced that they are prepared to offer their life-extending therapies to the developing world at no cost or at a very discounted rate. Merck will provide Botswana with $100 million in medicine over the next five years. Abbott Laboratories confirmed that it will initiate a charitable program in Tanzania, Burkina Faso, Romania and India. Boehringer Ingelheim will give away one of the most important drugs in preventing the transmission of HIV from mother to child--Viramune--to developing countries over the next 5 years. Similarly, Pfizer recently promised to give South Africa its effective product--Diflucan--which is used for treating a deadly brain infection associated with AIDS. 
   These are all important developments. Access to these pharmaceutical products has historically been prevented by high price, and these companies should continue to work with governments and philanthropies like the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation--which today is announcing another $90 million in grants to combat AIDS in the developing world. The contribution made by Bill and Melinda Gates to fighting infectious diseases cannot be overstated. Through their philanthropy, they have given countries which are being ravaged by disease a fighting chance. 
   Fighting and winning the war against AIDS is more than just giving away medicine. We must continue to bolster the research into a cure. To this end, a number of significant biomedical breakthroughs have come out of Durban. The most significant is the announcement by the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative of human trials of a new vaccine candidate against AIDS. Development of an effective AIDS vaccine is critical especially in Africa where preventive measures--such as encouraging change in high-risk behaviors and debunking deadly myths--will do little to slow the spread of HIV in countries which have a 20 or 25 percent infection rate. It is clear that the only hope for these countries is a cure: that means, developing an effective vaccine and assuring its affordable distribution. 
   And, we have a responsibility to act in this increasingly intertwined world because, together with all the benefits associated with globalization, we also now are facing a range of new threats that know no borders and move without prejudice--international crime, cyber-terrorism, drug-trafficking and infectious diseases. 
   We are seeing a rise in the number of previously unknown lethal and potent disease agents identified since 1973--the ebola virus, hepatitis C, drug-resistant tuberculosis, West Nile virus and HIV. These diseases affect all of us, including American citizens. New Yorkers know the scare associated with these heretofore unknown diseases--last summer New York City was held captive by an encephalitis scare and new outbreaks this year have already 
   been spotted in pigeons. There was a shock in the scientific community when it was discovered that outbreak of the mosquito-borne disease in New York was not, as scientists had believed, St Louis encephalitis: instead, it was a deadly variant of West Nile virus, a disease hitherto found only in Africa, the Middle East and parts of West Asia. United States health officials now fear that the disease may now become prevalent in the Americans. Similarly, it is foolhardly and dangerous to believe that any infectious disease can be adequately contained in one region. We are all at-risk. 
   Militaries are not immune; in fact, they are in some cases even more susceptible to upheaval and instability  from infectious diseases, especially AIDS. Some militaries in Africa have HIV-infection rates which top 40 percent. These military forces could be part of the solution for democratization in Africa in terms of peacekeeping and conflict prevention; instead, African armed services are losing their military effectiveness and adding to the social instability. 
   It is projected that Africa will be home to 40 million children, orphaned by AIDS, by the year 2010. Zambia is a country of 11 million people--half a million of them will be AIDS orphans. We know from other regions of the world--like Cambodia and Burma--that exploited children are common targets by rogue militias and narco- and other criminal organizations. It is clearly in our interest to stem this activity. 
   Likewise, economies are not immune. In fact, development of the last 20 years is being reversed in the countries hardest-hit by AIDS. AIDS cost Namibia almost 8 percent of its GDP in 1996. Tanzania will experience a 15 to 25 percent drop in its GDP because of AIDS over the next decade. Over the next few years, Kenya's GDP will be 14.5 percent less than it would have been absent AIDS. AIDS consumes more than 50 percent of already meager health budgets. In many African countries, the total annual per capita health-care budget is $10. 80 percent of the urban hospital beds in Malawi are filled with AIDS patients--all is a direct threat on evolving democratic development and free-market transition. Mozambique and Botswana have two of the world's fastest growing economies but this economic growth cannot be maintained when those countries' workforces are being decimated with the daily deaths of hundreds of people in their most productive years. In the Cote d'Ivoire, a teacher dies of complications associated with AIDS every school day. In South Africa, businesses owners often hire and train two employees for one job, knowing that one will probably die from AIDS. 
   As we celebrated the passage this year of the Africa Trade bill, how can we seriously think that a vibrant market for products or investment can be formed on a continent which will lose up to 20 percent of its population in the next decade? To lure investors, the continent has already had to battle underdevelopment and racism, but now, some people in the developed world will see Africa as only as a place of disease. This is wrong and it is a direct threat to our national economic interests. 
   Governments are not immune. This epidemic is causing leadership crises in some African countries. President Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania reported last week that ``some ministries lose about 20 employees each month to AIDS.'' 
   African governments are grappling with the devastation wrought by HIV on their economies and their societies. It is difficult to fathom the challenges they face with this public health crisis, and some of the actions sometimes baffle western observers. Some critics have recently pointed to the questions raised by President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa as to the origins of AIDS and as to the proper course of treatment. When it comes to dealing with AIDS, there are moral questions, there are budgetary constraints, there are political decisions. But there are also some biomedical truths. Senator FRIST and I have discussed these issues with the distinguished ambassador from South Africa and followed up with President Mbeki when he came to Washington on a state visit. Leadership is necessary from both the United States and from Africa--this issue cannot be solved by one nation alone. But no one country can ignore it either. President Mbeki has focused his attention on fighting the AIDS epidemic by fighting poverty. In his remarks in Durban, he missed an opportunity by refusing to state unequivocally that HIV causes AIDS. And, I fear, his questions will allow those who engaged in risky and unsafe practices to continue. Only bashing pharmaceutical companies is not helpful in the fight against AIDS, and the participants at the International Conference on AIDS rightly passed a resolution in support of the tested science of AIDS. 
   One can argue--and I do not at all subscribe to that argument--that Africa does not matter to the security interests of the United States. Some even mock the suggestion. I believe that this is not an issue of which any decent rational human being can be dismissive. One humanitarian terms, on political terms, on cultural terms, on economic terms, on historical terms, no one should dare be dismissive. We are linked to everything that is happening in Africa, starting back to our nation's and civilization's earliest history, and we are now tied by the new forces of globalization and technology. And I hope that we will always be tied by who we are and what we are as nation. This really tests the fiber of our country, in a sense, and questions whether we are prepared to deal with this threat. 
   But even if you subscribe to the view that the AIDS disaster in Africa is not a threat to our national security, you have to at least recognize that unfettered spread of this horrendous virus to other regions of the world--including North America--is certainly a threat. As goes Africa, so goes India and China--and no one in this Senate can make the argument that an India or a China, destabilized by a public health catastrophe, can be ignored in terms of our national security interests. 
   The window of opportunity is now open to making a real difference in Africa and improving global health, and that is why I am so pleased that the Senate is acting with all dispatch to make a significant contribution to fighting the epidemic in Africa. This bill builds upon the work of many of our most thoughtful and distinguished colleagues. It includes initiatives that Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI, Senator FRIST and I began many months ago to speed vaccine development, to deal with AIDS orphans and to alleviate the suffering of those infected with HIV on the African continent. It also incorporates the plan Senator FRIST, Congressman LEACH and I have devised to inaugurate AIDS prevention grants from the World Bank. Senator DURBIN and I proposed a plan to assist AIDS orphans, and the spirit of that legislation is found throughout this bill. Senator BOXER and Senator GORDON SMITH have called for funding increases to AIDS prevention programs in Africa; Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator FEINGOLD have a proposal to target money to prevent further infection among infants. Their contributions can be seen in this bill. 
   The work of the appropriators has been and will continue to be vital in funding programs to assist Africa. I commend Senator LEAHY and Senator MCCONNELL for increasing funding for the existing appropriations accounts on global health in the Foreign Operations bill and I am very grateful that they have agreed to fund the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations (GAVI) which I have been urging for a year now. 
   I would also like to acknowledge the significant contribution of the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, Mr. HELMS. I commend the Chairman and our ranking member, Senator BIDEN, for their leadership. They have ensured that this session will not close until we have passed the largest single response by our Nation to the global AIDS epidemic. 
   It is my hope that the other body will move to pass these vital proposals with all necessary speed. It is clearly in our national interests--security, economic, political, health and moral--to do all we can to solve this crisis. Let me be clear on this, Mr. President, my commitment to this issue is not transitory. I will not rest on this legislative victory. I will be back next year and every year after that until this public health disaster is over.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senators MCCAIN, BOXER and ABRAHAM in announcing that today we will be introducing a bill that takes a positive, balanced approach to the issue of Internet privacy. There can be no doubt that consumers have a legitimate expectation of privacy on the Internet. Our bill protects that interest. At the same time, consumers want an Internet that is free. For that to happen, the Internet, like television, must be supported by advertising. Our bill will allow companies to continue to advertise, ensuring that we  don't have a subscription-based Internet, which would limit everyone's online activities and contribute to a digital divide. 
   If we recognize that the economy of the Internet calls for advertising, we must also recognize that it won't attract consumers if they believe their privacy is being violated. Finding this fine balance of permitting enough free flow of information to allow ads to work and protecting consumers' privacy is going to be critical if the Internet is going to reach its full potential. And I believe this bill strikes the right balance. 
   I think all of the bill's cosponsors were hopeful that self-regulation of Internet privacy would work. And I think self-regulation still has an important role to play. But it seems that now it is up to Congress to establish a floor for Internet privacy. I have no doubt that many innovative high tech companies and advertisers will go beyond the regulations for notice and choice we provide here. A number of companies in my home state of Massachusetts already do, providing consumers with anonymity when they go online. I applaud and encourage those efforts and am certain that if Congress enacts this bill, they will continue. 
   But technology and innovation won't address all the concerns people have about Internet privacy. Congress has the responsibility to ensure that core privacy principles are the norm throughout the online world. We need to respond to the consumers who don't shop on the Internet because they are concerned about their privacy. This is necessary not only for the sake of the consumers, but for every online business that wants to grow and attract customers. 
   The bill that we are introducing today will encourage those skeptical consumers to go online. This legislation will require Web sites to clearly and conspicuously disclose their privacy policies. People deserve to know what information may be collected and how it may be used so that they can make an informed decision before they navigate around or shop on a particular Web site. They shouldn't have to click five times and need to translate legalese before they know what a site will do with their personal information. Requiring disclosure has the added benefit of providing the FTC with an enforcement mechanism. If a Web site fails to comply with its posted disclosure policy, the FTC can bring an action against it for unfair or deceptive acts. This is the bare minimum of what I believe consumers deserve and expect, and I don't think this would have any unintended or negative consequences on e-commerce. 
   In addition, this bill addresses the core principle of choice by requiring Web sites to offer consumers an easy to use method to prevent Web sites from using personally identifiable information for marketing purposes and to prevent them from selling that information to third parties. This bill empowers consumers and lets them make informed decisions that are right for them. 
   By ensuring consumers have the right to full disclosure and the right to not have their personally identifiable information sold or disclosed, this bill addresses the most fundamental concerns many people have about online privacy. But I believe there are still a number of important questions that we need to answer. The first is whether there is a difference between privacy in the offline and online worlds. 
   Most of us hardly think about it when we go to the supermarket, but when Safeway or Giant scans my discount card or my credit card, it has a record of exactly who I am and what I bought. Should my preferences at the supermarket be any more or less protected than the choices I make online? 
   Likewise, catalog companies compile and use offline information to make marketing decisions. These companies rent lists compiled by list brokers. The list brokers obtain marketing data and names from the public domain and governments, credit bureaus, financial institutions, credit card companies, retail establishments, and other catalogers and mass mailers. 
   On the other hand, when I go to the shopping mall and look at five different sweaters but don't buy any of them, no one has a record of that. If I do the same thing online, technology can record how long I linger over an item, even if I don't buy it. Likewise, I can pick up any book in a book store and pay in cash and no one will ever know my reading preferences. That type of anonymity can be completely lost online. 
   This bill requires the National Research Council to study the issue of online versus offline privacy, and make a recommendation if there is a need for additional legislation in either area. 
   Likewise, this bill requires the Council to study the issue of access. While there is general agreement that consumers should have access to information they provided to a Web site, we still don't know whether it's necessary or proper for consumers to have access to all of the information gathered about an individual. Should consumers have access to click-stream data or so-called derived data by which a company uses compiled information to make a marketing decision about the consumer? And if we decide consumers need some access to this type of information, is it technology feasible? Will there be unforeseen or unintended consequences such as an increased risk of security breaches? Will there be less, rather than more privacy due to the necessary coupling of names and data? I don't we are ready to regulate until we have some consensus on this issue. 
   Finally, it is important to add that this bill in no way limits what Congress has done or hopefully will do with respect to a person's health or financial information. When sensitive information is collected, it is even more important that stringent privacy protections are in place. I have supported a number of legislative efforts that would go far to protect this type of information.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Senator ROBB and 16 other colleagues to introduce comprehensive legislation aimed at spurring economic development and person empowerment in our inner cities and isolated rural areas. Our economy is booming, and has been for most of the 90s, yet there are still individuals and families who are struggling. 
   What we've tried to do is develop economic incentives that will encourage business development and remove barriers that make it hard for entrepreneurs, community organizations and individuals to build healthy communities. 
   Among the many important initiatives in this bill is my new markets legislation that I introduced last September, S. 1594, the Community Development and Venture Capital Act, which passed the Senate Committee on Small Business today, and as part of the Clinton/Hastert package in the House yesterday. It also includes full funding for Round II of Empowerment Zones. 
   The Community Development and Venture Capital Act has three parts: a  venture capital program to funnel investment money into distressed communities; Senator WELLSTONE's program to expand the number of venture capital firms and professionals who are devoted to investing in such communities; and a mentoring program to link established, successful businesses with small businesses owners in stagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve. 
   The venture capital program is modeled after the Small Business Administration's successful Small Business Investment Company program. As SBA Administrator Alvarez pointed out just last week in a Small Business Committee hearing, the SBIC program has been so successful that it has generated more than $19 billion in investments in more than 13,000 businesses since 1992. And, in the past five years, the SBIC participating securities program has returned $224 million in profits, virtually paying for itself for the past nine years. 
   As successful as that program is, it does not sufficiently reach areas of our country that need economic development the most. One, out of the total $4.2 billion that SBICs invested last year, only 1.6 percent were deals of less than $1 million dollars in LMI areas. Two, only $1.1 million of that $4.2 billion went to LMI investments in rural areas. Three, in 1999, 85 percent of SBIC deals were $10 million and more. 
   In broader terms, the economy is booming. Since 1993, almost 21 million jobs have been created. Since 1992, unemployment has shrunk from 7.5 percent to 4 percent. In the past two years, we've paid down the debt $140 billion, and CBO currently projects a surplus of $176 billion. Some estimates even say more than $2 trillion. In spite of these impressive numbers, one out of five children grows up in poverty and there are pockets of America where unemployment is as high as 14 percent. 
   We can make a difference by investing in a new industry of community development venture capital funds that target investment capital and business expertise into low- and moderate-income areas to develop and expand local businesses that create jobs and alleviate economic distress. The existing 25 or 30 community development venture capital funds have set out to demonstrate that the same model of business development that has driven economic expansion in Silicon Valley and Route 128 Massachusetts can also make a powerful difference in areas like the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East Harlem, or the rural desolation of Kentucky's Appalachia or Mississippi's Delta region. 
   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan says ``Credit alone is not the answer. Businesses must have equity capital before they are considered viable candidates for debt financing.'' He emphasizes that this is particularly important in lower-income communities. 
   What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand investment in our neediest communities by building on the economic activity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do that is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities. I am very glad that Senator ROBB and my other colleagues agreed to include this powerful economic development plan in this legislation. 
   Switching to another provision in this bill, this legislation builds on the President's and Speaker's agreement by securing full, mandatory funding for Massachusett's Empowerment Zone. As I said earlier, this passed the full House yesterday by a vote of 394 to 27. Full, mandatory funding is important because, so far, the money has dribbled in--only $6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten years--and made it impossible for the city to implement a plan for economic self-sufficiency. Some 80 public and private entities, from universities to technology companies to banks to local government, showed incredible community spirit and committed to matching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it another way--these groups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal Empowerment Zone money with $800 million. Yet, regrettably, in spite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston has not been able to tap into that leveraged money and implement the strategic plan because Congress hasn't held up its part of the bargain. I am extremely pleased that we were able to work together and find a way to provide full, steady funding to these zones. That money means education, daycare, transportation and basic health care in areas--in Massachusetts that includes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattipan--where almost 50 percent of the children are living in poverty and nearly half the residents over 25 don't even have a high school diploma 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their work on this important legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a former member of this body, Senator Edward W. Brooke. Senator Brooke has served the Commonwealth of Massachusetts as both a Massachusetts Attorney General and United States Senator. Recently, I had the privilege of attending the dedication of the New Chardon Street Courthouse in Boston on June 20th, named in honor of Senator Brooke. Given the former Senator's prestigious record of service to both the citizens of Massachusetts and the Nation, it is fitting that this honor be bestowed upon him. 
   During his distinguished career which spanned the course of two decades, Senator Brooke earned the prominent distinction of being the first African-American directly elected to both a State Attorney General position and the United States Senate. While in each office, Senator Brooke spearheaded efforts to achieve civil rights and equality for women, minorities, and the poor. 
   Elected Massachusetts Attorney General in 1962, Senator Brooke earned his reputation as a crime-fighter through his extensive work with the newly created Massachusetts Crime Commission. He actively combated corruption in State government and singlehandedly organized and completed the extensive investigation of the infamous ``Boston Strangler'' homicides. 
   Only 4 years later, he became the first African-American Senator to serve since Reconstruction, and the first and only to be re-elected. During his two terms in Congress, Senator Brooke figured prominently into all aspects of the Senate. He vigorously opposed escalation of the Vietnam war and supported arms control treaties like the MIRV and ABM proposals that would eventually become the catalysts in establishing improved relations and recognizing the People's Republic of China. Senator Brooke was the first Republican Senator to call for President Nixon's resignation after the Watergate scandal. In addition, Senator Brooke was a tireless champion of the poor. He authored the ``Brooke amendment,'' which provided that public housing tenants pay no more than one-fourth of their income for housing.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Mr. DURBIN to amend Section 3102 of the Agriculture Appropriation bill. 
   Section 3102 is the latest edition in a series of riders that have prevented the Clinton Administration from reforming hardrock mining on public lands by putting in place sound environmental and fiscal protections. In past debates, proponents of these riders have argued that the hardrock mining industry has reformed its ways. They acknowledge that mining companies have made mistakes in the past. How could they not? The facts are overwhelming: More than 300,000 acres of federal lands have not been reclaimed. There are more than 2,000 abandoned mines in national parks. There are 59 Superfund sites at former mines across the country. The Mineral Policy Center estimates that the cleanup costs for abandoned mines on public and private lands may reach $72 billion. But after acknowledging this legacy of environmental damage, the proponents of these riders argue it is the result of decisions made 50 or 60 years ago--before we knew better--before we understood that there a limits to what the environment can withstand. They tells us that a new environmental consciousness, sensitivity and awareness have taken root in the industry, and today's mines are safe because they utilize modern technology and practices. 
   This is an important point, Mr. President. It deserves a response. I'm not out to punish the mining industry for mistakes of the past. I recognize that the mining industry has made improvements and that not all mining operations result in environmental disaster. The March 2000 National Geographic has an excellent article on the hardrock mining industry. It discusses the history of the mining in the West, its cultural heritage, its economic contribution, and its unfortunate legacy of environmental ruin. It also talks about some of the new efforts underway to lessen mining's impact on the environment. It describes Homestake Mining Company's McLaughlin gold mine near Lower Lake, California as a safe mine. The McLaughlin operation recycles and contains all processed water, the 600-acre tailings pond will eventually be converted into wetlands, and a monitoring system watches for contamination of ground water. Sierra Club and the Mineral Policy Center--two groups sharply and appropriately critical of mining operations--have praised this operation. Homestake's environmental manager at the site told National Geographic that, ``When you look at the total environmental cost, it's roughly 2 percent of our capital costs for the whole project. We want to protect the our stockholders' investment. Creating an environmental liability doesn't serve their interests or ours.'' 
   I am confident that McLaughlin is not the only operation that is working and caring for the land, but it's just not true to say that the entire industry is reformed. There are bad actors and mistakes happen, and that is why we need tougher standards. 
   I urge my colleagues to look at the record of the Hecla Mining Company's Grouse Creek Mine in the Salmon-Challis National Forest in Idaho. The Grouse Creek Mine opened in 1994 with great expectations. It was precisely the kind of operation we've heard about on the Senate 
   floor: a new mine operated under a new environmental ethic, and presumably an example of why we don't need tougher protections. In August 1995, Mr. Michael White, the Vice President and General Counsel of the Hecla Mining Company, testified before the Senate that, ``The Grouse Creek Mine is a state-of-the-art facility and has been constructed not only to meet, but to exceed, existing environmental requirements.'' Mr. White continued, ``For example, road improvements that included sediment catch basins actually reduced sediment impact to Jordan Creek compared to preexisting conditions.'' Let me be clear: Mr. White promised us a state-of-the-art facility that would exceed existing environmental requirements, and he went even further to promise that the Grouse Creek Mine would actually improve the environment by reducing the sediment runoff into Jordan Creek. Hecla's chairman, Arthur Brown, said in 1995 of Grouse Creek that, ``Minimizing the environmental impact is a strong focus of Hecla.'' A Hecla company spokeswoman said in 1995, ``We believe that we need to take care of the land we are using; it's just good stewardship.'' The former Governor of Idaho, Cecil Andrus added his praise, saying ``Hecla has met every requirement we've asked of them. I can show you a thousand sins of the past that we need to clean up but modern mining is a plus.'' And the accolades continued: The Idaho Department of Lands nominated the mine for an award, and Hecla employees were honored by the US Department of Agriculture for their environmental work. 
   It is now only 6 years latter, and Grouse Creek is an environmental disaster. In 1996--only two years after the mine opened-- the Environmental Protection Agency fined Hecla $85,000 for violating its wastewater permit. EPA found cyanide and mercury discharges that exceeded their limits by more than five times the allowed levels for over a year, and the mine was cited for excessive sediment discharge into Jordan Creek. In April 1999, Idaho officials found cyanide leaking into a stream that is habitat for the endangered chinook salmon, steelhead trout and bull trout. The cyanide levels were more than 12 times the concentrations at which chronic exposure harms fish. The environmental legacy of the now-closed mine is a tailings impoundment holding 450 million gallons of cyanide-laced water and 4.3 million tons of heavy metals. Can you imagine? The General Counsel of Hecla, Michael Smith, actually testified before the Senate in 1995 that the mine would actually improve the environmental quality of Jordan Creek. Within less than five years the operation was cited for loading Jordan Creek with excessive sediments and cyanide. The fiscal legacy is just as bad. A May editorial in the Idaho Falls Post Register reports that Hecla may walk away from the environmental mess it has created if the cost of cleanup exceeds $28 million. Before opening the mine, Hecla was only required to put up a bond of $7 million, and the company reported $120 million in losses before closing the mine. Maybe Hecla will reclaim the land, maybe it won't--it's too early to judge that issue--but clearly a system that allows part of a national forest to be turned into a toxic waste site, and leaves us negotiating cleanup, is in need of reform. And, Mr. President, more importantly, this didn't happen 50 years ago or 60 years ago. It happen 6 years ago. 
   Grouse Creek isn't the only unfortunate example of the ``modern'' mining industry's environmental troubles. The Phelps Dodge Mining Corporation's Chino copper mine near Santa Rita, New Mexico has dumped more than 180 million gallons of contaminated wastewater into Whitewater Creek since 1987. In 1990, rainwater flushed 324,000  gallons of wastewater out of the Ray Complex mine site and into the Gila River in Arizona. Shortly after opening in 1986 the Summitville gold mine in southern Colorado began leaking cyanide, acid and heavy metals into 17 miles of the Alamosa River. Its owner is now bankrupt, the mine closed and the land has been declared a Superfund site. 
   We need reform. Today's debate is not about sins of the past or punishing the mining industry. It is about ending a system that sells public land for as little as $2.50 per acre. A system that has allowed more than $240 billion worth of minerals to be excavated from public lands and does not collect a cent in royalties. A system that, despite all the excuses and promises, continues to allow the land to be damaged. We should not have to depend on the goodwill of the mining industry to protect public land--the rules should be clear, they should be strong and they should be enforced. American citizens should not carry the burden of fiscal and environmental irresponsibility. 
   I thank Senator DURBIN for moving to amend the hardrock mining rider. I urge other my colleagues to support the amendment.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, due to important family obligations, I was necessarily absent this evening during votes on the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriation bill for fiscal year 2001. 
   Mr. President, were I present, I would have voted for Senator WELLSTONE's amendment, number 3919. 
   Further, were I present, I would have voted for Senator SPECTER's amendment, number 3958. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. It corrects an inadvertent error in the 1997 Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 that prevents Amtrak from leasing automobiles from the General Services Administration. The amendment will enable Amtrak to continue leasing such vehicles until 2003. 
   Further, were I present, I would have voted to find Senator DURBIN's amendment, number 3980, germane. I am a cosponsor of the amendment. The Agriculture Appropriation bill includes a rider that would block efforts to reform the hardrock mining industry, which has caused and continues to cause substantial environmental damage to public lands. Senator DURBIN's amendment would have allowed needed reforms to proceed. I have submitted an additional statement on this issue into the RECORD. 
   Finally, were I present, I would have voted for final passage of the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies Appropriation bill for fiscal year 2001.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join me in voting for H.R. 2392, the Small Business Innovation Research Program Reauthorization Act of 2000. The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a great example of how government and business can work together to advance the cause of science, the diverse missions of the government, and a healthy economy. The results have been dramatic for small, high-technology companies participating in the program. Since 1983 when the program was started, some 16,000 small, high-technology firms have received more than 46,000 SBIR research awards through 1997, totaling $7.5 billion. 
   Technological advancement is a key element of economic growth. According to a Congressional Research Service Report, Small, High Tech Companies and Their Role in the Economy: Issues in the Reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Program, ``technical progress is responsible for up to one-half the growth of the U.S. economy and is one of the principal driving forces for increases in our standard of living.'' 
   Mr. President, this bill, and the accompanying managers' amendment, are the products of months and months of work between Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate, SBIR companies and SBIR advocates, the ten Federal agencies that participate in the SBIR program, and the Small Business Administration's Office of Technology and the Office of Advocacy. 
   I want to thank Senator BOND and Senator LEVIN, and the members of the House Committees on Small Business  and Science, and their staffs, for their hard work on this bill. Many of us had very different concerns regarding reauthorization of the SBIR program, and I greatly appreciate everyone's willingness to find common ground where possible and compromise. 
   We wrestled with tough questions. How long to reauthorize the program? I wanted to make it permanent; it has a long and successful track record. In fact, in 1998, the Senate Committee on Small Business voted to do just that, but that legislation never passed the House. This year the Committee agreed to reauthorize the program for ten years, giving the agencies and innovative small businesses a good measure of security to plan SBIR projects for the longer term. However, the House Science Committee felt strongly that it should only be reauthorized for seven years. In the end, as reflected in this bill, we compromised on eight, reauthorizing the bill through September 30, 2008. 
   How to improve the quality and collection of data without overburdening small businesses? GAO reports have found that the SBIR program works well, but that the records are sometimes incomplete, making it harder to evaluate the program and track awards. I fully support the goal of collecting the best information possible to evaluate the program, but I don't want small businesses owners to spend more time filling out paper work than absolutely necessary for that purpose. They are capable of developing cutting-edge research and meeting national R&D needs and should spend the majority of their efforts on that. As Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee and a Senator from the state whose small, hi-tech companies win the second largest amount of SBIR awards, I heard many, many complaints and concerns about the possibility of excessive and burdensome reporting requirements. I also heard complaints that the same level of reporting is not required of universities and big business that get Federal R&D dollars. There were real fears that Congress would require SBIR award winners to continue reporting to the SBA on SBIR research for years after a contract ended and 
   that tracking commercialization out of context would be used against the program and against individual SBIR firms. Just knowing the ratio of awards to commercialization is not an indicator of success. By its very nature, R&D has a low probability of getting a product to market in relation to the investment in research. It is the ratio of commercialization in the SBIR program compared to that of big business, universities and the private sector that may be one indicator of the program's value to the government and to the nation. For example, one study shows that small businesses have 24 times as many innovations per R&D dollar as large businesses. In the end, we agreed to collect basic, but useful, information about sales and additional investment on Phase II awards. According to the Department of Defense that currently requires similar information, it generally takes less than 15 minutes to provide the information, and companies are only required to give the information during the life of the contract. 
   Probably the biggest question we dealt with was how to increase the participation in the SBIR program in states, and areas of states, that receive few or no awards. Though the number of awards given to a state has been proportionate to the number of proposals submitted, according to a GAO study, one-third of the states receive 85 percent of all SBIR awards. And the states that submit the most proposals generally have the right mix of small high-tech companies, an active venture capital community, and universities that understand the benefits of technology transfer, attract academic research funds and graduate a highly qualified workforce. While Massachusetts does extremely well in this program, for years I have recognized that the SBIR awards have been concentrated in less than half the states. The problem has been how to create a solution that helps small businesses in states that don't have the necessary infrastructure without changing the program's reliance on competition. Merit is the only way to maintain the integrity of the research because the highly competitive nature of SBIR awards (only one in seven or eight Phase I proposals is awarded) is one of the main reasons the program has been so popular and successful. 
   This bill takes two innovative approaches to increasing nationwide participation in the program. First, it establishes a peer volunteer mentoring network, which Senator LEVIN and I originally introduced as S. 1435 in 1999. Modeled after SBA's successful Service Corps of Retired Executives or SCORE program, this mentoring program would reimburse experienced SBIR companies that volunteer to assist one or more newcomers to the program. They can help in a variety of ways, whether it's writing proposals, understanding the Federal procurement process or a particular agency, tapping into venture capital, or commercializing their technologies. The bill also directs the SBA to create a database with the names and profiles of successful SBIR companies interested in mentoring struggling or prospective SBIR companies. This will be used by the states to link companies to mentors based on their needs. 
   Second, it creates the Federal and State Technology Partnership (FAST) program. This program is a competitive matching-grant program to encourage and help states cultivate high-tech small businesses and a build a support infrastructure in the state. I feel strongly, as does Senator LEVIN, and am very pleased, that all states, even the ones that currently win the most SBIR awards, are eligible to compete for a FAST matching grant so that they can help develop small, hi-tech companies in areas of their states that don't have SBIR activity. For example, in Massachusetts, most of our awards are in the Boston area. But with these grants, working with one of the economic development arms of our local government, we could coordinate and foster SBIR activity in the Western part of the state close to Amherst and Northampton. Those companies could create high-quality, high-wage jobs where the cost structure for companies is less expensive but where we have numerous universities and highly-skilled workers. 
   Given the strength of these initiatives, I do have some concerns about mentoring getting lost in the states' FAST initiatives. For the record, I ask that the SBA, the program managers of participating SBIR agencies, and FAST entities promote this cost-effective tool. Take advantage of the substantial pool of good-will and willingness to share experiences of those who have been successful in the SBIR program. Let SBIR companies know that they will be reimbursed for relevant out-of-pocket expenses if they choose to become a volunteer mentor. It gives them another stake in this program, and will strengthen the program on many levels. And, SBA and SBIR agencies should let prospective or struggling SBIR companies know that veteran SBIR companies are out there willing to help them understand the world of SBIR and federal procurement. 
   Mr. President, these research and development awards not only provide dollars to small hi-tech companies that create quality jobs, but they also help agencies meet their R&D needs. As one example, an Army SBIR award played a role in the development of the B-2 Bomber. Specifically, the research led to the development of a ``pilot alert'' system which warns the pilot if the plane is about to produce a trail of condensation that could be detected by enemy radar. Sales to date, to both the Air Force and commercial customers, exceed $27 million. And what about NASA? As the world watched the space shuttle Discovery in 1998, the feature elements of two of the shuttle's payloads were developed with SBIR funds. 
   In Woburn, Massachusetts, NZ-Applied Technologies used its SBIR award to help develop photonic components for optical telecommunications applications. The company is so successful that Corning recently bought it for $150 million. Further, the company was named as one of the top 50 fastest growing companies in New England and top 500 fastest growing companies in the country. 
   I want to thank my colleagues for their support of the SBIR program over the years. As always, I am pleased that we can work in a bipartisan fashion.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to clarify for the record the intent of language included in Section 326 of the Interior Appropriation fiscal year 2001 bill. I want to point out that interagency coordination of Federal resources is desirable and certainly something many of us have been supporting as a way to eliminate wasteful bureaucratic redundancies. We don't want to spend money in Washington duplicating positions and processes. We want money in the field helping local communities. The language in Section 326 refers to the American Heritage Rivers Initiative, which is coordinated by an interagency committee that serves that purpose for communities seeking technical assistance and opportunities for Federal grants. I would like to point out that this initiative has proven to work well for the participating communities in my state and others. 
   It is my understanding that this language does not prohibit Federal agencies funded through this appropriation from working on or coordinating with each other to support American Heritage Rivers projects. Further, I understand that this language does prohibit the use of resources derived from this bill for funding personnel, training or administration of the activities of the Council on Environmental Quality.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate passed the Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2001. Included in that legislation is a rider that exempts the White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire from the Forest Service's Roadless Initiative. While I supported the passage of the Interior Appropriations bill, I want to express my concern over this rider. 
   I am concerned because the White Mountain National Forest is a national resource, and it is completely appropriate for the federal government to set forth policies to conserve and protect a national resource. Many of my constituents in Massachusetts hike, camp, sightsee and enjoy the great natural lands of the White Mountains. In fact, it was a Massachusetts Congressman, John Weeks, who sponsored the legislation creating the White Mountain National Forest. When the Forest Service sought comment on a new management plan for the forest, more than 54 percent of all comments were submitted by Massachusetts residents. Proponents of the rider have argued that its purpose is to protect local control of forest management. Certainly local residents should have input in the management of the forest. I urge local participation in decisions at Cape Cod National Seashore. However, it sets a bad precedent when one forest is exempted from a national policy to protect the national interest. 
   Despite these concerns I did not move to strike this rider. The reason, ironically, is that I'm confident that the White Mountain National Forest will remain protected because of local input. Time and again, the local process, driven by the citizens of New Hampshire and Massachusetts, has resulted in sound management of the White Mountain National Forest. So, while I oppose the amendment for the precedent it will set, I expect and hope that it will have almost no impact on the health of the forest.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to offer an amendment to the estate tax repeal bill. This amendment would establish a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund to fill the growing gap in our ability to provide affordable housing in this country. 
   Over the past two decades, income and wealth disparities in our country have increased. The gap between the rich and the poor has widened. Even our robust economy has not been able to bridge the great divide between the haves and have-nots. 
   This great divide remains impassable for millions of Americans who struggle to survive on the minimum wage. This divide remains impassable for millions of Americans who have no health insurance, no prescription drug coverage. This divide remains impassable for millions of Americans who cannot afford housing, child care, or a college education, who cannot afford to even finish high school because they must drop out and work in order to support their family. 
   Despite the economic boom that heralded in the new millennium, poverty rates in our country have dropped only marginally. Today, 1 out of ever 5 children still lives in poverty, compared with 1 out of every 7 in the 1970s. The number of families living in extreme poverty--on less than $6,750 a year for a family of 3--has increased from 13.9 million in 1995 to 14.6 million in 1997. Over the 1990's, the average real income of high-income families grew by 15 percent, while average income grew by less than 2 percent for middle-income families and remained the same for the lowest-income families. 
   I ask, with the futures of so many lower- and middle-income Americans hanging in the balance, what is the majority in Congress doing? What is the majority in Congress defining as a top priority? 
   Would you believe a tax cut for the richest of the rich? Indeed they have. It is before us today. A tax break for the highest income earners in our country. A fiscally irresponsible tax cut which stands to threaten our non-Social Security surplus and undercut the critical investments we should be making in the future of all Americans. 
   According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Republican proposal to repeal the estate tax will cost $105 billion over the first 10 years, as it slowly phases in. Once the repeal has been fully implemented, it will cost an additional $50 billion each year. That comes out to roughly three-quarters of a trillion dollars over 20 years. 
   Three-quarters of a trillion dollars is a generous hand-out, Mr. President. But into exactly whose hands does it fall? Does it go to the senior citizen who has survived one heart attack only to find that she cannot afford her cholesterol lowering medication? Does it go to the decorated homeless veteran who cannot afford to put a roof over his head? Does it go to the graduating high school senior who cannot afford to pay tuition and be the first generation of his family to go to college? 
   The simple answer is no. The estate tax repeal would give the Forbes 400 richest Americans a windfall of $250 billion--that is enough to pay for prescription drug coverage, housing costs, and college scholarships for millions of Americans. 
   The majority's priorities are misguided, irresponsible, and an affront to the American public. Don't get me wrong; I support targeted estate tax relief for small businesses and family farms. Owners of small businesses and farms should neither be penalized for their success nor denied the opportunity to pass their family businesses on to future generations. And the Democratic alternative which I support would increase the exemption for family-owned small businesses and farms from $1.3 million to $4 million by 2001, and to $8 million by 2010. But the outright repeal proposed by the majority goes far beyond what is necessary to save family businesses and family farms. 
   Let's be clear: The majority is serious about one thing--unwise, unrealistic, and untenable tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans at a time when the Federal tax burden has shrunk to its lowest level in four decades; at a time when low- and middle-income Americans are struggling to afford decent health care, housing, and education. 
   I ask my colleagues, does anyone really believe that Donald Trump, Bill Gates, or Steve Forbes needs a tax cut? Does anyone really believe that before doing anything to strengthen Social Security and Medicare, we should provide a tax break to the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans who control 40 percent of the wealth in this Nation? Apparently, the majority believes it. That is their idea of tax fairness: millions for the rich, not a penny for the middle class. 
   The bottom line is: the Republican proposal mortgages America's future. It threatens our ability to reduce interest rates and protect the economy, to help secure a strong Social Security system for our nation's retirees, to modernize Medicare by establishing a prescription drug benefit for seniors and the disabled, and to provide educational assistance for those that want to climb up the ladder. 
   There are many more worthwhile investments we could be making with the $750 billion this bill hands out to the extremely wealthy. I am offering an amendment to ensure that we make at least one of these critical investments--an investment in housing. 
   The booming economy is fueling rising housing costs. While housing prices and costs skyrocket at record pace, many families are unable to keep up. Even during this time of great economic expansion, the housing crisis in this country worsens, quickly becoming a national disgrace. 
   HUD estimates that 5.4 million low-income households have ``worst case'' housing needs. This means they are  paying over half their income towards housing costs or living in severely substandard housing. In the past decade, the number of families who have ``worst case'' housing needs has increased by 12 percent--that's 600,000 more American families who cannot afford a decent and safe place to live. For these families living paycheck to paycheck, one unforseen circumstance, a sick child, a car repair bill, can send them into homelessness. 
   Another recent study actually estimates that 13.7 million households have critical housing needs, including 6 million working and 3.7 million elderly households. 
   Moreover, there is not one metropolitan area in the country where a person making minimum wage can afford to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. A person needs to earn over $11 an hour to afford the median rent for a two bedroom apartment in this country. This figure rises dramatically in many metropolitan areas: an hourly wage of $22 is needed in San Francisco; $21 on Long Island; $17 in Boston; $16 in the D.C. area; $14 in Seattle and Chicago; and $13 in Atlanta. 
   We have to remember that there are real people behind these numbers--real people who are struggling to keep their families housed each month. The stories are a testament to the need for increased affordable housing. Let me give you a few. 
   On Cape Cod, Susan O'Donnell a mother of three, earns $21,000 a year working full-time. Nonetheless, she is forced to live in a campground because she can not find affordable housing. The campground she is living at has time limits, so the only way she is able to stay for a prolonged period of time is through cleaning the campground's toilets. When her time runs out at the campground, she will again be forced to move with her three children, though it is not clear where she will be able to afford to move. Skyrocketing housing costs have pushed her, and other full-time workers on the Cape out of their housing and into homelessness. 
   Janitors who work at high-tech companies in Silicon Valley are living in egregious conditions, including several large families living in single-family homes and others renting out garages for families to live in--garages which can cost $750 a month. Maria Godinez, of San Jose, works full time for Sun Microsystems making $8 an hour. She shares one bedroom of a single-family house with her husband and five children; 22 people live in that house. 
   Not too far from where we are today, in Fairfax County, VA, Anita Salathe and her two children live in a shelter despite her having a job and a voucher for assisted housing--there just are not enough affordable housing units. The homelessness rate in Fairfax County has increased by 21 percent in the last two years. Full-time workers are living in shelters because their paychecks are not rising fast enough to keep pace with their growing housing costs. 
   These stories are all too common. As housing costs rise around America, more working families are being pushed closer to homelessness. 
   Despite these abysmal stories, we have decreased Federal spending on critical housing programs over time. From fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 1999, we engaged in what I call the ``Great HUDway Robbery,'' diverting or rescinding over $20 billion from Federal housing programs for other uses. With a few exceptions, the funding increases of this past year have gone primarily to cover the rising costs of serving existing assisted families. 
   Affordable housing units are being lost. Between 1993 and 1995, a loss of 900,000 rental units affordable to very 
   low-income families occurred. From 1996 to 1998, there was a 19 percent reduction in the number of affordable housing units. This amounted to a dramatic reduction of 1.3 million affordable housing units available to low-income Americans. 
   We need to bring our levels of housing spending back up to where they belong. Between 1978 and 1995, the Government increased the number of households receiving housing assistance by almost 3 million. From 1978 through 1984, we provided an additional 230,000 families with housing assistance each year. This number dropped significantly to 126,000 additional households each year from 1985 to 1995. 
   If we hoped things could not get worse, in 1996 this nations' housing policy hit a brick wall. Not only was there no increase in families receive housing assistance, but the number of assisted units actually decreased. From 1996 to 1998, the number of HUD assisted households dropped by 51,000. In this time of rising rents and housing costs, and the loss of affordable housing units, it is incomprehensible that we are not doing more to bring the levels of housing assistance back from the dead. 
   It is high time that we focused on housing policies in Congress and around the country. Housing is an anchor for families. When we focus our efforts on other social issues like education and health care, it is beyond comprehension that housing does not take a front seat in these discussions. 
   It is no secret that neighborhood and living environment play enormous roles in shaping young lives. It should not be news that housing assistance, which helps a family maintain a stable home, is positive for low-income children. We know that a child can not learn if he has to attend 3 or 4 schools in a single year, if his family moves from relative to relative to friend to friend because his parents can't afford the rent. 
   A recent study conducted by Johns Hopkins University helps to show that housing assistance is beneficial. Housing assistance makes it easier to get and retain a job by providing stability. We need to ensure that every American family has these same opportunities. We need to address the lack of opportunity, the lack of affordable housing. 
   I am proposing to address this severe shortage of affordable housing by establishing a National Affordable Housing Trust Fund. While we are considering a bill which allows the wealthy to pass on large estates and homes to their families, let's ensure that all Americans can afford a place to live. 
   My proposal would create an affordable housing production program, ensuring that new rental units are built for those who most need assistance--extremely low-income families, including working families. In addition, Trust Fund assistance will be used to promote homeownership for low-income families, those families whose incomes are below 80 percent of the area median income. 
   The Trust Fund aims to create long-term affordable, mixed-income developments in areas with the greatest opportunities for low-income families. 
   A majority of assistance from the Trust Fund will be given out as matching grants to the States which will distribute funds on a competitive basis like the low-income housing tax credit. Localities, non-profits, developers and other entities will be eligible to apply for funds. The remaining 25 percent of the Trust Fund assistance will be distributed through a national competition to intermediaries, such as large, national non-profits which will be required to leverage private funds. 
   This proposal will bring Federal, State and private resources together to create needed affordable housing opportunities for American families. 
   When we allow families in this country to live in severely distressed housing, or in situations where they are forced to move from place to place, American children suffer--they have behavioral problems, they suffer from more health problems, and they do worse in school. I think the American people understand that helping children escape these problems today will pay us back tenfold in the years to come. I think the American people understand how we can measure what actually counts in America. I think they know that housing is more than a word or a government program--it is the quality of life--it is how we measure our lives and it is how we ought to take the measure of our nation. 
   I urge you to support this amendment which restores our commitment to providing affordable housing for all families. We should not vote to ensure that the wealthiest Americans can retain more of their incomes and estates, while turning our back on those families who struggle each month just to put a roof over their heads.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about the Santorum/Lieberman amendment being offered to the Estate Tax bill. This amendment gives the Senate the opportunity to vote on broad economic development  policies originally introduced a few weeks ago as S. 2779, the American Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment Act. 
   Of the many important and innovative provisions in this legislation, I would like to focus on the community development and venture capital initiative and full funding for Round II of Empowerment Zones. Mr. President, as my colleagues may remember last year I introduced the Community Development and Venture Capital Act. The purpose of community development and venture capital is to stimulate economic development through public-private partnerships that invest venture capital in smaller businesses. Not just any small businesses, but those that are located in impoverished rural and urban areas, known as new markets, or that employ low-income people. We call these areas new markets because of the overlooked business opportunities. According to Michael Porter, a respected professor at Harvard and business analyst who has written extensively on competitiveness, ``..... inner cities are the largest underserved market in America, with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.'' 
   Both innovative and fiscally sound, my new markets initiative is financially structured similar to Small Business Administration (SBA)'s successful Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program, and incorporates a technical assistance component similar to that successfully used in SBA's microloan program. However, unlike the SBIC program which focuses solely on small businesses with high-growth potential and claims successes such as Staples and Calaway Golf, the New Markets Venture Capital program will focus on smaller businesses that show promise of financial and social returns, such as jobs--what we call a ``double bottomline.'' 
   To get at the complex and deep-rooted economic problems in new market areas, my initiative has three parts: a venture capital program to funnel investment money into our poorest communities, a program to expand the number of venture capital firms that are devoted to investing in such communities, and a mentoring program to link established, successful businesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in stagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve. 
   What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand investment in our neediest communities by building on the economic activity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do that is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities. 
   Building on part of the President's and Speaker HASTERT's agreement, this amendment secures full, mandatory funding for Round II empowerment zones. In Massachusetts--specifically Boston--this amounts to a little more than $93 million. Now, I know many of my colleagues are in the same boat because they have empowerment zones in their states--Ohio, South Carolina, Florida, California--but let me just give you the history of why this funding is so important. Funding for Round II empowerment zones started in 1998. So far, however, the money has dribbled in--only $6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten years--and made it impossible for Boston, and other empowerment zones, to implement its plan for economic self-sufficiency. In Boston, 80 public and private entities, from universities to technology companies to banks to local government, showed incredible community spirit and committed to matching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it another way--these groups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal Empowerment Zone money with $800 million. Yet, and regrettably so, in spite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston has not been able to tap into that leveraged money and implement the strategic plan because Congress hasn't held its part of the bargain. I am extremely pleased that we were able to find a way to provide full, steady funding to these zones. That money means education, daycare, transportation and basic health care in areas--in Massachusetts that includes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattipan--where almost 50 percent of the children are living in poverty and nearly half the residents over 25 don't even have a high school diploma. 
   Mr. President, this bill goes further than funding empowerment zones and establishing incentives to attract venture capital into distressed communities. It enhances education opportunities, creates individual development accounts to help low-income families save and invest in their future, increases affordable housing, improves access to technology in our classrooms and creates incentives to help communities remediate brownfields. 
   I thank my colleagues for their work on this legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alaska for his efforts to try to reach an accommodation. I listened carefully to the arguments of the Senator from Alaska who made it clear that he had a very strong belief that certain facilities in the State of Alaska had been treated in a way that he believed very deeply was inappropriate and resulted in fines that were excessive and, in his judgment, wrought with some bureaucratic issues that he had no recourse to resolve. 
   The initial section in the bill reported by the committee would regrettably have prohibited the EPA entirely from being able to enforce. A number of Members felt very strongly that was an overreaction in how we cure the problem that the Senator from Alaska was bringing to our attention without destroying the ability of the EPA to be able to enforce across the country. 
   So we reached an agreement where 98 percent of all those enforcement actions in the country which are under $1.5 million, the EPA will continue to be able to enforce as it currently does. It is appropriate for this 3-year period only to review what the impact may be of some larger level over that period of time. 
   To have proceeded down the road we were going to proceed, in my and other people's judgment, would have created a terrible double standard. Under current law, a DOD facility that violates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or the Safe Drinking Water Act or the Toxic Substances Control Act or the Clean Air Act is subject to the same kinds of penalties as a private facility. By waiving sovereign immunity and subjecting Federal facilities to fines, we created the financial hammer to be able to force a sometimes reluctant Government and a Government bureaucracy to comply. 
   Congress recognized this principle in 1992 when we passed the law. The bill was sponsored by majority leader Mitchell. He said at the time that a waiver of sovereign immunity would move us from the disorder of Federal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities were subject to the same law and to full enforcement action. I am pleased to say it passed the Senate by a vote of 94-3, and it passed the House by a vote of 403-3. It was signed into law by President Bush, who at the time said it would bring all Federal facilities into compliance with applicable Federal and State hazardous waste laws. 
   I think that very much is our purpose today--to protect our capacity to be able to secure that kind of enforcement. I thank the Senator from Alaska for his very reasonable approach to this. I think we have been able to resolve the most egregious situations about which he has expressed appropriate concern, but at the same time we have been able to preserve the principle of Federal compliance and the principle of all people being treated equally. 
   I thank the Chair and I thank the distinguished Senator from West Virginia for his courtesy in allowing us to deal with this issue.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight, Senator STEVENS offered an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 to amend Section 342. The amendment reflects a compromise reached between Senator STEVENS, BAUCUS, LAUTENBERG and myself. I want to thank Senator STEVENS for working with us to address grave concerns we had with Section 342 of the bill. 
   Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments about Section 342 and discuss why I had such great concerns over the impact it would have had on environmental compliance. Section 342, as it was passed out of the Armed Services Committee, would have weakened a fundamental environmental principle that protects the environment and public health in communities across the nation. It is the principle that national environmental laws should apply to the federal government in the same manner as they apply to state and local governments and to private facilities, including companies, universities, hospitals, and nonprofit entities. 
   Section 342 would have created a double standard by subjecting corporations, state and local facilities to one legal standard and Department of Defense facilities to a second, weaker standard. More importantly, it had the great potential to undermine compliance with national environmental and public health protections at military facilities across the nation--putting the environment and citizens at risk. 
   Specifically, the provision amended existing law to require Congressional authorization before the DOD pays environmental and public health penalties assessed by state and federal authorities in excess of $1.5 million or based on ``economic benefit'' or ``size-of-business'' criteria. As a result, it provided DOD a congressional reprieve not provided to any other entity. 
   It created a double standard. Under current law, a DOD facility that violates the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Toxic Substances Control Act, or the Clean Air Act is subject to the same kind of penalties as a private facility. By waiving sovereign immunity--and subjecting federal facilities to fines--we create the financial hammer that forces sometimes reluctant government bureaucracies to comply. And we apply the law equally to all. 
   Congress recognized this principle in 1992 with the enactment of the Federal Facilities Compliance Act, which waived sovereign immunity under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The bill was sponsored by Majority Leader George Mitchell, who said in floor debate that, ``A waiver of sovereign immunity moves us from the disorder of Federal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities are subject to the same law and to full enforcement action.'' He added that: ``The principle [of waving sovereign immunity] is important because, without it, there is only voluntary compliance. History demonstrates that voluntary compliance does not work.'' 
   The Federal Facilities Compliance Act had 33 cosponsors in the Senate--myself included. It was a bipartisan effort that passed the Senate with a vote of 94-3 and the House by a vote of 403-3. It was signed into law by President George Bush, who said that, ``The objective of the bill is to bring all Federal facilities into compliance with applicable Federal and State hazardous waste laws, to waive Federal Sovereign immunity under those laws, and to allow the imposition of fines and penalties.'' He added, ``Four years ago I promised the American people that I would make the federal government live up to the same environmental standards that apply to private citizens. By signing this bill, we take another step toward fulfillment of that promise.'' 
   It was an important step for the states coping with federal agencies that were immune to enforcement and that refused to comply. The California Secretary of Environmental Protection, James M. Strock, said that in passing the Act, Congress took ``an important step in restoring the link between environmental responsibility and remediation of environmental damage at federal facilities.'' He continued, ``The Act provides an essential tool to states and localities which seek compliance with hazardous waste laws.'' 
   The National Association of Attorneys General applauded the passage of the Act. Their statement read that, ``The [legislation] has been among the Association's highest priorities on Capitol Hill for the past five years. ..... [The] Attorneys General have repeatedly called upon Congress to clarify the waiver of federal sovereign immunity, which has thus far prevented the states from ensuring compliance at contaminated facilities through assessment of fines and penalties.'' 
   I feel that Section 342 would have rolled back the progress we've made with the Federal Facilities Compliance Act and other laws. It would have been a mistake. We should allow our law enforcement agencies to do their job. Section 342 of the DOD bill was opposed by the National Governors' Association, the National Association of Attorneys General, and the National Conference of State Legislatures. In a joint letter they write that, ``States report that the federal government is the nation's largest polluter and military installations are a major contributor to that pollution. Section 342 is a step backward from the progress we have made in changing the attitude of military installations toward compliance with the nation's environmental laws. We urge you to support efforts to strike the provisions.'' This letter is signed by Governor Kenny Guinn of Nevada, Attorney General Christine Gregoire of Washington, and Senator Beverly Gard of Indiana. 
   Section 342 was also opposed by the Environmental Council of the States. It writes that, ``The state environmental commissioners, along with governors, state legislators, attorneys general and other officials of state government have insisted that the federal government live by exactly the same standards and requirements that it imposes on all other parties, and we all oppose this provision in S. 2549. Exempting military installations from one of the basic tools of environmental enforcement is bad policy, and would seriously erode our capacity to ensure our citizens the protection of federal and state laws.'' The letter is signed by R. Lewis Shaw, Deputy Commissioner, South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control and President 
   of the Council.  
   Mr. President, even Governor George W. Bush of Texas recognizes the important principle of treating federal facilities as we treat state and local governments and private facilities. On Governor Bush's website--georgebush.com--the Governor has posted his environmental platform. The sixth plank in that platform reads as follows: ``Direct active federal facilities to comply with the environmental protection laws and hold them accountable.'' It continues, ``Governor Bush will expect the federal government to lead by example. He believes it is time to end the double standard that has federal government acting as enforcer of the nation's environmental laws, while at the same time causing pollution that violates those laws.'' 
   Mr. President, last year, a provision similar to Section 342 was incorporated into the FY 2000 DOD appropriations bill. The Congressional Budget Office evaluated that provision and concluded that, ``Based on information from DOD and on conversations with representatives of state governments, CBO believes that requiring DOD to seek specific authorization from the Congress before paying each fine ..... will likely delay the payment of some fines. To the extent the Congress fails to authorize fines in the future, it is possible that the section would make it more difficult for states and local governments to negotiate for compliance with environmental laws.'' The letter is signed by Dan. L. Crippen, Director of the CBO. 
   Plain and simple, if we had passed Section 342 we would have rolled back environmental and public health protections for thousands of Americans who live near DOD facilities and for generations who will face the costs of cleanup. Our state attorneys--the people in the field enforcing our laws--our governors and our state environmental commissioners--and even the likely Republican nominee for President are telling us it is a mistake to do so. 
   Mr. President, the principle is not just rhetoric--it is supported by the record. In 1993, compliance by federal facilities with the Resources Conservation and Restoration Act was 55.4 percent. Almost half of all federal facilities operated out of compliance. Why? Because the law was unclear as to whether or not environmental fines could be assessed against federal facilities. But with the passage of the Federal Facilities Compliance Act in 1992--when DOD and other federal facilities faced fines and penalties for the first time--compliance started to climb. By 1998, compliance at federal facilities had reached 88.2 percent. And the opposite has also proven true. Federal compliance under the Clean Water Act, which does not have a clear waiver, has dropped at federal facilities. In 1993, more than 94 percent of federal facilities were in compliance, and by 1998 that number had dropped to just 61.5 percent. According to enforcement officials at EPA and state government, that decline coincided with court decisions that interpreted the Clean Water Act as having only a limited waiver of sovereign immunity. To reverse that trend, I understand that Senator COVERDELL has introduced legislation to waive sovereign immunity for federal facilities. That Republican-led initiative now has now been cosponsored by Senators BREAUX, CHAFEE, DEWINE, GRAMS, and VOINOVICH. 
   Some argued that last year's provision wouldn't impact enforcement because, like Section 342, Congress can authorize the fine. But the numbers don't bear out that prediction. Why? Because investigators and attorneys knew full well that DOD was about to get a ``Get Out Of Jail Free Card'' from Congress. Even the best legal work can be overturned if Congress simply decides not to act on an authorization. As a result, enforcement actions have dropped off. As with any law, without strong enforcement, compliance will fall. 
   The principle is simple, Mr. President. If you want people, companies, institutions, and the government to comply with the law you must be tough on crime--including environmental crime. The way to ensure that all facilities comply with the law is to make sure that pollution does not pay. If the threat of a large fine is on the horizon--if the laws have teeth--everyone will be far more inclined to comply. 
   Mr. President, I want to focus some on the issue of ``economic benefit'' and ``size-of-business'' criteria and what it means to limit the federal and state authority to impose a fine based on those criteria. There seems to be some confusion as to why a federal or state authority would seek a penalty based on economic benefits at a DOD facility. The Report language accompanying Section 342 notes that the DOD, in the Committee's view, has no economic competitors in regard to the Clean Air Act. Therefore, the principle of economic benefit or size-of-business should not apply. Mr. President, I believe that is an incorrect reading of the Clean Air Act and other relevant statutes. 
   Foremost, an economic benefit provision prevents a facility, whether it's private or federal, from benefitting financially from noncompliance. Federal and state authorities need the power to make noncompliance economically unviable. We cannot have a system that rewards people for breaking the law. The Report language accompanying Section 342 argues that economic benefit is tied to ``competition'' among businesses and intended to prevent economic advantage through noncompliance. That is a narrow, misreading of the Clean Air Act. For example, all across the country, electric utilities--including municipal facilities--operate without ``competitors'' as the report defines the term. Utilities are guaranteed a market in return for providing a set amount of power. This is changing with competition, but many did and some still do operate as sanctioned monopolies. But they are not exempt from fines and penalties in the Clean Air Act. Further, EPA and the states assess ``economic benefit'' fines against hospitals, universities, and local and state governments. For example, in a Clean Water Act challenge, the United States versus City of San Diego in 1991, a federal court found that the ``plaintiffs' analysis of economic benefit is valid as to municipalities. While it is difficult to quantify precisely the savings realized by the City as a result of its intransigence, plaintiffs have demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence that the city has saved in excess of $300 million over approximately the last thirty years by failing to invest in capital improvements.'' The case shows that economic benefits apply to nonbusiness entities--the City of San Diego and that economic benefit is based on ``savings'' from noncompliance. 
   Mr. President, ``economic benefit'' and ``size-of-business'' criteria are as applicable to DOD as they are to private companies, non-profits, states, and other federal agencies. We should not 
   rollback protections and create a situation in which a manager within the DOD could rationalize noncompliance because it saves money--we must demand compliance from federal facilities. 
   Further, Mr. President, the use of these criteria to enforce the law has been endorsed by the states. The Attorneys Generals, the Governors and the Conference of Legislatures specifically addressed this issue in their letter opposing Section 342. They write that, ``The economic benefit analysis, in particular, is important to states because it prevents DOD from considering a fine merely as a cost of doing business .....'' The Environmental Council of the States, which represents our state environmental commissioners, writes, ``Section 342 would have severely restricted the ability of states to ensure that facilities do not realize financial gain through noncompliance. Typically, states include in their penalties an amount that offsets these financial benefits. In this way, they significantly reduce economic incentives to avoid environmental and public health requirements.'' A cursory review of state policy conducted by the Governors, Attorneys General and the State Commissioners at my request, found that most states use economic benefits, including Texas, Montana, South Carolina, Minnesota, Colorado, Indiana, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Alaska, Connecticut, and California. 
   The Armed Services Committee Report with S. 2549 states that ``[i]t is the committee's view that the application of the economic benefit or size of business penalty assessment criteria to the DOD is inconsistent with the statutory language and the legislative history under the [Clean Air Act.]'' Again, I  disagree and suggest that is narrow and incorrect reading of the Act. I believe a plain reading of the Clean Air Act makes it clear that all fines and sanctions apply to DOD. Section 118(a) of the Act reads as follows: ``Each department, agency, and instrumentality of executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government ..... shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, administrative authority, and process and sanctions respecting the control and abatement of air pollution in the same manner, and to the same extent as any nongovernmental entity. The preceding sentence shall apply (A) to any requirement whether substantive or procedural (including any record keeping or reporting requirement, any requirement respecting permits and any other requirement whatsoever), (B) to any requirement to pay a fee or charge imposed by any State or local agency to defray the costs of its air pollution regulatory program, (C) to the exercise of any Federal, State, or local administrative authority, and (D) to any process and sanction, whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts, or in any other manner.'' In addition, the managers report for the 1990 amendments regarding Section 118(a) reads that, ``the new language is intended to refute the argument [DOD is not subject to fee requirements] and to affirm the obligation of federal agencies to comply with all requirements, including such fees or charges.'' I add that Section 118(b) of the Clean Air Act is titled ``Exemptions'' and it specifically delineates under what circumstances the DOD can be exempted from enforcement action--and it makes no reference to the size of a fine or the criteria set forth in the penalty section. The Clean Air Act is very clear on this point. 
   Mr. President, Section 342 reached beyond the Clean Air Act. It also applies to the Resources Conservation and Restoration Act, Toxic Substances Control Act and the Safe Drinking Water Act. I believe that a plain reading of RCRA and the Federal Facilities Compliance Act makes clear that DOD should be treated the same as private facilities. There is no ambiguity in the law or the legislative history. In the floor debate Senator Mitchell said, ``A waiver of sovereign immunity moves us from the disorder of Federal noncompliance to a forum in which all entities are subject to the same law and to full enforcement action.'' At the bill signing Bush said, ``The objective of the bill is to bring all Federal facilities into compliance with applicable Federal and State hazardous waste laws, to waive Federal Sovereign immunity under those laws, and to allow the imposition of fines and penalties.'' Section 102 of RCRA reads, ``The Federal, State, interstate, and local substantive and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited to, all administrative orders and all civil and administrative penalties and fines, regardless of whether such penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in nature or are imposed for isolated, intermittent, or continuing violations.'' In regard to EPA actions against DOD, the Act reads that, ``The Administrator may commence an administrative enforcement action against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government pursuant to the enforcement authorities contained in this Act. The Administrator shall initiate an administrative enforcement action against such a department, agency, or instrumentality in the same manner and under the same circumstances as an action would be initiated against another person.'' Mr. President, I believe the law is clear. The Report language with S. 2549 offers us an inaccurate reading of the Clean Air Act and fails to address other environmental law statutes it impacts. 
   Some have suggested that Section 342 would have almost no impact on enforcement because few cases exceed $1.5 million. As a result, we will rarely--if ever--need a congressional authorization to impose a fine. That's simply wrong. Section 342 reads that congressional authorization is needed if the fine exceeds $1.5 million or if it is based on ``economic benefit'' or ``size of business'' criteria. In theory, Mr. President, all fines originating with the Environmental Protection Agency would have been caught by Section 342, regardless of their size. It is EPA's policy and that of many states that all fines should incorporate the economic benefit gained from noncompliance. It is difficult to know how many fines will need to pass through the new process created by Section 342 and how many will not be authorized or authorized at a lower amount. But, we do know that it could be a fine of any size, no matter how small. 
   Moreover, the threat of a large fine will be gone if Section 342 passed. This alone will deter compliance. The Congressional Budget Office specifically noted in its letter from last year that, ``the States, local governments, and federal agencies often use the threat of theses fines as part of the negotiation with facilities to achieve compliance with environmental laws.'' The Attorneys General--the people in the field doing the work--write of Section 342 that, ``The threat of a significant fine or penalty is one of the more effective ways state officials have for encouraging violators, including military installations, to take responsibility for the environmental consequences of their operations.'' Any prosecutor, whether they are involved in a criminal action, or civil environmental compliance, will tell you that the threat of long jail term or a large fine is critical to enforcing the law. Finally and most importantly, Mr. President, by giving the largest violators, those fined over $1.5 million, a chance for congressional reprieve, Section 342 created a perverse system where only the most egregious violators get a special legal loophole unavailable to less egregious violators. It is a bad precedent. 
   Mr. President, the compromise we have reached does not resolve all of my concerns, but it addresses many of them. Under the agreement reached tonight, offered by Senator STEVENS and passed, all fines of $1.5 million or more, assessed against DOD by a federal agency for environmental noncompliance, over the next three years, must be approved by Congress. State enforcement actions are not impacted by this agreement and our state Attorneys General can continue to enforce the law as they now do. The concepts of economic benefits and size of business remain in place in our environmental enforcement at the state and federal level. Only fines equal to or in excess of $1.5 million will require a congressional authorization and that result in only a small percentage of fines needing authorization. And it expires in three years. I do have some concerns with the agreement. By requiring a congressional authorization on fines of $1.5 million or more, we provide the most egregious violators a congressional reprieve and, therefore, it will limit our ability to deter noncompliance because the threat of a large fine will be reduced. However, I want to note and recognize the concerns Senator STEVENS has raised. Enforcement power, whether it sits with the EPA or the states, can be abused. The agreement expires in three years. In that time, Congress will have a close look at EPA's actions in assessing large fines. 
   Again, I want to thank Senators STEVENS, BAUCUS and LAUTENBERG.

   This is really a matter of--I guess the best word to summarize it--common sense. My prayer is that we in the Senate are not going to become prisoners of politics on an issue that is as critical to the national security interests of our country--indeed, of the world. This is the most important arms decision we will make in years. I am not going to get into the comparisons of when the last one was, but certainly in the last 10 or 15 years. I think what the Senator from Illinois is asking for ought to fit into the political philosophy of every single member of the Republican Party. I would have hoped the Senator, the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee, would say we should accept this amendment. How is it that we could be talking about deploying a weapons system?

   Mr. KERRY. We face a situation where we are talking about putting together a system that the best scientists in the world tell us could literally be rendered absolutely inoperative, if it is simply deployed; all you have to do is put the system out there, and you have the ability to create decoys with fairly unsophisticated technology. In fact, General Welch himself has said in his report, and he said it before the Armed Services Committee the other day, that they anticipate the C-1 deployment, which is the deployment currently contemplated, with countermeasures by year 2005, is a deployment in which they anticipate current technology, current state-of-the-art technology, has the ability to deploy countermeasures. 
   They say you could have bomblets. After the stage separates in outer space and it is in that midstage, you could have bomblets, up to 100 of them, released from 1 single warhead. Strictly speaking, that is not a countermeasure because it is not directed at the entire system. But it is a countermeasure in that it voids the effectiveness of the system or the capacity of the system to work effectively. 
   I ask my colleagues to look around the wall of this Chamber. I counted earlier, in the great amount of time we had to wait for this debate, 88 lights up there on the outer section. That is fewer than 100 of these bomblets. I ask you to just look at those. We are supposed to talk about a system that would be effective enough to destroy bombs coming at us from outer space, at a spacing far greater than any of those 
   lights, at tens of hundreds of miles an hour, with the capacity to distinguish and break through every single one of them to prevent a chemical weapon or biological weapon, that could be completely lethal to the entire city of New York, Los Angeles, to a whole State, from hitting this country. 
   Does anybody here really believe we are going to be able to go down that kind of sophisticated, discriminative capacity? Some say maybe we might get there in 10 years, 20 years, 30 years; that we might have that ability if everything worked correctly. Maybe we can develop that kind of system ultimately. But at what cost? Then the question is, What is the next tier of countermeasure that defeats whatever it is we did to defeat their countermeasure? 
   People sit here and say: Don't worry about that, Senator; we are just going to have a technological superiority. 
   All you have to do is go back to the cold war, 50 years of point-counterpoint; step-counterstep. We do the atom bomb; they do the atom bomb. We do the hydrogen bomb; they do the hydrogen bomb. We put them on long-range aircraft; they put them on long-range aircraft. We MIRV; they MIRV. They do Sputnik; we do Sputnik. 
   Out of all of the measures through the entire cold war, the United States of America was the first to do them almost every single time. I think the record is all but once and maybe twice. Every single time we did it, it may have taken them 5 years, it may have taken them 7 years, but they did it. And finally we decided that we were safer by passing the ABM Treaty and beginning to move in the opposite direction, first with SALT and then with START. 
   Now all we are asking in this amendment is let's be certain, before we spend these billions of dollars. I happen to support this. I want to be very clear about this. I support the notion of developing a limited, capable, mutually deployed system for national defense that could, indeed, strike down a potential rogue missile or accidental firing. No leader of the United States could responsibly suggest we are going  to write off an entire city or State, or half our country. Of course we have an obligation to go down that road, but we have an equal obligation to do it in a way that does not wind up upsetting the entire balance of the arms race, or our current process of diminishing arms, that does not tell all our allies the United States is going to break out, at some point, of their regime at our own will; that we have not established a sufficient level of scrutiny, of transparency, of mutuality, that brings people along with us so they understand where we are going. 
   I say to my friend, I am all for continuing as rapidly as we can the technological development, the research, the capacity to do this, but don't we want to do it in a way that guarantees we have a system that can do what it sets out to do without inviting a set of unintended consequences that actually wind up making the world not as safe as we were when we began the process? That is all we are asking. 
   I can envision a world where the Russians and the Chinese and others decide we are all safer if we have a capacity to prevent a terrorist from firing some kind of missile from anywhere, but we are only safer if other countries move along with us and perceive that they are sharing in that safety and that, somehow, it is not a new measure directed by the United States against their current level of perceived security or threat level. 
   All of this is an ongoing process of perceptions: How they perceive us; how we perceive them. It is important to be sensitive to those perceptions. 
   I believe what the amendment of the Senator from Illinois will do will actually build on General Welch's recommendations. It will explicitly set out what the BMDO should do. It will require ground and flight testing that will make the system safer and better. It will ultimately guarantee us that we will get the kind of system we want. 
   General Welch says he intends for the independent review team to address these countermeasure issues. It seems to me what the Senator from Illinois is doing is guaranteeing that the Congress is going on record, just as we did in saying we think we ought to pursue this, just as we did in suggesting that there are certain threshold levels that we ought to respond to with respect to our intelligence. 
   My final comment is, picking up where the Senator from Michigan closed, the 2005 deadline is exactly what the Senator from Michigan defined it as. It is, in effect, an out-of-the-sky, artificially arrived at deadline. Yet it has been driving this debate and driving the Congress' actions. We have time to pursue this thoughtfully and efficiently. That is what this amendment sets out to do. I congratulate the Senator from Illinois.

   Mr. KERRY. If I can answer the distinguished Senator, and I know the Senator from Illinois will talk about it more, the truth is, if you read the Senator's amendment in full, the Senator is very precise about those kinds of tests that he thinks the Congress ought to guarantee take place. 
   The Secretary of Defense is a friend of mine, too. I went to meet with him 3 weeks ago on this very subject to spend some 
   time talking it through with him, but I find nothing inappropriate, nor do I think he would as a former Member of this Chamber, in this Chamber expressing its will in requiring a certain set of tests with respect to a system. 
   This is not the first time we will have required the Secretary of Defense to do something. In point of fact, when we pass the DOD authorization bill, we have literally hundreds of directives for the Secretary of Defense with respect to housing, treatment of deployments, recruitments--there are countless numbers of ways we direct him to do things. It is entirely appropriate we direct him----

   Mr. KERRY. I say to my friend from Virginia, I read that report very carefully. There is nothing in it that guarantees to me--there is terminology about further investigation, further evaluation, but that could be on paper; that could be a computer model; that could be in any number of ways that they decide satisfy a fairly strong compulsion, shall we say, within the institution to build. 
   What we want to guarantee is that compulsion is appropriately measured against a clear empirical standard that we are establishing. I find absolutely nothing inconsistent in that. 
   Moreover, with respect to the date that is compelling us--I know the chairman of the committee will agree with me on this --the fact is that significant changes have been made in the intelligence estimating process which has also made many people nervous about how people want to push this process a little bit. 
   The Senator from Michigan talked about the possibility of a missile being fired by North Korea. Until, I think, a year ago or 2 years ago--I will finish very quickly. I am not going to go on long. I want to make this point because it is important. 
   We used to measure in an intelligence estimate more than mere possibility. We measure intention, and it was only in response to the 1995 Rumsfeld process that suddenly we changed the way we evaluate this. We now no longer contemplate intention; we merely look at possibility. I say to my friend, it may be a possibility that North Korea has one missile that they could fire, but they would have to be beyond insane to do it 
   because they would not last on the face of this planet more than 30 minutes because of our response. 
   So do they have an intention to do it, particularly when you measure it against the Perry mission, when you  measure it against Kim Dae-jung's recent visit and the entire rapprochement that is currently taking place? Are we to believe this is a legitimate threat we should be responding to with such speed that will not guarantee the kind of testing the Senator from Illinois is asking for? 
   That is our point. I think this is one where there are suspicions sufficient to raise questions about the guarantees that the testing will be there that we need.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am deeply concerned that the supplemental appropriations contained in this Military Construction Appropriations conference report (accompanying H.R. 4425) do not provide for essential funding for SBA's popular 7(a) guaranteed business loan program. 
   For nearly 50 years, SBA's 7(a) loan program has provided loans to start and grow small business across the country when they could not access financing in the commercial marketplace. SBA provides this assistance in the form of guaranties for loans made by a network of more than 5,000 private sector lenders. Currently, SBA's 7(a) portfolio includes nearly $40 billion in 7(a) loans representing as many as 150,000 small businesses that might not be in business today were it not for their SBA guaranteed loans. The 7(a) program is funded by user fees and a modest appropriation intended to offset any potential losses on the SBA guaranteed loans. For fiscal year 2000, the taxpayers' cost for a 7(a) loan is only $1.16 for every $1000 guaranteed. And for each $10,000 loaned, at least one job is created. 
   Despite the tremendous benefits provided by the 7(a) loan program, however, this year the available program level will not be adequate to meet the needs of the eligible, credit-worthy small businesses that will seek assistance from SBA. This means that by the end of the fiscal year the Agency will have to turn away some of the small entrepreneurs that are relying on SBA-guaranteed loans to finance the growth of their businesses. In an environment where small business is responsible for much of the growth in the American economy and most of the new job opportunities, this is penny-wise and pound-foolish. 
   SBA has funds available that could be transferred to the 7(a) program to help to make sure that every eligible, credit-worthy small business that seeks SBA's loan assistance is able to access the loans that they need. The simple request would allow SBA to use funds that have been previously appropriated to it for the 7(a) program. If any of us were asked whether we support the small businesses in our States--in our districts, we would answer with a resounding ``yes.'' By including language to allow SBA to use existing funds for 7(a) program loans, we will be demonstrating in a very tangible way that our local small businesses can really count on this support. 
   I don't understand why we, the Congress, continue to deny this simple request that means so much to so many and costs so little. This is nothing unanticipated or given to the Congress at the last minute: 
   In SBA's FY 2000 request, SBA asked for a program level of $10.5 billion for this program. The SBA only received a program level of $9.75 billion. 
   The President's supplemental request letter of February 25, 2000 included SBA's request for authority to transfer money to the 7(a) program to raise the program level to the requested $10.5 billion. 
   When the Administrator testified on the FY 2001 budget in March of this year, she stated that SBA would need the $10.5 billion program level for FY 2000 at the then current demand level. 
   On May 22, SBA Administrator Alvarez sent letters to Chairmen STEVENS and GREGG expressing her concern that the transfer was not included in S. 2536.  
   In a letter from Jacob Lew, director of OMB, to Chairman Young, Director Lew mentioned the concern by the Administration of the transfer ability. 
   Now I am expressing my concern that it is not in H.R. 4425.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced legislation, along with my good friend from Ohio Senator DEWINE, that will set minimum standards for gun safety locks. There has been a lot of discussion swirling around the U.S. Congress and in State legislatures throughout the country about the use of handgun safety locks to prevent children from gaining access to dangerous weapons. In fact, just last week New York became the latest State to require that safety locks be sold with firearms. Seventeen states have Child Access Protection, or CAP laws in place, which permit prosecution of adults if their firearm is left unsecured and a child uses that firearm to harm themselves or others. 
   An important element that is largely missing from the debate over the voluntary or required use of gun safety locks is the quality and performance of these locks. Mr. President, a gun lock will only keep a gun out of a child's hands if the lock works. There are many cheap, flimsy locks on the market that are easily overcome by a child. In fact just last week in Dale City, VA there was an absolutely heart-wrenching accidental shooting of  a 10-year-old boy by his 13-year-old brother. The parents of these young boys purchased both a lock box and a trigger lock and I'm sure they assumed that they were safely storing their weapon. 
   But, as was reported in Saturday's Washington Post, the boys easily got past the flimsy lock box and then got around the lock. This incident ended in unspeakable, but all too common tragedy with the death of a 10-year-old boy at the hands of his brother. 
   Mr. President, the legislation Senator DEWINE and I introduced yesterday might have prevented the accidental shooting of that young boy last week. Our legislation gives authority to the Consumer Product Safety Commission to set minimum regulations for safety locks and to remove unsafe locks from the market. Our legislation empowers consumers by ensuring that they will only purchase high-quality lock boxes and trigger locks. 
   Storing firearms safely is an effective and inexpensive way to prevent the needless tragedies associated with unintentional firearm-related death and injury. And I am pleased that several states, including my home state of Massachusetts, have required the use of gun safety locks. Last July here in the U.S. Senate we passed an amendment that would require the use of gun safety locks. 
   So, while I am encouraged by this trend of increasing the use of gun safety locks, I am genuinely concerned that with the hundreds of different types of gun locks on the market today it is difficult--probably impossible--for consumers to be assured that the lock they are purchasing will be effective. 
   The latest data released by the Centers for Disease Control in 1999 revealed that accidental shootings accounted for 7 percent of child deaths and that more than 300 children died in gun accidents, almost one child every day. A study in the Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine found that 25 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds and 70 percent of 5- to 6-year-olds had sufficient finger strength to fire 59 (or 92 percent) of the 64 commonly available handguns examined in the study. Accidental shootings can be prevented by simple safety measures, one of which is the use of an effective gun safety lock. 
   As I have already mentioned, Mr. President, the use of gun safety locks is increasing in the United States. Despite the growing use of gun safety locks, such products are not subject to any minimal safety standards. Many currently available trigger locks, safety locks, lock boxes, and other similar devices are inadequate to prevent the accidental discharge of the firearms to which they are attached or to prevent access and accidental use by young children. Consumers do not have any objective criteria with which to judge the quality of gun safety locks. 
   My colleagues on both sides of the aisle should be able to support this amendment. The legislation does not require the use of gun safety locks. It only requires that gun safety locks meet minimum standards. The legislation does not regulate handguns. It applies only to after-market, external gun locks. 
   The Senate has been gridlocked since last July over the issue of gun control. And you can be sure that young lives have been needlessly lost due to our inaction. This legislation--which I truly believe every Senator can support--would make storing a gun in the home safer by ensuring safety devices are effective. It would empower consumers. And most importantly it would protect children and decrease the numbers of accidental shooting in this country. 
   We simply cannot stand by any longer and watch our young children fall victim to accidental shootings. We cannot hear about tragedies like the one last week in Dale City, VA without responding. This legislation is a step in the right direction, one I believe every Senator should support.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Shark Conservation Act of 2000, legislation that will significantly improve conservation and management of sharks worldwide, and establish a consistent national policy toward the practice of shark-finning. The bill would prohibit the practice of shark finning and transshipment of shark fins by U.S. vessels, set forth a process to encourage foreign governments to end this practice by their own fishing fleets, and authorize badly needed fisheries research on shark populations. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by the Ranking Member of the Commerce Committee, Senator HOLLINGS. 
   Mr. President, sharks are among the most biologically vulnerable species in the ocean. Their slow growth, late maturity and small number of offspring leave them exceptionally vulnerable to overfishing and slow to recover from depletion. At the same time, sharks, as top predators, are essential to maintaining the balance of life in the sea. While many of our other highly migratory species such as tunas and swordfish are subject to rigorous management regimes, sharks have largely been overlooked until recently. 
   The bill first amends the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act to prohibit shark finning, which is the practice of removing a shark's fins and returning the remainder of the shark to sea, and provides a rebuttable presumption that shark fins found on board a U.S. vessel were taken by finning, thus closing the transshipment loophole. National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) regulations in the Atlantic Ocean prohibit the practice of shark finning, but a nationwide prohibition does not currently exist. Shark fins comprise only a small percentage of the weight of the shark, and yet this is often the only portion of the shark retained. The Magnuson-Stevens Act and international commitments discourage unnecessary waste of fish, and thus I believe this bill ensure our domestic regulations are consistent on this point. Another goal of the Magnuson-Stevens Act--the minimization of bycatch and bycatch mortality--is an issue that I have been particularly committed to over the years. Because most of the sharks caught and finned are incidentally captured in fisheries targeting other species, I believe establishing a domestic ban will help us further reduce this type of shark mortality. 
   Mr. President, this legislation would also direct the Secretary of Commerce to initiate negotiations with foreign countries in order to encourage those countries to adopt shark finning prohibitions similar to ours. The establishment of a prohibition of shark finning by United States fishermen, or in waters subject to our jurisdiction, will not reduce finning by international fishing fleets or transshipment or landing of fins taken by these fleets. At present, foreign fleets transship or land approximately 180 metric tons of shark fins annually through ports in the Pacific alone. The global shark fin trade involves at least 125 countries, and the demand for shark fins and other shark products has driven dramatic increases in shark fishing and shark mortality around the world. 
   International measures are an absolutely critical component of achieving effective shark conservation. Under my legislation, the Secretary would be mandated to report to Congress on progress being made domestically and  internationally to reduce shark finning. Further, this legislation will establish a procedure for determining whether governments have adopted shark conservation measures which are comparable to ours through import certification procedures for sharks or shark parts. Imports of sharks or shark parts from countries that do not meet these certification procedures are prohibited. I have also included provisions which would provide technical assistance to foreign nations in an attempt to promote compliance. 
   Finally, my bill would authorize a Western Pacific longline fisheries cooperative research program to provide information for shark stock assessments, identify fishing gear and practices that prevent or minimize incidental catch of sharks and ensure maximum survivorship of released sharks, and provide data on the international shark fin trade. 
   Mr. President, the United States is a global leader in fisheries conservation and management. I believe this legislation provides us the opportunity to further this role, and take the first step in addressing an international fisheries management issue. In addition, I believe the U.S. should continue to lead efforts at the United Nations and international conventions to achieve coordinated international management of sharks, including an international ban on shark-finning. I look forward to working with Committee members on this important legislation. 
   Thank you Mr. President.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me pick up, if I may, on the comments made by the Senator from Connecticut. There is a relationship between these amendments that are proposed by Senator KENNEDY, Senator BINGAMAN, Senator DODD, and myself. They are made with great respect for the leadership of the appropriations subcommittee. I share the feelings expressed by Senator DODD that they are working within the constraints that have been imposed on them by the Congress in a sense through the budgeting process. 
   What we are asking of our colleagues is to begin a process by which we more accurately reflect the truth of the budgeting process and the choices we as Senators face. The fact is, we have the ability to provide 60 votes to waive and to proceed to make a statement as the Senate that we believe a specific priority is significant enough that we ought to depart from the constraints. The constraints under which we are operating, that were very properly and articulately listed by the Senator from Pennsylvania, are restraints imposed by a Budget Act and by allocations that do not reflect the reality of the budget choice we face as a country because of the level of surplus. Since those allocations were made, we have in fact learned that we have a significant amount of additional funds available to us to begin to choose how we will reflect the priorities of our Nation. 
   I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, a lot of us on this side of the aisle joined with them to put in place the fiscal discipline we all laud and believe is appropriate. It was a 1993 vote, in fact, that put in place the Deficit Reduction Act. Many of us are pleased that we finally were able to set this country on a course where we now have the current 
   surpluses. We have to start to be smart about what kind of choices we are going to make. 
   I keep hearing colleagues on both sides of the aisle come to the floor. They lament what is happening to children in America. They lament what is happening with respect to young people who are increasingly feeding into the juvenile justice system of the Nation. We hear the cries of anguish about children having children out of wedlock, about the failure of marriage in this country. But we don't seem to connect our legislative actions to things that really might make a difference in the lives of young people so they will choose a more moral, traditional, affirmative course for their own life. 
   How do kids make those kinds of choices? Traditionally, in the America we always hear Members talking about, we have family, which is the best teacher of all, the most important connection of a child to their future. We have schools and teachers. History in America is replete with great personalities who harken back to a particular teacher who affected their life. We hear less and less of those stories in modern America. Finally, there is organized religion. Organized religion is the other great teaching entity. Not one that we are supposed to, in this body, specifically legislate about, but it is proper to acknowledge the role that religion plays as one of those three great teachers in the lives of children. 
   The truth is, in America today we have an awful lot of young children who don't have contact with any one of those three teachers, not one. Their teachers are the streets. Colin Powell talks about it in his America's Promise, which appeals to people to make a voluntary commitment to try to intervene in the lives of some of those children and replace the absence of those three great teachers. 
   What kids learn in the streets is not the real values of America; it is what I call ``coping skills.'' They learn how to get by. They learn how to survive. They learn the sort of ``law of the jungle,'' as some used to call it. The fact is, we are not doing enough, we Senators are not doing enough, to leverage those things that make a difference in the absence of the three great teachers. 
   I ask any one of my colleagues: How do we break the cycle of a kid having a kid out of wedlock? How do we break the cycle of a child raised in an abusive household, whose role models in life are people who beat up on each other, shoot drugs, get into trouble, such as the role models for that 6-year-old kid who shot a 6-year-old classmate living in a crack house with an uncle, a parent in jail, no one responsible? 
   What is that child's future, unless adults make the decision to somehow provide those positive forces that make a difference? What are the positive forces? Well, the positive forces are often some of the faith-based interventions, whether it is the Jewish Community Center or a Baptist organization or the Catholic Charities; but there are those entities out there that have a wonderful, extraordinary capacity to bring kids back from the brink. And then there are those organized entities that also do it, such as the Boys and Girls Club; Big Brother/Big Sister; YMCA and YWCA; or a program in Boston called Youth Build, or City Year. All of these provide young people with alternatives and the ability to have surrogate parenting, fundamentally. That is what is really taking place. What is really taking place is those entities is providing an alternative. 
   Now, we will debate in the Senate whether or not we are going to provide 200,000 H-1B visas. I am for it. I think we ought to provide that, or more, because we have an immediate need in this country to provide skilled people in order to keep the economic boom going and provide for critical technologies, to have good working people. But has it not occurred to my colleagues what an insult it is to our own system that we have to go abroad and import skilled labor to the United States, even as we are putting thousands of young kids into prison, into the juvenile justice system, and out into the streets, as the Senator from Connecticut just said, because we don't have afterschool programs? What are we going to do? We are going to import 200,000 skilled people to make up for the unskilled people whom we leave unskilled because we are unwilling to make the adult choices in the Senate that would make a difference in their lives. 
   How can we boast about the extraordinary surplus we have in this country, with the stock market climbing to record levels, the most extraordinary amounts of wealth ever created in the history of any nation on the planet right here in the United States, but poverty among children has increased by 50 percent and the number of kids who are at risk has increased. 
   I don't believe in the Federal Government taking over these programs. I don't believe in Washington dictating the solutions. But I do believe in Washington leveraging the capacity of people at the local level to be able to do what they know they need to do. So we are reduced to a debate where the Senator from Pennsylvania has to say, well, oh, my gosh, under our 201(b) allocation--or whatever the appropriate section is--we don't have enough money to be able to allocate because we have a total cap that has no relationship to the reality of what we must do. 
   We keep saying, isn't it terrific that we have raised the amount of money--and it is terrific--when the real question is, are we doing what we need to do to get the job done? That is the question we ought to be asking. 
   What is it going to take to guarantee that children in the United States of  America are safe? What does it take to guarantee that we don't dump 5 million kids out into the streets in the afternoons, unsafe, and exposed to drug dealers and to all of the vagaries of the teenage years and all of the pressures that come with it in a modern society that doesn't have parents around to be able to help those kids make a better choice? We don't have to do that. We ought to make it the goal of the Senate to guarantee that every child in America is going 
   to be safe and secure between the hours when teachers stop teaching and when those parents are coming home. And we can ask 100,000 questions about why it is we are not providing arts and music and sports and libraries that are open full-time, and Internet access. 
   That is where my amendment comes in, Mr. President. Senator KENNEDY has an amendment on teacher quality, which is linked to the capacity of kids to fill those high tech jobs that we talk about. Senator DODD has an amendment talking about making those kids safe after school. My amendment seeks to increase the funding for the technology literacy challenge fund, which is a critically important education program that helps provide technology access, education, professional development, and instruction in elementary and secondary schools. 
   All we say is that to qualify for the money, States have to submit a statewide technology plan that includes a strategy on how the States will include private, State, local, and other entities in the continued financing and support of technology in schools. 
   There are two points that I can't stress enough. One is the importance of providing young people with the opportunity to learn how to use technology. I am not one of those people. I don't want to celebrate technology to the point of it being put up on a pedestal and it becomes an entity unto itself. Technology is not a god; it is not a philosophy; it is not a way of life. Technology is a tool, a useful tool. It is a critical tool for the modern marketplace and the modern world. But we are preordaining that we are going to have to have next year's H-1B plan, and the next year's H-1B plan, and another prison, and another program to deal with a whole lot of young kids for whom the digital divide becomes more and more real, who don't have accessability or the capacity to be able to gain the skills necessary to share in this new world. The fact is that there are too many teachers who don't have the ability to even teach; we have the schools wired; we have the e-rate. 
   We are beginning to get increased access to the Internet. But what do you do with it? How many teachers know how to use the technology to really be able to educate kids? How many kids are, in fact, having the benefit of the opportunity of having teachers who have those skills so that they can ultimately maximize their opportunities? 
   All we are suggesting is that we ought to be doing more to empower--not to mandate, not to dictate, but to empower--those local communities that desperately want to do this but don't have the tax base to be able to do it. Let's give them that ability. That is the best role the Federal Government can play--to leverage things that represent national priorities, leverage the things that represent the best goals and aspirations of ourselves as a Nation. It is not micromanagement; it is, rather, putting in place a mechanism by which we have national priorities--to have good, strong families, to have kids who are computer literate, and to have more skilled workers. Those are national priorities. But if we turn our heads away and say the only priority in this country is to sort of sequester this money for the senior generation in one form or another, without any regard to the generation that is coming along that needs to fund Social Security, that needs to have a high value-added job so they can pay into it and adequately protect it, that is not Social Security protection. 
   We have gone from 13 workers paying in for every 1 that is taking out--13 workers paying into the system for every 1 worker taking out--to three paying in and one taking out. Now there are two paying in and one taking out. 
   We have a vested interest as a nation in making sure those two paying in are capable of paying in; that they have a high value-added job that empowers them to pay in; when they pay in, it doesn't take so much of their income that they feel so oppressed by the system that they are not able to invest in their own children and in their own future. 
   That is in our interest. That is a national priority. 
   If we don't begin in the Senate tomorrow to adequately reflect the needs of our children in the money that we allocate, we will be seriously missing one of the greatest priorities the country faces. 
   All of us understand the degree to which there is an increase in the digital divide of the country. The technology literacy challenge fund is a critical effort to try to provide those kids with an opportunity to close that gap. 
   Last year, my home State of Massachusetts received $8.1 million. Some of the programs it put in place are quite extraordinary. Let me share with my colleagues one of the examples of this program that works so effectively. It is called the Lighthouse Technology Grant. 
   The Lighthouse Technology Grant incorporates new technologies into the State curriculum framework so that it better motivates children to be able to learn. 
   One of the schools in my State--the Lynn Woods Elementary School in Lynn--is integrating technology into the classroom by virtue of this grant. Fifth grade students at the Lynn Woods school are studying Australia. They have been able to videoconference directly with Australian students who are studying the Boston area. 
   You have students engaging in a very personal and direct way, all of which encourages their learning and enhances their interest in the topic. They have also developed writing skills through special e-mail pen pal programs with Australian students. 
   In addition, they have been able to connect more directly with the experience of life, thereby asking very direct questions and engaging in a personal exchange that they never could have experienced before because of telephone rates and because of the difficulties of communication under any kind of telephone circumstance. 
   The Lighthouse Technology Grant is only one of eight programs funded by this challenge grant in Massachusetts. It also provides grants to a virtual high school program which enables school districts to offer students Internet courses ranging from advanced academic courses to technical and specialized courses. Let me emphasize the importance of that to my colleagues. 
   A few weeks ago, I visited a high school in Boston, an inner-city high school, Dorchester High. I found that in this high school of almost 1,000 students in the inner city they are not able to provide advanced placement courses. I ask everybody here to imagine a high school that is supposed to be state of the art that doesn't have advanced placement courses. 
   Yet, because of the virtual high school and because of the access to the Internet, if we close the digital divide, we can in fact make it affordable and accessible for schools that today 
   have difficulty finding the teachers, affording the teachers, and providing the curriculum--and be able to do so immediately. 
   That is the difference between somebody being able to go to college or being college ready or being able to go to college and advance rapidly in the kinds of curriculum and courses that will make even a greater difference in their earning capacity and in their citizen-contributing capacity at a later time. We need to recognize that unless we encourage this to happen, the transformation could take a lot longer than we want it to take. 
   For example, it has taken only 7 years for the Internet to be adopted by 30 percent of Americans. That is compared to 17 years for television to be adopted by 38 percent, and for the telephone, 38 percent during the same amount of time. 
   The world of work is obviously so much different and at a faster rate. But if we leave kids behind for a longer period of time, we will greatly restrain their learning capacity as well as our growth capacity as a country. 
   The technology literacy challenge fund has been funded under the committee's mark at about $425 million. The administration actually asked for $450 million. The House has set a figure  of $517 million. I think that is more reflective of the level of funding that is necessary in order to achieve the kind of transition that we wish for in this country. Some might argue we could even do more. But it is clear to me that by measuring the priorities as expressed by other colleagues we can, in fact, do more if we will challenge the system a little bit, if we will push the limits a little bit, and if we will look at the reality of the budget choices that the Congress faces. 
   I think nothing could be more important for all of us as Senators and as Congress this year. I hope my colleagues will embrace the notion that we can in fact do an appropriate waiver of the budget and set this as a priority of the Senate. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. If the Senator from Pennsylvania wants to yield back time, I am prepared to do the same. I want to reserve one comment. 
   I appreciate everything the Senator has said. I appreciate his comments. I know he wants to do more. Unless we in the Senate tackle this beast called the allocation process, and unless we begin to challenge the constraints within which we are now dealing, we are not doing our job. 
   These votes are an opportunity to try to do that. My plea is to the Senator, the Appropriations Committee, and others, that we begin to try to change these shackles that are keeping us from responding to the real needs of the country. The measurement should not be what we are doing against a baseline set by us. The measurement should be, what will it take to guarantee we can turn to Americans and say we are addressing the problem, we are getting the job done. 
   We need to close that gap. 
   I am happy to yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to express my enthusiastic support for the amendment offered by my colleague and friend, Senator KENNEDY. Mr. President, Labor Secretary Herman summed up the challenge of today's economy when she declared at the National Skills Summit in April that in this country we have ``a skills shortage, not a labor shortage.'' 
   Right now we have the lowest unemployment rate in this country in the last 30 years. But even as we celebrate this remarkable feat--and it is remarkable--we must remember that there are still some 13 million people in this country who want, but do not have, a full-time job. The Kennedy amendment would make full-time employment a real possibility for homeless veterans, young people, and for youths seeking summer employment. 
   I appreciate that the Labor-HHS subcommittee's allocations were inadequate to fund at sufficient levels all of the programs in this legislation and I think they have done a good job with what they had to work with. But clearly Mr. President this bill retreats from our commitment to fund many critical education, training, and health programs. I am troubled that the bill before us does not adequately fund job training programs for homeless veterans. Veterans issues are especially important to me, and I know it is of great importance to my fellow veterans here in the Senate. The Kennedy amendment would allow 1,400 more veterans to receive employment placement and economic security than does the bill put forth by the Republicans. 
   This appropriations bill severely under-funds many important programs, but none more critical than the youth job programs like Job Corps, Youth Opportunity Grants program, and the Summer Jobs program. 
   Mr. President, Job Corps is the nation's largest residential education and  training program for disadvantaged youth. This program takes head on the issues and the people who have been left behind in this period of economic expansion. While many Americans enjoy unprecedented prosperity, the nation's unemployment rate among African-American teenagers is 22%, almost double the national teenage unemployment rate. Twenty-six percent of those who dropped out of high school between October 1998-99 are unemployed. We cannot relegate these people to the margins of our society, especially during this moment of great national wealth. 
   There are 120 Job Corps centers in 46 states, including three in my state of Massachusetts. Since 1964, Job Corps has given 1.7 million young people in this country the academic and vocational training they need to get good, entry-level jobs, join the military, or go to college. Job Corps offers GED or high school equivalency programs and training in various occupations, as well as advanced training and additional support services. Graduates of Job Corps go on to work in every field from automotive mechanics and repair, to business, and to health occupations. This amendment would allow Job Corps to serve more than 70,000 additional students and reduce staff turnover by offering Job Corps employees a more 
   competitive salary. 
   This amendment would also greatly increase funding for the Youth Opportunity Grants. These grants serve some of the poorest inner-city areas and Native American reservations in the country, where unemployment levels are well above the national average. Unfortunately, the Republican legislation would not allow the Department of Labor to expand this program. Last year, the Department of Labor was able to fund only 36 of 150 grants under the Youth Opportunity Grant program, two of which are in Boston and Brockton, Massachusetts. This amendment would allow the Department of Labor to fund 15-20 new grants, allowing us to provide job skills and real work experience to people who live in areas that have only heard rumors about our nation's economic growth, but have not seen it for themselves. 
   I would also like to voice my support for increasing funding by $254 million to restore cuts in the Summer Jobs program. In late March I met with 20 members of the Boston Mayor's Youth Council, who raised money to travel to Washington. We met right outside this chamber on the Senate steps. The 20 young people that I met with spoke extremely eloquently and passionately about their experiences in summer jobs programs, and they asked me to speak on their behalf in Washington in support of the Summer Jobs program. 
   Well, Mr. President, I intend to speak on their behalf. Approximately 85% of youths in the summer jobs program last year were between the ages of 14-17. Teens in that age group typically do not find private-sector work. But these young people were afforded the opportunity to learn job skills and responsibility. We have all heard teachers lament that students often greet lessons with cries of ``When are we ever going to have to use this again?'' Summer jobs make education relevant to teenagers, helping to reduce drop-out rates and fostering an interest in higher education. 
   The Workforce Investment Act consolidates the Summer Jobs program and year-round jobs program into a comprehensive system of services for at-risk, low-income youth. But under the bill before us, 13,000 teens will be eliminated from this program. The Kennedy amendment would add back $254 million, allowing us the opportunity to provide summer jobs to 152,400 low-income students, 85% of whom would not otherwise be able to find summer employment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I don't want to end today without pointing out the importance of this amendment to our national trade policy. I believe very strongly in free trade. I know that the Trade and Development Act that we passed earlier this year and granting PNTR to China--if we ever get the chance to debate it in the Senate--will grow Massachusetts's economy and produce long-term benefits for workers in Massachusetts and across the country. But the budget put forth by the Republicans takes no responsibility for protecting those who are most at risk for being left behind. This amendment does claim that responsibility. As we continue with our push to open new markets, we have got to ensure those who lack the skills, the income or the education to get quality jobs can have an opportunity to succeed in the new economy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my amendment seeks to address the digital divide that all of us are aware is significantly handicapping the capacity of a lot of Americans to participate in the new marketplace. The House of Representatives has recognized this problem to the tune of $517 million. In our budget, we are only at $425 million. We are going to vote in the Senate on the H-1B visa, allowing 200,000-plus people to be imported into this country because of our lack of commitment to our own citizens in developing their skills for the new marketplace. 
   This is an opportunity to make it clear that, for teachers and their ability to be able to teach, for virtual high school capacity to have advanced placement, in order to enhance the ability of our young to learn the new marketplace skills and to close the digital divide, we need to make this commitment. 
   I think everybody in the Senate knows that with this surplus, with our ability to be able to make the choices we have in the budget, we have allowed for a waiver of the budget precisely for this kind of moment. I ask my colleagues to join me in saying the House of Representatives will not have a better sense of this priority than the Senate.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to join the City of Boston, the residents of Massachusetts, and members of the law enforcement community across the country in recognizing the loss of Paul McLaughlin. Paul was a committed prosecutor who lived his life for others, and on September 25, 1995, he was shot while getting into his car after work. This weekend Boston memorializes its loss with the dedication of the Paul McLaughlin Boys and Girls Club in Dorchester's Savin Hill neighborhood and I join the city in this important day of recognition. 
   Paul came from a long, distinguished line of Bostonians. His grandfather, Edward Sr., was the Boston Fire Commissioner as well as a member of the State Legislature in the 1920's, and his father, Edward Jr., was President of the Boston City Council, an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Lt. Governor under Governor Volpe. A graduate of Boston Latin School, Dartmouth College and Suffolk Law School, Paul was admitted to the bar in 1981 and his early work included time at the Cambridge District Court and the Public Protection Bureau. Paul was the consummate professional, and his reputation soon led to serving on the Attorney General's staff in 1991, where he was assigned to drug and gang cases in Suffolk Superior Court. During one five year stretch he compiled an impressive 73 percent conviction rate, winning 98 of 134 Superior Court cases. 
   In a fitting tribute to Paul's commitment to working for a better community for all of us, especially our children, the site for the McLaughlin Boys and Girls Club is one of Boston's Ten Most Wanted drug houses. On Saturday, June 24th, the McLaughlin Family joined with Mayor Thomas M. Menino and members of the Colonel Daniel Marr Boys & Girls Club in honoring Paul's life by opening a remarkable new facility in his name in Dorchester's Savin Hill neighborhood. The Paul R. McLaughlin Youth Center will perpetuate Paul's legacy of selfless service to his community by serving 2,600 children in one of the state's most successful youth programs. The structure that used to be the source of drugs and despair will now be a beacon of hope for the whole city. 
   Mr. President, I join the people of Dorchester, West Roxbury and Jamaica Plain in mourning the loss of their neighbor and friend. My thoughts go out to Paul's colleagues, friends and family. Together, we realize how fortunate we are to have worked with and known an individual of his caliber. Today the City of Boston memorializes this loss, and I join everyone in honoring his life by opening the Paul R. McLaughlin Youth Center.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to spend a few minutes today talking about the importance of the Department of Labor's ergonomics regulation, which seeks to protect the health and safety of American workers. I'd like to urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment proposed by Senator ENZI that would prevent the Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration from issuing any standard or regulation addressing ergonomics concerns in the workplace. 
   Mr. President, let's be very clear about the issue before us, about the ergonomics issue, about employer health and safety, about the number of people nationwide--600,000 each year--that suffer from musculoskeletal injuries. In my state of Massachusetts, last year nearly 21,000 workers suffered serious injuries from repetitive motion and overexertion. Mr. President, if this amendment were to be passed by this body, then hundreds of thousands of people will continue to needlessly suffer on the job. The solution to this problem is NOT doing nothing, Mr. President, and that is what the Enzi amendment purports to do. Ergonomics injuries are real. They are prevalent in the workplace. And we must respond to this treacherous workplace hazard. 
   Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population. Mr. President, the scientific community understands that effective and successful ergonomics programs assure high productivity, avoidance of illness and injury risks, and increased satisfaction among the workforce. Ergonomics disorders include sprains and strains, which affect the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, or spinal discs; repetitive stress injuries, that are typically not the result of any instantaneous or acute event, but are usually chronic in nature, and precipitated by poorly designed work environments; and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   Many businesses, both large and small, have already responded to the threat of ergonomics injuries in the workplace. Mr. President, when businesses ensure that their workplaces are safe and protect workers from these types of injuries, their productivity rises! When workers are healthy, employers lose far fewer hours in productivity. Last year Assistant Secretary of Labor Charles Jeffress testified before the House Committee on Small Business and he reported that programs implemented by individual employers reduce total job-related injuries and illnesses by an average of 45 percent and lost work time and illnesses by an average of 75 percent. Mr. President, these numbers mean something, they indicate results, and they prove that making the workplace safe is crucial to increasing worker safety. But let me explain what these numbers really mean. 
   Beth Piknik is a registered nurse at the Cape Cod hospital. Ms. Piknik's 21-year career as an intensive care unit nurse was cut short due to a preventable back injury. On February 17, 1992, she suffered a back injury while assisting a patient. The injury required major surgery--spinal fusion--and two years of major rehabilitation before and after surgery. The injury was devastating to Ms. Piknik, both professionally and personally. Prior to her injury, Beth led a very active life, enjoying competitive racquetball, water-skiing, and white-water rafting. But most importantly, she enjoyed her work as an ICU nurse, which had been her career since 1971. The loss of her ability to take care of patients led to a clinical depression, which lasted four and a half years. She now administers TB tests to employees at the hospital. Her ability to take care of patients--the reason she became a nurse--is gone. Ms. Piknik's injury could have been prevented and so can the crippling injuries suffered by hundreds of thousands of workers every year. 
   In fact, many employers have already taken action and put into place workplace ergonomics programs to prevent these injuries. For example, the Crane Paper Company in Massachusetts had a serious problem with ergonomics injuries. In 1990, they put in place an ergonomics program to identify and control hazards, to train workers and provide medical management to intervene before workers developed serious injuries. These efforts paid off. Within 3 years of starting their ergonomics programs, Crane reduced their ergonomic injury rate by more than 40 percent. 
   Mr. President, the Department of Labor took public comments on the proposed ergonomics regulation through 90 days of written comments and nine weeks of public hearings. During the hearings, OSHA heard from hundreds of workers and local union members and representatives from eighteen international unions. These workers and union members--who represent all sectors of the economy including auto workers, nurses and nurses aides, poultry workers, teachers and teachers aides, cashiers, office workers--told OSHA why an ergonomics standard is desperately needed and how ergonomics programs in their workplaces have worked to prevent injuries. I would like to share with my colleagues a couple of statements from some of the workers from my state of Massachusetts who appeared at the hearings. 
   This is what Nancy Foley, who is a journalist from South Hadley, MA, had to say at one of the hearings. ``I am here today to strongly support an ergonomic standard. I suffer from serious injuries caused by a repetitive job. I want to see the ergonomics standard enacted so that others will not be injured as I have been. In 1988 I earned a masters degree in journalism from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Most of my career was spent at the Union-News in Springfield, Massachusetts. As a reporter, I spent four to five hours a day typing on a computer keyboard. In 1993, I began having pain in my neck and weakness in my hands. I did not seek medical attention until 1995 when the pain had spread into my left shoulder and left arm, making it difficult for me to sit through the workday. Fear prevented me from seeking medical attention sooner. I was a part-time reporter, and I was afraid I would never be made full-time if my employer knew the job was hurting me. Even after seeking medical attention, I was afraid to go out of work to recover from the injuries. I thought that taking time out of work would hurt my career. In October 1998, I went out of work altogether and was never able to return. I settled my workers' compensation case in 1999, with the insurance company taking responsibility for my injuries and continuing medical payments. I have been diagnosed with repetitive strain injury, carpal tunnel syndrome, cervical strain, thoracic outlet syndrome, and medial epicondylitis. By the time I left the newspaper I was so severely injured, that my recovery has been very slow. I may never fully recover. I live with chronic pain every day. Sitting still triggers pain. I have trouble carrying groceries into my house and doing simple housekeeping tasks. I am trying to retrain to be a schoolteacher, but my injuries make the retraining difficult. I do my school work by lying in bed and talking into a voice-activated computer. That is the way I wrote this 
   statement.'' 
   Mr. President, these are the real voices, the real people, the reality behind the 600,000 injuries. Unfortunately, gauging from the debate so far today my colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem uninterested in talking about how devastating musculoskeletal injuries are. They are content to lambaste the Department of Labor and OSHA. They are content to nitpick at the rulemaking process, Mr. President, because they are incapable of refuting the proposed rule on its merit. They cannot deny that 600,000 a year suffer from musculoskeletal injuries. They cannot deny that workplaces that have adopted good ergonomics policies have increased productivity. 
   Let's be clear about this Mr. President. These types of injuries are a real problem for American businesses and workers. Industry experts have estimated that injuries and illnesses caused by ergonomics hazards are the biggest job safety problem in the workplace today. The 600,000 workers who suffer from back injuries, tendinitis, and other ergonomics disorders cost over $20 billion annually in worker compensation.  
   What is most troubling to me, Mr. President, is that these types of injuries are preventable. Something can be done to protect the American worker. In drafting this proposed rule OSHA worked extensively with a number of stakeholders, including representatives from industry, labor, safety, and health organizations, State governments, trade associations, and insurance companies. OSHA is currently in the process of holding stakeholder meetings on the draft rule for all interested parties. These comments are made part of the rulemaking record and OSHA is required to review these comments as the final rule is prepared. Just a few months ago, OSHA's small business liaison met with small business representatives in an open roundtable format. Mr. President, this is not a ``command and control'' regulatory action. 
   Mr. President, this proposed rule has been criticized by those on the other side of the aisle as unfair, unnecessary, and prohibitively costly for businesses. I disagree. The proposed rule is drafted as an interactive approach between employee and manager to protect the assets of the company in ways that are either already being done, or should be done under existing rules. This new rule is a guide and a tool, not an inflexible mandate. 
   The rule is a flexible standard that allows employers to tailor their programs to their individual workplaces. Small employers are not expected to have the same kind of program as big employers. The proposed rule exempts small businesses from record keeping requirements, so it does not add to small businesses paperwork burdens. Moreover, OSHA is reaching out to small businesses to provide them information on how to control ergonomics hazards through meetings and conferences and by providing on-site compliance assistance. 
   According to the Department of Labor, thirty-two states have some form of safety and health program. Four states (Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Washington) have mandated comprehensive programs that have core elements similar to those in OSHA's draft proposal. In these four states, injury and illness rates fell by nearly 18 percent over the five years after implementation, in comparison with national rates over the same period. We are not talking about something that has come out of the blue--ergonomics programs are creating positive results for workers all over the country. 
   Mr. President, in spite of the arguments for the Enzi amendment, there bulk of the science and the research proves that an ergonomic standard is needed in the American workplace. 
   The National Academy of Sciences has compiled a report entitled Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders. This report summarized 6,000 scientific studies on ergonomics-related injuries and concluded that the current state of science reveals that workers exposed to ergonomic hazards have a higher level of pain, injury and disability, that there is a biological basis for these injuries, and that there exist today interventions to prevent these injuries. 
   In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health completed a critical review of epidemiologic evidence for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and lower back. This critical review of 600 studies culled from a bibliographic database of more than 2,000 found that there is substantial evidence for a causal relationship between physical work factors and musculoskeletal disorders. 
   Furthermore, Mr. President, we are not talking about a new phenomenon, or the latest fad. Ten years ago in 1990 under a Republican President, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole committed the Department of Labor to begin working on an ergonomics standard. Then-Secretary Dole was responding to a growing body of evidence that showed that repetitive stress disorders, such as carpal tunnel syndrome, were the fastest growing category of occupational illnesses. This rulemaking has been almost ten years in the making. Mr. President, it is time to put safeguards in place for the American worker, and this should not be a partisan issue. 
   This rule has been delayed for far too long. In 1996, the Senate and the House agreed to language in an appropriations conference report that would prevent OSHA from developing an ergonomics standard in FY 1997. In 1997, Congress prevented OSHA from spending any of its FY 1998 budget on promulgating an ergonomics standard. Last year, money in the FY 1999 budget was set aside for the new National Academy of Sciences study, and the then-Chairman and Ranking Members of the House Appropriations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, stating that this study ``was not intended to block or delay OSHA from moving forward with its ergonomics standard.'' 
   Mr. President, we should wait no longer for this standard to be proposed and we should certainly not prevent OSHA from issuing its final ergonomics rule. Workers should not have to wait any longer for safety on the job. The time to protect the American workplace is now. 
   This standard is a win-win for workers and management: the greater the safety workers have on the job, the more time they spend on the job. The more time they spend on the job, the more productive the workplace. And it is obvious, but it bears restating, that the more productive the workplace, the more productive this country. Workers want to be at work, and their bosses want them at work. 
   It's been 10 years, Mr. President, since Secretary Dole promised to take action to protect workers from ergonomics injuries and to issue an ergonomics standard. Since that time, more than 6.1 million workers have suffered from serious injuries as a result of ergonomics hazards--injuries that could have and should have been prevented. Workers have waited too long for protections from ergonomics hazards. It's time to stop breaking the promises made to American workers and to support the promulgation of a final OSHA ergonomics standard not to protect workers.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have followed the issue of narcotrafficking and other international crimes for years, particularly during my tenure as chairman of the Subcommittee on International Operations, Narcotics and Terrorism. Although I have many concerns about this piece of legislation, I believe we have a chance here to provide support to a Colombian administration trying to address its largest problem--drug trafficking. 
   The line between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency is not at all clear in Colombia, but we cannot let this stop our extension of aid. Withholding aid is not an option. In doing so, we would send the message to Colombia, our important ally in the war on drugs, that when the going gets tough, they must go it alone. We must be very clear: the terrible human rights conditions in Colombia are inextricably tied to the narcoterrorists. That won't change overnight with our support of this assistance package, but it won't change at all without our help. And just as important as our support for this package will be our continuing oversight of its implementation. If human rights abuses continue, or if we begin to get embroiled in the counterinsurgency efforts, the Senate must remain vigilant, ending the program if necessary. But we cannot simply turn our backs and walk away. 
   Civil conflict in Colombia has worn on for half a century as the government has fought narcoterrorists for control of the country. Opposition groups such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia [FARC] and the National Liberation Army has made a business of guerrilla warfare and continue to terrorize the civilian population. Paramilitary groups, formed in the 1980's as anti-guerrilla forces, have resorted to many of the same terror tactics. Opposition and paramilitary groups control much of the country and the vast majority of the drug producing areas. It is clear that drug money fuels the fighting. In the last decade, this conflict has claimed over 35,000 lives and has created a population of over a million and a half internally displaced persons. 
   Colombian President Andres Pastrana, in sharp contrast to his recent predecessor, is trying to improve human rights conditions and promote democracy, under extremely difficult conditions. Under Pastrana, the Colombian Government has begun the first peace talks ever with the FARC. Though the talks have been slow moving and have encountered setbacks,  Pastrana has clearly made the peace process a top priority. 
   Plan Colombia was developed by President Pastrana as a comprehensive approach to strengthening the Colombian economy and promoting democracy, with heavy emphasis on fighting drug trafficking. In my view, any successful approach to Colombia's myriad of problems will require a strong counterdrug effort. The United States contribution to Plan Colombia, as proposed by the administration, does this. 
   Let us be clear, however, that the drug trade in Colombia is not simply a Colombian problem. The United States is the largest and most reliable market for the Colombian cocaine and heroin that is at the center of this conflict. We have approximately 5.8 million cocaine users and 1.4. 
   million heroin users. Based on the most recent National Household Survey on Drug Abuse estimates, fourteen million Americans are current drug users. Clearly we are making a large contribution to the problem and should therefore contribute to finding a solution. 
   The United States must seize the opportunity presented by President Pastrana's current efforts to fight drug trafficking and bring stability to Colombia. This legislation offers us a chance to play a constructive role in Colombia while simultaneously promoting American interests. 
   The Plan addresses the major components of the problem. ``Push into Southern Colombia'' is designated to affect the major growing and production areas in the South. It provides for the training of special dedicated narcotics battalions, and the purchase of helicopters for troop transport and interdiction. To complement this effort, interdiction tools will also be upgraded, including aircraft, airfields, early warning radar and intelligence gathering. The Plan also provides increased funding for eradication of coca and poppy, and the promotion of alternative crop development and employment. Perhaps most importantly, the Plan calls for and provides resources for increasing protection of human rights, expanding the rule of law, and promoting the peace process. 
   As I outlined earlier, Colombia's situation is bleak, and this may be its last chance to begin to dig its way out. If we fail to support aid to Colombia, we can only sit back and watch it deteriorate even further. This Plan presents a unique opportunity to support the Colombian Government's effort to address its problems while at the same time promoting U.S. interests. The Colombian Government, despite immense obstacles, has begun to address significant human rights concerns and is working to instill the rule of law and democratic institutions. Though the United States is not in the business of fighting insurgents, we are in the business of fighting drugs, and this is clearly an opportunity to work with a willing partner in doing so. 
   While I support a United States contribution to helping Colombia, I believe that if we are going to commit, we must do so in the context of an ongoing process under constant review to respond to changing needs. 
   My first concern is the fine line that exists between counternarcotics and counterinsurgency operations, particularly since they are so intertwined in Colombia. It is impossible to attack drug trafficking in Colombia without seriously undercutting the insurgents' operations. We must acknowledge that the more involved in Colombia's counternarcotics efforts we become the more we will become involved in its counterinsurgency, regardless of our intentions to steer clear of it. But, because the drug trade is the most destabilizing factor in Colombia, our cooperation with the government will over the long run, advance the development and expansion of democracy, and will limit the insurgents' ability to terrorize the civilian population. But our military involvement in Colombia should go no further than this. Efforts to limit number of personnel are designed to address this. 
   I appreciate the concerns expressed by my colleagues that the United States contribution to Plan Colombia 
   is skewed in favor of the military, but we must keep in mind that our contribution is only a percentage of the total Plan. The total Plan Colombia price tag is approximately $7.5 billion. The Colombian Government has already committed $4 billion to the Plan, and has secured donations and loans from the International Monetary Fund, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank, the Andean Development Corporation, and the Latin American Reserve Fund. As part of our contribution, and to balance military aid, the United States must continue to support Colombian requests for additional funding from international financial institutions and other EU donors. We must also continue to implement stringent human rights vetting and end-use monitoring agreements, and make sure that our Colombia policy does not end with the extension of aid. 
   Second, I am concerned that even if the Plan is successful at destroying coca production and reducing the northward flow of drugs, large numbers of coca farmers will be displaced, worsening the current crisis of internally displaced people in Colombia. Colombia has the largest population of internally displaced persons in the world, estimated at over one and half million in November 1999. Seventy percent of those displaced are children, and the vast majority of them no longer attend school. There is every indication that as Plan Colombia is implemented, this population may grow. This problem underscores the importance of supporting the Colombians in their efforts to secure economic aid for alternative development. Unless we strongly support loans and additional donations, the danger remains that desperate farmers will simply move across the borders into Peru and Bolivia, and undo all the eradication progress that has been made in those areas. 
   My third major concern with respect to this aid package is that it does not adequately address Colombia's human rights problem. The Colombian Government has made a real effort to address human rights and to promote the rule of law. Pastrana has worked to root out members of the military who have committed gross violations of human rights, and has suspended a number of high-level officers. He has also attacked corruption in the legislature, and has come under heavy fire for doing so. Despite this progress, there is no question that recent events in Colombia have raised some cause for concern. The Colombian Government's unfortunate decision to send back to the legislature a bill to criminalize genocide and forced disappearance was a significant setback for the promotion of human rights and the rule of law. I would like to commend my colleagues on the Foreign Operations Subcommittee for bolstering the human rights component of this legislation. In addition to requiring additional reporting from the Secretary of State on the human rights practices of the Colombian security forces, Senator LEAHY's provisions for human rights programs in the Colombian police and judiciary, a witness protection program and additional human rights monitors in our embassy and Bogota, and Senator HARKIN's provision to provide $5 million to Colombian NGOs to protect child soldiers, demonstrate our commitment to improving the human rights situation. 
   Despite my reservations, the potential benefits of this plan are too large to ignore. In light of the changes made by the committee, I believe the plan can help advance United States interests by reducing drug trafficking and thereby promoting stability and democracy in Colombia. We must now work 
   to ensure that our concerns do not become realities. Recognizing that we are not the sole contributors to this Plan, we must support Colombia's requests for additional aid from our allies, and work closely with them to ensure that additional aid complements our efforts in the areas of human rights and strengthening the rule of law. The committee report recognizes the importance of reducing the drug trade first to build confidence among the Colombian people that progress can be made in other important areas such as economic development and democracy. 
   Plan Colombia's counterdrug focus will also benefit the United States by reducing the flow of drugs to the United States. The United States is faced with a serious drug problem which must be attacked at both ends--supply and demand. Our consideration of counterdrug aid to Colombia should force us to look inward, reexamine our domestic counterdrug plan, and find ways strengthen it.  
   The United States has long been the cocaine traffickers' largest and most reliable market, fueling continued and expanded cultivation and production. Without addressing the problem here at home, we present no reason to expect that the growers and traffickers will not continue to shift their operations to maintain access to their best market. 
   Increasing funding and expanding drug treatment and prevention programs are absolutely imperative if we are to coordinate an effective counterdrug campaign, particularly if we are to expect any real improvement in the situation in Colombia. Levels of drug abuse in the United States have remained unacceptably high, despite stepped-up interdiction efforts and increased penalties for drug offenders. 
   Our criminal justice system is flooded with drug offenders. Three-quarters of all prisoners can be characterized as alcohol or drug involved offenders. An estimated 16 percent of convicted jail inmates committed their offense to get money for drugs, and approximately 70 percent of prisoners were actively involved with drugs prior to their incarceration. 
   America's drug problem is not limited to our hardened criminals. The 1997 National Household Survey revealed that 77 million, or 36 percent of Americans aged 12 and older reported some use of an illicit drug at least once in their lifetime. The statistics in U.S. high schools are even more disturbing. According to a 1998 study by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, 54 percent of high school seniors reported that they had used an illicit drug at least once and 41.4 percent reported use of an illicit drug within the past year. 
   As we support Colombia's efforts to attack the sources of illegal drugs, we need to make sure we are addressing our own problems. According to recent estimates, approximately five million drug users needed immediate treatment in 1998 while only 2.1 million received it. It was also found that some populations--adolescents, women with small children, and racial and ethnic minorities--are badly underserved by treatment programs. Only 37 percent of substance-abusing mothers of minors received treatment in 1997. Drug offenders, when released from jail, are often not ready or equipped to deal with a return to social pressures and many return to their old habits if they are not provided with effective treatment while incarcerated and the social safety net they so desperately need upon release. 
   It is clear that drug treatment works, and there is no excuse for the high numbers of addicts who have been unable to receive treatment. As we increase funding for supply reduction programs in Colombia, we must increase funding for treatment to balance and complement it. Drug research has made significant strides in recent years, and there are a variety of treatment options now available to help even the most hardcore addicts. These treatments have been successful in the lab studies. Now we must allow these methods to be successful in helping the population for whom they were developed. Access to drug abuse treatment in the United States is abysmal when compared to the resources we have to provide it. 
   The administration's Office of National Drug Control Policy argues that a balanced approach that addresses both demand reduction and cutting off supply at the source is necessary to significantly reduce drug abuse in America. While Plan Colombia works to cut off the drug supply, we must balance that with increased funding for drug abuse prevention and better treatment programs that reach more of the population that so desperately needs it. 
   Plan Colombia is an opportunity to help an important ally attack the sources of illegal drug production reduce the flow of cocaine and heroin to the United States. The United States must stay engaged with the Pastrana government and support its critical efforts to combat drug trafficking. Instead of being limited by our reservations, we must use them to carefully craft a policy that addresses economic development, political stability, human rights and the rule of law. Drug trafficking is the major obstacle to the advancement of these goals, and it must be curbed if any progress is to be made in our drug war at home.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am honored to rise today and pay tribute to a public servant who has selflessly contributed his legal knowledge and experience to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and its residents for almost 50 years. Today, the Honorable Neil L. Lynch, Associate Justice of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, gathers with this friends and family to celebrate a career marked by military service, a devotion to family, and a true love of the law. 
   Beginning in 1952 with his service as a First Lieutenant Adjutant in the 42nd Air Rescue Squadron of the United States Air Force, Justice Lynch set a standard of achievement and professionalism that would carry him to the pinnacle of the legal profession. After working at Hale, Sanderson, Byrne & Morton, he began teaching at the new England School of Law. He served as Chief Legal Counsel and Secretary-Treasurer at the Massachusetts Port Authority, worked again in the private sector with Herlihy & O'Brian, then return to New England School of law as a Professor of Law. 
   Judge Lynch's skills and understanding of the law were well known in Massachusetts by the 1970's, and few were surprised when Governor Ed King appointed him to be his Chief Legal Counsel from 1979 to 1981. This ascension was completed by the Governor's nomination of Justice Lynch for a seat on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, a position he has held with unquestioned professionalism and integrity since 1981. 
   While a member of the Court, Justice Lynch has reached out to all levels of law enforcement in an effort to pool and maximize the considerable knowledge and resources amongst his peers. As Dean and President of the Flaschner Judicial Institute, Justice Lynch oversaw a professional enhancement program that shares information on new initiatives and changes in the field with his colleagues, he returned to academia to teach at the Massachusetts School of Law, and issued the landmark study, ``Commission to Study Racial and Ethnic Bias in the Courts,'' in 1994. 
   Now, instead of navigating through complex legal issues, Justice Lynch will be navigating his beloved ``Sui Generis'' through the waterways of the East Coast. He leaves the court to spend more time with Kathleen and his family and their growing number of grandchildren. Mr. President, I join all of justice Lynch's colleagues, past and present, and all of the people he has touched in the course of his professional life, in thanking him for his dedication to justice and equality under the law.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator COLLINS in introducing the Equal Access to Medicare Home Health Care Act. This legislation will protect patient access to home health care under Medicare, and ensure that providers are able to continue serving seniors who reside in medically underserved areas. 
   Medicare was enacted in 1965, under the leadership of President Lyndon Johnson, as a promise to the American people that, in exchange for their years of hard work and service to our country, their health care would be protected in their golden years. Today, over 30 million seniors rely on the Medicare home health benefit to receive the care they need to maintain their independence and remain in their own homes, and to avoid the need for more costly hospital or nursing home care. 
   Home health care is critical. It is a benefit to which all eligible Medicare beneficiaries, regardless of where they live, should be entitled. But, this benefit is being seriously undermined. Since enactment of the Balanced Budget Act, BBA, of 1997, federal funding for home health care has plummeted. According to the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, Medicare spending on home health care dropped 45 percent in the last two fiscal years--from $17.5 billion in 1998 to $9.7 billion in 1999--far beyond the original amount of savings sought by the BBA. Across the country, these cuts have forced over 2,500 home health agencies to close and over 500,000 patients to lose their services. 
   In my own State of Massachusetts--a state that, because of economic efficiency, sustained a disproportionate share of the BBA cuts in Medicare home health funding--28 home health agencies have closed, 6 more have turned in their Medicare provider numbers and chosen to opt out of the Medicare program, and 12 more have been forced to merge in order to consolidate their limited resources. The home health agencies that have continued to serve patients despite the deep cuts in Medicare funding reported net operating losses of $164 million in 1998. The loss of home health care providers in Massachusetts has cost 10,000 patients access to home health services. Consequently, many of the most vulnerable residents in my state are being forced to enter hospitals and nursing homes, or going without any help at all. 
   To compound the problem, without Congressional action, Medicare payments for home health care will be automatically cut by an additional 15 percent next year. It is critical that we defend America's seniors against future cuts in home health services, and this bill will eliminate the additional 15 percent cut in Medicare home health payments mandated by the BBA. However, we must do more than attempt to stop future cuts. Indeed, it is equally as important that we begin to provide relief to home health providers who are already struggling to care for patients. 
   During the first year of implementation of the Interim Payment System, IPS, thousands of home health care agencies incurred overpayments because they were not notified of their per beneficiary limits until long after the limits were imposed. The provisions of this bill would extend the repayment period for IPS overpayments without interest for three years, and thereafter at an interest rate lower than currently mandated. 
   Under IPS, even agencies which did not incur overpayments were placed on precarious financial footing because of insufficient payments, particularly for high-cost and long-term patients. Accordingly, it is critical that we bolster the efforts of all home health care providers to transcend their current operating deficits, especially as they transition from the Interim Payment System to the Prospective Payment System, PPS. 
   The BBA specified that, in aggregate, PPS payments to home health providers must equal IPS payments. This adjustment--the budget neutrality factor--is expected to reduce PPS payments for home health services by 22 percent below the average Medicare costs prior to enactment of the BBA. In order to provide relief to home health providers in this budget neutral context, the Equal Access to Medicare Home Health Care Act would establish a 10 percent add-on to the episodic base payment for patients in rural areas, to reflect the increasing costs of travel, and a ``reasonable cost'' add-on for security services utilized by providers in our urban areas. These add-ons ensure that patients in our medically underserved communities continue to receive the home care they need and deserve. 
   Finally, this legislation would encourage the incorporation of telehealth technology in home care plans by allowing cost reporting of the telemedicine services utilized by agencies. Telemedicine has demonstrated tremendous potential in bringing modern health care services to patients who reside in areas where providers and technology are scarce. Cost reporting will provide the data necessary to develop a fair and reasonable Medicare reimbursement policy for telehomecare and  bring the benefits of modern science and technology to our nation's underserved. 
   Unless we increase the federal commitment to the Medicare home health care benefit, we can only expect to continue to imperil the health of an entire generation. We must act to deliver on that promise that President Johnson made 25 years ago--our nation's seniors deserve no less.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am joining colleagues on both sides of the aisle to introduce the American Community Renewal and New Markets Empowerment Act. Demonstrating that Congress can constructively work together and find common ground, we--Senators LIEBERMAN, TORRICELLI, KOHL, SANTORUM, ABRAHAM, and HUTCHINSON--unveiled a plan that creates economic incentives to help close America's wealth gap. Among many important initiatives, our plan includes my new markets legislation that I introduced last September, S. 1594, the Community Development and Venture Capital Act, and full funding for Round II of Empowerment Zones. 
   This plan builds on the President's and Speaker's agreement by securing full, mandatory funding for Massachusett's Empowerment Zone. So far, the money has dribbled in--only $6.6 million of the $100 million authorized over ten years--and made it impossible for the city to implement a plan for economic self-sufficiency. Some 80 public and private entities, from universities to technology companies to banks to local government, showed incredible community spirit and committed to matching the EZ money, eight to one. Let me say it another way--these groups agreed to match the $100 million in Federal Empowerment Zone money with $800 million. Yet, regrettably, in spite of this incredible alliance, the city of Boston has not been able to tap into that leveraged money and implement the strategic plan because Congress hasn't held its part of the bargain. I am extremely pleased that we were able to work together and find a way to provide full, steady funding to these zones. That money means education, daycare, transportation and basic health care in areas--in Massachusetts that includes 57,000 residents who live in Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattipan--where almost 50 percent of the children are living in poverty and nearly half the residents over 25 don't even have a high school diploma. 
   Mr. President, this bill also includes an initiative that I introduced last year called the Community Development and Venture Capital Act. Its purpose is to stimulate economic development through public-private partnerships that invest venture capital in smaller businesses that are located in impoverished rural and urban areas, known as new markets, or that employ low-income people. We call these areas new markets because of the overlooked business opportunities. According to Michael Porter, a respected professor at Harvard and business analyst who has written extensively on competitiveness, ``..... inner cities are the largest underserved market in America, with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.'' 
   Both innovative and fiscally sound, my new markets initiative is financially structured similar to Small Business Administration (SBA's), successful Small Business Investment Company (SBIC), program, and incorporates a technical assistance component similar to that successfully used in SBA's microloan program. However, unlike the SBIC program which focuses solely on small businesses with high-growth potential and claims successes such as Staples and Calaway Golf, the New Markets Venture Capital program will focus on smaller businesses that show promise of financial and social returns, such as jobs--what we call a ``double bottomline.'' 
   To get at the complex and deep-rooted economic problems in new market areas, my initiative has three parts: a venture capital program to funnel investment money into our poorest communities, a program to expand the number of venture capital firms that are devoted to investing in such communities, and a mentoring program to link established, successful businesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in stagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve. 
   What I'm trying to do as Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, and have been working with the SBA to achieve, is expand investment in our neediest communities by building on the economic activity created by loans. I think one of the most effective ways to do that is to spur venture capital investment in our neediest communities. 
   But, Mr. President, this bill even goes further than funding empowerment zones and establishing incentives to attract venture capital into distressed communities. It enhances education opportunities, creates individual development accounts to help low-income families save and invest in their future, increases affordable housing, improves access to technology in our classrooms and creates incentives to help communities remediate brownfields. 
   Before closing, I want to thank my colleauges for working so hard on this compromise and for their admirable willingness to put aside our differences for a larger purpose.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in October 1998, I stood on the steps of the U.S. Capitol Building at a candlelight vigil for Matthew Shepard, the young gay man who was beaten and left for dead on a lonely Wyoming roadway. Two thugs were arrested, charged and convicted of murdering Matthew Shepard because of his sexual orientation. Tens of thousands of people--gay and straight, black and white, young and old, Americans all--came to the Capitol with only a few hours notice to encourage the passage of a Federal hate crimes law. 
   The evening was memorable. We expressed our passionate conviction and knowledge that there is no room in our country for the kind of vicious, terrible, pathetic, ignorant hatred that took the life of Matthew Shepard, or of James Byrd, or of Barry Winchell, or of Brandon Teena. And the Congress responded. We came close to extending the federal hate crimes law that year, but the provision was dropped in conference. 
   So, we came back again to guarantee that crimes will not be tolerated when they are motivated by other people's limitations. We are here to reaffirm that hate crimes are indeed an insult to our civilization. We are here for once and for all to make certain that there will be no period of indifference, as there was initially when the country ignored the burning of black churches or overlooked the spray-painted swastikas in synagogues; or suggested that the undiluted lethal hatred is someone else's problem, some other community's responsibility. 
   We must accept the national responsibility for fighting hate crimes and commit--each of us in our words, in our hearts and in our actions--to insure that the lesson of Matthew Shepard and scores of others is not forgotten. Mr. President, I understand that we cannot legislate racism and hatred out of existence, but we can empower our local law enforcement officials to prosecute hate crimes. And we can empower our local communities to be free of violence and fear brought about by hate crimes. 
   Look to the 58 high schools in my own beautiful, progressive state of Massachusetts where 22 percent of gay students say they skip school because they feel unsafe there and fully 31 percent of gay students had been threatened or actually physically attacked for being gay. Matthew Shepard is not the exception to the rule--his tragic death is rather the extreme example of what happens on a daily basis in our schools, on our streets and in our communities. That is why we have an obligation to pass laws that make clear our determination to root out this hatred. 
   And today we will have carried the day in passing the Kennedy-Smith amendment. 
   It is my belief that Americans always act when confronted by an inherently unethical wrong. They stare down those who want us to live in fear and declare boldly that we will not live in a country where private prejudice undermines public law. 
   American heroes such as Martin Luther King did this when he preached in Birmingham and Memphis, when he thundered his protest and assuaged those who feared his dreams. He taught us to look hatred in the face and overcome it. Harvey Milk did this in San Francisco, when he brushed aside hatred, suspicion, fear and death threats to serve his city. Even as he foretold his own assassination, Harvey Milk prayed that ``if a bullet should enter my brain, let that bullet destroy every closet door.'' He knew that true citizenship belongs only to an enlightened people, unwavered by passion or prejudice--and it exists in a country which recognizes no one particular aspect of humanity before another. 
   Mr. President, we must root out hatred wherever we find it, whether on Laramie Road in Wyoming, or on a back road in Jasper, Texas, or in the Shenandoah National Park. That kind of hatred is the real enemy of our civilization. The day is here, Mr. President, when we can rightly celebrate our passage of this amendment to the hate crime prevention act to treat all Americans equally and with dignity, to allow all Americans to enjoy the inalienable rights framed in the Declaration of Independence--the rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. 
   This indeed will be a happy day.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today's vote on hate crimes legislation marks a monumental day in our history. The U.S. Senate definitively voted in support of expanded hate crimes legislation because standing law has proven inadequate in the protection of many victimized groups. The 30-year-old Federal statute currently used to prosecute hate violence does not cover hate violence based on sexual orientation, gender or disability and requires that the victim be participating in a federally protected activity. The Kennedy-Smith amendment addresses and corrects these gaps in the law. Not only is this bill the right thing to do, but Americans overwhelmingly support it. Law enforcement groups, as well as 80 civil rights and religious organizations support this bill, in addition to a 1998 poll showing that this Hate Crimes Prevention Act is favored 2 to 1 by a majority of voters. This bill protects all Americans and ensures equal justice for all victims of hate violence, regardless of their race, religion, sexual orientation, national origin, gender, or disability--and regardless of where they live.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes to discuss an issue of considerable importance, one I feel very strongly about and one that I think the Senate should address before the end of this Congressional session, and that is Mr. President, the issue of the digital divide. The digital divide is one of the key issues the Congress is currently facing--and will continue to face--in the foreseeable future. Right now we are wrestling with how to best encourage growth in this new economy, but at the same time, how to ensure that growth is evenly spread, that everyone in our society has an opportunity to participate in this new economy and reap its economic rewards. 
   Mr. President, these are amazing times in which we live and the new economy is responsible for much of this nation's unprecedented prosperity: the stock market is soaring to unimaginable heights. IPO's are occurring at a record pace and creating literally thousands of millionaires in this country. The innovations of the new technologies are astounding: You can order a Saturn online and the very next day a new car shows up in your drive-way. Each day 25,000 new E-BAY subscribers sign up for the world's largest auction. The NetSchools program provides every child with a kid-proof laptop PC that is connected to teachers and classmates using wireless infared technology and has had tremendous results improving academic achievement, attendance, and parental involvement in extremely disadvantaged communities. A surgeon in Boston can direct a doctor in the Berkshires to do a biopsy by using telemedicine equipment. These innovations and hundreds more like them are changing how we live. 
   The wealth creation--for those on the right side of the divide--generated by this New Economy is breathtaking, Mr. President: College students go from the dorm room to the board room as high tech moguls, like Jerry Yang and Michael Dell. Starting salaries for high tech jobs even for students coming out of college can range from $70,000-$100,000--even more with stock options. Pick up the San Jose Mercury News job section each day and--literally--you will find advertisements for upwards of 10,000 high tech and information technology jobs. Silicon Valley has created more than 275,000 new jobs since 1992--and median family income has soared to $87,000 per year--the third highest in the country. 
   But as we all know Mr. President, the new economy has not evenly spread its wealth to all Americans and income disparity in this nation continues to grow. One of the greatest challenges we currently face is to connect those not participating in the new economy with the skills, resources, and support necessary for them to do so. A January 2000 study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and the Economic Policy Institute found that in two-thirds of the states, the gap in incomes between the top 20 percent of families and the bottom 20 percent of families grew between the late 1980s and the late 1990s. In three-fourths of the states, income gaps between the top fifth and middle fifth of families grew over the last decade. By contrast, inequality declined significantly in only three states. Clearly Mr. President, the digital divide and the economic divide are closely interrelated and must be responded to as such. 
   Mr. President, the new economy is more than the latest and greatest innovations in information technology and the highest-flying Internet companies. It is a knowledge economy, 
   with a large share of the workforce employed in office jobs requiring some level of higher education. It is a global economy--the sum of U.S. imports and exports rose from 11 percent of gross domestic product in 1970 to 25 percent in 1997. This emerging economy is driven by innovation in every arena from traditional manufacturing to health care, and even farming and fishing. 
   The new economy is powerful and exciting, but the digital divide is real and cannot afford to be ignored. Let me describe to you what this divide looks like. 
   The Digital Divide: 
   61.6% of those with college degrees now use the Internet, while only 6.6% of those with an elementary school education or less use the Internet. 
   At the highest incomes ($75,000+), the White/Black divide for computer ownership decreased by 76.2% between 1994 and 1998. 
   Whites are more likely to have access to the Internet from home, than Blacks or Hispanics have from any location. 
   Black and Hispanic households are 2/5 as likely to have home Internet access as White households. 
   Forty-four million American adults, roughly 22 percent, do not have the reading and writing skills necessary for functioning in everyday life. And an estimated 87 percent of documents on the Internet are in English. Yet at least 32 million Americans speak a language other than English and they are--again and again--left behind on the Internet. 
   Those with a college degree or higher are over eight times more likely to have a computer at home than the least educated and nearly sixteen times more likely to have home Internet access. 
   The ``digital divide'' for Internet use between those at the highest and lowest education levels widened by 25% from 1997 to 1998. 
   Those with college degrees or higher are ten times more likely to have Internet access at work as persons with only some high school education. 
   Mr. President technology is changing our world. Technology is changing our lives, how we work, and how we learn. But this is not just a new economy, it is our economy. And ours is not a newly divided society. Mr. President, this country has always been a society of haves and have nots, and so although we must respond to the unique challenges presented by the changing economy and the changing world of work, we must also understand that bridging the digital divide is about more than just computers and the Internet. In order to meet the challenge of bridging the digital divide we must assist the have nots with basic necessities, like a good public education system, a safe and clean place to live, and adequate health care. We must recognize 
   what I hear from business leaders, teachers, students, parents--everyone--the biggest technology issue in the United States today is education. And we need to make that connection. 
   Originally when we talked about technology and education--the earlier days of our awareness that there was a growing digital divide--we were focused on wiring schools and outfitting them with equipment. Now, thanks in large part to the success of the E-Rate program, which we worked hard on in the Commerce Committee and which we pushed through to passage, now technology and education is about so much more. In just a few years most of our schools have gotten on-line. And now the focus is on training teachers to effectively use the technology, to integrate technology into the classroom, and to improve parental involvement through technology. 
   What we can do and what we must do Mr. President, is work to harness technology to grow our economy and enlarge the winner's circle. What we can do and what we must do is work to communicate this single reality: to keep the economic growth moving ahead, we need to work together to ensure that we have a workforce and a generation of young people capable of working with the best technology and the very best ideas to raise living standards and expand the economy--and that is why we must close the digital divide. 
   The digital divide goes far beyond technology to encompass basic human needs. Mr. President, if we can ensure that there is a computer in every classroom--for every student--the technology will not be effectively used, learning will continue to be challenged if the child does not have a safe and secure home to go to at the end of the day. If a child attends a school that is falling apart, does it matter how many computers are in the classroom and whether or not the school is wired? If a child lives in a dangerous and violent  community--a reality for far too many of this nation's young people--the fear of bullets and gangs is certain to triumph over the desire to conquer new technologies. If a child goes hungry, if school is the only place that can be counted on for a good meal, that child cannot focus on computing and learning. 
   Mr. President, these are the issues of the digital divide: adequate and affordable housing, safe and secure school buildings, adequate health care, qualified teachers, an increased minimum wage, strong communities, and affordable day care. We must understand that in order to seize upon this brilliant moment of technological advance and move our entire nation forward, we must address these basic needs. We must shore up the foundation, Mr. President and provide all our citizens with opportunity as we march forward in the digital age. 
   I ask my colleagues to ponder this for a moment: change is nothing new, technology is nothing new, the challenge is the same as it's ever been. But we can use these new technologies to extend opportunity to more Americans than ever before--or, if we're not careful, we could allow technology to heighten economic inequality and sharpen social divisions. By the same token, we can accelerate the most powerful engine of growth and prosperity the world has ever known--or allow that engine to stall. As every economics textbook will tell you, new technologies will continue to drive economic growth--but only if they continue to spread to all sectors of our economy and civic life. And that's the challenge that faces this Congress and this nation. 
   Mr. President, we have a real opportunity here--and I urge my colleagues to seize it--to close the divisions within our society that have always existed and also to close the digital divide.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman for his very generous and appropriate gesture on behalf of Senator LAUTENBERG. Over the last months, I have had occasion to meet around the country with people who are concerned about transportation. To a person, they all voluntarily offer up the degree to which they are going to miss Senator LAUTENBERG who has been an extraordinary champion for public transportation and for aviation, as the chairman said. 
   Most important, speaking parochially for a moment, it is not easy to champion the rail system in a country that has been dominated by automobiles and our love affair with autos and highways. In all his years here, FRANK LAUTENBERG has been the single strongest advocate of making certain we have an alternative form of transportation. 
   In the Northeast particularly, we will have an accelerated rail link between New York and Boston and ultimately Washington that is due almost solely to his persistent annual guarantee that the funding is there. 
   That is an enormous legacy. We do not always get an opportunity in the Senate to have that kind of niche where your vision is singlehandedly implemented. Senator LAUTENBERG has done that with great commitment and great perseverance. 
   I thank him on behalf of everybody in New England who depends on that system to get to work, to travel, to meet their families, and to enjoy affordable opportunity to travel.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Oregon in expressing support for what we have achieved here. I begin by thanking Senator MCCAIN, Senator SARBANES, and Senator HOLLINGS for their leadership. They helped to create the climate within which we were able to finally get together with the House leadership. 
   But also I thank the distinguished Senator from Oregon. He is extraordinarily knowledgeable in this arena and very creative. And he works hard at it. He really has helped to shape the outcome of this in a significant way. I think he has done a very good job of outlining the tensions that existed here. 
   Many of us thought, at the outset of this endeavor, that we could accomplish this quickly. We ran into, as he said, complications along the road. The key to many of us was that even as we provided the legal capacity for electronic signatures to take place and certain recordkeeping to take place, we did not want to diminish the rights of our citizens to have access to information about them, we did not want their ability to be able to make corrections to be diminished somehow. We did not want to diminish their right to know about themselves or about their own transactions in a way that would diminish their position in the marketplace. And that is a difficult thing. We worked through that. I think we are still going to be working through that for some time. 
   But the important thing is that this phenomenon, this revolution that is taking place in America and across the globe in how we do business, needed to be----

   Mr. KERRY. That revolution needed to be able to continue in its most creative form and, frankly, with the best upside possible for the people to whom we are all accountable, who are the consumers, the citizens, and the people who ultimately we want to have benefit from this. I think this legislation is very positive in that regard. 
   I thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee, Senator MCCAIN, for his leadership and his courtesy in letting the usually mostly abused and beleaguered minority take a dominant position at the outset of the debate. It is characteristic of him that he allowed us to do that. It is a very momentary glimpse of freedom we are not used to. We thank him for that. It is just whetting our appetite and only makes us work harder to have that dominant position forever. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it has been more than a year now since the Columbine tragedy, and still regrettably our friends on the other side of the aisle refuse to act on commonsense, sensible gun legislation. I understand the divisions in the Senate and in the country on the issue of guns. I am certainly not unmindful of the truth to some people's assertions regarding the degree to which personal responsibility enters into the actions of anybody with respect to guns. 
   Obviously, we need to create greater accountability on a personal level with respect to those actions. But common sense tells every single American that there are also basic things we can do to make this country safer for our children, things we can do to keep guns out of the hands of our children, things we can do to make our schools safer, ways in which guns themselves can become safer. I am deeply troubled by the numbers of people, particularly the number of children who have been wounded or killed by gunfire since Columbine, and who are killed and wounded by gunfire each year in this country. 
   All we are asking is that the juvenile justice conference meet, that the Senate do its business, that they finish the business, issue their report, and that the Congress have the courage and the willingness to vote on the conference report. 
   Until we do act, many of us on this side of the aisle--I would say the Democratic caucus--is prepared to read the names of those who have lost their lives to gun violence over the past year. We will continue to do so every single day that the Senate is in session. 
   The following are the names of people who were killed by gunfire, 1 year ago today: 
   Latonia Davis, 21, Charlotte, NC; Jacob B. Dodge, 24, Madison, WI; Elvin R. Dugan, 33, Oklahoma City, OK; Marcus E. Gray, 39, Chicago, IL; Dante Green, 26, Washington, DC; Dwayne Pate, 32, Washington, DC; Charles Vullo, 42, Houston, TX; Brandon Williams, 3, Hollywood, FL; Lennox Williams, 49, Hollywood, FL; Mae William, 44, Hollywood, FL; Unidentified male, 63, Portland, OR. 
   I hope my colleagues will join in releasing the juvenile justice bill from its prison and empowering the Senate to do its job and to pass the juvenile justice bill, which will make this country safer for our children. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today, along with my colleagues, Senators SANTORUM and SARBANES, I am introducing legislation which will help address the lack of affordable housing for the most vulnerable Americans--the elderly, disabled persons, and low-income families. This bill closes a number of gaps in the federal housing assistance programs for these families, and ensures that programs designed to promote affordable housing can do so in this rapidly expanding economy. 
   As our economy flourishes at an unprecedented rate, many Americans have prospered. However, as the economy grows, so too does the gap between rich and poor. Instead of finding opportunities in this new economy, some Americans have found closed doors. This is especially true for low-income people who are being squeezed out of tight housing markets in my home state of Massachusetts and around the Nation. 
   Although a majority of elderly Americans live in decent, adequate and affordable housing, millions of elderly households require some assistance in order to afford housing that meets their needs. In fact, there are eight elderly people waiting for each unit of assisted elderly housing in this country. Fourteen percent of people in Massachusetts are over 65 years of age, and one out of every ten of these elderly persons has an income below the poverty level. 
   This bill expands upon the current program of providing affordable housing, increasing housing opportunities for low-income elderly and disabled persons, and bringing the program up-to-date. As Americans grow older, housing programs must be altered to address the changing needs of a generation that is living longer, and aging in place. This bill enables existing housing to be converted to assisted living facilities to meet the needs of the elderly and disabled. 
   Assisted living is the fastest growing type of elderly housing in the U.S., and this legislation ensures that this supportive, and increasingly necessary living arrangement, is available to all elderly and disabled Americans, regardless of income. By 2030, 20 percent of this Nation's population will be over the age of 65, compared with only 13 percent of the population today. As we make strides in medicine to allow older people to live longer, more active lives, we must also make sure that the services and structures are in place to support elderly Americans. This bill is a step in this direction. 
   This bill also encourages the leveraging of federal funds, helping to increase the stock of affordable housing. Public dollars alone are unable to meet the needs of low-income families. This legislation makes it easier for federal funds for disabled and elderly housing to be combined with other sources of funding, including the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, and private funds. 
   Not only will this bill increase the supply of affordable housing for the elderly and disabled, it will help to preserve affordable housing for all low-income households. A record high number of households, 5.4 million, have worst case housing needs, paying over 50 percent of their income to housing costs or living in substandard housing. This is a 12 percent increase since 1991. At the same time that more Americans are finding it increasingly difficult to find suitable and affordable housing, the federal government has not been doing enough to preserve the affordable housing that exists. 
   A number of provisions aim to ensure that affordable housing is preserved. This bill allows uninsured 236 project owners to retain their excess income for use in the project, helping to keep these owners in the program and ensuring that the units will remain affordable. In addition, this bill includes the preservation bill introduced earlier this Congress by Senator JEFFORDS and myself, S. 1318, to provide matching grants to States and localities devoting resources to the preservation of affordable housing. Cities, like Boston, which have dedicated a substantial amount of funds to the production and preservation of affordable housing units, would receive federal funds to assist in their efforts under this provision, ensuring that an even greater number of units are preserved. 
   I hope that this critical legislation will attract broad support. At this time of prosperity, we cannot forget that while many Americans have benefited, there are still too many people who cannot afford to meet their basic housing needs. These people cannot be overlooked in this era of economic growth. This legislation ensures that they won't be.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the availability of capital and credit still remains one of the most significant impediments to small business creation and growth, and it is the Small Business Administration (SBA) that continues to effectively serve as the principal ``gap'' lender to our nation's 24 million small businesses. 
   SBA's loan and investment programs are a bargain. For very little, taxpayers leverage their money to fuel the economy and help thousands of small businesses every year. In the 7(a) program, taxpayers spend $1.24 for every $100 loaned to small business owners. Well-known successes like Winnebago and Ben & Jerry's are examples of the program's effectiveness. In the 504 program, taxpayers don't spend a penny to lend or leverage investments because they are self-funded. 
   Today we will vote on H.R. 2614, the Certified Development Company Program Improvements Act of 2000. This bill makes changes to the 504 Certified Development Company (CDC or 504 program) loan program that will greatly increase the opportunity for small businesses to build a facility, buy more equipment, or acquire a new building. These loans create a ripple effect that enables small business owners to expand their companies, hire more workers and ultimately improve the local economy. 
   This bill also includes a manager's amendment with three provisions. One, it addresses prompt approval of applications from certified development companies (CDCs) to operate in multiple states. Two, it restores much of the shortfall in 7(a) funding for FY2000 by giving SBA the authority to reprogram unused funds. Three, it maintains continuity in the HUBZone program by grandfathering in existing HUBZone companies as zones are redefined when the Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its new data. 
   Before I get into the details of this bill, I would like to spend a minute describing the 504 Certified Development Company (CDC) loan program. This program is mission-driven, designed to provide capital to growing small businesses and create jobs. The professionals who work at CDCs do much more than make loans--they better communities. They usually have a mixture of expertise, part economic development specialist and part lender. They know their communities, and they know how to package loans and help prospective borrowers get financing. In fact, if you were to talk to them, you would learn that many are former lenders from commercial banks who wanted to get out from behind a desk and get involved in their communities. Instead of turning away meritorious projects because they didn't fit the profile of a traditional borrower, using the 504 program they could put together a loan that spreads the risk among commercial lenders, CDCs, the state or local governments, and the small business owners. These loans  jumpstart or complement the economic development in CDCs' communities. 
   Specifically, the 504 program provides businesses with long-term, fixed-rated financing for major fixed assets, such as buildings and equipment. CDCs work with the SBA and private-sector lenders to provide financing to small businesses and ultimately contribute to the economic development of their communities or the regions they serve. There are about 290 CDCs nationwide, and each CDC covers a specific area. Each CDC's portfolio must create or retain one job for every $35,000 provided by the SBA. 
   As I mentioned earlier, but will expand on here, proceeds from 504 loans must be used for fixed-asset projects. Projects range from land purchases and improvements--including existing 
   buildings, grading, street improvements, utilities, parking lots and landscaping--to the construction of new facilities, or modernization, renovation or conversion of existing facilities, to the purchase of long-term machinery and equipment. The 504 Program cannot be used for working capital or inventory, consolidating or repaying debt, or refinancing. 
   I strongly support SBA's 504 loan program. Since 1980, more than 25,000 businesses have received more than $20 billion in fixed-asset financing through the 504 program. In Massachusetts, over the last decade, small businesses got $318 million in 504 loans that created more than 10,000 jobs. The stories behind those numbers say a lot about how SBA's 504 loans help business owners and communities. In Fall River, owners Patricia Ladino and Russell Young developed a custom packing plans for scallops and shrimp that has grown from ten to 30 employees in just two short years and is in the process of another expansion that will add as many as 25 new jobs. In Danvers, there's the car dealership that used a 504 loan to grow a company over 15 years from 25 to 395 employees. In Berkshire County, the 504 program has helped support the growth of the plastics mold and tool industry. One good example of success in this area is the development of Starbase Technologies in Pittsfield which now employs 65 people. 
   H.R. 2614 would build on that success by implementing the following. First, it will increase the maximum debenture size for Section 504 loans from $750,000 to $1 million, and the size of debentures for loans that meet special public policy goals from $1 million to $1,300,000. It has been 10 years since the Committee acted to increase the maximum guarantee amount in the 504 program. To keep pace with inflation, the maximum guarantee amount should be increased to approximately $1.25 million. However, consistent with my colleagues on the House Small Business Committee, I believe that a simple increase to $1 million is probably sufficient. 
   H.R. 2614 also adds women-owned businesses to the current list of businesses eligible for the larger public policy loans with guarantees of up to $1.3 million. Currently, the higher guaranty is available for business district revitalization; expansion of exports; expansion of minority business development; rural development; enhanced economic competition; and, added just last year, veteran-owned businesses, with an emphasis on service-disabled veterans. 
   This small legislative change was significant and long overdue. Throughout America's history, countless men and women have served our country and fought for its ideals as members of our armed services. However, when they return to civilian life, veterans have often encountered barriers to starting or expanding a business. Although there are a number of programs at the SBA to provide assistance, many of these are not specifically targeted at veterans. Making them eligible for the higher debenture should help to remedy some of the inequalities that our service men and women face upon their return to civilian life and provide greater opportunity for the 5.5 million businesses owned or operated by veterans. That change also should help the 104,000 service-disabled veterans within the business community. 
   I originally introduced the provision to add women-owned businesses to the list of public policy goals in the 105th Congress as part of S. 2448, the Small Business Loan Enhancement Act. Though it eventually was included in and passed by the Senate as part of H.R. 3412, a comprehensive small business bill, it was never enacted. Unfortunately, the House received the bill too late to act before the 105th Congress adjourned. I am very pleased that the Committee continues to recognize the important role women-owned businesses play in the economy and is making this change to facilitate the expansion of this sector of our economy. 
   Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and earning power. They constitute one-third of the 24 million small businesses in the United States, generate $3.6 trillion annually in revenues to the economy and range in industry from advertising agencies to manufacturing. Addressing the special needs of women-owned businesses serves not only these entrepreneurs, but also the economic strength of this nation as a whole. Since 1992, SBA has managed to increase access to capital for women and has worked in earnest to move women entrepreneurs away from expensive credit card financing to more affordable loans for financing their business ventures. While the percentage of 504 loans to women-owned businesses has increased nationwide from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 13 percent in 1999, and I applaud that, we need to increase lending opportunities to better reflect that 38 percent of all businesses are owned by women. 
   By expanding the public policy goals of the 504 loan program to include women-owned businesses, we are ensuring that loans to eligible women business owners aren't capped at $1 million but are now available for as much as $1.3 million. According to Certified Development Company professionals, loan underwriters are conservative when it comes to approving loans for more than $750,000 and this directive would undoubtedly help eligible women business owners get the financing they need to expand their facilities and buy equipment as their businesses grow. 
   H.R. 2614 also reauthorizes the fees currently levied on the borrower, the Certified Development Company, and the participating bank. The fees in the 504 program cover all its costs, resulting in a program that operates at no cost to the taxpayer. Without this legislation, the fees sunset on October 1, 2000. H.R. 2614 will continue them through October 1, 2003. 
   Additionally, H.R. 2614 will grant permanent status to the Preferred Certified Lender Program before it sunsets at the end of fiscal year 2000. This program enables experienced CDCs to use streamlined procedures for loan making and liquidation, resulting in improved service to the small business borrower and reduced losses and liquidation costs. 
   H.R. 2614 also makes the Loan Liquidation Pilot Program a permanent program. This gives qualified and experienced CDCs the ability to handle the liquidation of loans with only minimal involvement of the SBA. It is the goal of this liquidation program to increase the recovery rates of the 504 loan program, and to bring about a corresponding reduction in the fees charged to the borrowers and the lenders. 
   Importantly, this bill includes Senator WELLSTONE's provision to authorize the program for three more years, making it a complete package. I believe it is better to act now on a bill that already has the House's blessing than to wait for the comprehensive reauthorization bill, H.R. 3843, to make its way to the President's desk. Taking this action now will enable the CDCs to plan for the year ahead, because they know that the program levels for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 are $4 billion, $5 billion and $6 billion. 
   In addition to these changes, and as I mentioned earlier, this bill includes a manager's amendment. The first provision deals with long-pending applications from CDCs that are seeking to expand into multiple states. To address the problem, this provision establishes a one-time automatic approval of applications for multi-state operation that have been pending at SBA headquarters for 12 months or more. Unless SBA acts to approve or disapprove the applications, automatic approval would go into effect 21 days after the bill is signed by the President. 
   While I urge the SBA to process applications in a timely manner, and while I understand the frustration of the applicants who have been waiting,  I believe, in general, that it is in the best interest 
   of the taxpayers for applicants and their proposals to be thoroughly screened, rather than blindly approved. This program, above all else, was designed to help small businesses, and I believe we should carefully review policy changes that are intended to expand a CDC's territory to make sure that the real goal--increasing access to the program for small businesses--is achieved. 
   The second provision gives the SBA the authority to reprogram unused funds to make up for the significant shortfall of appropriations for the 7(a) loan program. In its budget request for FY 2000, and again recently, the SBA estimated that the demand in this popular lending program would grow to a program level of $10.5 billion. Unfortunately, it was only appropriated enough to support a level of close to $9.8 billion. The Administration's estimate has proven to be more accurate than Congress anticipated, and the SBA needs additional funds to keep the program running throughout this fiscal year. This bill restores $500 million of the $700 million shortfall. I strongly support this provision and worked with Senator BOND to draft this legislation. I appreciate his cooperation and respectfully urge the appropriators in both the Senate and House to work with us. 
   Lastly, Mr. President, this bill also includes a technical change to the Historically Underutilized Business Zone small business contracting program (HUBZone program) administered by the SBA. The HUBZone program is designed to provide contracting opportunities in economically distressed areas of this country. One of the criteria for this program is that a small business must be located in a qualified census tract or nonmetropolitan county based on unemployment statistics from the Department of Labor and the Department of the Census. 
   As new data becomes available, there is a possibility that HUBZone firms would lose their eligibility, because the data could reflect that the census tract the firm is located in is technically no longer considered an economically depressed area. As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and as a cosponsor of the original HUBZone law passed in 1997, I am concerned that when a particular area is no longer deemed HUBZone-eligible, small business owners in that area will lose the ability to bid on contracting opportunities under the program with little or no warning. This will be disruptive to the program and could discourage participation by qualified small businesses. 
   Because it is better policy to provide both small firms and the SBA with some sort of warning before a firm is deemed ineligible, this amendment is intended to allow a HUBZone firm located in an economically depressed area that has been redesignated by either Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) or Census data, to remain eligible under the program for three additional years. Thus the firm is put on notice that contracting opportunities under the program may not be available in the future, and the business is given time to plan for this change. 
   While I understand only a handful of firms were affected by a change in designated areas when new BLS data was released last year, I support the chairman's effort to ensure that no firm is taken by surprise this year. I am pleased that Senator BYRD and his staff worked together with my staff to come up with appropriate language for this amendment. 
   In closing, I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this bill. If, as expected, it is enacted, they will have improved the business climate and taken a few more steps to ensure that small businesses have access to capital and expanded procurement opportunities.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the chairman and ranking member for their courtesy and I appreciate the time of the Senate to be able to discuss an issue of extraordinary importance. It is an issue that is contained in this bill. It is a line item in this bill of some $85 million with respect to the issue of national missile defense. 
   President Clinton has just returned from his first meeting with the new Russian President, Vladimir Putin, and arms control dominated their agenda, in particular, the plan of the United States to deploy a limited national defense system, which would require amending the 1972 ABM Treaty. Russia is still strongly opposed to changing that treaty, and I think we can all expect this will continue to be an issue of great discussion between the United States and Russia in the months and possibly years to come. 
   As I said, in the Senate today, this defense bill authorizes funding for the construction of the national missile defense initial deployment facilities. Regretfully, we do not always have the time in the Senate to lay out policy considerations in a thorough, quiet, and thoughtful way, and I will try to do that this morning. The question of whether, when, and how the United States should deploy a defense against ballistic missiles is, in fact, complex--tremendously complex. I want to take some time today to walk through the issues that are involved in that debate and to lay bare the implications it will have for the national security of the United States. 
   No American leader can dismiss an idea that might protect American citizens from a legitimate threat. If there is a real potential of a rogue nation, as we call them, firing a few missiles at any city in the United States, responsible leadership requires that we make our best, most thoughtful efforts to defend against that threat. The same is true of the potential threat of accidental launch. If ever either of these things happened, no leader could explain away not having chosen to defend against such a disaster when doing so made sense.  
   The questions before us now are several. Does it make sense to deploy a national missile defense now, unilaterally, if the result might be to put America at even greater risk? Do we have more time to work with allies and others to find a mutually acceptable, nonthreatening way of proceeding? Have the threats to which we are responding been exaggerated, and are they more defined by politics than by genuine threat assessment and scientific fact? Have we sufficiently explored various technologies and architectures so we are proceeding in the most thoughtful and effective way? 
   The President has set out four criteria on which he will base his decision to deploy an NMD: The status of the threat, the status and effectiveness of the proposed system's technology, the cost of the system, and the likely impact of deploying such a system on the overall strategic environment and U.S. arms control efforts in general. In my judgment, at this point in time none of these criteria are met to satisfaction. 
   While the threat from developing missile programs has emerged more quickly than we expected, I do not believe it justifies a rush to action on the proposed defensive system, which is far from technologically sound and will probably not even provide the appropriate response to the threat as it continues to develop. More importantly, a unilateral decision of the United States to deploy an NMD system could undermine global strategic stability, damage our relationship with key allies in Europe and Asia, and weaken our continuing efforts to reduce the nuclear danger. 
   Turning first to the issue of the threat that we face, this question deserves far greater scrutiny than it has thus far received. I hear a number of colleagues, the State Department, and others, saying: Oh, yes, the threat exists. Indeed, to some 
   degree the threat does exist. But it is important for us to examine to what degree. Recently, the decades-long debate on the issue of deploying an NMD has taken on bipartisan relevance as the threat of a rogue ballistic missile program has increased. 
   I want to be very clear. At this point, I support the deployment, in cooperation with our friends and allies, of a limited, effective National Missile Defense System aimed at containing the threat from small rogue ballistic missile programs or the odd, accidental, or unauthorized launch from a major power. But I do not believe the United States should attempt to unilaterally deploy a National Missile Defense System aimed at altering the strategic balance. We have made tremendous progress over the last two decades in reducing the threat from weapons of mass destruction through bilateral strategic reductions with Russia and multilateral arms control agreements such as the Chemical Weapons Convention. We simply cannot allow these efforts to be undermined in any way as we confront the emerging ballistic missile threat. 
   Even as we have made progress with Russia on reducing our cold war arsenals, ballistic missile technology has spread, and the threat to the United States from rogue powers, so-called, has grown. The July 1998 Rumsfeld report found that the threat from developing ballistic missile states, especially North Korea, Iran, and Iraq, is developing faster than expected and could pose an imminent threat to the U.S. homeland in the next 5 years. That conclusion was reinforced just 1 month later when North Korea tested a three-stage Taepo Dong-1 missile, launching it over Japan and raising tensions in the region. While the missile's third stage failed, the test confirmed that North Korea's program for long-range missiles is advancing towards an ICBM capability that could ultimately--and I stress ultimately--threaten the United States, as surely as its shorter range missiles threaten our troops and our allies in the region today. 
   A 1999 national intelligence estimate on the ballistic missile threat found that in addition to the continuing threat from Russia and China, the United States faces a developing threat from North Korea, Iran, and Iraq. 
   In addition to the possibility that North Korea might convert the Taepo Dong-1 missile into an inaccurate ICBM capable of carrying a light payload to the United States, the report found that North Korea could weaponize the larger Taepo Dong-2 to deliver a crude nuclear weapon to American shores, and it could do so at any time, with little warning. The NIE also found that, in the next 15 years, Iran could test an ICBM capable of carrying a nuclear weapon to the United States--and certainly to our allies in Europe and the Middle East--and that Iraq may be able to do the same in a slightly longer time frame. 
   The picture of the evolving threat to the United States from ballistic missile programs in hostile nations has changed minds in the Senate about the necessity of developing and testing a national missile defense. It has changed my mind about what might be appropriate to think about and to test and develop. 
   If Americans in Alaska or Hawaii must face this threat, however uncertain, I do not believe someone in public life can responsibly tell them: We will not look at or take steps to protect you. 
   But as we confront the technological challenges and the political ramifications of developing and deploying a national missile defense, we are compelled to take a closer look at the threat we are rushing to meet. I believe the missile threat from North Korea, Iran, and Iraq is real but not imminent, and that we confront today much greater, much more immediate dangers, from which national missile defense cannot and will not protect us. 
   To begin, it is critical to note that both the Rumsfeld Commission and the National Intelligence Estimate adopted new standards for assessing the ballistic missile threat in response to political pressures from the Congress. 
   The 1995 NIE was viciously criticized for underestimating the threat from rogue missile programs. Some in Congress accused the administration of deliberately downplaying the threat to undermine their call for a national missile defense. 
   To get the answer that they were looking for, the Congress then established the Rumsfeld Commission to review the threat. Now, that commission was made up of some of the best minds in U.S. defense policy--both supporters and skeptics of national missile defense. I do not suggest the commission's report was somehow fixed. These are people who have devoted their lives in honorable service to their country. The report reflects no less than their best assessment of the threat. 
   But in reaching the conclusions that have alarmed so many about the immediacy of the threat, we must responsibly take note of the fact that the commission did depart from the standards that we had traditionally used to measure the threat. 
   First, the commission reduced the range of ballistic missiles that we consider to be a threat from missiles that can reach the continental United States to those that can only reach Hawaii and Alaska. 
   I think this is a minor distinction because, as I said earlier, no responsible leader is going to suggest that you should leave Americans in Hawaii or Alaska exposed to attack. But certainly the only reason to hit Hawaii or Alaska, if you have very few weapons measured against other targets, is to wreak terror. And insomuch as that is the only reason, one has to factor that into the threat analysis in ways they did not. 
   Secondly, it shortened the time period for considering a developing program to be a threat from the old standard which measured when a program could actually be deployed to a new standard of when it was simply tested. 
   Again, I would be willing to concede this as a minor distinction because if a nation were to be intent on using one of these weapons, it might not wait to meet the stringent testing requirements that we usually try to meet before deploying a new system. It could just test a missile, see that it works, and make plans to use it. 
   These changes are relatively minor, but they need to be acknowledged and factored into the overall discussion. 
   But the third change which needs to be factored in is not insignificant because both the Rumsfeld Commission and the 1999 NIE abandoned the old standard of assessing the likelihood that a nation would use its missile capacity in favor of a new standard of whether a nation simply has the relevant capacity for a missile attack,  with no analysis whatsoever of the other factors that go 
   into a decision to actually put that capability to use. 
   This is tremendously important because, as we know from the cold war, threat is more than simply a function of capability; it is a function of attention and other political and military considerations. Through diplomacy and deterrence, the United States can alter the intentions of nations that pursue ballistic missile programs and so alter the threat they pose to us. 
   This is not simply wishful thinking. There are many examples today of nations who possess the technical capacity to attack the United States, but whom we do not consider a threat. India and Pakistan have made dramatic progress in developing medium-range ballistic missile programs. But the intelligence community does not consider India and Pakistan to pose a threat to U.S. interests. Their missile capacity alone does not translate into a threat because they do not hold aggressive intentions against us. 
   Clearly, North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are hostile to us, and our ability to use diplomacy to reduce the threat they pose will be limited. But having the capacity to reach us and an animosity towards us does not automatically translate into the intention to use weapons of mass destruction against us. 
   In the 40 years that we faced the former Soviet Union, with the raw capability to destroy each other, neither side resorted to using its arsenal of missiles. Why not? Because even in periods of intense animosity and tension, under the most unpredictable and isolated of regimes, political and military deterrence has a powerful determining effect on a nation's decision to use force. We have already seen this at work in our efforts to contain North Korea's nuclear and missile programs. We saw it at work in the gulf war when Saddam Hussein was deterred from using his weapons of mass destruction by the sure promise of a devastating response from the United States. 
   During the summer of 1999, intelligence reports indicated that North Korea was preparing the first test-launch of the Taepo Dong-2. Regional tensions rose, as Japan, South Korea and the United States warned Pyongyang that it would face serious consequences if it went ahead with another long-range missile launch. The test was indefinitely delayed, for ``political reasons,'' which no doubt included U.S. military deterrence and the robust diplomatic efforts by the United States and its key allies in the region. 
   Threatening to cut off nearly $1 billion of food assistance and KEDO funding to North Korea should the test go forward, while also holding out the possibility of easing economic sanctions if the test were called off, helped South Korea, Japan and the United States make the case to Pyongyang that its interests would be better served through restraint. An unprecedented dialogue between the United States and North Korea, initiated by former Secretary of Defense William Perry during the height of this crisis, continues today. It aims to verifiably freeze Pyongyang's missile programs and end 50 years of North Korea's economic isolation. 
   Acknowledging that these political developments can have an important impact on the threat, the intelligence community, according to a May 19 article in the Los Angeles Times, will reflect in its forthcoming NIE that the threat from North Korea's missile program has eased since last fall. And if it has eased since last fall, indeed, we should be thinking about the urgency of decisions we make that may have a profound impact on the overall balance of power. 
   In short, even as we remain clear-eyed about the threat these nations pose to American interests, we must not look at the danger as somehow preordained or unavoidable. 
   In cooperation with our friends and allies, we must vigorously implore the tools of diplomacy to reduce the threat. We must redouble our efforts to stop the proliferation of these deadly weapons. We cannot just dismiss the importance of U.S. military 
   deterrence. 
   Only madmen, only the most profoundly detached madmen, bent on self-destruction, would launch a missile against U.S. soil, which obviously would invite the most swift and devastating response. One or two or three missiles fired by North Korea or Iraq would leave a clear address of who the sender was, and there is no question that the United States would have the ability to eliminate them from the face of this planet. All people would recognize that as an immediate and legitimate response. 
   My second major concern about the current debate over the missile threat is that it does nothing to address equally dangerous but more immediate and more likely threats to U.S. interests. 
   For one, U.S. troops and U.S. allies today confront the menace of theater ballistic missiles, capable of delivering chemical or biological weapons. We saw during the gulf war how important theater missile defense is to maintaining allied unity and enabling our troops to focus on their mission. We must continue to push this technology forward regardless of whether we deploy an NMD system. 
   The American people also face the very real threat of terrorist attack. The 1999 State Department report on Patterns of Global Terrorism shows that while the threat of state-sponsored terrorism against the U.S. is declining, the threat from nonstate actors, who increasingly have access to chemical and biological weapons, and possibly even small nuclear devices, is growing. These terrorist groups are most likely to attack us covertly, quietly slipping explosives into a building, unleashing chemical weapons into a crowded subway, or sending a crude nuclear weapon into a busy harbor. 
   An NMD system will not protect American citizens from any of these more immediate and more realistic threats. 
   Finally, on the issue of the missile threat we are confronting, I remain deeply concerned about Russia's command and control over its nuclear forces. Russia has more than 6,000 strategic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. Maintaining these missiles on high alert significantly increases the threat of an accidental or an unauthorized launch. In 1995, the Russian military misidentified a U.S. weather rocket launched from Norway as a possible attack on the Russian Federation. With Russia's strategic forces already on high-alert, President Yelstin and his advisors had just minutes to decide whether to launch a retaliatory strike on the United States. And yet, in an effort to reassure Russia that the proposed missile defense will not prompt an American first strike, the administration seems to be encouraging Russia to, in fact, maintain its strategic forces on high alert to allow for a quick, annihilating counterattack that would overwhelm the proposed limited defense they are offering. 
   In effect, in order to deploy the system the administration is currently defining, they are prepared to have Russia, maintain with a bad command-and-control system weapons on hair trigger or targeted in order to maintain the balance. 
   In sum, the threat from rogue missile programs is neither as imminent nor is as mutable as some have argued. We have time to use the diplomatic tools at our disposal to try to alter the political calculation that any nation might make before it decided to use ballistic missile capacity. 
   Moreover, the United States faces other, more immediate threats that will not be met by an NMD. To meet the full range of threats to our national security, we need to simultaneously address the emerging threat from the rogue ballistic missile program, maintain a vigorous defense against theater ballistic missiles and acts of terrorism, and avoid actions that would undermine the strategic stability we have fought so hard to establish. 
   Let me speak for a moment now about the technology. In making his deployment decision, the President will also consider the technological readiness and effectiveness of the proposed system. Again, I have grave concerns that we are sacrificing careful technical development of this system to meet an artificial deadline, and, may I say, those concerns are shared by people far more expert than I am. Moreover, even if the proposed system were to work as planned, I am not convinced it would provide the most effective defense against a developing missile threat. 
   Let's look for a moment at the system currently under consideration. The  administration has proposed a limited system to protect all 50 States against small-scale attacks by ICBMs. In the simplest terms, this is a ground-based, hit-to-kill system. 
   An interceptor fired from American soil must hit the incoming missile directly to destroy it. Most of the components of this system are already developed and are undergoing testing. It will be deployed in 3 phases and is to be completed by about 2010, if the decision to deploy is made this year. The completed system will include 200, 250 interceptors deployed in Alaska and North Dakota, to be complemented by a sophisticated array of upgraded early-warning radars and satellite-based launch detection and tracking systems. I have two fundamental questions about this proposed system: Will the technology work as intended, and is the system the most appropriate and effective defense against this defined threat? 
   There are three components to consider in answering the first question: The technology's ability to function at the most basic level, its operational effectiveness against real world threats, and its reliability. 
   I do not believe the compressed testing program and decision deadline permit us to come close to drawing definitive conclusions 
   about those three fundamental elements of readiness. 
   In a Deployment Readiness Review scheduled for late July of this year, the Pentagon will assess the system, largely on the results of three intercept tests. The first of these in October of 1999 was initially hailed as a success because the interceptor did hit the target, but then, on further examination, the Pentagon conceded that the interceptor had initially been confused, it had drifted off course, ultimately heading for the decoy balloon, and possibly striking the dummy warhead only by accident. That is test No. 1. 
   The second test in January of 2000 failed because of a sensor coolant leak. 
   The third test has not even taken place yet. The third test, initially planned for April 2000, was postponed until late June and has recently been postponed again. It is expected in early July, just a few weeks before the Pentagon review. 
   To begin with, after two tests, neither satisfactory, it is still unclear whether the system will function at a basic level under the most favorable conditions. Even if the next test is a resounding success, I fail to see how that would be enough to convince people we have thoroughly vetted the potential problems of a system. 
   On the second issue of whether the system will be operationally effective, we have very little information on which to proceed. We have not yet had an opportunity to test operational versions of the components in anything such as the environment they would face in a real defensive engagement. We are only guessing at this point how well the system would respond to targets launched from unanticipated locations or how it would perform over much greater distances and much higher speeds than those at which it has been tested. 
   Finally, the question of reliability is best answered over time and extensive use of the system. Any program in its developing stages will run into technical glitches, and this program has been no different. That does not mean the system will not ever work properly, but it does mean we ought to take the time to find out, particularly before we do something that upsets the balance in the ways this may potentially do. 
   That is one more reason to postpone the deployment decision, to give the President and the Pentagon the opportunity to conduct a thorough and rigorous testing program. 
   This recommendation is not made in a vacuum. Two independent reviews have reached a similar conclusion about the risks of rushing to deployment. In February of 1998, a Pentagon panel led by former Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. Larry Welch, characterized the truncated testing program as a ``rush to failure.'' The panel's second report recommended delaying the decision to deploy until 2003 at the earliest to allow key program elements to be fully tested and proven. The concerns of the Welch Panel were reinforced by the release in February 2000 of a report by the Defense Department's office of operational test and evaluation (DOT&E). 
   The Coyle report decried the undue pressure being applied to the national missile defense testing program and warned that rushing through testing to meet artificial decision deadlines has ``historically resulted in a negative effect on virtually every troubled DOD development program.'' The Report recommended that the Pentagon postpone its Deployment Readiness Review to allow for a thorough analysis and clear understanding of the results of the third intercept test (now scheduled for early July), which will be the first ``integrated systems'' test of all the components except the booster. 
   The scientific community is concerned about more than the risks of a shortened testing program. The best scientific minds in America have begun to warn that even if the technology functions as planned, the system could be defeated by relatively simple 
   countermeasures. The 1999 NIE that addressed the ballistic missile threat concluded that the same nations that are developing long-range ballistic missile systems could develop or buy countermeasure technologies by the time they are ready to deploy their missile systems. 
   Just think, we could expend billions of dollars, we could upset the strategic balance, we could initiate a new arms race, and we could not even get a system that withstands remarkably simple, inexpensive countermeasures. Now, there is a stroke of brilliant strategic thinking. 
   The proposed national missile defense is an exo-atmospheric system, meaning the interceptor is intended to hit the target after the boost phase when it has left the atmosphere and before reentry. An IBM releases its payload immediately after the boost phase. If that payload were to consist of more than simply one warhead, then an interceptor would have more than one target with which to contend after the boost phase. 
   The Union of Concerned Scientists recently published a thorough technical analysis of three countermeasures that would be particularly well suited to overwhelming this kind of system, chemical and biological bomblets, antisimulation decoys, and warhead shrouds. North Korea, Iran, and Iraq are all believed to have programs capable of weaponizing chemical and biological weapons which are cheaper and easier to acquire than the most rudimentary nuclear warhead. 
   The most effective means of delivering a CBW, a chemical-biological warfare warhead on a ballistic missile, is not to deploy one large warhead filled with the agent but to divide it up into as many as 100 submunitions, or bomblets. There are few technical barriers to weaponizing CBW this way, and it allows the agents to be dispersed over a large area, inflicting maximum casualties. Because the limited NMD system will not be able to intercept a missile before the bomblets are dispersed, it could quickly be overpowered by just three incoming missiles armed with bomblets--and that is assuming every interceptor hit its target. 
   Just one missile carrying 100 targets would pose a formidable challenge to the system being designed with possibly devastating effects. 
   The exo-atmospheric system is also vulnerable to missiles carrying nuclear warheads armed with decoys. Using antisimulation, an attacker would disguise the nuclear warhead to look like a decoy by placing it in a lightweight balloon and releasing it along with a large number of similar but empty balloons. Using simple technology to raise the temperature in all of the balloons, the attacker could make the balloon containing the warhead indistinguishable to infrared radar from the empty balloons, forcing the defensive system to shoot down every balloon in order to ensure that the warhead is destroyed. By deploying a large number of balloons, an attacker could easily overwhelm a limited national missile defense system. Alternately, by covering the warhead with a shroud cooled by liquid nitrogen, an attacker could reduce the warhead's infrared radiation by a factor of at least 1 million, making it incredibly difficult for the system's sensors to detect the warhead in time to hit it. 
   I have only touched very cursorily on the simplest countermeasures that could be available to an attacker with ballistic missiles, but I believe this discussion raises serious questions about  a major operational vulnerability in the proposed system and about whether this system is the best response to the threats we are most likely to face in the years ahead. I don't believe it is. 
   There is a simpler, more sensible, less threatening, more manageable approach to missile defense that deserves greater consideration. Rather than pursuing the single-layer exo-atmospheric system, I believe we should focus our research efforts on developing a forward-deployed, boost phase intercept system. Such a system would build on the current technology of the Army's land-based theater high altitude air defense, THAAD, and the Navy's sea-based theaterwide defense system to provide forward-deployed defenses against both theater ballistic missile threats and long-range ballistic missile threats in their boost phase. 
   The Navy already deploys the Aegis fleet air defense system. An upgraded version of this sea-based system could be stationed off the coast of North Korea or in the Mediterranean or in the Persian Gulf to shoot down an ICBM in its earliest and slowest stage. The ground-based THAAD system could be similarly adapted to meet the long-range and theater ballistic missile threats. Because these systems would target a missile in its boost phase, they would eliminate the current system's vulnerability to countermeasures. This approach could also be more narrowly targeted at specific threats and it could be used to extend ballistic missile protection to U.S. allies and to our troops in the field. 
   As Dick Garwin, an expert on missile defense and a member of the Rumsfeld Commission has so aptly argued, the key advantage to the mobile forward-deployed missile defense system is that rather than having to create an impenetrable umbrella over the entire U.S. territory, it would only require us to put an impenetrable lid over the much smaller territory of an identified rogue nation or in a location where there is the potential for an accidental launch. A targeted system, by explicitly addressing specific threats, would be much less destabilizing than a system designed only to protect U.S. soil. It would reassure Russia that we do not intend to undermine its nuclear deterrent, and it would enable Russia and the United States to continue to reduce and to secure our remaining strategic arsenals. It would reassure U.S. allies that they will not be left vulnerable to missile threats and that they need not consider deploying nuclear deterrents of their own. In short, this alternative approach could do what the proposed national defense system will not do: It will make us safer. 
   There are two major obstacles to deploying a boost phase system, but I believe both of those obstacles can and must be overcome. First, the technology is not yet there. The Navy's theaterwide defense system was designed to shoot down cruise missiles and other threats to U.S. warships. Without much faster intercept missiles than are currently available, the system would not be able to stop a high speed ICBM, even in the relatively slow boost phase. The THAAD system, which continues to face considerable challenges in its demonstration and testing phases, is also being designed to stop ballistic missiles, but it hasn't been tested yet against the kinds of high speeds of an ICBM. 
   Which raises the second obstacle to deploying this system: the current interpretation of the ABM Treaty, as embodied in the 1997 demarcation agreements between Russia and the United States, does not allow us to test or deploy a theater ballistic missile system capable of shooting down an ICBM. I will address this issue a little more in a moment, but let me say that I am deeply disturbed by the notion that we should withdraw from the ABM Treaty and unilaterally deploy an ABM system, particularly the kind of system I have defined that may not do the job. In the long run, such a move would undermine U.S. security rather than advance it. It is possible--and I believe necessary--to reach an agreement with Russia on changes to the ABM Treaty that would allow us to deploy an effective limited defense system such as I have described. In fact, President Putin hinted quite openly at the potential for that kind of an agreement being reached. I commend the President for working hard to reach an agreement with Russia that will allow us both to deploy in an intelligent and mutual way that does not upset the balance. 
   I want to briefly address the issue of cost, which I find to be the least problematic of the four criterion under consideration. Those who oppose the idea of a missile defense point to the fact that, in the last forty years, the United States has spent roughly $120 billion trying to develop an effective defense against ballistic missiles. And because this tremendous investment has still not yielded definitive results, they argue that we should abandon the effort before pouring additional resources into it. 
   I disagree. I believe that we can certainly afford to devote a small portion of the Defense budget to develop a workable national missile defense. The projected cost of doing so varies--from roughly $4 billion to develop a boost-phase system that would build on existing defenses to an estimated $60 billion to deploy the three-phased ground-based system currently under consideration by the Administration. These estimates will probably be revised upward as we confront the inevitable technology challenges and delays. But, spread out over the next 5 to 10 years, I believe we can well afford this relatively modest investment in America's security, provided that our research efforts focus on developing a realistic response to the emerging threat. 
   My only real concern about the cost of developing a national missile defense is in the perception that addressing this threat somehow makes us safe from the myriad other threats that we face. We must not allow the debate over NMD to hinder our cooperation with Russia, China, and our allies to stop the proliferation of WMD and ballistic missile technology. In particular, we must remain steadfast in our efforts to reduce the dangers posed by the enormous weapons arsenal of the former Soviet Union. Continued Russian cooperation with the expanded Comprehensive Threat Reduction programs will have a far greater impact on America's safety from weapons of mass destruction than deploying an NMD system. We must not sacrifice the one for the other. 
   Let me go to the final of the four considerations the President has set forward because I believe that a unilateral decision to deploy a national missile defense system would have a disastrous effect on the international strategic and political environment. It could destabilize our already difficult relationships with Russia and China and undermine our allies' confidence in the reliability of the U.S. defensive commitment. It would jeopardize current hard fought arms control agreements, and it could erode more than 40 years of U.S. leadership on arms control. 
   The administration clearly understands the dangers of a unilateral U.S. deployment. President Clinton was not able to reach agreement with the Russian President, but he has made progress in convincing the Russian leadership that the ballistic missile threat is real. To be clear, I don't support the administration's current proposal, but I do support its effort to work out with Russia this important issue. The next administration needs to complete that task, if we cannot do it in the next months. 
   While simply declaring our intent to deploy a system does not constitute an abrogation of the ABM Treaty, it surely signals that the U.S. withdrawal from the treaty is imminent. 
   Mr. President, the first casualty of such a declaration would be START II. Article 2 paragraph 2 of the Russian instrument of ratification gives Russia the right to withdraw from START II if the U.S. withdraws from or violates the 1972 ABM Treaty. Russia would also probably stop implementation of START I, as well as cooperation with our comprehensive threat reduction program. I don't have time at this moment to go through the full picture of the threat reduction problems. But suffice it to say that really the most immediate and urgent threat the United States faces are the numbers of weapons on Russian soil with a command and control system that is increasingly degraded, and the single highest priority of the United States now is keeping the comprehensive threat reduction program on target. To lose that by a unilateral statement of our intention to proceed would be one of the most dramatic losses of the last 40 to 50 years.  
   So continued cooperation with Russia on these arms control programs is critical. Furthermore, no matter how transparent we are with Russia about the intent and capabilities of the proposed system, Russia's military leadership will interpret a unilateral deployment as a direct threat to their deterrence capacity. And while Russia doesn't have the economic strength today to significantly enhance its military capabilities, there are clear examples of Russia's capacity to wield formidable military power when it wants. We must not allow a unilateral NMD deployment to provoke the Russian people into setting aside the difficult but necessary tasks of democratization and economic reform in a vain effort to return to Russia's days of military glory. 
   Finally, with regard to Russia, a unilateral deployment by the United States would jeopardize our cooperation on a whole range of significant issues. However imperfect it is, U.S.-Russian cooperation will continue to be important on matters from stopping Teheran's proliferation efforts and containing Iraq's weapons programs to promoting stability in the Balkans. 
   While the impact of a limited U.S. system on Russian security considerations would be largely perceptual, at least as long as that system remains limited, its impact on China's strategic posture is real and immediate. China today has roughly 20-plus long-range missiles. The proposed system would undermine China's strategic deterrent as surely as it would contain the threat from North Korea. And that poses a problem because, unlike North Korea, China has the financial resources to build a much larger arsenal. 
   The Pentagon believes it is likely that China will increase the number and sophistication of its long-range missiles just as part of its overall military modernization effort, regardless of what we do on NMD. But as with Russia, if an NMD decision is made without consultation with China, the leadership in Beijing will perceive the deployment as at least partially directed at them. And given the recent strain in U.S.-China relations and uncertainty in the Taiwan Strait, the vital U.S. national interest in maintaining stability in the Pacific would, in fact, be greatly undermined by such a decision made too rashly. 
   Nobody understands the destabilizing effect of a unilateral U.S. NMD decision better than our allies in Europe and in the Pacific. The steps that Russia and China would take to address their insecurities about the U.S. system will make their neighbors less secure. And a new environment of competition and distrust will undermine regional stability by impeding cooperation on proliferation, drug trafficking, humanitarian crises, and all the other transnational problems we are confronting together. So I think it is critical that we find a way to deploy an NMD without sending even a hint of a message that the security of the American people is becoming decoupled from that of our allies. In Asia, both South Korea and Japan have the capability to deploy nuclear programs of their own. Neither has done so, in part, because both have great confidence in the integrity the U.S. security guarantees 
   and in the U.S. nuclear umbrella that extends over them. They also believe that, while China does aspire to be a regional power, the threat it poses is best addressed through engagement and efforts to anchor China in the international community. Both of these assumptions would be undermined by a unilateral U.S. NMD deployment. 
   First, our ironclad security guarantees will be perceived by the Japanese, by the South Koreans, and others, as somewhat rusty if we pursue a current NMD proposal to create a shield over the U.S. territory. U.S. cities would no longer be vulnerable to the same threats from North Korea that Seoul and Tokyo would continue to face. And so they would say: Well, there is a decoupling; we don't feel as safe as we did. Maybe now we have to make decisions to nuclearize ourselves in order to guarantee our own safety. 
   China's response to a unilateral U.S. NMD will make it, at least in the short term, a far greater threat to regional stability than it poses today. If South Korea and Japan change their perceptions both of the threat they face and of U.S. willingness to protect them, they then could both be motivated to explore independent means of boosting their defenses. Then it becomes a world of greater tensions, not lesser tensions. It becomes a world of greater hair-trigger capacity, not greater safety-lock capacity. 
   Our European allies have expressed the same concerns about decoupling as I have expressed about Asia. We certainly cannot dismiss the calculations that Great Britain, France, and Germany will make about the impact of the U.S. NMD system. But I believe their concerns hinge largely on the affect a unilateral decision would have on Russia, concerns that would be greatly ameliorated if we make the NMD decision with Russia's cooperation. 
   Finally, much has been made of the impact a U.S. national missile defense system would have and what it would do to the international arms control regime. For all of the reasons I have just discussed, a unilateral decision would greatly damage U.S. security interests. I want to repeat that. It will, in fact, damage U.S. security interests. 
   The history of unilateral steps in advancing strategic weapons shows a very clear pattern of sure response and escalation. In 1945, the United States exploded the first atomic bomb. The Soviets followed in 1949. In 1948, we unveiled the first nuclear-armed intercontinental bomber. The Soviets followed in 1955. In 1952, we exploded the first hydrogen bomb. The Soviets followed 1 year later. In 1957, the Soviets beat us, for the one time, and launched the first satellite into orbit and perfected the first ICBM. We followed suit within 12 months. In 1960, the United States fired the first submarine-launched ballistic missile. The Soviets followed in 1968. In 1964, we developed the first multiple warhead missile and reentry vehicle; we tested the first MIRV. The Soviets MIRVed in 1973, and so on, throughout the cold war, up until the point that we made a different decision--the ABM Treaty and reducing the level of nuclear weapons. 
   The rationale for testing and deploying a missile defense is to make America and the world safer. It is to defend against a threat, however realistic, of a rogue state/terrorist launch of an ICBM, or an accidental launch. No one has been openly suggesting a public rationale at this time of a defense against any and all missiles, such as the original Star Wars envisioned, but some have not given up on that dream. It is, in fact, the intensity and tenacity of their continued advocacy for such a system that drives other people's fears of what the U.S. may be up to and which significantly complicates the test of selling even a limited and legitimately restrained architecture. 
   Mr. President, in diplomacy--as in life--other nations and other people make policies based not only on real fears, or legitimate reactions to an advocacy/nonfriend's actions, but they also make choices based on perceived fears--on worst case scenarios defined to their leaders by experts. We do the same thing. 
   The problem with unilaterally deployed defense architecture is that other nations may see intentions and long-term possibilities that negatively affect their sense of security, just as it did throughout the cold war. 
   For instance, a system that today is limited, but exclusively controlled by us and exclusively within our technological capacity is a system that they perceive could be expanded and distributed at any time in the future to completely alter the balance of power--the balance of terror as we have thought of it. That may sound terrific to us and even be good for us for a short period of time--but every lesson of the arms race for the last 55 years shows that the advantage is short lived, the effect is simply to require everyone to build more weapons at extraordinary expense, and the advantage is inevitably wiped out with the world becoming a more dangerous place in the meantime. That is precisely why the ABM treaty was negotiated--to try to limit the unbridled competition, stabilize the balance and create a protocol by which both sides could confidently reduce weapons. 
   The negotiation of the ABM Treaty put an end to this cycle of ratcheting up the strategic danger. After 20 years of trying to outdo each other--building an increasingly dangerous, increasingly unstable strategic environment in the process--we recognized that deploying strategic defenses, far from  making us safer, would only invite a response and an escalation of the danger. There is no reason to believe that a unilateral move by the United States to alter the strategic balance would not have the same affect today as it had for forty years. At the very least, it would stop and probably reverse the progress we have made on strategic reductions. And it will reduce our capacity to cooperate with Russia on the single greatest threat we face, which are the ``loose nukes'' existing in the former Soviet Union. 
   Under START I levels, both sides agree to reduce those arsenals to 6,500 warheads. Under START II, those levels 
   come down to 3,500 warheads. And we are moving toward further reductions in our discussions on START III, down to 2,000 warheads. With every agreement, the American people are safer. A unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty would stop this progress in its tracks. No NMD system under consideration can make us safe enough to justify such a reckless act. 
   I strongly disagree with my colleagues who argue that the United States is no longer bound by our legal obligations under the ABM Treaty. No president has ever withdrawn us from the Treaty, and President Clinton has reaffirmed our commitment to it. We retain our obligations to the Treaty under international law, and those obligations continue to serve us well. It would never have been possible to negotiate reductions in U.S. and Soviet strategic forces without the ABM Treaty's limit on national missile defense. The Russians continue to underscore that linkage. And since, as I've already argued, Russia's strategic arsenal continues to pose a serious threat to the United States and her allies, we must not take steps--including the unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty--that will undermine our efforts to reduce and contain that threat. 
   However, the strategic situation we confront today is worlds apart from the one we faced in 1972, and we must not artificially limit our options as we confront the emerging threats to our security. Under the forward-deployed boost-phase system I have described, the United States would need to seek Russian agreement to change the 1997 ABM Treaty Demarcation agreements, which establish the line between theater missile defense systems that are not limited by the Treaty and the strategic defenses the Treaty proscribes. In a nutshell, these agreements allow the United States to deploy and test the PAC-3, THAAD and Navy Theater-Wide TMD systems, but prohibit us from developing or testing capabilities that would enable these systems to shoot down ICBMs. 
   As long as we are discussing ABM Treaty amendments with Russia, we should work with them to develop a new concept of strategic defense. A boost-phase intercept program would sweep away the line between theater and long-range missile defense. But by limiting the number of interceptors that could be deployed and working with Russia, China, and our allies, so that we move multilaterally, we can maximize the transparency of the system, we can strike the right balance between meeting new and emerging threats without abandoning the principles of strategic stability that have served us well for decades. 
   The most important challenge for U.S. national security planners in the years ahead will be to work with our friends and allies to develop a defense against the threat that has been defined. But how we respond to that threat is critical. We must not rush into a politically driven decision on something as critical as this; on something that has the potential by any rational person's thinking to make us less secure--not more secure. 
   I urge President Clinton to delay the deployment decision indefinitely. I believe, even while the threat we face is real and growing, that it is not imminent. We have the time. We need to take the time to develop and test the most effective defense, and we will need time to build international support for deploying a limited, effective system. 
   I believe that support will be more forthcoming when we are seen to be responding to a changing security environment rather than simply buckling to political pressure. 
   For 40 years, we have led international efforts to reduce and contain the danger from nuclear weapons. We can continue that leadership by exploiting our technological strengths to find a system that will extend that defense to our friends and allies but not abrogate the responsibilities of leadership with a hasty, shortsighted decision that will have lasting consequences. 
   I hope in the days and months ahead my colleagues will join me in a thoughtful and probing analysis of these issues so we can together make the United States stronger and not simply make this an issue that falls prey to the political dialog in the year 2000. 
   I thank my colleagues for their time. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join Senator MOYNIHAN in introducing the Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000. I commend the Senator from New York for his leadership on this issue, and I look forward to working with Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator ROCKEFELLER and others in this critical effort to ensure the rapid deployment of high-speed telecommunications services to all Americans. 
   Mr. President, throughout the course of history, prosperity has flowed to those economies that had ready access to avenues of commerce. Throughout the middle ages and up until the mid-19th century, that meant ready proximity to a waterway. The great cities of Italy, England and France all lay on oceans or rivers. In North America, the early trading points on or near the Atlantic thrived and became New York, Boston, Philadelphia and Baltimore. Throughout this time, the primary way to ship goods was over water, and economies prospered along oceans or major inland waterways because of the paramount importance of access to commerce. With the industrial revolution came the advent of the railroad and this new way of getting goods to market. If your town was fortunate to be along one of many rail lines, then good economic times often lay ahead. If your town was not along the railroad, then you were at a serious economic disadvantage. We read today about the ``ghost towns'' of the old West--these were the towns left behind because the railroad passed them by. And even then, one hundred seventy years ago, we know that Americans did all they could to connect themselves to the networks--waterways, railroads--that delivered goods to market: along the Panhandle, the entire town of Ivanhoe, Oklahoma literally uprooted itself--picked up the church, the school, the buildings--and moved across the Texas border to be closer to the railroad lines. 
   In many ways, that is precisely the challenge facing thousands of communities across the nation today: communities are rushing and hurrying--and too many are struggling and finding it enormously difficult--to get connected to the networks on which we conduct business in the New Economy. And, Mr. President, unless we are willing to countenance thousands of ghost towns across the landscape of the 21st century--ghost towns of inner city and rural America--we must work together to empower every community to meet that challenge. 
   Mr. President, today, the major product in the United States is information. The ability to send and receive vast amounts of information, quickly and efficiently, often determines the success or failure of a company in our new information age. For this reason, companies are locating where they have high-speed access to this new avenue of commerce, and they are shying away from areas where such excess is either prohibitively expensive or unavailable. High-speed access is also  providing new opportunities in terms of educating our children and caring for the sick. However, those opportunities are available only to those communities with efficient and affordable access to high-speed lines. 
   Herein lies the problem. As would be expected, telecommunications companies are deploying advanced networks initially in areas where there are lots of attractive consumers, but are often taking their time to build-out elsewhere, such as in low-income urban and rural areas. That's why a downtown business consumer has a myriad of choices for high-speed access. And most residential consumers living in reasonable well-off urban and suburban areas also have a 
   choice. However, many, many regions of our country still have little or no ability to obtain high-speed access to the Internet. 
   According to the Massachusetts Technology Collaborative, of the 351 towns in Massachusetts, only 164 are wired to receive high-speed DSL Internet service, and only 145 are wired to receive high-speed cable modem service. Significantly, 151 towns have no DSL or cable modem option, only 56 kilobit dial-up Internet service. Moreover, this situation is not expected to change anytime soon. The Legg Mason Precursor groups estimates that even three or fours years down the road, half of America will have either one or zero broadband providers to choose from. 
   We need to address this problem in order to ensure that no area is left behind--to ensure that all Americans are able to benefit from our new high-tech economy. Many telecommunications companies legitimately argue that deploying in certain areas makes little sense because the opportunity to recoup the investment is so small. It's time we listened and offered an economic incentive to change the equation. To this end, our bill establishes a generous 10 percent tax credit to all companies willing to deploy and offer 1.5 megabit high-speed Internet service in rural and low-income urban areas. We are advocating such an approach because we have heard from industry that this will provide a needed incentive to deploy in areas that are presently neglected. Significantly, this credit is open to all companies be they telephone or cable, wireline or wireless, MMDS or satellite. The bill is concerned only with encouraging widespread deployment, and is absolutely technology neutral. 
   Mr. President, our legislation addresses not only the digital divide that exists today, but also looks to the future and to the next generation of high-speed services. The next generation of advanced services will require substantially higher transmission speeds like 4 megabits for one channel of standard television, 20 megabits for one channel of HDTV, and 10 to 100 megabits for Ethernet data. These transmission speeds can only be achieved with more advanced technology such as fiber optics, very high speed digital subscriber line, 50-home-node cable modems, and next-generation wireless. 
   The services available at such speeds will truly revolutionize and improve our daily lives. However, according to economists from the American Enterprise Institute, at the current rate of deployment, such advanced technology will not achieve universal penetration until somewhere between 2030 and 2040. Furthermore, such delay may seriously undermine our global leadership in technology. Indeed, according to a recent report in the Wall Street Journal, the Japanese company NTT will start bringing optical fiber lines directly to homes in Tokyo and Osaka by the end of this year. Such networks will have capabilities of up to 10 megabits downstream--several times faster than most of the high-speed services offered today in America. 
   Such Internet capability will transform American life in ways we can only imagine today. Children can download educational video in real time on nearly any subject. Adults can train for new jobs from their homes. Complex medical images such as MRIs and x-rays that today take several minutes to download can be transmitted in a matter of seconds. Telecommuting, business teleconferencing and personal communication will all rise to new levels. 
   To accelerate the roll-out of such next-generation systems in the US, we propose to establish a 20 percent tax credit for companies that deploy systems capable of providing 22 megabit downstream/10 megabit upstream service to residential consumers everywhere and business consumers in low-income urban and rural areas. Such bits speeds will allow for different users in a home to simultaneously watch 3 different channels of digital television and utilize high-speed Ethernet-comparable Internet access. 
   Mr. President, this measure is intended to begin the debate in the Senate on how best to address the growing digital divide and to accelerate the deployment of next-generation technologies across our nation. I want to thank Senator MOYNIHAN for his extraordinary leadership on this issue and his staff for their continued hard work in crafting this bill. I also wish to commend Senators ROCKEFELLER and SNOWE for their work on tax credit legislation which we incorporate and expand on in this bill. Finally, I wish to extend my gratitude to all the members of industry who worked with us over these past few months in crafting this bill. Clearly, this is a very complex topic and we are continuing to work to find the right solution. I look forward to continuing our partnership and to passing meaningful legislation this year. 
   The challenge today is extraordinary--its implications absolutely unmistakable for our country. Too often we talk about a digital divide in the United States as if it were unchangeable, as if it were a simple fact of life in this nation that some communities will be empowered by technology while others will be left behind. But this is a false choice--and we ought to be doing everything in our power as policy makers, working harmoniously with industry, to offer a new choice: every community connected to the new technology, every citizen provided with the tools to make the most of their own talents in the New Economy. 
   Mr. President, The Broadband Internet Access Act of 2000 is not a panacea for every challenge before us in the New Economy; significant questions of education reform workforce development, and technology training must be resolved and reinvented before mere access to technology will allow full participation for every citizen in the Information Age. But Mr. President, I ask that--as we work in a bipartisan way to address those other vital areas of public policy-- we remember the lessons of our nation's economic history and take this absolutely critical first step towards meeting the most basic needs of any community--a connection to the New Economy.

   Mr. KERRY. I agree. I understand. 
   The Senator is correct. The Russian Duma ratified START II with the understanding that they had to have the successor states to the ABM Treaty ultimately recognized by the United States, and there are a series of bilateral agreements they want us to ratify, and because the Senator from North Carolina, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, is fundamentally opposed to these changes, we are stuck. But the larger interests of the United States of America are to make the world and this country safer. 
   We decided, as a matter of policy, I say to the Senator from Virginia, that the world will be safer if we move to reduce weapons to the levels of START II. In fact, it is the policy of the United States of America now to engage in negotiations toward START III, but no one whom I know, who is rational at least--and I absolutely include the distinguished chairman of the Armed Services Committee as among the most rational and most thoughtful people on this subject--nobody is suggesting that we would not want to reduce from the level of 6,000-plus warheads and try to move in the direction of START II. I assume the Senator agrees.

   Mr. KERRY. I interpret what the candidate, George W. Bush, said somewhat differently, and I read his speech closely the other day. 
   It was my understanding he said he is prepared to unilaterally reduce weapons no matter what the Russians do. He also wants to accompany that with a fairly robust national missile defense system. 
   I again say to my colleague, I think the Senator from Nebraska is on target. Look, the former Soviet Union, what remains of it, Russia, has an extraordinarily weak command and control system. 
   As a current member of the Intelligence Committee, and the Senator from Virginia shares that, we know full well that one of the greatest single threats to the United States of America today is threat reduction efforts. To suggest that the United States, that our citizens, are safer with more warheads and more active missiles being left in place, with an army that is not being paid, with command and control that is disintegrating and degrading, is a very hard thing for me to understand.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is ironic that a Democrat would be here interpreting the words of the putative Republican nominee. But let me say to my colleague, he very clearly talked about unilateral reductions. His father, President Bush, also was supportive of and negotiated the policy of START II and wanted to move in that direction. 
   Now START II takes us down to 3,000 warheads. I do not know anybody in  the world of nuclear assessments--you look at 
   the SIOPs. I think there are public targeting figures that do not violate classification. But I will be careful with this because I do not want to violate it. 
   Let me just say that the Senator well knows that the SIOPs plans of the United States have a number of targets that are well taken care of by the current levels of START II, which is why the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Pentagon, and everybody signed off on it. 
   In today's world, in a non-cold-war world, the greatest threat is a rusty freighter hobbling its way into New York Harbor, or nearby, and has the potential to launch a cruise missile at us, or the greater threat is some group of terrorists assembling in New York the multiple parts of a nuclear weapon and holding us hostage, or, as we saw in Japan with the sarin gas attack, terrorists who want to cripple the community through chemical or biological warfare. 
   Those threats chill me far more than the concept of reducing to 3,000 weapons over the course of the next years. It is going to happen. No matter what the Senator from Virginia says about the next quadrennial review, I am willing to bet my seat in the Senate that this country is going to move, together with others, to reduce the levels of weapons to at least 3,000. The debate today is not whether we ought to be at 3,000. The debate today is whether or not 1,000, 1,500, 2,200 to 2,500 are the appropriate levels. 
   So why on Earth we would want to hobble the ability of the President of the United States to make this country safer by reducing to the level already agreed upon by Republican and Democrat negotiators alike is absolutely beyond me.

   Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my friend, he talks about the law of the land. When you sign a treaty and the Senate has ratified it, it is the law of the land. Technically speaking, under international law, it is the law of the land when you sign it. When it is ratified, it is even more so the law of the land. 
   I realize that technically speaking the SALT II does not, in effect, go into full effect until we pass on the codicils. But that is such a technicality in the context of what we are trying to achieve in the world. We are the leader of the free world. We used to be the most important force in the world for nonproliferation efforts. We used to make the most important efforts to try to encourage other countries to toe the line on nuclear weapons. 
   If we are now going to suggest that having put into law and ratified a treaty, we are unwilling to reduce these levels of nuclear weapons at a time we know Russia is growing more and more unsafe in its capacity to maintain them, we are not acting in the interests of the American people and making them safer. 
   I say respectfully to my friend from Virginia, in the next 6 months there is ample opportunity for any President to step in, a new President, and say: I do not want to continue these levels. But we have an opportunity here to make the law of the land on this bill in effect carry through properly. I strongly hope my colleagues will do so because it is the right thing to do. 
   I thank the Senator from Nebraska.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, last night, the FTC released its report on Internet privacy. We are, all of us, in the midst of an Internet revolution in this country. It is extraordinary, when we think about it, to take note of the fact that the Internet has only been in existence about 6 or 7 years now. During that time, it has had a profound impact on everybody's life, particularly on business, and increasingly on consumer opportunity. 
   I have tremendous respect for the work the FTC has done on this issue. Its monitoring of web sites and the convening of working groups have been very helpful in educating all of us on a very complicated new arena. The FTC plays an important role in oversight and regulating our economy, and I think it is fair to say that its Commissioners have navigated admirably through the complexity of the new economy. 
   But--and here is the ``but,'' Mr. President--at this particular moment in time, I very respectfully disagree with the regulatory approach to Internet privacy proposed by the FTC. Let me be clear. Yes, consumers have a legitimate expectation of privacy on the Internet, and they will demand it, and I personally want that right of privacy protected. But I also believe that they want an Internet that is free and that gives them more choices rather than fewer. I believe that a regulatory approach mandated by in-depth, detailed congressional legislation at this particular point in time could actually harm consumers in the long run by limiting their choices on the Internet. 
   On the Internet today, we can buy and sell anything. We can research everything from health information to sports scores to movie reviews. We can keep track of our stock portfolios, tomorrow's weather, and the news throughout the world. And we do most of that free of charge. The reason we can surf from page to page for free is because the Internet, like television, is supported by advertising--or is struggling to be supported by advertising. Obviously, access is by subscription in most cases; but the point is that advertising is increasingly growing. Business spent more than $1.9 billion to advertise on the web in 1998, with spending on electronic advertising expected to climb to $6.7 billion by 2001. 
   It is this advertising that is the reason we don't have a subscription-based Internet--at least at this point in time. That would clearly limit a lot of people's online activities, and it would contribute to the so-called digital divide. Instead, we have an Internet that we can freely explore. It is my sense that people like this model of the Internet, and they understand that the banner ads they see on their screens are necessary in order to try to keep the Internet free. 
   What I don't think people understand is that, at least for now, the model for Internet advertising is going to include ads that are narrowly targeted to particular customers. The jury is still out on whether a targeted model is going to work. Currently, the click-through rates--the average percentage of web surfers who click on any single banner ad have fallen below the 1-percent mark, compared with about 2 percent in 1998. Some see that as a sign that the advertising model on the Internet has failed. Others say the percentages are lower, but that is because more and more ads are being placed. What it tells me is that it is simply too soon for the Congress of the United States to step in and prevent that model from running its course. If, for the time being, we allow or acknowledge that the economy of the Internet calls for targeted advertising, we must also recognize that it won't attract customers if they believe their privacy is being violated. 
   Finding the fine balance of permitting enough free flow of information to allow ads to work and protecting consumers' privacy is going to be critical if the Internet is going to reach its full potential. I believe that we in Congress have a role to play in finding that balance, although we should tread very lightly in doing so. 
   In the past, I have argued that self-regulation was the best answer for consumers and the high-tech industry itself in relation to privacy. I hope we can continue to focus on self-regulation because Congress will, frankly, never be light-footed enough--nor fast-footed enough--to keep up with the technological changes that are taking place in the online world. 
   However, poll after poll shows that consumers are anxious that their privacy is not being protected when they go on line. 
   For example, a 1999 survey by the National Consumers League found 73 percent of online users are not comfortable providing credit card or financial information online and 70 percent are uncomfortable giving out personal information to businesses online. Moreover, due to privacy concerns, 42 percent of those who use the Internet are using it solely to gather information rather than to make purchases online. 
   Likewise, a Business Week survey in March 2000 noted that concern over privacy on the Internet is rising. A clear majority--57 percent--favor some sort of law regulating how personal information is collected and used. According to Business Week, regulation may become essential to the continued growth of e-commerce, since 41 percent of online shoppers say they are very concerned over the use of personal information, up from 31 percent two year ago. Perhaps more telling, among people who go online but have not shopped there, 63 percent are very concerned, up from 52 percent two years ago. 
   In addition to it being too early in the process for Congress to embark on sweeping legislation, I believe there are still a number of fundamental questions that we need to answer. The first is whether there is a difference between privacy in the offline and online worlds. 
   I think polls like that are the result of the failure, so far, of industry to take the necessary initiative to protect consumers' privacy. But we should not neglect to notice that industry is making progress. When the Federal Trade Commission testified before the Commerce Committee about this time last year, it cited studies showing that roughly two-thirds of some of the busiest Web sites had some form of disclosure of privacy policies. This year, the FTC reports that 90 percent of sites have disclosure policies. Likewise, last year the FTC found that only 10 percent of sites implemented the four core privacy principles of notice, choice, access and security. This year the FTC reports that figure at 20 percent. That is still not high enough, but this is a five-year-old industry. We've seen significant improvements without the need for intrusive congressional intervention. It is simply too soon to write off a market driven approach to privacy. 
   Most of us don't think about it. But I want to make a point about the distinction between the offline and online world. When you go to the supermarket and you walk into any store and swish your card through the checkout scanner, that scanner has a record of precisely what you bought. In effect, today in the offline world, people are getting extraordinarily detailed information about what you are purchasing. The question, therefore, is to be asked: Is there some kind of preference about what happens at the supermarket, or any other kind of store, and is that somehow less protected than the choice you make online? 
   Likewise, catalog companies compile and use offline information to make marketing decisions. These companies rent lists compiled by list brokers. The list brokers obtain marketing data and names from the public domain and governments, credit bureaus, financial institutions, credit card companies, retail establishments, and other catalogers and mass mailers. 
   I have been collecting the catalogs that I have received just in the last few weeks from not one online purchase, and I have been targeted by about 50 catalogs just on the basis of offline purchases that have been made and not because of an online existence. 
   Even in politics, off-line privacy protections may be less than those we are already seeing online. For example, we all know that campaigns can and do get voter registration lists from their states and can screen based on how often individuals vote. They will take this data and add names from magazines--Democrats could use the New Republic and Republicans might choose  the National Review--and advocacy groups, and target all of them. With those combined lists, campaigns decide which potential voters to target for which mailings. The campaigns will also often share lists with each other and with party committees. All of this goes on offline. 
   On the other hand, when I go to the shopping mall and I walk into a store and look at five different items, five sweaters, or five pairs of pants, whatever it may be, and I don't buy any of them, there is no record of them at all. But there is a record of that kind of traveling or perusal, if you will, with respect to the web. 
   There are clearly questions that we have to resolve with respect to what kind of anonymity can be protected with respect to the online transaction. 
   I just do not think this is the moment for us to legislate. I think we need to study the issue of access very significantly. 
   There is a general agreement that consumers should have access to information that they provided to a web site. We still don't know whether it is necessary or proper to have consumers have access to all of the information that is gathered about an individual. 
   Should consumers have access to click-stream data or so-called derived data by which a company uses compiled information to make a marketing decision about the consumer? And if we decide that consumers need some access for this type of information, is it technologically feasible? Will there be unforeseen or unintended consequences such as an increased risk of security breaches? Will there be less rather than more privacy due to the necessary coupling of names and data? 
   Again, I don't believe we have the answers, and I don't believe we are in a position to regulate until we have thoroughly examined and experienced the work on those issues. 
   I disagree with those who think that this is the time for heavy-handed legislation from the Congress. Nevertheless, I believe we can legislate the outlines of a structure in which we provide some consumer protections and in which we set certain goals with which we encourage the consumer to familiarize themselves while we encourage the companies to develop the technology and the capacity to do it. 
   Clearly, opting in is a principle that most people believe ought to be maximized. Anonymity is a principle that most people believe can help cure most of the ills of targeted sales. For instance, you don't need to know if it is John Smith living on Myrtle Street. You simply need to know how many times a particular kind of purchase may have been made in a particular demographic. And it may be possible to maintain the anonymity and provide the kind of protection without major legislation. It seems to me that most companies will opt for that. 
   In addition to that, we need to resolve the question of how much access an individual will have to their own information, and what rights they will have with respect to that. 
   Finally, we need to deal with the question of enforcement, which will be particularly important. It is one that we need to examine further. I believe that there is much for us to examine. We should not, in a sense, intervene in a way that will have a negative impact on the extraordinary growth of the Internet, even as we protect privacy and establish some principles by which we should guide ourselves. I believe that the FTC proposal reaches too far in that regard. 
   I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in an effort to embrace goals without the kind of detailed intrusion that has been suggested. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, women-owned businesses have scored a double victory today. President Clinton and a bi-partisan coalition of Senators have unveiled separate but complementary national policies to increase procurement opportunities for businesses owned by women. 
   Though on its face Federal procurement may not sound like an important issue to the general public, or even a term that many recognize, it is one of the most lucrative, yet difficult, markets for small businesses to access, particularly those owned by women and under-represented minorities. For example, in 1999, women-owned businesses made up 38 percent of all businesses but received only 2.4 percent of the $189 billion in Federal prime contracts. We can do better. And, before we enact new laws, we should promote and enforce the ones we have. 
   First, I want to offer my strong support and sincere compliments to President Clinton for signing an executive order today that reaffirms and strengthens the executive branch's commitment to meeting the five-percent procurement goal for women-owned businesses. His staff has worked for months with the Small Business Administration, SBA, the National Women's Business Council, the Women's Coalition for Access to Procurement, Women First, Women's Construction Owners and Executives, and the Women's Business Enterprise National Council to draft a feasible plan to help Federal agencies and departments increase the number of contracts awarded to businesses owned by women. Announcing that plan this afternoon is timely. 
   Today I join my colleague Senator BOND to introduce a resolution that encourages the President to adopt a policy that reinforces and enforces a procurement law Congress passed in 1994. That law, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act, established a government-wide goal for all heads of Federal departments and agencies to award five percent of their prime and subcontracts to women-owned businesses. First, this resolution asks the President to adopt a policy that supports the law and encourages agencies and departments to meet the goal. Second, this resolution asks the President to reinforce the law by holding the heads of agencies and departments accountable for meeting the five-percent goal. 
   I believe the President's executive order goes beyond the Senate's request and establishes a strong system within the Federal Government for increasing the number of contracts that go to women-owned businesses. I think it is very smart to hire an Assistant Administrator for Women's Procurement within the SBA's Office of Government Contracting. Increasing opportunities for women-owned businesses is a full-time job and devoting staff to this area is good use of resources. 
   I also think it is good policy for the Assistant Administrator to evaluate the agencies' contracting records on a semi-annual basis. This has two benefits. One, it encourages the procurement offices to run their operations like good small businesses. If you ask, most business owners will tell you that a key to running a successful business is having a solid business plan and regularly measuring your costs against revenues and projecting adequate inventory or staff to meet the demands of your products or services. I think it is a very good idea for contracting officers to do the same. Two, this policy  allows the SBA to work with an agency that is not meeting its goal midway through the year rather than finding out at the end of the year when it is too late. 
   Lastly, I like the Administration's plan because it takes a holistic approach to procurement. Rather than just focusing on the agencies and departments, it requires the Assistant Administrator to organize training and development seminars that teach women entrepreneurs about the complex world of Federal procurement and the SBA's procurement programs. It will be much easier for women-owned businesses to compete for Federal contracts if they understand the process and how to find out about opportunities. 
   I think it is important to note that while the government as a whole is not contracting as it should with women-owned firms, there are some outstanding exceptions. Some Federal agencies have taken the lead in working with women owned firms, and should be congratulated. According to the Federal Procurement Data System, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the Federal Mine Safety & Health Review Commission, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and the Small Business Administration have all not only met the five percent goal, but have come in at around fifteen percent or better. That is three times the goal set by Congress. 
   These Federal agencies know that working with women-owned firms is not simply an altruistic exercise. These firms are strong, dependable and do good work. These firms provide a solid service to their customer, and the Federal contracting officers know it. In total, 20 Federal agencies either met or exceeded the five percent goal. 
   Therefore, we know that it is indeed possible for Government agencies to meet the five percent goal. With this resolution, it is our hope that agencies will work harder, following the examples of the agencies I discussed earlier, to contract with women-owned firms. 
   I've supported many initiatives over the years to increase resources and opportunities for businesses owned by women. Most recently, I supported Senator LANDRIEU's legislation to re-authorize the National Women's Business Council for 3 years, and to increase the annual appropriation from $600,000 to $1 million. Part of that increase will be used to assist Federal agencies meet the five-percent procurement goal for women-owned businesses. The Council has provided great leadership in this area, making increased contracting opportunities a priority since it was created in 1988, and earned praise from Democrats and Republicans for two extensive procurement studies it published in 1998 and 1999. The first study tracked 11 years of Federal contracting so that we have measurable data, and the second study identified and analyzed public and private sector practices that have been successful in increasing contracting opportunities for women business owners. The additional resources will allow the Council to build on that study and put the information to good use, ultimately increasing competitive contracting opportunities for businesses owned by women. 
   In addition to supporting reauthorization of the National Women's Business Council, last year I introduced the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999. Now public law, that legislation is helping Centers address the funding constraints that have been making it increasingly difficult for them to sustain the level of services they provide after they graduate from the Women's Business Centers program and no longer receive federal matching funds. It is important to note that SBA requires Women's Business Centers to provide procurement training. 
   As part of that bill, we passed an amendment addressing Federal procurement opportunities for women-owned small businesses. The amendment expressed the sense of the Senate that the General Accounting Office should conduct an audit on the federal procurement system for the preceding three years. Unlike the Council's previous studies and reports that focused on data and best practices, this report was to focus on why the agencies haven't met the congressionally mandated five-percent procurement goal for small businesses owned by women. 
   Mr. President, the Federal agencies have begun to make progress since Congress enacted the five-percent procurement goal, but I want the contracting managers to remember that this goal is a minimum, not a maximum. Out of the more than 9 million businesses owned by women in this country, I believe that the Federal Government can find ones that are qualified and reliable, with good products and services, to fill their contracts if they make it a priority. 
   I believe that the President's Executive Order establishes a strong system within the Federal Government for increasing the number of contracts that go to women-owned businesses, and I look forward to seeing the Federal departments and agencies meet the five-percent goal this year, as the Senate resolution emphasizes.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my great privilege today to introduce to my colleagues in the Senate a very special person who is here with us, a long time friend of mine and a true leader, nationally as well as in Massachusetts, the Rev. Eugene Rivers. 
   Reverend Rivers is the pastor of the Azusa Christian Community in Four Corners, which is an inner-city community in Boston. He honored the Senate today by delivering our opening prayer, asking particularly that each and every one of us are bestowed with the wisdom to turn our fears into courage so that we will have the power to make good decisions even in bad situations. I think those words are particularly important to us in the context of this debate in the last few days. 
   Not only should we be touched by Gene Rivers' words this morning, but I emphasize to my colleagues the degree to which the words of this person of the cloth and the acts of life come from his heart. As someone who knows him and has worked with him and has been inspired by him, I can tell my colleagues that he is the living embodiment of the words he shared with us today. Those words reflect the important work that he has made his life's work--walking often in places of danger, always in places of difficulty, in order to try to bring the word of God and the spirit to our fellow citizens--in fact, the citizens of the world. 
   Gene Rivers comes from a place that understands some of the toughest fights in our country. He was born and raised in south Chicago and in northwest Philadelphia. He found himself in a bad situation as a gang member. He was struggling to break free from the life that he knew was either going to take him to jail or to a cemetery. 
   After, from that difficult life of the streets, Reverend Rivers persevered and he attended Harvard University and then did studies at the Divinity School. Ultimately, he has returned to the streets to live out his inner self in the spirit that commands his life. He has been part of what we call the Boston Miracle. As he puts it, he has let God use him to fight the gangs. Most recently, through his tremendous efforts in Boston, with Operation 2006 and the Baker House, my staff and I have seen Gene Rivers go out into the community, knocking on doors, standing on street corners to develop the services and assistance and the inspiration that so many young people need. He works very closely with the law enforcement authorities in helping to defuse the danger of the gangs. 
   As a consequence of his hands-on efforts, we went through, I think, almost a 2-year period in which we had not one young person killed in the city of Boston. He is consistently working to try to defuse those kinds of situations. Because of his direct hands-on action, Operation 2006 reduces juvenile violence and it brings the community together in ways that perhaps no one in public life could do without that special kind of connection. 
   I might add that, since then, Gene Rivers has tackled a much larger call beyond Massachusetts. The Senate this year has become particularly aware of the devastation taking place in Africa as a result of the AIDS epidemic. Gene Rivers has tackled that issue, challenging leaders in Africa, as well as leaders here, to engage in a candid discussion that tries to bring us all together in a united effort to deal with this terrible scourge. He has helped to make us all aware of the responsibility to do something about this, and he has had an impact. 
   Reverend Rivers was, in fact, the subject of a cover story in Newsweek magazine, I think a little over a year ago. They described him as an ``intellectual burst of firecrackers spinning off ideas and energy.'' 
   He has been called an ``impolitic preacher'' and a man of action. Today, I simply want to thank him for always answering the call of leadership, for battling, from every day for the souls and safety of our inner-city kids to standing up to halt the spread of AIDS throughout Africa. I thank him for being a great voice of our generation, and he graces us with his wisdom and his prayers. I extend my heartfelt thanks to Rev. Eugene Rivers for his guidance, his friendship, and his leadership.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair and the Senator from Michigan. 
   In the 16 years I have been here, I have debated a number of these issues with my colleague from Virginia. We have debated a number of different incursions in various countries, involvement of U.S. troops abroad. There are few people in the Senate I respect as much or have as much affection for as the Senator from Virginia, whose knowledge and patriotism are absolutely unquestionable on subjects such as this. 
   I, as a veteran of Vietnam and as somebody who came back from that war to argue about Congress's capacity and prerogatives to make judgments about our involvement there, have nothing but respect for the position he espouses today about congressional prerogative. It exists. We should respect it. It is a critical component of the balance of power in this country. It is entirely appropriate that Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER ask the Senate to make a judgment about our troops. We should do no less. We owe the American people that judgment. That is one of the great prerogatives of the Senate. 
   What they are asking the Senate to do is, in effect, to make the judgment today that we have reached our limit with respect to the current involvement in Kosovo and we are going to set up a structure for withdrawal. They argue: not at all; there is a vote down the road as to whether or not we will appropriate money. But in point of fact, the way this amendment is structured, the message is clear: The vote is now; the choice is whether or not we believe we should continue to be involved. 
   I do not question that there are aspects of this involvement that I think are not necessarily well thought out even today. I think there are divisions between the ethnic parties in Kosovo that we have not properly thought through as to how we resolve them in the long run. There are aspects of the risks we are asking young American troops, male and female, to bear with which I am uncomfortable. 
   I am not suggesting there aren't ways to strengthen our approach to this, both our responsibilities and European responsibilities. But--here is the ``but''--I ask my colleagues to look at the law as it is set forth in the language of S. 2521. It says: None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available shall be available for the continued deployment of U.S. combat troops in Kosovo after July 1, 2001, unless and until the President does something. 
   What does the President have to do? He has to submit a report to Congress asking for the money to be spent but, most importantly, describing the specific progress made in implementing a plan. 
   What is the plan the President has to describe to Congress on which he is making progress? The plan refers to a subsection (b). If we turn to it, it says very specifically:  
   The President shall develop a plan, in consultation with appropriate foreign governments, by which NATO member countries, with the exception of the United States, and appropriate non-NATO countries will provide, not later than July 1, 2001, any and all ground combat troops necessary to execute Operation Joint Guardian or any successor operation in Kosovo.  
   That means, according to the plan he must now begin to put into effect, he must report to us how far along we are in getting out. There are quarterly target dates that that plan requires us to establish, with 3-month intervals, achieving an orderly transition. There is an interim plan for achieving the objectives not later than September 30, 2000, and then there is the final plan. 
   We are, in effect, being asked to vote today on a plan for withdrawal. We are stating our intention that, absent a future vote at some later time, which has been met with a succession of interim stages of withdrawal, we will have a vote on appropriations. 
   I say to my colleagues, that is not the way to deal with foreign policy generally. It is certainly not the way to deal with this specific issue. Why is it not the way to deal with this specific issue? Well, effectively, we are being asked to vote today as to whether or not we think the investment we made in the war itself is worthwhile. 
   On March 23, 1999, I joined with 57 of our colleagues to vote that we thought there was something worthwhile doing in Kosovo. 
   And we voted to support a resolution that authorized the President to conduct military operations against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. I did so because I believed then, as I believe now, that the U.S. national interest and stability throughout Europe is unquestionable and that the oppression and thuggery of the Milosevic regime not only threatened that stability throughout Europe, but it posed an unacceptable challenge to the humanitarian values of the American people. 
   Mr. President, this Nation committed 50 years and trillions of dollars to protecting the security of Europe through the Marshall Plan. Half a million American troops served in Europe to preserve the peace won by our fathers and grandfathers in World War II. I respectfully suggest that the Senate effectively decided, when we voted to do those military operations, that we were not willing to walk away from the ethnic cleansing in Kosovo because that would have been walking away from the very investment in peace and freedom for which we paid so dearly. It troubles me, then, to say that today some of the most stalwart supporters of our efforts in Kosovo only a year ago would now say that we should effectively put into gear the process of walking away from whatever responsibilities may remain in terms of how we adequately finish the job. 
   I share the frustration of my colleagues that our European allies, whose own stability is so closely tied to peace in the Balkans, have not met their obligations to the Kosovo peacekeeping effort as swiftly and as deftly as we would like. I want to underscore that I think the efforts of Senator BYRD and Senator WARNER have helped to place that responsibility squarely in front of them. 
   Let me ask a simple question of my colleagues. If restoring the peace in Kosovo was in our interest 1 year ago, isn't preserving the peace in Kosovo in our interest today? I don't believe you can separate those obligations. I think the answer is resoundingly yes, it is in our interest today. Some people may rethink their vote, and that is perfectly legitimate. Some people may believe that they misinterpreted that national interest, and they should explain it as such. But I don't understand how this country can clearly define its interest in Europe for the 50 years since World War II and maintain hundreds of thousands of troops in Europe in order to make clear our determination to stay with that peace effort and not be willing to keep 5,000-plus troops in Kosovo, which we all deem to be a component of our European interests. I don't understand that. 
   Are we suggesting that we are not willing to bear any of those risks? Now, I understand as well as anybody the post-Vietnam syndrome and the sort of nervousness people have about putting troops in harm's way. But I am confident that most of my colleagues who have worn the uniform will share with me the belief that that is what you put it on for, and that being in the military is not a cakewalk to get your GI bill so that you can ride on the benefits for the rest of your life; it is assuming certain risks. Sometimes in the national interest of our country--maybe not the vital security interest, but in a security interest, or some level of interest--there are sometimes risks that we have to be willing to bear to achieve our goals. 
   The price of leadership that we have spent so much of our treasure earning is not cheap. You can't fulfill the obligations that we have in the world on the fly. You can't do it on the cheap. I know there are certain questions of 
   readiness and other questions, but there are many choices we make with respect to the entire military budget, national missile defense, and others  that bear significantly on where we spend money and how we spend money. I believe that we won an enormously important victory in terms of the values that drive our foreign policy and on which this country is founded. I think 5,000 troops, the lack of losses, and the extraordinary accomplishments we have gained in this region over the last years say to us that even with the difficulties, this is a policy that, measured against the risk to our troops, is worth pursuing. 
   I ask my colleagues to measure very carefully whether or not they are prepared today to send a message to Milosevic, as well as our allies, that we are not willing to stand the test of time with respect to those obligations and responsibilities. 
   I thank the Chair.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to share just a few words about a good friend we recently lost, someone I have known since I first ran for Lieutenant Governor in Massachusetts in 1982, a good hearted and selfless individual who was always an inspiration, Jo-Ann Molnar. Jo-Ann recently passed away after bravely battling cancer, and I know that I am not alone in saying that as someone whose life was touched by Jo-Ann Molnar's service, activism, and warmth, there is today a deep and profound sense of loss. In Jo-Ann many of us have lost--and today I would like to honor--a committed activist, a person of enormous courage and character and, most simply, a great friend. 
   I first met Jo-Ann Molnar when I became involved in politics in the 1970s. Jo-Ann approached me at one of our earliest events and offered to help in any way she could. Jo-Ann was one of those individuals who--through her commitment to do what is right, through her belief in politics not as sport but as a fight for principle--could reaffirm precisely why politics matters and why public service is worthwhile. 
   Jo-Ann and I remained in touch ever since that first involvement, and I looked forward to and always appreciated Jo-Ann's warm cards and greetings. Always a loyal friend, Jo-Ann would share with me her thoughts on issues of importance, keep me abreast of her accomplishments, and offer me words of encouragement as I worked through the challenges of the United States Senate. 
   It was through her frequent cards and letters--and the occasional happy meeting either in Massachusetts or at political gatherings around the Maryland area--that I learned of the many ways in which Jo-Ann continued to dedicate herself to public service. Her determination to make a difference led her to remarkable achievements. In 1977, Jo-Ann graduated magna cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University, with a degree in history and political science. She went on to earn a master's degree in political science from American University. Jo-Ann selflessly offered her leadership to her fellow Democrats, serving admirably as President of the Montgomery County, Maryland Young Democrats, as Vice Chair of the Handicapped Commission in Montgomery County, and on the Board of Directors of the Montgomery County public libraries. In addition to her help with my campaigns, Jo-Ann served as a legislative intern to U.S. Senator Donald Reigle, U.S. Representative Gene Andrew Maguire, and Montgomery County Council member Michael L. Gudis. She also worked as a Congressional Liaison Assistant for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For almost a decade, Jo-Ann served as a legal researcher for the Human Relations Commission. She gave of herself as a Sunday School teacher and a confirmation teacher at the Foundary United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C, as well as an instructor at Colesville United Methodist Church in Silver Spring, Maryland.  
   Mr. President, Jo-Ann lived a life true to her ideals of service--service to community, service to faith. I would add, though, that none of these achievements would have been possible if Jo-Ann had not worked so hard to overcome cerebral palsy. Jo-Ann refused to be slowed by her disability--and in fact rejected the notion that she should in any way lower her expectations for herself or expect different expectations from those to whom she so selflessly offered her best efforts. Jo-Ann was a fighter, and I continually marveled at her drive to rise above what some would view as limitations. 
   For that reason, Jo-Ann served as one of the best possible advocates and activists for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Honored as a teenager for her activism on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Jo-Ann kept pushing as an adult to break down barriers in our society that she believed kept disabled Americans from maximizing their contributions to their communities and our nation. Jo-Ann was not just an advocate for legislation to protect and empower disabled Americans--she was the living embodiment of those efforts. 
   Mr. President, it is difficult to accept that we have all lost a friend in Jo-Ann Molnar, but it is particularly difficult, I know, for Jo-Ann's family--her mother, Helen, and her two sisters, Dorothy and Ilona. They are in our thoughts and prayers. 
   I was comforted, though, to learn that Jo-Ann was able to enjoy life as she had always done, up until her last days. Jo-Ann's mother, Helen, let me know that she had a wonderful Christmas with her family and was able to attend a New Millennium New Year's Eve celebration, complete with the 60's rock music she loved. Just as she did throughout her life, even in her most difficult days, Jo-Ann kept on doing the things that she loved--and she moved forward in so many remarkable efforts driven by a real sense of social conscience. 
   Mr. President, today I remember Jo-Ann for her service, her friendship, and her kindness. All of us who knew her continue to draw strength from her courage and her faith, and Jo-Ann's life continues to inspire.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to lend my support to the Daschle sense of the Senate, which commends the organizers and marchers of the Million Mom March and urges the juvenile justice conference include the Senate-passed gun control measures in its report and to issue its report by the Memorial Day recess. I support the gun control measures that are contained in the juvenile justice bill that was debated and passed by the Senate last July and I sincerely hope that the conference will meet to finish their work on this critically important bill. 
   I am deeply troubled by the numbers of people--and particularly the number of children--that are wounded or killed by gunfire each year. And, Mr. President, I know that all of America understands that the impact of gun violence on children is staggering. Listen to some of these statistics, Mr. President: The National Center for Health Statistics found that in 1997 almost 12 children died every day from gunfire. The gun homicide rate for children under 15 is sixteen times higher in the U.S. than in 25 other industrialized nations combined. Between 1979 and 1997, gunfire killed nearly 80,000 children and teens in America--25,000 more than the total number of American soldiers killed in battle in Vietnam. Firearms wounded an additional 320,000 children during this same period. In a single year 4,205 children and teens were killed by gunfire. Those 4,205 deaths are equal to the number of passengers on eight jumbo jets, 90 school buses full of children, and more than an entire high school graduating class of a school the size of Columbine every school month. Nearly three times as many children under ten died from gunfire as the number of law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. Children are twice as likely as adults to be victims of violent crime, and more likely to be killed by adults than by other children. Homicide is the third leading cause of death among children aged five to fourteen. 
   Mr. President, these statistics reveal why it is of such considerable consequence that we complete work on the juvenile justice bill. We cannot ignore the violent reality that so many of our children face. The Senate has debated and passed the a very good piece of legislation that seeks to reduce gun violence among our young people. All we are asking, Mr. President--all that we have been debating here today--is that the juvenile justice conference meet, that they finish their business and issue their report, and that the Congress vote on the conference report. 
   The juvenile justice bill is being made controversial, Mr. President, but it does not need to be. The Senate-passed juvenile justice bill would enhance efforts to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and children, by closing the gun show loophole which currently permits sales at gun shows without a background check; by prohibiting the sale or transfer by a licensed dealer of a handgun without a secure gun storage or safety device; by closing the loophole in the law that permits the importation of large-capacity ammunition clips; by keeping guns out of the hands of serious juvenile offenders by banning gun sales to juveniles with violent crime records; by expanding the Youth Crime Gun Interdiction Initiative to 250 cities by 2003 to enhance efforts to trace guns used in crimes and identify and arrest adults who sell guns to children; by requiring the FTC and the Attorney General to study the extent to which the gun industry markets and distributes its products to juveniles; by increasing penalties on ``straw purchases'' to curb the transfer of firearms to individuals who cannot purchase them legally--juveniles, felons, fugitives, and stalkers; and by banning juvenile possession of semi-automatic assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition clips. 
   Mr. President, I don't think it is necessary to get bogged down in a protracted, partisan debate over this legislation. The Senate must come together to address the horrible number casualties caused by gun violence in this country. The juvenile justice bill that we have debated and passed will make our communities, our schools, and our cities safer for this nation's young 
   people. And, Mr. President, I think it is a critical first step to addressing the problem of gun violence that this legislation be moved through conference and voted on. 
   But Mr. President, I understand that common-sense gun control measures are not a silver bullet capable--by themselves--of solving this tragic problem. We must do much more, Mr. President, than just close the gun show loophole, we must also increase enforcement of existing gun laws at the federal, state, and local levels. We must increase our investment in and commitment to early learning programs. We must also improve and reform our public schools. We must ensure that our students have meaningful after-school programs to keep young people off the streets at the times in which juvenile crime rates are highest. We must enable communities to hire full-time, school based police officers under the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program to prevent and respond to disorder and violence in our schools. We must allocate funding for school counselors to assist in identifying troubled students and providing them with the necessary resources and attention to address their problems. We must support partnerships between schools, families, and law enforcement to build relationships, establish anti-truancy programs and mentoring and conflict resolution programs in schools and communities. But if we are truly committed to ending the terrible trend of gun violence in this country, than we must also implement gun control measures. It is going to take much, much more to deal with this horrendous problem than passing the juvenile justice bill, but this legislation is critical to reducing gun violence. 
   Mr. President, I agree with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that another very important component of reducing gun violence is improving the enforcement of existing gun laws. I believe we should provide additional funding for ATF agents to crack down on gun dealers who violate federal laws and expand the highly-successful Project Exile program nationwide. I do not view gun control measures and enforcement provisions as mutually exclusive. I do not believe that we must choose between more gun control legislation or tougher enforcement. This is a false choice. The American people want a comprehensive approach that includes common-sense gun legislation; tougher enforcement; and closing the loopholes that exist in current law. 
   Increased enforcement--at the federal, state, and local levels--is a critical component of a comprehensive approach to ending gun violence. We have improved our enforcement efforts over the last few years and I think we should step-up our efforts to improve enforcement. Department of Justice statistics show a 41 percent increase in the number of federal gun felons sentenced to more than five years in prison since 1993, and a 16 percent increase in the number of gun cases filed. The number of higher-level offenders--those sentenced to five or more years--has gone up nearly 30 percent in five years. Mr. President I'd like to call your attention to an article that appeared in USA Today on June 10, 1999. This article reported that ``Gun laws are enforced more vigorously today  than five years ago by nearly any measure. Prosecutions are more frequent than ever before; sentences are longer; and the number of inmates in federal prison is at a record level. The number of inmates in federal prison on firearm or arson charges (the two are lumped together) increased 51% from 1993 to 1998 ..... A U.S. Sentencing Commission analysis done for USA Today shows that lying on the background check form is prosecuted in federal court far more often than acknowledged.'' We are on the right track and I sincerely hope that the federal government continues to improve its enforcement record. As of April 1999, there were more than 100,000 federally licensed firearm dealers in America--more licensed gun dealers than there are McDonald's franchises. Yet there were only 1,783 ATF agents to police them; many of those agents are detailed by law to only investigate crimes involving explosives. Clearly there is room for the federal government to do more than it is currently doing. I wholeheartedly support increased enforcement efforts and commit to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to see that federal, state, and local enforcement efforts are increased. 
   The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the American people want more from us and they deserve better from us. They want an end to random and senseless violence. We have got to get past the partisan divide that exists in the Senate. It is preventing us from effectively addressing the problem of gun violence and that cannot be tolerated, Mr. President. We must come together to achieve the goal that I know each and every Senator shares: to make our society safer for our young people. This issue is too important, Mr. President, to get caught up in politics. We must find a way to work together on this issue.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to express my support for the HUBZones in Native America Act of 2000. This bill is designed to clarify eligibility requirements and enhance participation by Native American-owned small firms seeking certification in the Small Business Administration's Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) government contracting program. The bill also sets up a temporary pilot program for Alaska Native Corporations under the HUBZone program. 
   As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business, I was a cosponsor to the HUBZone legislation when it was enacted into law as part of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997. The original bill language, because of some peculiarities in Native American and Alaska Native law, inadvertently exempted some Native American-owned firms located in economically distressed areas from participating in the HUBZone program. This bill is designed to make those firms eligible to participate. 
   The HUBZone program, Mr. President, is designed to help qualified small businesses located in economically distressed areas--inner cities, rural areas, and Native American tribal lands--secure contracting opportunities with the Federal government. The  program is also designed to create jobs in these areas by requiring that firms hire 35% of their workforce from economically distressed areas. 
   According to the SBA, there are currently 1171 small businesses that are eligible to participate in the HUBZone program, and 114 of these are Native American-owned, 11 of which are located in the state of Alaska. This bill should provide the vehicle for more Native American-owned firms to become eligible. 
   Mr. President, Native Americans are one of the groups that the SBA presumes to be socially and economically disadvantaged for purposes of their Section 8(a) and Small Disadvantaged Business contracting programs. Unfortunately, Native American tribal areas have not been able to share in the remarkable economic growth that our country has enjoyed for the last few years. It is my hope that this bill, with its technical corrections to the HUBZone program, will in some part, provide greater economic opportunities in these areas that continue to suffer high levels of unemployment and desperately need this help.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to share just a few words about a good friend we recently lost, someone I have known since I first ran for Lieutenant Governor in Massachusetts in 1982, a good hearted and selfless individual who was always an inspiration, Jo-Ann Molnar. Jo-Ann recently passed away after bravely battling cancer, and I know that I am not alone in saying that as someone whose life was touched by Jo-Ann Molnar's service, activism, and warmth, there is today a deep and profound sense of loss. In Jo-Ann many of us have lost--and today I would like to honor--a committed activist, a person of enormous courage and character and, most simply, a great friend. 
   I first met Jo-Ann Molnar when I was running for Lieutenant Governor of Massachusetts, and Jo-Ann approached me at one of our earliest events and offered to help in any way she could. It was on that race in the middle of a difficult and heated campaign that Jo-Ann first demonstrated to me not just that she was an indefatigable volunteer, but that she was one of those individuals who--through her commitment to do what is right, through her belief in politics not as sport but as a fight for principle--could reaffirm precisely why politics matters and why public service is worthwhile. 
   Jo-Ann and I remained close ever since that first campaign, and I looked forward to and always appreciated Jo-Ann's warm cards and greetings. Always a loyal friend, Jo-Ann would share with me her thoughts on issues of importance, keep me abreast of her accomplishments, and offer me words of encouragement as I worked to find my way in the United States Senate. 
   It was through her frequent cards and letters--and the occasional happy meeting either in Massachusetts or at political gatherings around the Maryland area--that I learned of the many ways in which Jo-Ann continued to dedicate herself to public service. Her determination to make a difference led her to remarkable achievements. In 1977, Jo-Ann graduated magna cum laude from Fairleigh Dickinson University, with a degree in history and political science. She went on to earn a master's degree in political science from American University. Jo-Ann selflessly offered her leadership to her fellow Democrats, serving admirably as President of the Montgomery County, Maryland Young Democrats, as Vice Chair of the Handicapped Commission in Montgomery County, and on the Board of Directors of the Montgomery County public libraries. In addition to her help with my campaigns, Jo-Ann served as a legislative intern to U.S. Senator Donald Reigle, U.S. Representative Gene Andrew Maguire, and Montgomery County Council member Michael L. Gudis. She also worked as a Congressional Liaison Assistant for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. For almost a decade, Jo-Ann served as a legal researcher for the Human Relations Commission. She gave of herself as a Sunday School teacher and a confirmation teacher at the Foundary United Methodist Church in Washington, D.C, as well as an instructor at Colesville United Methodist Church in Silver Spring, Maryland. 
   Mr. President, Jo-Ann lived a life true to her ideals of service--service to community, service to faith. I would add, though, that none of these achievements would have been possible if Jo-Ann had not worked so hard to overcome cerebral palsy. Jo-Ann refused to be slowed by her disability--  and in fact rejected the notion that she should in any way lower her expectations for herself or expect different expectations from those to whom she so selflessly offered her best efforts. Jo-Ann was a fighter, and I continually marveled at her drive to rise above what some would view as limitations. 
   For that reason, Jo-Ann served as one of the best possible advocates and activists for the Americans with Disabilities Act. Honored as a teenager for her activism on the Education for All Handicapped Children Act, Jo-Ann kept pushing as an adult to break down barriers in our society that she believed kept disabled Americans from maximizing their contributions to their communities and our nation. Jo-Ann was not just an advocate for legislation to protect and empower disabled Americans--she was the living embodiment of those efforts. 
   Mr. President, it is difficult to accept that we have all lost a friend in Jo-Ann Molnar, but it is particularly difficult, I know, for Jo-Ann's family--her mother, Helen, and her two sisters, Dorothy and Ilona. They are in our thoughts and prayers. 
   I was comforted, though, to learn that Jo-Ann was able to enjoy life as she had always done, up until her last days. Jo-Ann's mother, Helen, let me know that she had a wonderful Christmas with her family and was able to attend a New Millenium New Year's Eve celebration, complete with the 60's rock music she loved. Just as she did throughout her life, even in her most difficult days, Jo-Ann kept on doing the things that she loved--and she moved forward in so many remarkable efforts driven by a real sense of social conscience. 
   Mr. President, today I remember Jo-Ann for her service, her friendship, and her kindness. All of us who knew her continue to draw strength from her courage and her faith, and Jo-Ann's life continues to inspire.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Lieberman amendment to ESEA. I am very supportive of the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut and my other colleagues who have worked so diligently on this amendment. This amendment is based upon a theory that I am very supportive of: increased flexibility in exchange for increased accountability. This means that States and school districts should have more flexibility in using Federal funds, but they must meet certain achievement measures, and most important, those achievement gains must hold true for children of all races, all ethnicities, and regardless of gender. Therefore, I am sorry that I am not rising in support of this amendment, because it includes many components of education reform that I firmly believe are necessary to improving the public education system for all students. 
   The Lieberman amendment would target the title I formula even more to the most highly disadvantaged students. This amendment would also dramatically increase our investment in the title I program. The Federal Government's number one priority should and must be to ensure that economically disadvantaged students are provided with supplementary educational resources, and I commend my colleagues for increasing this critical investment in this program. 
   The Lieberman amendment would also increase the accountability of Federal dollars, a component of education reform that I know is critical to improving the public education system. The Federal Government has an obligation to ensure that we are getting the most from our investment in public education, by holding our teachers, our schools, and our students accountable to the highest standards. This amendment would make a great step toward increasing the Federal Government's investment in accountability. Accountability is the third side of an education triangle that also includes standards and assessments. Now that many states have adopted high standards and tests to measure students' progress toward those benchmarks, they have turned their attention to making sure that performance matters. Achieving real accountability in our schools is a large part of what this amendment is all about and I believe increased accountability is critically important for the state of public education in this country. Again I commend my colleagues for focusing their amendment on this important element of public school reform. 
   The Lieberman approach focuses on public school choice, another element of public education reform that I support and know to be critical to improving educational attainment for all children. Public school choice is becoming more and more a part of the American educational system. In 1993, only 11% of students attended schools chosen by their parents. In 1999, 15% of students attended schools chosen by their parents. While still serving a relatively small percentage of students, charter schools and magnet schools are becoming an increasingly common tool to improve the education of our nation's children. In 1994, there were only 100 charter schools in this country. Today, there are 1,700. Currently there are over 5,200 magnet schools serving approximately 1.5 million students. Magnet schools foster diversity and promote academic excellence in math, science, performing arts and marketable vocational skills. 
   Parents deserve more choice in their children's public schools. Increasing parental choice will allow healthy competition between public schools. Choice, of course, necessarily 
   implies that one thing is being chosen over another. As a result, choice means competition which is a force that often hastens change and improvement in any organization or system. All schools, district and charter, are forced by competition to examine why parents, students, or prospective teachers might be choose to go to other schools. Even teachers' unions and school board associations are signing on to the concept of publicly funded schools that operate outside most state and district regulations. In early 1996, the National Education Association promised $1.5 million to help its affiliates start charter schools in five States and to study their progress. I am pleased that my esteemed colleagues have made public school choice a primary component of this amendment. 
   This amendment also deals with an issue we have frequently discussed during this ESEA debate: the consolidation of many Federal programs. Let me say that I am not opposed to consolidating some Federal programs. I do believe that there are important programs that are not overly burdensome on states and schools and that have proven successful, and I believe that the success of these programs is due in part on the competitive grant process and Federal guidelines of the programs. I know the Federal Government does not have all the answers and that we cannot always anticipate the needs of states and local school districts throughout this country, and though I have some specific concerns about the level of consolidation in the Lieberman amendment, I support the streamlining of Federal programs and providing flexibility to states and school districts. 
   Despite my support for so many things in this amendment, I am ultimately unable to support the Lieberman approach. The Federal Government is the only entity that ensures funding is provided to the most disadvantaged populations in this country, like migrant children, homeless and runaway youth, and immigrant children. I am greatly concerned about the loss of Federal support for these vulnerable youth. Therefore, I cannot support the Lieberman approach despite my commitment to so many of its  provisions. The Federal Government's involvement in education has always been to ensure that vulnerable populations are provided the additional funds that are necessary to their educational success. And I have heard from those people in Massachusetts who work with homeless young people and with troubled youth. And they have told me how incredibly important this Federal money is to these children. These children have so much going against their ability to succeed, I believe we must maintain our commitment to those children. 
   I am encouraged by the work my colleagues have done on this amendment. I am supportive of their new approach to public education reform and their attempt to draft legislation that would attract the support of both Republicans and Democrats. I am frustrated and saddened by the very partisan nature of this year's ESEA debate, and commend my colleagues for their fresh approach to ESEA reauthorization and their attempts to attract support from both sides of the aisle. 
   I regret that I cannot support this amendment, but I look forward to working with many my colleagues to address the concerns that I and other Senators have. I hope we can resolve these concerns and that we can bring this divided Senate together on the issue of public education. I look greatly forward to working with my colleagues in the future and deeply appreciate their hard work and new perspective on this critically important issue.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to lend my support to a critical component of our efforts to reform the public education system and ensure that all children can learn to high standards: a collaborative approach to increasing the availability of high-quality early learning initiatives for young children. The amendment before us today recognizes the importance that the early years of a child's life play in his or her future learning and development. This amendment acknowledges what we know to be to true: children who begin school lacking the ability to recognize letters, numbers, and shapes quickly fall behind their peers. Students who reach the first grade without having had the opportunity to develop cognitive or language comprehension skills begin school at a disadvantage. Children who have not had the chance to develop social and emotional skills do not begin school ready to learn. Mr. President, we have the opportunity here today in this bipartisan amendment to see to it that all of our young children have access to high-quality early learning initiatives and that all of our children begin school ready to learn. 
   The beauty of the approach that I am advocating for here today, is that it builds upon existing early learning and child care programs in each and every community in this country. Mr. President, this early learning amendment would provide support to families by minimizing government bureaucracy and maximizing local initiatives. This amendment would support the creation of local councils that will provide funding to communities to expand the thousands of successful early care and education efforts that already exist. It will establish an early learning infrastructure at the local level. This infrastructure will establish the necessary linkages between private, public, and non-profit organizations that seek to provide a healthy, safe, and supportive start in learning and in life for children of pre-school age. Mr. President, this amendment provides the Senate with a critically important bipartisan opportunity to support early learning collaboratives at the state level, in towns, in cities, and in communities throughout this country. 
   I can attest to the success and importance of this collaborative approach, because I have seen it work. I was so convinced by what I saw in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, Mr. President, that I introduced legislation in the 105th and the 106th Congresses that is very similar to the amendment before us today. Let me tell you about the Early Childhood Initiative (ECI) in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania--an innovative program which helps low-income children from birth to age five become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high quality, neighborhood-based early care and education programs, ranging from Head Start, center-based child care, home-based child care, and school readiness programs. ECI draws on everything that's right about Allegheny County--the strength of its communities--neighborhood decision-making, parent involvement, and quality measurement. Parents and community groups decide if they want to participate and they come together and develop a proposal tailored for the community. Regular review programs ensure quality programming and cost-effectiveness. We're talking about local control getting results locally: 19,000 pre-school aged children from low-income families, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any childcare or education program. Evaluations have shown that enrolled children are achieving at rates equivalent to their middle income peers. And as we know, without this leveling of the playing field, low-income children are at a greater risk of encountering the juvenile justice system. 
   In the United States, child care, early learning, and school-age care result from partnerships among the public sector--federal state, and local governments; the private sector--businesses and charitable organizations; and parents. Both the public and the private sectors help children get a strong start in life by supporting and providing child care, by enhancing early learning opportunities, and by 
   supplying school-age care. Attention to early childhood development by so many organizations and levels of government is important and appropriate. But oftentimes, early care and education is a hodgepodge of public and private programs, child-care centers, family day-care homes, and preschools and ironically the widespread concern for the provision and quality of such programs has led to what some experts in this field have called a non-system. 
   I'd like to tell you about one of the most ground-breaking studies in the effectiveness of early learning programs, called the Abecedarian Project, that is taking place at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill. This highly-regarded study has found that low-income children who received comprehensive, quality early educational intervention had higher scores on cognitive, reading, math tests than a comparison group of children who did not receive the intervention. These effects persisted through age 21. The study also found that young people who had participated in the early education program were more likely to attend a four-year college and to delay parenthood. And the positive impact of the early learning program was not just limited to the children, Mr. President. Mothers whose children participated in the program achieved higher educational and employment status as well, with particularly strong results for teen mothers. 
   Community collaboration allows a vast array of people to assess what support children and families need, what resources are available in their own community, and what new resources are necessary. Collaboration is a way to meet the needs of parents who work full time. For example, children who attend a state-financed half-day preschool program in a child-care center are able to remain in the center after the formal preschool program has ended until a parent finishes working when linkages between disparate programs are made. This sort of continuity can eliminate transportation problems that often plague working families and stressful transitions for parents and children. 
   Child care and early learning are necessities for millions of American families. Children of all income levels are cared for by someone other than their parents. Each day, an estimated 13 million children under age six--including children with mothers who work outside the home and those with mothers who do not--spend some or all of their day being cared for by someone other than their parents. Many of these children enter non-parental care by 11 weeks of age, and often stay in some form of child care until they enter school. 
   I commend my esteemed colleagues, Senator STEVENS, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator BOND, Senator DODD, and the senior Senator from Massachusetts, Senator KENNEDY, who, as you all know, is a true leader in this area, for working so diligently on this amendment. And I'm pleased to have the opportunity to be here on the floor to discuss this bipartisan legislation. Indeed, supporting states and local early learning collaboratives is not a partisan  issue. In fact. Mr. President, the legislation that I introduced in the 105th and 106th Congresses, the Early Childhood Development Act, would support a collaborative approach and sustain an early learning infrastructure. My legislation has been supported by Senators on both sides of the aisle. I commend my colleagues--Senator BOND, Senator GORDON SMITH, Senator SNOWE, Senator COLLINS, and the late Senator CHAFEE, for supporting this important, non-partisan educational priority and approach to improving early learning opportunities for all children. And I particularly commend the bipartisan group of leaders on this amendment. 
   Early childhood programs are cost effective and can result in significant savings in both the short- and the long-term. For example, the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool Study examined the long-term impact of a good early childhood program for low-income children. Researches found that after 27 years, each $1.00 invested in the program saved over $7.00 by increasing the likelihood that children would be literate, employed, and enrolled in postsecondary education, and making them less likely to be school dropouts, dependent on welfare, or arrested for criminal activity or delinquency. A study of the short-term impact of a pre-kindergarten program in Colorado found that it resulted in cost savings of $4.7 million over just three years in reduced special education costs. 
   Child care and early learning are particularly important for low-income children and children with other risk factors. Good early care and education programs help children enter school ready to succeed in a number of ways, and have a particularly strong impact on low-income children who are at greater risk for school failure. Mr. President, reading difficulties in young children can be prevented if children arrive in the first grade with strong language and cognitive skills and the motivation to learn to read, which are needed to benefit from classroom instruction. 
   Law enforcement has attested to the importance of early learning programs. A poll of police chiefs from across the country found that nearly none out of ten (86 percent) said that ``expanding after-school and child care programs like Head 
   Start will greatly reduce youth crime and violence.'' Nine out of ten also agreed that a failure to invest in such programs to help children and youth now would result in greater expenses later in crime, welfare, and other costs. Police chiefs ranked providing ``more after-school programs and educational child care'' as the most effective strategy for reducing youth violence four times as often as ``prosecuting more juveniles as adults'' and five times as often as ``hiring more police officers to investigate juvenile crime.'' 
   I urge my colleagues to think about what is at stake here. Poverty seriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. Of the millions children under the age of three in the U.S. today, 25 percent live in poverty. Three out of five mothers with children under three work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants provided care of such poor quality as to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. Literally the future of millions of young people is at stake here. Literally that's what we're talking about. But is it reflected in the investments we make here in the Senate? I would, respectfully, say no--not nearly enough, Mr. President. But today, during this debate on the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, we have a genuine opportunity to make a meaningful difference and contribution to the lives of poor children in this country. 
   I'd also like to discuss the results of a study conducted by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. This study has been following a group of children to compare the development of children in high quality child care with that of children in lower quality child care. Researchers have thus far tracked the children's progress from age three through the second grade. At the end of this most recent study period, children in high quality child care demonstrated greater mathematics ability, greater thinking and attention skills, and fewer behavioral problems. These differences held true for children from a range of family backgrounds, with particularly significant effects for children at risk. 
   Let me explain why this legislation is so fundamentally important and why it is clear we are not doing enough to ensure that our youngest children are exposed to meaningful learning opportunities: 
   A study in Massachusetts found that the supply of child care in communities with large numbers of welfare recipients was much lower than in higher-income communities. The 10 percent of zip code areas with the greatest share of welfare recipients had just 8.3 preschools operating per 1,000 children ages 3 to 5. This was one-third lower than in high-income communities. 
   Four out of five children already know what it means to be in the full-time care of someone other than one of their parents. 
   A study by the U.S. Department of Education found that public schools in low income communities were far less likely to offer pre-kindergarten programs (16 percent) than were schools in more affluent areas (33 percent). 
   Kindergarten teachers estimate that one in three children enters the classroom unprepared to meet the challenges of school. 
   Only 42 percent of low-income children between the ages of 3 and 5 are in pre-kindergarten programs compared with 65 percent of higher income children. 
   Our country has struggled, and this body has struggled, with ways to improve the lives of young, poor children in this country. The debate we are engaged in today centers around how to more effectively educate disadvantaged children, how to hold schools, administrators, and teachers accountable for providing a high-quality education, and ensuring that all children are given the opportunities to learn. Mr. President, early learning is a critical element of the fundamentally important goal of ensuring all children learn to high standards. We must go where the children are--in child care centers, in family-based care--and guarantee support of meaningful early learning services. 
   The intent of a collaborative approach to early education and child care is to create a system that supports children's development and is also responsive to the needs of working parents. We need to take action in order to make a difference in the lives of our children before they're put at risk, and this bipartisan approach is certainly a step in the right direction, I believe a step the Senate must take. We need to accept the truth, Mr. President, that we can do a lot more to help our kids grow up healthy with promising futures in an early childhood development center, in a classroom, and in a doctor's office than we can in a courtroom or in a jail cell. 
   I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. 
   I thank my colleague, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, for his extraordinary leadership in this arena, as well as in the entire area of education. 
   I think my colleagues will agree that there is no more forceful, eloquent, or committed voice on the subject of children and of education in the country. I am grateful for his leadership on their particular issue. 
   I also join in thanking the Senator from Alaska for his passionate and very firsthand commitment to this subject. He comes to this from a place of real understanding. And I hope his colleagues on his side of the aisle will recognize that this is not partisan. This is something that has the capacity to bring both sides together to the advantage of the children of America. 
   I also thank my colleague, Senator BOND, who joined me several years ago in what was then a ground-breaking effort in the Senate to try to recognize the capacity of collaboratives in the local communities to be able to pick up much of this burden. For a long time, we spent an awful lot of energy in the Senate reinventing the wheel. I think what we did was try to say how we solve the problem without necessarily creating a new Federal bureaucracy and without creating additional administrative overhead. 
   How do we play to the strengths of our mayors, of our local charitable organizations, which do such an extraordinary job, and  which in so many cases are simply overburdened by the demand? 
   I think there is not one Member who is not aware of a Boys Club, Girls Club, YMCA, YWCA, Big Brother-Big Sister, or any number of faith-based entities, whether the Jewish community centers, the Catholic charities, the Baptist Outreach--there are dozens upon dozens of efforts--that successfully intervene in the lives of at-risk or troubled young people and who succeed in turning those lives around. 
   This should not be categorized as a government program with all of the pejoratives that go with the concept of government program. This is, in effect, the leveraging of those efforts at the local level that already work. The best guarantee that comes out of this amendment is that it appeals to the capacity of the local communities to choose which entities work and which entities don't. There is none of the rhetoric that somehow attacks so easily the notions that seek to do good and changes lives of people for the better, none of that rhetoric that suggests that Washington is dictating this or there is a new bureaucracy, or this is the long reach of the government at the Federal level trying to tell the local level what to do. None of that applies here. 
   This is a grant to local collaboratives with the Governors' input and the input of those local charitable entities. They know best what is working; they know best where that money can have the greatest return on the investment. They will, therefore, decide what to do. 
   Let me address for a quick moment the common sense of this. Senator STEVENS talked about the science and brain development. Indeed, we have learned a great deal about brain development. In fact, we are learning even more each day. 
   Just this year, new evidence about brain development has been made public which suggests that not only is the early childhood period so critical for a particular kind of discipline, but we are now capable of learning about the brain's functioning at different stages of development through to the point of adulthood. A child in their early teens, for instance, may be particularly susceptible to language input and at a later stage of life to more analytical skills; at the earlier stage of life much more subject to the early socialization skills and the early recognition, cognitive skills such as recognizing shapes, forms, numbers. 
   The problem in America is--every single one of us knows this--certain communities don't have the tax base, don't have the income, and we will find parents have a greater struggle to provide for a safe, nonchaotic atmosphere within which their children can be brought up. Find a place where children get the proper kind of early input and it makes a difference in their capacity to go to school ready to learn. In an affluent community, almost by 2 to 1 we find many more children are in safe, competent, early childhood environments where they are well prepared to go to school. 
   The consequences of not preparing a child to go to school at the earliest stage ought to be obvious to everybody, but they are not. I have heard from countless first grade schoolteachers who tell me in a class of 25 to 30 kids, they might have 5 to 10 kids who do not have the early cognitive skills their peers 
   have, so the teacher is then reduced in their capacity to be able to provide the accelerated effort to the rest of the class because they are spending so much time trying to help people catch up. Moreover, it takes longer for the children to catch up. 
   There are a host of other disadvantages that come with the lack of that early childhood education that often play out later in life, sometimes in very dramatic ways, when they get in trouble with the law, when they become violent, and when we spend countless billions of dollars, literally billions of dollars, trying to remediate things that could have been avoided altogether in the first place. 
   That is what this is all about. This is common sense. There are two former Governors who will speak on this. I know what the Senator from Ohio did because I followed what he did when he was a Governor. We used some of what he did, as well as some of what was done by Governor Hunt in North Carolina, as models for possibilities. There are Governors all across this country who currently support wonderful, homegrown, locally initiated, locally based efforts that save lives and change lives on an ongoing basis. 
   We need to augment the capacity of all of those entities to reach all of the children of America. If we did that, we could provide a tax cut in the end to the American people. For the dollar invested at the earliest stage, there is a back-end savings of anywhere from $6 to $7 per child, and sometimes much greater percentages in terms of the costs of the social structure that we put in place to either mitigate, and sometimes simply to isolate, people from society as a consequence of those early deprivations. 
   This is not ``goo-goo'' social work. This is not do-goodism. It doesn't fit into any kind of ideological label. This is something that has worked all across the country. 
   I close by pointing to one very successful initiative that I visited several years ago which became part of the basis of the collaboration in which Senator BOND and I engaged. 
   In Allegheny County, PA, there is a thing called the Early Childhood Initiative. This program helps low-income children from birth to age 5 to become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high-quality, neighborhood-based early care and education programs ranging from Head Start to center-based child care, to home-based child care, to school readiness programs. It draws on all of the corporate community. The corporate community matches funds. The corporations become involved with the charitable entities. The public sector becomes involved. They join together to guarantee there are regular review programs ensuring quality programming and cost effectiveness. 
   We are now talking about 19,000 preschool age children from low-income families, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any children's care or education program prior to the childhood education initiative being put in place. 
   May I add, this has been done to date with a small amalgamation of Federal money, principally with corporate and local match and State money. 
   This can be done. For a minimal amount of Federal dollars, you can leverage an extraordinary outpouring of local match, of corporate private sector involvement, all of which builds communities, all of which in the end would make this country stronger and significantly augment the capacity of our teachers, who are increasingly overburdened, to be able to teach our children adequately. 
   I really hope this will be one amendment that does not fall victim to partisanship or to predisposition. I think we ought to be able to come to common agreement and common ground on this. I really commend it to my colleagues on that basis. 
   I thank my colleagues for their forbearance.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I would like to honor the efforts of my long time friends at the Massachusetts State Letter Carriers' Association (MSLCA) as they continue to fight for job security, fair pensions, health care, and reforms to the national postal system. I would also like to applaud Massachusetts president, Frederick Celeste, and the National Association of Letter Carriers as they continually seek to improve and develop a mail service that efficiently delivers both in Massachusetts and nationwide. 
   Soon Massachusetts' proud 11,000 Letter Carriers will be gathering in Washington, D.C. for their annual convention. These hardworking men and women provide the Bay State with a vital service each day. Letter Carriers have been the backbone of the communications and commercial infrastructure of our nation since its inception. On behalf of all Massachusetts residents, I would like to thank the Letter Carriers Association for remaining vigilant in the fight to further improve the postal system. 
   The Letter Carriers' Association has always fought for decent wages, cost of living adjustments, job security, and benefits for its brothers and sisters, while constantly striving to forge a more effective partnership with the United States Postal Service and the federal government. Throughout my career, I have always been grateful for the tremendous help I have received from the Letter carriers. 
   This year, The Letter Carriers of New England are rallying around an agenda to secure fair benefits to provide security for their families and their future. They are fighting for adequate social security benefits through the Windfall Elimination Provision and the Social Security Benefits Restoration Act. The Carriers are working to secure long-term care insurance for federal employees, and are guarding against rate hikes in the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan by opposing inserting medical savings accounts. I look forward to continuing to join with the Letter Carriers in opposing the privatization of the Postal Service. 
   Mr. President, The American public has an overwhelmingly favorable view of their letter carriers. In fact, 89 percent of the American public gives the Postal Service a favorable rating, higher than any other federal agency. In addition, 75 percent of Americans identify that the Postal Service is doing an excellent or good job. I think that it is time that we say, if it is not broke, don't fix it. 
   The Letter Carriers have recently won some victories for their brother and sisters. In September, 1999, an Arbitration Board, in conjunction with an agreement between the Postal Service and the NALC, upgraded all letter carriers from Grade 5 to Grade 6 federal employees. The recent pay raise and cost of living adjustments reflect the concerted lobbying and negotiating efforts of the Letter carriers' leadership, including National President Vincent Sombrotto. 
   Mr. President, I would like to thank the Letter Carriers for their service to the public. There is much to celebrate. As we focus on the fights that lay ahead, I look forward to joining with the Letter Carriers to protect our families and our future.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator, and I will not be too long. 
   We have come here for several years in a row with this impasse. The Senator from Washington and I have met privately trying to have a discussion about how we could find a meeting of the minds. I certainly don't question his desire to have kids in the United States educated. 
   Obviously, there is a difference between us, as he has said, in our confidence in what may occur. As the Senator from Washington knows, when title I began back in 1965, for instance, it was a block grant. Indeed, in Memphis, TN, moneys were used to pay for swimming pools. In Oxford, MS, moneys were used for cheerleading uniforms. In Macon County, AL, moneys were used for football uniforms. In Attala County, MS, two lagoons for sewage disposal were constructed with title I money. 
   The record of States not choosing to reduce class size or have afterschool programs or improve teacher quality is already there. 
   The question I ask the Senator, If everyone on his side is so willing to pass this bill with the notion there is a level of accountability that they will put in place for improving education, why would they not be willing to adopt a series of areas which we could all agree on to represent the top priorities in America for education, such as getting better teachers, improving teacher quality, having afterschool programs? Isn't it possible to agree on a broad categorization that does not tell local districts how to do it, doesn't tie their hands to one particular choice, but gives them a sufficient range of options? At least we know the Federal dollar will not be subject to the kind of abuse it was once subjected.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the answer. 
   I do not want to abuse the time because I know my colleagues are lined up to speak, but if I may ask further, I hear what the Senator is saying, but the examples I chose are examples of when it was a block grant. We changed the block grant precisely in order to obviate those kinds of examples. Bringing it to modern times, I know the Senator will agree with me that everyone in the Senate is not debating education because it is a nonissue in America. 
   No one would suggest that every Governor in this country is doing as well as some other Governors in the country. No one would suggest--I am not going to name States here--there are not some States that are light years behind other States in what they are willing to adopt. 
   So even measured against the modern system, I agree with the Senator from Washington. Let's tear apart some of the bureaucracy. Let's rip away some of the layers and tiers, let's minimize the paperwork. But let's guarantee we are working together in a more genuine fashion. The fact that we have bills on the floor that are, frankly, as far apart--this is the first time in the eight times this bill has been to the floor that there is as little bipartisan effort at this stage as there is this year, a time when education is far more important than it has ever been in the history of the country. 
   So I ask my colleague if it is not possible, if we somehow cannot find a more reasonable middle ground where we achieve goals of both sides which are essentially to provide the best opportunities for our kids. 
   It seems to me, when you are looking at a 5-year period before you, in effect, measure what is happening, I am 
   constrained to ask the Senator how that 5-year period helps a kid who goes into that foundational stage of education, or even a high school student? You go into freshman year and you are gone from high school before anybody has evaluated the program at the Federal level to make a judgment whether or not the Federal dollar is being well spent. 
   Surely the accountability mechanism in the Democratic alternative cannot be that unappealing to those on the other side who want to give local administrators power but at the same time be more responsible for the Federal dollar. I wonder why it is, in fact, so unacceptable, measured against a 5-year block of time where nothing takes place.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will have more to say. I thank the Senator for interrupting his remarks. My colleague has been waiting a long time. My only comment is that Ed-Flex was passed. It allows radical departures. And very few Governors have even taken advantage of the Ed-Flex that we passed. We need to look at the reality of what is happening. I thank the Senator very much for his engaging in this dialog and thank my other colleagues for their patience.

   Mr. KERRY. If the Senator will yield, is the Senator aware--and maybe the Governor is not; I think he is--that it is an 
   option, but, secondly, that the Senator joined with all of us in voting for Ed-Flex under which any Governor basically can do whatever they want? 
   Is the Senator aware of that? That is what we passed last year, complete flexibility to Governors. We are not required to spend that. If they want to seek a waiver, they can get a waiver.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Missouri, who I have  listened to carefully--and I regret with only 10 minutes, I do not have time to yield and enter into a dialog, which I would enjoy doing--first of all, I agree with what he just said about the capacity of people to discipline. In fact, I have proposed what we call Second Chance Schools. In the legislation that Senator GORDON SMITH and I proposed, there is a component of it that would help provide the capacity for that kind of discipline. But once again, because this is not a bipartisan process or one that has been open to anything except the point of view of the Straight A's plan, we do not have the ability to debate that or other things. 
   I will also say to my friend from Missouri, one has to ask a question. He is talking about getting the capacity to the local people to be able to make the choices. If the local people were so thrilled with the proposal by the other side, why are they not supporting it? The only entity that I know of that is supporting the legislation proposed by the Republicans is the Heritage Foundation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am actually informing him at this point in time, not asking him a question. I am going to ask a rhetorical question because, again, I do not have the time. But the fact is, the local entities that make the decisions, the State school officers, the secondary and elementary school principals, the teachers, the education associations--all of those folks are the ones who are supportive of the Democratic alternative. 
   Second, I heard the Senator from Missouri say why is it that--I guess it was more than 50 percent of the people who work in schools are outside of the classroom? 
   That is because we do not have enough teachers for the numbers of kids in the classroom. When you have one teacher teaching 35 kids, you begin to change the proportion of who is working in the school system. I am confident my friend from Missouri does not intend to have a school system that does not have custodians, does not have janitors, does not have schoolbus drivers, does not have people working in the cafeterias. These are the people ``outside of the classroom.'' 
   What we really need to face is the reason the proportion is out of whack, which is that we will need 2 million new teachers in America in the next 10 years. We will need a million of those teachers in the next 5 years. At the current pay level, without the capacity of the Federal Government to assist in reducing class size, it is going to be exceedingly difficult for the very districts in which the Federal Government got involved in education in the first place, which are poor districts, to ever be able to catch up. 
   I will ask another rhetorical question. If we are supposed to be giving control to the people who effectively have had control for all of these years, why is the school system in America doing so badly? We do not run it at the Federal level. We have never run it, nor are we asking to run it. We are trying to provide an incentive for communities, which have never bought into real reform, to buy into reform. If you look at the 1994 ESEA that we passed in a bipartisan fashion, you will see, as a result of that legislation, standards now being put in place across the country, whole school reforms being put into effect, a whole series of measures with respect to testing and improvements that are beginning to take hold. 
   Have they reached the level that everybody would like? The answer is no. But we would never have had to try to make that kind of broad-based effort at reform if, indeed, everything was working so well because the local decisionmakers were making the decisions that needed to be made. 
   Equally important, the Senator from Missouri was talking about raising the standards of schools. 
   I know in St. Louis or Kansas City, MO, there are poor schools. I know in Atlanta there are schools that depend on title I money to adequately provide a cushion for what their lack of a tax base provides. Poor communities do not have a big tax base. Since schools are funded by the property tax, they do not have the ability to put the money into the school system. That is precisely why the Federal Government became involved in 1965 in title I in the first place. The reason was to address the problems of communities that were disadvantaged. 
   Along comes this Republican bill with a provision called portability. I know the sponsors have spent a lot of time saying this is not a voucher, and the reason this is not a voucher is there is not a piece of paper that goes to the parent which they take to another school. The school district manages the money. But it is effectively a credit voucher. It is effectively an indirect voucher where a parent gets $400 to $600 of value for their child if they want to take them somewhere else for a different kind of schooling. 
   It sounds good and appealing, but it directly undermines the very concept that brought the Federal Government in the first place to help education, which is, if a school has a group of disadvantaged kids, by providing assistance based on the number of kids, on the conglomerate need of that community, we can help lift the school so the school can become a great school and teach those kids. 
   If we provide a per-disadvantaged-pupil stipend, what we will do is, in fact, reward kids who may be poor themselves but who go to a good school, a school that is not disadvantaged, that has an adequate tax base and does not at all need to have additional funding from the Federal Government. We will simultaneously have stripped away from a school that is struggling to be good the very heart of the money they need to make the difference and improve. 
   If we really wanted to help make a difference today, we would fully fund title I. That is the way we make a difference in what is happening to the schools that are not making it. We would do so in a way that set an order of priorities with respect to the key things we wanted to do. 
   I heard from the Senator from Missouri the mirror reflection of what we keep hearing from the other side. They keep saying: We do not want the Federal Government dictating how to approach this. The fact is, the Federal Government does not dictate that. It offers a specific menu. The schools can apply for the menu of money or not apply, as the case may be. If they think they need money for smaller class size, they can apply for that money, but nothing in the Federal budget orders a school to do that--nothing. 
   It is a concept completely out of any reality whatsoever for people to suggest there is somehow this long arm that is telling them precisely what to do. It is only suggesting the guidelines and constraints of what they have to do if they choose to do what has been established as a priority. 
   Surely we can all agree that afterschool programs are a priority. Getting guns out of schools is a priority. Drug-free schools is a priority. Having adequate class size is a priority. Having better teachers is a priority. I do not understand why the Senate is incapable of agreeing on a set of top priorities that every school district in this country can name and then say we are going to find a way to hold them accountable, not after 5 years but next year, to see precisely 
   how there is funding money with respect to that priority. 
   We are not going to tell them how to spend the money. We are not going to order them to spend the money. They can choose to do it or not do it, but we are going to at least guarantee that the country is going to spend its Federal dollars on those things that represent priorities of education. 
   This is hard for me to understand. The bill proposed by the Republicans has no accountability for 5 years at all, and for all this talk of telling us that we want the local people to make the decision, it plunks the entire pot of money in the hands of the Governors. That is not local decisionmaking; that is just playing to the politics of the State, and the people most powerful and with the greatest lobbying capacity will go back to the old order and the Federal priorities will be by the wayside. 
   We are somehow not connecting. It is the first time in all the years of this bill that there has been such a partisan bill and such a disconnect in an effort to meet the needs of our Nation.  
   I close by saying there was a terrific ex-general who was the superintendent of schools for 3 or 4 years in Seattle, from where the Senator from Washington came. He did an extraordinary job and was beloved by all. He said: There are no libertarians, no Republicans, no Democrats, no conservatives or liberals among the kids in our schools. We ought to get the ideology out of this process and put the kids first. If we do that, I am confidant we can have a solution.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I applaud Tufts University for furthering the values of leadership, citizenship, and public service, by founding a University College of Citizenship and Public Service. By creating this new college, Tufts' President, Dr. John DiBiaggio, is fostering an attitude of ``giving back'' to supplement the University's vision that `active citizen participation' is essential to freedom and democracy. 
   Tufts has a history of commitment to civic education, having founded the Lincoln Filene Center for Citizenship and Public Affairs over 50 years ago. The largest student organization on the Medford campus is the Leonard Carmichael Society, a community service group, which boasts about 1,000 members. Recently, Tufts has hatched the ``United Leaders for a Better Tomorrow,'' a new student organization that aims to encourage young people to pursue careers in public service. With chapters starting across the country, this group of young leaders seeks to re-enlist those Americans interested in public service in using public office as a vehicle for change. 
   Tufts University is now renewing its commitment to public service with an entrepreneurial spirit. Tufts is not adding a stand-alone college, composed of its own buildings and faculty. Instead, the university is creating a `virtual college,' one ``without walls;'' challenging itself to infuse all classroom instruction with the ideas of citizenship and public service. 
   According to Tufts' President Dr. John DiBiaggio, the tangible impact will mean that a major in child development who is mentoring kindergarten kids in a poor community could also participate in legislative advocacy to improve conditions in that community or, a Tufts student who wants to be a chemist will have an opportunity to measure pollution in nearby waterways, determine the sources of this pollution and then create a local team to clean them up. 
   The need for a college of public service has never been greater. While Tufts students, Massachusetts residents, and citizens nationwide are volunteering at record rates, voter participation rates continue to fall. Just two stops away on the T's red line, the ``Vanishing Voter Project'' at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government measures the depth of the public's cynicism and apathy towards public service. Last week, according to the Vanishing Voter Project's Voter Involvement Index, only 19% of the American public paid any attention to the Presidential race. In fact, at no time during the Presidential Primaries--one of the most hotly contested races in years--did the number of Americans paying attention to the race rise above 46%. In the world's leading democracy, in an age where limitless information is available at our fingertips, we can do better. 
   More than ever, it is critical that we restore and maintain civil society. We need voters that are educated and engaged. Tapping the cutting edge of the New Economy's budding e-commerce, Tufts is partnering with eBay founder, Pierre Omidyar. eBay, is now the world's leading person-to-person online trading community. Omidyar's ten million dollar investment in the College of Public Service includes financial aid packages for 24 undergraduates every year, enhanced public and private sector internship opportunities, citizenship-based career workshops, and a senior honors program in civic activism. Mr. President, Tufts University's College of Citizenship and Public Service and its partnership with eBay's Pierre Omidyar illustrates the possibilities provided by technological innovation. The promise of a technology based digital democracy is that billions of people will engage in business, receive their news, and even vote, directly and  instantly. Our challenge for this new age is to continue to foster values of public service, community, and citizenship, in order to constantly renew and re-engage our citizenry and our democracy.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to extend an invitation to the nation to join Massachusetts and the City of Boston in celebrating the gathering of tall ships for Sail Boston 2000. 
   The tall ships represent a nautical history that stretches across the globe. The International Sail Training Association, jointly with the American Sail Training Association, is organizing the Tall Ships 2000 Race. I am proud to say that Boston Harbor has been granted the opportunity to be the only official United States Race Port. 
   Beginning in April 2000, two races will start from Southampton and Genoa, finishing in Cadiz. The second leg will be a transatlantic race to Bermuda, and from there, the fleet heads north to Boston. This journey will replicate the routes taken by mariners and explorers over the last five centuries. 
   On July 11th, 2000, the Tall Ships will parade into Boston Harbor, and they will be led by the oldest ship in the U.S. Navy; America's Old Ironsides; the U.S.S. Constitution. This national treasure was originally built in Boston between 1794 and 1797, and was charged with the task of defending a young American nation. This ship, the oldest commissioned warship in the world, set to sea in 1798, and in July 1999, the U.S.S. Constitution operated under her own sail for the first time in 116 years. 
   This international fleet will be one of the finest gatherings of tall ships. Among the Sail Boston 2000 fleet are historic ships such as: Mir of Russia; Concordia of Canada; Juan Sebastian De Elcano of Spain; Pogoria of Poland; and the Amerigo Vespucci of Italy. 
   Massachusetts and the historic Boston Harbor, which offers the perfect setting for this occasion, will open itself up to visitors from around the world, and over six million spectators are expected to visit us and enjoy the festivities. The history that the Tall Ships represent belongs to all of us, and it is my hope that visitors from every state in the nation will take the opportunity to visit Massachusetts and participate in this historic celebration.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Moving Company Responsibility Act of 1999 to improve the protections afforded to consumers who hire moving companies to carry their possessions from one state to another. Under current law, consumers whose goods are lost or stolen during transit have no redress against moving companies that deceive or mistreat them during the claims process. 
   This problem was first brought to my attention by my constituents, Jane Rini and John Pucci. In 1990, Ms. Rini hired a moving company to transport her household goods from South Carolina to Massachusetts to attend Smith College's Ada Comstock Program. Among Ms. Rini's possessions were valuable original paintings and art objects that had been passed down through her family. When her belongings were delivered by the driver employed by the moving company, Ms. Rini noticed that the boxes containing the works of art were missing. Although the company's driver was not able to locate the boxes, he demanded that Ms. Rini sign inventory sheets indicating that her goods had been properly delivered and refused to leave her house until she signed for the delivery. Under pressure, Ms. Rini signed the inventory sheets, noting on them that boxes containing the works of art were missing. She was not informed by the company that she should note missing boxes on the bill of lading, nor was she given the pamphlet containing this information, as required by federal law. The next day, Ms. Rini and her family unpacked the boxes that had been delivered and determined conclusively that eleven works of art were missing. They have never been recovered. 
   From that point on, Ms. Rini did everything to obtain redress that reasonably could be expected of a consumer. She filed her claim with the moving company in a timely manner, and she went to great lengths to supply the moving company's claims adjusters with all the information they needed to process her claim. However, her efforts to recover damages for the lost artwork were met with abusive and deceptive tactics seemingly designed to discourage her claim. 
   At the beginning of the claims process, the company demanded that Ms. Rini provide it with documentation such as canceled checks, recent appraisal information, insurance riders, or cash receipts. Ms. Rini had no recent information on the works because they had been handed down through her family for generations, but she was able to supply the company with photographs of most of the missing pieces, and she even paid for professional appraisals of the works based on the photos. She also provided the company with a letter from 1929 which reflected the authenticity of some of the pieces. 
   Mr. President, this should have been more than enough to satisfy the company as to the validity of Ms. Rini's claim, but the company refused to accept appraisals unless they were based upon actual examination of the objects. Meanwhile, Ms. Rini was told by a company representative that a thorough investigation of her claim would be conducted, but the representative negligently failed to interview or take written statements in a timely manner from any of the employees involved in the move who might have been able to substantiate the claim. 
   Almost nine months later, the company denied Ms. Rini's claim on the grounds that all items were delivered and signed for on the bill of lading without a notation indicating missing items; that the company had not received adequate documentation to substantiate Rini's claims; and that the company had not uncovered any evidence that the works had not been delivered to Northampton.  
   Ms. Rini finally took her case to a District Court in Massachusetts. During the trial, the moving company's own expert witnesses testified that reliable and fair estimates of the 
   value of works of art are commonly obtained through examination of photographs, but the company maintained that Ms. Rini's documentary proof was insubstantial and denied that it had a duty to settle the claim. Upon hearing the testimony, the court found Ms. Rini's documentation provided sufficient evidence upon which the moving company should have settled her claim. It further characterized the company's tactics as ``unfair,'' ``unethical,'' and ``deceptive,'' and found that Ms. Rini was entitled to recover damages for injury she suffered as a result of the company's negligence and misrepresentation throughout the claims process. However, the District Court's decision, which was based on Massachusetts law, was overturned by the First Circuit Court of Appeals, which found that state law providing relief to Ms. Rini is preempted by the federal law establishing uniform liability for motor carriers. 
   Mr. President, Ms. Rini's story is just an illustration of the larger problem. Under current law, irresponsible, unethical moving companies are allowed to mistreat those who depend on them for service, and there is no recourse for consumers who are the victims of negligence or deception. Consumers who place their trust in moving companies should have a reasonable expectation that they will be treated with consideration and respect at all times; and when a company fails to deliver on its promise to transport household goods in good condition, consumers' efforts to recover damages should not be met with the kind of abuse and deception that Ms. Rini experienced. No consumer should have to suffer that sort of treatment. 
   Unfortunately, current law provides little or no incentive for moving companies to make sure that customer claims are handled fairly. In fact, under current law, moving companies can act irresponsibly and unfairly with impunity. According to the Department of Transportation, well over 2,500 complaints were filed against moving companies in 1998, the most recent year for which this information is available. That's more than 2,500 consumers who believe they were treated unfairly--and those are just the consumers who actually took the time to file complaints. The time for Congress to act to protect consumers is now, and passage of the Moving Company Responsibility Act is the first step. 
   The Moving Company Responsibility Act would provide customers with a means of redress against unethical companies by allowing them to pursue claims under state law. The penalties and fines available under state laws would serve as an incentive to companies to treat customers fairly throughout the business relationship. This is a simple bill, but it is needed to ensure that consumers are adequately protected when they contract with moving companies. 
   I would like to thank my constituents, Ms. Rini and Mr. Pucci, for bringing this important consumer protection matter to my attention. 
   This bill will provide important protections to consumers, and I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in supporting it so that we can pass it quickly.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I applaud my colleague from Massachusetts for his tremendous leadership on this subject and for having just pointed out the realities of the situation we find ourselves in on the floor of the Senate. It is hard for anybody, rationally, to think about the problems our seniors face in this country and then measure those problems against what the Republican majority is presenting the country in its budget resolution. 
   I do not understand the rationale. I do not understand how they can come to the floor prepared to guarantee the wealthiest Americans are going to get an extraordinary tax cut. That is absolutely cast in stone. That is going to happen. They saw to it in this budget resolution that there is a certainty as to the tax cut. But at the same time they saw to it that there is no certainty with respect to senior citizens having an opportunity that we take care of their needs for prescription drugs. Their budget pays lipservice to the critical issue of helping seniors afford medications that are prescribed by their doctors. 
   If you measure this, the budget resolution provides a tax cut of over $150 billion over 5 years. Those tax cuts will require we pay $18 billion more in interest payments. So when you add the interest payments to the tax cuts themselves, you have virtually the amount of the entire non-Social Security surplus that is going to be taken off the table and given back. But what is extraordinary is their focus. Here is a major problem. There is not one of us, as Senators, who does not go home to our States and find countless numbers of citizens come to us and say: I cannot afford to buy drugs. 
   I have to choose between paying rent or food and buying the prescription drugs I need to be healthy. 
   We have citizens who are piling into buses going to Mexico and Canada to buy drugs, and yet ``our'' fixation, the fixation of the majority is to absolutely guarantee that the wealthiest people in America who have done the best over the last 15 to 20 years are absolutely going to get a tax cut, but the neediest people in America who need help with prescription drugs, who are paying thousands of dollars a year and are on a fixed income and cannot afford it, have no guarantee in this budget that they are going to have the Senate produce a prescription drug benefit. 
   There is some lipservice to $40 billion, but as my colleague from Massachusetts pointed out, there is no guarantee we are ever going to see legislation. 
   Why is it that there is an absolute certainty as to the tax cut, an absolute guarantee that people who have done the best are going to be helped but people who are the most needy are not going to be helped? The Senate ought to be committed to addressing the importance of working families receiving this kind of help. 
   Why is that so important? It ought to be obvious to every Member of the Senate. When Medicare was created in 1965, the biggest cost concern for patients was a long stay in the hospital. Today, particularly because of the wonders of modern medicine and the biotechnology revolution, patients who once needed surgery now can take drugs; patients who once needed extensive stays in hospitals are now able to take wonder drugs of the modern age to lower cholesterol, lower blood pressure, stabilize weak hearts, and do extraordinary things, but they cost a lot of money. 
   There has been a remarkable cost-shifting process. It used to be that if one went to the hospital to have an operation and stayed in the hospital, insurance took care of the stay. But now the hospital stay and the long period of convalescence has been supplanted by the miracle drug, and the cost has shifted from the insurance to the individual, and most of these individuals are not able to afford it. 
   Take, for instance, a highly effective drug for hypertension. Sixty percent of the people over the age of 65 have hypertension. The fact is, highly effective drugs to control this typically cost about $40 a month. They greatly reduce the potential of stroke. A stroke, obviously, requires rehab time in hospitals and a variety of in-house costs and services to the medical system. If we can prevent that from happening, we save the system money. But if that cost shifting is to the individual who is on a fixed income, they get stuck with the problem. 
   Prescription drug expenditures in the United States--and I ask my colleagues to focus on this--have grown at nearly double-digit rates almost every year since 1980, with seniors' drug prices growing at four times the rate of inflation. 
   In 1997, prescription drug expenditures had the highest growth rate of all health and human services and supplies. There was a 14.1-percent growth in those costs versus the overall health care expenditure cost that rose at only 4.8 percent--14.1 percent for prescription drugs; health care costs were generally 4 percent. 
   A lot of us will support the increase in the NIH funding because we want to continue this revolution, but the fact is, it does not do a lot of good to put on the shelf drugs from the laboratory that are completely inaccessible to the average American who needs them because they simply cannot afford them. 
   We are missing a historic opportunity in the Senate in terms of our legislating process. The fact is, we have an opportunity to provide 14 million senior citizens, who lack prescription drug coverage, with that coverage. That is, one-third of all Medicare beneficiaries have no prescription drug coverage at all. 
   Three-fifths of all Medicare beneficiaries lack dependable coverage, and one-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries have retiree drug coverage from their former employer, but the number of firms offering that coverage has declined by 25 percent over the last 4 years. 
   In our state of Massachusetts, there are 982,934 Medicare beneficiaries. 45% of these seniors lack prescription drug coverage. 55% of these seniors have some form of coverage--but, the form that coverage takes is often capped, costly, inadequate or all of the above. 
   Prescription drugs are the largest out-of-pocket health care cost for seniors in Massachusetts and throughout the country. More than 85% of Medicare beneficiaries take at least one prescription medicine, and the average beneficiary fills 18 prescriptions per year. The average annual prescription drug cost for Medicare beneficiaries will reach $1,100 this year. Even beneficiaries with some drug coverage incur high out-of-pocket spending, an average of $700 per year. Increasing costs coupled with the lack of coverage force 1 out of 8 seniors in our country to choose between buying food and medicine. 
   Unless we act, we can only expect these numbers to increase. Americans aged 85 and older represent the fastest growing segment of the population, with expected growth from 4 million people today to 19 million people by 2050. We cannot afford to allow this problem to continue. 
   Medicare was enacted in 1965 as a promise to the American people that, in exchange for their years of hard work and service to our country, their health care would be protected in their golden years. Mr. President, it is past time we deliver on that promise. 
   My hope is that we will adopt the Robb amendment. I congratulate the Senator from Virginia for bringing this amendment to the floor. It requires that we find some methodology by which we will guarantee that Congress will pass a prescription drug program. It seems to me it is as imperative we do that as give a tax cut, considering the fact that the Federal tax burden is the lowest it has been in 20 years. Let's get our priorities straight and do what is correct. 
   I thank the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I thank the Senator from Nevada. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, whose passion and understanding of this issue provide the most important leadership in the country with respect to the question of education. 
   I join him on the floor of the Senate in an absolute state of incredulity that the Republicans can turn their backs so brazenly and so overtly on the educational opportunities that are needed for young people in our country. 
   We just had a conference in Massachusetts last Saturday with many leaders of what is called the ``new economy.'' I think we are getting lost in all of this talk about a new economy and an old economy. What we are seeing is an economy in transition. It is in transition because we are moving into a very different world --a world where skills are more needed than ever before. Every single day, we talk about the economy and its changes--about the knowledge-based economy. The presumption is that people are able to get the knowledge on which that economy is based, that they are able to get the skills. 
   But at this conference in Boston, which is one of the leading cities in the Nation experiencing the changes in the economy today, we had leader after leader after leader of new technologies, not just the Internet--everybody talks about the Internet and the Internet companies, but there are a host of companies on which this new opportunity is based--but companies in biotechnology, artificial intelligence, robotics, 
   advanced materials. You could run down a long list of critical technologies where the United States of America is in the lead today. 
   But guess what. We have a bill before the Senate to raise the number of visas which permit people to come into the country to fill technical slots. They are called H-1Bs. The level of H-1Bs was at 65,000. It was as high as 115,000 for a year or so. Several pieces of legislation are now seeking to enable up to 200,000 people to come in. But the leaders of the new revolution in our economy tell us that we are anywhere from 400,000 to 1 million people behind where we need to be in terms of hiring. 
   Here we are with a bill that might let in several hundred thousand at the end of this year or next year when the demand is 400,000 to a million, and when countless numbers of our citizens are facing a transition in their life--movement from the old kind of job to the new kind of job or the hope that they are going to be able to find some kind of job in the new economy where they can share the higher salaries that so many Americans are beginning to experience. 
   What do the business titans tell us? What are those leaders and entrepreneurs who are breaking the ground of the new economy --who, I might add, are in a voracious race with other countries for the market share. We are not the only people experiencing this. You go to Europe; you have all kinds of companies racing to try to grab their share of the markets. You go to Asia; the one thing leaders in Asia will tell you today is that they are focused on education. The one thing leaders of Europe will tell you they are focused on--and also in Latin America--is education because only by educating Americans ultimately are we not only going to provide the labor pool to be able to fill the jobs of this new economy, but, quite frankly, only by educating Americans are we going to have a citizenry that is capable of managing our own democracy and making the difficult kinds of decisions we will face in the future. 
   So one would think the Senate in facing this reality--it is not a partisan reality. Most of these leaders of industry  who are telling us in the Senate to wake up and pay attention to education are Republicans. They will tell us it is long since overdue that the United States make a more pronounced commitment to the education system of the country. 
   I know we don't run the education system at the Federal level, and none of us is advocating that we should. I understand that. I know no one wants Washington telling the local community what to do. I understand that. I don't want to tell them what to do. I would like to empower them to be able to do what they know they want to do but can't do because they don't have the resources. 
   All over this country, there are communities in rural areas and urban centers of the Nation where they don't have the tax base. In the United States of America, for some reason that is beyond me, we still base our school systems on the property tax, which is part of the old agrarian structure we had when we first founded our public school system. And yet, in the urban centers and in many rural centers where they don't yet share in the kinds of salaries or the kinds of opportunities as do other parts of the country, they don't have a property tax capacity to pay the teachers more money, put the equipment into the school, have an extended schoolday, have the kind of 
   laboratories for language that they need, do the kinds of remedial work with students who are troubled, have dance, arts, music, sports, and the kinds of things that are the real stuff of a complete education. 
   What do these districts do? In some cases, they have received help from States because the States have engaged in education reform, and there is a State revenue sharing process. But where is the Federal Government? Where is the great equalizer which, as a matter of national priority, is supposed to help provide the kinds of empowerments to communities that federalism embraces? That is the whole notion of a national government. It is the whole notion of a Federal system of sharing so that all parts of the country are uplifted simultaneously. 
   We have some great public schools in Massachusetts. We have some great public schools in some urban centers where mayors have paid particular attention to help scrounge up enough money. But even in those areas, they are desperate for additional Federal assistance and for more capacity to do the things they know they need to do. Yet here we are with a budget resolution on the floor of the Senate which gives a very meager increase to the special needs side of the ledger. We are happy for some increase on the special needs side, but we fundamentally reduce the capacity of our schools to face this most important mission. 
   It ought to be an acceptable national priority that our citizens are well educated. It may be a responsibility of the local level to actually do it, but it is certainly a Federal priority that it is done. If we have the capacity by leveraging resources to the local communities to empower those local communities to be able to achieve that national priority, we ought to do it. 
   Americans may not be aware that in the budget we are about to spend $1.8 trillion of collected taxpayers' money. People ask, My God, out of $1.8 trillion we cannot find $5 billion additional for education? 
   A lot of that budget obviously goes to pay for the entitlement programs, including Social Security, Medicare, military retirement, and Federal and civilian disability benefits. We will spend over $1 trillion of the $1.8 trillion on all of the entitlement programs, which no one has suggested we will suddenly cut or stop. Then we have the defense spending as well as everything else the Government does that will come out of the remaining $600 or $700 billion. Out of that $600 billion, we have to make interest payments on the national debt, pay for our defense, build our highways, channel our harbors, finance mass transit, pay for housing assistance, nutrition programs, finance health research, public health programs, fund crime control, drug trafficking, and foreign aid, which is minuscule compared to the total budget. All of these are by choice of our majority, and when measured against other significant choices, it leaves precious little money for education. 
   Why? Because they want to give a $150 billion, 5-year tax break to the wealthiest people in America. Every single tax 
   break they have ever brought to the floor of the Senate has been with 60 percent or more going to the top 20 percent of income earners of America. I have gladly voted for many of the tax cuts we have given over the last years I have been in the Senate. In the year 2000, we are looking at about a 1-million-person gap in the high-skilled labor needs of this country. 
   Kids in our schools test ahead only of Cyprus and South Africa in math and science. Kids in our country are reading at a 1988 level that hasn't progressed since then. Because of the property tax revolution in California, Massachusetts, and a lot of other States, we saw the schools decimated over the last 10 years. Programs were cut, libraries were shut, and teachers' pay was not raised. We now need 2 million additional teachers in the course of the next 10 years. We need 1 million of those teachers over the course of the next 5 years. 
   It is precious hard to find a kid out of most colleges who says, I want to teach, when teaching means starting anywhere from $22,000 though $27,000, and after 15 years of teaching and getting a master's degree you can get into the thirties and the forties, depending on the system in which you are working in this country. Their colleagues from college will be earning $40,000 and $50,000 a year within a couple of years of getting out of college. College graduates today have $50,000 or $100,000 in loans and have to begin paying back those loans immediately. 
   What kid at the top percentile of their class, with $100,000 in loans, will say, yes, I will go into an urban center at $20,000-plus a year, so I never have a chance to send my kids to college unless they get a scholarship or I somehow qualify for assistance? If that isn't a national emergency, I don't know what is a national emergency. 
   Yet this budget does nothing to address the question of how the Federal Government is going to assist these revenue-starved communities to be able to deal with the problem of education in this country. It does nothing to answer the question of executives across the Nation about how they will have a skilled labor pool in the future that will be able to address the question of education. It goes backwards. Under their proposal, there will be a cut. 
   The President has proposed a hiring of teachers to reduce class sizes so we get a nationwide average of 18 students per class. But what happens? Under their proposal, 20,000 new teachers could not be hired in order to do that. It cuts $540 million from the President's request for 21st century community learning centers where approximately 1.6 million school-age children in over 6,000 new centers would have access to before- and afterschool programs. Again, it defies common sense to believe we are going to continue to turn our backs. 
   I do understand some of it. I understand some of our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle don't want to put money into the Federal education system unless it is done in one way--maybe a big block grant that has no targeting whatever with respect to any of the priorities we might embrace as a Federal Government. 
   For instance, if we happen to believe it is important in certain States that Head Start be a priority or that afterschool programs be a priority or early childhood intervention be a priority, and we think as a matter of Federal priorities it is very important that at least the Federal Government say, hey, you go decide how you want to spend the money--if you want to put it into this kind of child care or that kind of child care, that is your business; we just want to make sure some of it goes to child care; that is all we are looking for--we cannot even get that kind of an agreement. 
   The great divide in the Senate is over putting some money into a grant where there is so much discretion that States that have never chosen to do any of these things could continue to choose not to do any of these things. Is that a smart expenditure of Federal dollars? I don't think so. 
   We are not even going to have an opportunity in this budget resolution to guarantee that the kind of dollars that ought to be part of that will be part of  it. So we will see reductions in the total amount of expenditure in order to have some huge tax cut as a matter of priority at a time when the Federal component of taxation is at its lowest level since I have been in the Senate. It seems to me we ought to be measuring our priorities a little bit more carefully. 
   I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are going to come to the floor and say: We put additional money into the special needs sector, into IDEA. They have about $1 billion that goes into IDEA. 
   All the other priorities, the real stuff of educating in America today, are in the cities and the rural areas that do not have the tax base. No matter what they say about money that will go into education spending, there is nothing in this budget that will guarantee those communities most in need are going to find the additional funding they need to address the needs of education in the country. 
   We should be talking about putting somewhere between $40 billion to $50 billion over the next 10 years in additional funding for education. We should probably have a significant separate trust fund that guarantees education is going to be the kind of top priority it needs to be, so every school in America has the ability to keep its doors open into the evening so parents--who are working extra hours, many of them single parents who have their kids in child care during the day and would like to have ongoing education--can participate in the new economy and have the ability to use school facilities well into the evening, even while their children may be there also getting their homework done in a secure environment so they can go to school the next day ready to learn. 
   In community after community in the United States, there are kids on waiting lists for Head Start, early childhood intervention--for all those programs that bring a child to the first grade ready to learn. I have talked to so many first grade teachers who tell me they have kids coming into a classroom with 25 kids in a class, 30 kids in a class, and the kids cannot even do the elementary things kids coming to first grade ought to be able to do such as early numbers or recognizing shapes and forms and colors. So they have to step aside and they have to deal with the problem of that child, magnified five, six, seven, eight times over, and try to deal with the mainstreaming of a full class of 25 kids at the same time. 
   We believe the standard of education that requires you have 18 kids and no more in a class is appropriate. These are the kinds of priorities left out of this budget. I regret that enormously. I regret this budget is a negative against even the rate of growth of inflation. I hope we will have a chance to rectify that in the days ahead.

   Mr. KERRY. My understanding is, $2.3 billion is for a new mandatory program that will not even be spent until the year 2005. That leaves an immediate increase of $2.2 billion. But the Republican budget resolution also assumes the $700 million increase in Pell grants. That brings it up to the President's level. It claims the $2.6 billion increase for elementary and secondary education programs alone, of which $1 billion is reserved for the IDEA. That means you have supposedly a total of $3.3 billion specified for K through 12. But the resolution only allows for a $2.2 billion increase because you do not even have an expenditure permission until 2005 for $2.3 billion. So there is a lot of ``robbing Peter to pay Paul.'' 
   Is that not true?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, that is a classic response to simply say the Senator is wrong. But there is no showing to the contrary. The language of the budget is absolutely clear. There is no question it forces $1.1 billion in cuts. But the way to have a debate is--to simply say it is wrong, and question whether the Senator's facts or capacity to even understand the facts are correct, I mean, we could talk about rule XIX here, but I am not going to do that. But I would suggest, we deserve a better debate than that. 
   I yield the remainder of my time to the distinguished manager.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont. I know this letter has been referenced previously, but I want to re-reference it in light of what the Senator read from General Schwarzkopf. No less a distinguished general, Gen. Colin Powell, has written a letter to Senator LEAHY:  
   I love our flag, our Constitution and our country with a love that has no bounds. I defended all three for 35 years as a soldier and was willing to give my life in their defense.  
   I am skipping down a paragraph:  
   I understand how strongly so many of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such an amendment. I feel the same sense of outrage. But I step back from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage. The First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies not just to that with which we agree or disagree, but also that which we found outrageous. 
   I would not amend that great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants. The flag will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away.  
   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to print in the RECORD this letter from Gen. Colin Powell.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I have enormous respect for the patriotism and the passion which so many of my fellow veterans bring to the effort to protect the flag of our country. Many of them are my friends, and it is never easy to disagree with friends on issues of conscience and emotion. While, obviously, out of approximately 250 million Americans there are a few miscreants, as Gen. Colin Powell says, who might choose to desecrate the flag, the vast majority of Americans know better. 
   Americans rightfully love the Stars and Stripes for all it symbolizes, for all the history, the glory, the promise, and the possibilities that are carried within its four corners. As most Americans, I feel the long honor roll of battles won and lost when I see Old Glory marched in for the presentation of colors. I feel unbridled pride watching her ripple in the breeze when we join together to sing the national anthem. I feel the cloak of patriotism draped over the coffin of a veteran to whom we bid farewell. Our flag is a stunning symbol of all that has made us who we are. 
   In the end, it is a symbol. It is not who we are. Who we are is embodied in the rights and obligations in the Constitution itself. A desecrated flag is replaceable. Desecrated rights are lost forever to those who experience the loss. What makes the United States different and, in many ways, stronger than any other nation is our aspiration for tolerance and diversity. Thanks to our Constitution, we are the leading proponent on the face of this planet for the greatest experiment in freedom that is set forth in words and in practice. 
   At the close of our national anthem, we sing, ``land of the free and home of the brave.'' Were this amendment to pass, make no mistake about it, we would certainly be a little less free and a lot less brave. 
   In the final analysis, there are eight powerful reasons for anyone, but I think particularly for a veteran, to vote against this constitutional retreat. They are: Iran, Iraq, Libya, North Korea, China, Cuba, Syria, and Sudan. These are the nations of the world that have laws banning flag desecration. They used to be joined by the South Africa of apartheid and Nazi Germany. 
   I ask my fellow Senators: Is that what we want to do with the freedom of the United States of America? Is this in keeping with all that our great Stars and Stripes stands for? Is this for what soldiers fought and died, so we could join this list of discredited, dictatorial regimes? 
   Does the United States of America, in response to an occasional act of defiance, ignorance, stupidity, and insolence, want to tremble and, for the first time in an extraordinary 224 years  of challenges, alter the Constitution to diminish someone's right to be stupid? 
   Our flag is stronger than any of those individual acts will ever be, quite simply because our country is bigger and stronger than any of those acts, and our country is bigger and stronger because of our Constitution and particularly the Bill of Rights. 
   This vote is not a test of patriotism because patriotism is, after all, love of country and loyal support of one's country. Our country is defined by the rights we protect, and my oath as a Senator is to defend the Constitution which defines those rights. That is how I will vote, and that is how I think my colleagues should vote.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first, I thank the distinguished majority leader for joining me in this important discussion today. I thank him for the vital role he played in shepherding the FAA authorization bill through the conference committee. We have been without an authorization bill for too long and this bill is a critical step in ensuring our skies are absolutely safe and less congested. But, as the majority leader well knows, aviation is not the only important piece of transportation funding this bill may affect. I believe that my friend agrees with me that, as important as aviation is to our country, funding for Amtrak and the Coast Guard are also crucial, and in enacting this bill, we by no means intend to give short-shrift to those parts of our transportation budget. Isn't that right, Mr. Majority Leader?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am gratified to hear the majority leader's commitment to Amtrak and the Coast Guard, as well as his intention to work with the chairmen of the Budget and Appropriations Committees to fully fund transportation needs at least for FY 2001, and hopefully beyond. Both Amtrak and the Coast Guard are absolutely necessary to my constituents. I would like to say a few words about the importance of Amtrak nationwide. This country needs to include passenger rail as part of its transportation mix in the 21st century. We have done a good job ensuring our highways and, now, our skyways get the funding and attention they deserve. Amtrak also needs some of that attention. Passenger rail is critical if we are going to reduce congestion on our highways and in the air, as well protect our environment. 
   People need a choice in transportation, and high speed rail especially can be a viable option for many, not only in the Northeast, but along corridors throughout the country. 
   On January 31, 2000, Amtrak launched Acela Regional--the first electric train in history to serve Boston and New England. This is literally a dream come true for all of us up and down the East Coast who care about jobs, the economy and traffic congestion and the environment. And in its first few weeks of operation, I understand that bookings on Acela Regional are up as much as 45 percent over the Northeast Direct line. This will be extremely helpful in my home state of Massachusetts, as well as in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Maryland, where airport and highway congestion often reach frustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, the fewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways. 
   Amtrak is not the only transportation priority we need to fully fund. The Coast Guard performs a number of critical missions for our country including search and rescue, environmental protection, marine safety, fisheries enforcement, and drug trafficking. I can't imagine any of our colleagues arguing that any one of these missions is unimportant or should be less than fully funded. Perhaps my good friend will expand upon the importance the Coast Guard's many missions.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in honor of International Women's Day, I respectfully call upon my friend, the Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, to hold hearings on an international treaty to fight discrimination against women around the world. 
   The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) was adopted by the United Nations in 1979 and signed by President Carter in 1980. It is a comprehensive and detailed international agreement to promote the equality of women and men. It legally defines discrimination against women for the first time and establishes rights for women in areas not previously covered by international law. More than 160 countries have ratified CEDAW, including all of our European allies and most of our important trading partners. It is well past high-time that the United States Senate take up and ratify this important international agreement. 
   In 1988, I convened field hearings on CEDAW in Massachusetts to highlight the importance of this treaty to American women. In the years that followed, I was pleased to support the efforts of former Senator Claiborne Pell, then-chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, to develop a resolution of ratification of CEDAW. In 1994, thanks to Senator Pell's leadership, the Foreign Relations Committee voted 13 to 5 to report the Convention favorably with a resolution of ratification to the Senate for its advice and consent. Despite support for ratification from Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, many state legislatures, the Clinton administration, and from the American public, opponents of this treaty blocked its consideration by the full Senate. 
   The resolution of ratification for CEDAW could be taken up tomorrow, if there was the political will in the Senate to do so. Ratification of CEDAW will strengthen our continuing efforts to ensure that women around the world are treated fairly and have the opportunity to realize their full potential. It will send a clear signal of our commitment to eliminating all forms of discrimination against women and it will underscore the importance we assign to international efforts to promote the rights of women. By allowing us to participate in the UN Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women, ratification will give us a bigger voice in shaping international policies that affect women. 
   Our failure to ratify has encouraged criticism from allies who cannot understand our refusal to uphold rights that are already found within the provisions of our own Constitution. It has put us in the same category with a small and very undistinguished minority of countries who have not ratified CEDAW, including Afghanistan, North Korea, Iran and Sudan. It is difficult for the United States to criticize the terrible treatment of women in these and other nations when we have not yet recognized those rights as international legal standards. 
   CEDAW is an important human rights document that is largely consistent with the existing state and federal laws of the United States. Senate advice and consent to this Convention will demonstrate U.S. leadership in the fight for women around the world.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to introduce an amended version of the Coastal Stewardship Act, which I offer along with Senators HOLLINGS and INOUYE. The purpose of introducing this amended version is to provide a blueprint for how we believe the Senate should address coastal and marine issues in larger proposals that allocate revenues from oil and gas exploration in the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) to the States for conservation. This amended version creates the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund with $375,000,000 to address urgent needs in our coastal and marine environment, including wetlands, non-point pollution, fisheries research and management, coral reefs and enforcement. 
   The bill allocates $100,000,000 to Cooperative Fisheries Research and Management. We have a great need to improve our understanding of fisheries and the fishing industry. The National Marine Fisheries Service, regional fisheries councils, states, the commercial and recreational fishing industries and conservationists rely on fishery data to make difficult management and investment decisions. Given the importance of having sound information, Congress requested the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to assess the  quality of our fisheries data. NOAA concluded that, ``Despite some regional successes, it is clear that the current overall approach to collecting and managing fisheries information needs to be re-thought, revised, and reworked. The quality and completeness of fishery data are often inadequate. Data are often on inaccessible in an appropriate form or timely manner. Methods for data collection and management are frequently burdensome and inefficient. These drawbacks result in the inability to answer some of the most basic question regarding the state of the Nation's fisheries .....'' NOAA added, ``Simply put, to manage fisheries at local, state, regional, or national levels requires a much better fisheries information system than the one in place.'' I have heard a similar refrain from almost every person and group involved in our fisheries, whether their interest is fisheries management, commercial or recreational harvest or fisheries conservation. With this legislation, the Governor of any State represented by an Interstate Maine Fishery Commission may make an application to the Secretary of Commerce for funding to support projects that address this critical need. We will establish comprehensive programs to improve the quality and quantity of information available to evaluate stocks, design control measures, develop more environmentally-sound gear and include the fishing community in the process. 
   The Cooperative Enforcement provision allocates $25,000,000 for the Secretary of Commerce to enter joint agreements with coastal states to enhance our coastal and marine enforcement. As with all our laws, our natural resources laws are only effective if they are enforced. These joint ventures allow states and local governments to tailor enforcement procedures to fit local needs and available resources, and allow for collaboration between state and local enforcement agencies and federal agencies, including the Coast Guard. The proposal authorizes the Secretary of Commerce to delegate its living marine resource enforcement authorities to a state marine law enforcement entity and to pay state enforcement costs pursuant to the individual agreements crafted with each participating state. State enforcement under these agreements would extend to requirements of federal or regional fisheries management plans, including those of interjurisdictional fishery management commissions. When first introduced, this proposal was endorsed by the National Association of Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs, the Gulf States Marine Fisheries Commission, the Northeast Conservation Law Enforcement Chiefs Association and others. 
   A total of $250,000,000 is dedicated to Coastal Stewardship. This flexible program allocates funds to states based on coastline, population and need for projects that restore and preserve coastal and marine habitat. Projects must be consistent with the Coastal Zone Management Act, National Estuary Program, National Marine Sanctuary Act, the National Estuarine Research Reserve program and other laws governing conservation and restoration of coastal or marine habitat. In this program, states set priorities and decide how and when projects proceed within broad national goals. The benefits will be enormous. We will preserve and restore wetlands, reduce non-point source pollution, remove abandoned vessels causing environmental damage, address watershed protection, and undertake a range of other projects, all aimed at coastal conservation. 
   Finally, $25,000,000 is set targeted at Coral Reef Restoration and Conservation. We must recognize the importance of maintaining the health and stability of coral reefs which possess enormous environmental and economic value. With this legislation we will fund cooperative projects with States to preserve and restore our coral reefs. 
   A portion of these authorizations is set aside for the Department of Commerce to enhance its National Marine Sanctuaries, coral programs and other critically important conservation efforts. 
   I want to thank Senator HOLLINGS and INOUYE for joining as cosponsors. I look forward to working with Senator BINGAMAN, the Commerce Committee, and Senator LANDRIEU and others who are working to pass comprehensive legislation to dedicate revenues from Outer Continental Shelf exploration to the conservation of our coastal and marine environment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia, and I thank the Senator from Nevada for their assistance in moving things along. I will try not to take very long. In fact, I want to say a few words about the schoolchild my friend from Illinois was talking about. Let me try to get through the substance and see where I am timewise before I do that. 
   Whatever the dynamic we are locked into in the Senate, it is clearly not promising or anything substantive to pass. Our friends on the other side of the aisle have decided that nothing substantive with respect to education will fundamentally pass. Yesterday we passed a study on welfare offered by Senator WELLSTONE, but every other effort to deal with education is preordained. 
   I understand in standing up here the fate of this amendment. Notwithstanding that, I want to make it clear, and I think my colleagues who preceded me have made it clear, that these are the real issues that face the country and these are the choices the Senate ought to be making. If our colleagues simply choose to dismiss them out of hand, then that is a reality the American people, I hope, will begin to digest at the appropriate time, which is obviously election time in this country. There may be another chance when we will deal with some of these issues. We certainly hope there will be. But not being guaranteed that opportunity, we have to take this opportunity now. 
   Everyone in this country knows we have a teacher shortage of remarkable proportions. We are supposed to hire some 5 million teachers over the course of the next 10 years, 2 million of them in the next 5 years. If one looks at an article that appeared in the Washington Post at the beginning of this school year, it tells us the story of some of that hiring. A principal in Northern Virginia was so desperate for teachers to begin the school year that she was wooing shoppers at Wal-Mart in an effort to find people to teach in her school. 
   The last thing the parents of our children and our school administrators want is an unprepared, unqualified, uncertified adult simply there supposedly to fill a quota and ``teach,'' and I put quotes around that. 
   If we continue on our present course, we are going to face many similar stories. But we know because of the pressures of attrition, the pressures of the classroom itself, the lack of pay, and other problems attendant to teaching today, we are losing many more people than are coming into the profession. Thirty to 40 percent of the people who teach leave within the first 3 to 5 years. We have a remarkable rate of loss and a remarkable rate of turnover. 
   We also know we have an incredible shortage of teachers who teach in the field for which they may have gone to school or in which they have a degree. Again, I am not going to take up all the time, but the statistics with respect to teachers who are qualified to teach math or science is extraordinarily distressing, not to mention other subjects that people also come to teach. 
   The amendment I offer today addresses this by seeking to address the question of how do we create an incentive to draw people into teaching. 
   I met with young people this morning, interns in my office, about 15, 16 of them. Not one of them is planning to be a teacher or is even thinking about it. 
   When I speak at colleges and universities there may be whatever number of people in the room, and I ask them: How many of you are planning to be teachers? You are lucky if you get one or two or three hands going up because most people cannot afford to do it based on the loans they have at the end of their schooling. Also, many of them find the opportunities of the private sector simply too great, too alluring, so they are drawn away from teaching. Thirdly, our school systems today, because of the lack of adequate resources, structures, support, curriculum, reform standards, and other things, are not particularly enticing to many young people in terms of a career option. 
   We have to offer greater incentives to attract people, particularly measured against the marketplace. Therefore, the current law already forgives $5,000 in student loans after 5 years in teaching. 
   My amendment seeks to recognize the reality of that principle, which we have already adopted, that an incentive works. But recognizing that, the second reality is that because of the marketplace, the incentive isn't strong enough. So we need to find a way to add an additional incentive. My amendment would provide an additional $5,000 in forgiveness for teachers after 2 years of teaching, providing additional relief for those who are faced with leaving teaching in order to make more money. 
   In addition, we would offer a grant for States to be able to establish a program to provide college scholarships to students with SAT scores or grade point averages in the top 20 percent of each State's high school graduating class. That would be in return for a commitment by the individual to become a State-certified teacher for a period of 5 years. 
   We have always tried to attract people into our military service by offering them, either through the Service academies or through ROTC or through the GI bill, the opportunity to be able to have payment in exchange for a service that we value greatly: Service to country. 
   Here we are trying to apply the same principle, and we are trying to draw some of the top students. Those who have performed the best in high school will have an opportunity to have college scholarships so they can go to college, not come out with the burden of debt and, indeed, dedicate 5 years of their life to teaching in return. 
   In a sense, it is a GI bill for teaching. I hope my colleagues will recognize this principle and the value of it. 
   The teacher shortage our schools are facing now will pale in comparison to what we're looking at over the next 10 years as large numbers of teachers are expected to retire and enrollments are expected to increase. The pressures of attrition, of retirements, will only be compounded by the impact of hundreds of other important education improvement efforts taking root all over the country, whether it's class-size reduction or higher standards for teachers, and that too will exacerbate the teacher shortage. 
   So what do we do about it? We must pass legislation that helps increase the supply, and the quality, of teachers in this country. And to do that, we must make the teaching profession more attractive to our young people and to those many thousands of people who are certified teachers but have left the profession because of financial constraints. 
   The amendment I offer today addresses the teaching crisis plaguing our Nation's schools and impairing our children's ability to learn and succeed.  My amendment will provide full-time state certified public school teachers who teach in low-income areas or who teach in areas with teacher shortages such as math, science, and special needs with loan forgiveness of up to $5,000 after 2 years of teaching and an additional $5,000 after 5 years of teaching. 
   I know the Congress believes loan forgiveness is an important way to attract and retain qualified teachers, because current law already forgives $5,000 in student loans after five years of teaching. My amendment would provide an additional $5,000 in forgiveness for teachers after 2 years of teaching, providing relief for teachers who are faced with leaving teaching to make more money, and providing an incentive for them to continue in the field. Coupled with increased ongoing education opportunities that are the focus of so many Senators, particularly my colleague from Massachusetts, who has contributed so much to the education debate over the years, Senator KENNEDY, coupled with increased professional development opportunities that I hope we will enact, we have the capability of recruiting and retaining thousands of highly qualified teachers around the country. 
   My amendment would also provide grants for states to establish a program to provide college scholarships to students with SAT scores or grade point averages in the top 20 percent of each state's high school graduating class in return for a commitment to become a state certified teacher for 5 years. States would contribute 20 percent of the funds for the scholarships. This amendment would also establish a national hotline for potential teachers to receive information on a career in teaching. 
   Demand for teachers is so great that it is projected that 50,000 unqualified teachers have been hired annually on emergency or substandard licenses. And the situation is most severe in poor urban and rural areas. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, these districts have such a hard time recruiting and retaining qualified teachers that 39 percent of their teachers have neither a college major or minor in their primary field of course work. 
   What does this mean for our children's education? In urban schools where children are already crippled by an unfair playing field, a lack of adequate resources, too often the teachers they do have are unqualified. And over the next 10 years the situation 
   will get even worse, virtually guaranteeing that the percentage of unqualified teachers in these schools will increase. 
   I ask you this: How are our young people supposed to get engaged in the learning process if they only have warm bodies in their classrooms? Who will answer the questions that children have about their lessons if the teachers themselves are not sure of the answers? I have heard from people all over my state, deans of engineering schools in my state, high school administrators, parents, about a decrease in the number of young people interested in pursuing math, science, and engineering degrees after they graduate from high school. Is it any coincidence then that the greatest shortage of teachers in this country is in the areas of math and science? No wonder our young people are seeking math and science degrees in lower numbers. They aren't excited about these subjects because the teachers weren't there to get them excited, to provide them with good instruction, to encourage them on. And I won't even get into the shortage of hi-tech workers before us now and that we are in dire need of greater numbers, not fewer, of graduates in math, science, and engineering. 
   I can guarantee you that this additional loan forgiveness and a scholarship program are necessary, that the existing laws will not recruit the numbers and quality of students we need. Thirty to fifty percent of all new urban teachers leave the teaching profession within the first 3 to 5 years of teaching. And while we can't be sure that all of these young teachers leave because of inadequate salaries and blossoming student loans, when you look at the data you can be sure looming students loans and low paying comprise a great deal of the incentive for these teachers to leave. 
   We need to attract the best and the brightest teachers into our public schools to cultivate the minds of our children. But can we realistically expect those students graduating from 4-year institutions and saddled with thousands of dollars in student loans--the average private college students graduates with $14,000 of loans that must be repaid--to enter career where they can expect a starting salary that barely reaches the mid-twenties? How can we expect our young people to turn their backs, particularly in this booming economy, on higher-paying jobs as analysts, in technology companies. 
   Consider the case of Bridgewater State College, which was the first college in Massachusetts to obtain accreditation under the new National Council for the Accreditation of Teacher Education standards. One-fifth of Bridgewater State students go on to become teachers in Massachusetts and throughout the country. But these students graduate with an average of $8,693 in student loans that must be repaid. And that is from a public school, where in-state tuition is just $8,000. A student graduating from a private college, of which there are many in my state, faces a average of $14,000 in loans to be repaid. 
   Now, we all know that first-year teachers are poorly paid. The average starting salary is in the mid-twenties. it is simply too difficult for young teachers to make ends meet when, in addition to paying rent, buying groceries, maybe saving for graduate school, or for a car, they must also pay back these loans. 
   We must act on this legislation now. If not because we are facing an imminent teacher shortage, then because of the rising cost of tuition. From 1990 to 1996, average tuition for a full-time resident undergraduate student rose 43.8 percent, but during that same period, the consumer price index rose only 15.4 percent. And at the same time, Mr. President loans are comprising a greater percentage of student's tuition than grants or income. In the early 1980s, loans covered about 40 percent of total aid. Now, loans cover 58 percent of total aid and during that period, grants went from covering 55 percent of total aid to just 40 percent of total aid. Mr. President, we must address this issue. We must provide assistance to aspiring teachers. We must act now.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today there was an article on the front page of the Washington Post. I thought the words captured in the caption really summarize the situation that the Senate needs to stop and think about much more seriously as we come into the budget deliberations for this year. 
   The title of the story is: ``A `Life in Chaos' Shaped Young Shooter.'' The description in the story talks about the life: Living in a place where drugs are rampant, where a gun is under a pillow, where parents are not paying attention. Literally, they define this as a life in chaos. 
   I have come to the floor many times over the course of the last few years to talk to my colleagues about exactly that: the difference for children between a life in chaos and a life lived in order, in structure. 
   The fact is, this child in Michigan, who saw fit to pick up a gun and shoot another student of the same age in their classroom, is tragically not an aberration in the context of life in America today. There are countless numbers of children living lives in chaos. 
   One-third of all of our children in this Nation begin life in a deficit because they are born into a parenting situation where there is only one parent, born out of wedlock. With the failure rate of marriages, when you add to  the one-third that begin life that way, maybe as many as 45 to 50 percent of America's children are being raised in a single-parent structure. 
   Too many kids who are raised with even two parents are often the victims of lives in chaos, where the parents are not paying attention, where there are not afterschool programs, there are not early start programs, there are not child-care programs. 
   Children, 5 million strong a day, are let out of school to go back to apartments and homes where there is no adult until 6 or 7 in the evening. We know that 5 million children are let out of school and returned to apartments and homes in that situation. 
   I know of cities in Massachusetts where, tragically, because of the situation in a housing project or the situation of a single parent who is struggling with two jobs, working to make ends meet, and they do not have a proper child care situation, children are also being raised in a kind of chaos. 
   Talk to any child psychologist anywhere in the world, and they will tell you the negative impact that kind of chaos or disorder or lack of structure has on children. 
   My prayer is that in the course of the next weeks, when we have the opportunity in this budget, in a year of surplus, in a year where we are talking about huge sums of money in tax rebate, and too much of it going back to people who already have more than most people in America, I hope that in that context the Senate is going to do the business of this Nation in helping parents to be able to parent and helping children to be able to live lives in order, not lives of chaos. There is no greater mission for this country.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment I have offered is a serious effort to try to attract qualified teachers in an era when the private sector is making it nearly impossible to draw people out of college and teaching because of the salaries. We really need a special incentive. 
   We have already created an incentive. We have a $5,000 paydown on loans. It is not enough to attract people. 
   I have offered an amendment that would raise the incentive and provide, in essence, a GI bill for teachers. I think it is worthwhile. I will not ask my colleagues to vote on it tonight because we are on automatic pilot. I think it is an idea that deserves better consideration than it will receive under that kind of approach. I don't want it prejudiced in the future by a vote that is on automatic pilot. 
   I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment with hopes we get the ESEA on the floor and we will have an opportunity to consider this in a better, bipartisan, and perhaps more thoughtful mode.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the Vaccines for the New Millennium Act of 2000. I have the honor of being joined by the distinguished chairman of the Africa Subcommittee, Senator FRIST, and my friend, the Senator from Washington, Mrs. MURRAY. This bill addresses a catastrophic problem that needs our immediate attention.  
   The proportions of the AIDS calamity in Africa are stupefying. More than 33 million people are infected with HIV--95 percent of them in sub-Saharan Africa. This disease will kill more than 2.5 million this year. It has already orphaned 11 million children, and it will orphan 40 million by 2010. These numbers are incomprehensible. To put in perspective, nearly 60 people will become infected with HIV in the time it takes me to testify today. 
   In addition, tuberculosis will kill close to 2 million this year, and a person dies from malaria every thirty seconds. No nation--but particularly ours--as rich as we are in talent, technology and money--can fail to help turn this around. 
   We should remember: borders do not matter when you are dealing with contagion. 
   These epidemics are out of control. And if we are to reverse this death spiral, we need to institute bold new measures. We must provide new global health infrastructures which look at long-term solutions for disease eradication. And, until they are established, we must provide much-needed short-term financing for disease prevention and treatment. 
   Mr. President, a number of my colleagues have shown great leadership in trying to find a solution to the health emergencies in the developing countries. 
   I applaud the work of my friend, Senator DURBIN with whom I have joined on a number of bills this year. I also recognize and support the efforts of Senator BOXER and Senator SMITH for their work on the Global AIDS Plan. Senator MOYNIHAN and Senator FEINGOLD also have an important plan to prevent vertical transmission of HIV from mother to child. I have supported all these plans. 
   Mr. President, I think we need to acknowledge the scope of this epidemic requires a bold response which looks beyond just preventing and treating this disease. The epidemiology of this disease dictates lifetime adherence to preventive measures. I am fully supportive of prevention programs--I have seen their very positive effect in the AIDS Action Committee in Boston and in AIDS Project Worcester. The Outer Cape also has a tremendous program which I support every year in Provincetown and these are echoed in small towns across Massachusetts which have accessed CDC grants and instituted the absolute best of community-based programs. I have also been an early and consistent supporter of the Ryan White program which comes up for reauthorization this year. 
   But, Mr. President, we need a vaccine--for the United States and for the developing world. 
   Vaccines are the most cost-effective weapon in the arsenal of modern medicine to stop the spread of contagious disease, and they offer a relatively inexpensive means of lowering a society's overall cost of medical care. Prime examples of the success are the three million children whose lives are saved each year as a result of early childhood immunizations against diphtheria, polio, pertussis, tetanus, measles, and tuberculosis. 
   Mr. President, consider the alternatives we have now. Pharmaceutical products, like the highly touted antiviral ``cocktail'' for treating AIDS patients can cost, on average, as much as $15,000 a year. That is a princely sum for even wealthy countries but clearly, for nations with per capita incomes of $700 or $800 like Malawi, such treatments and drugs are nowhere in the real of affordability. They also require enormous infrastructure investments and medical compliance which is difficult to adhere to in this country let alone developing societies. 
   For these nations, finding an affordable vaccine for AIDS is really the only option that offers them an opportunity for gaining control over the AIDS epidemic. 
   Unfortunately, of the $2.4 billion or so spent on overall AIDS research last year, only a fraction was spent on AIDS vaccine research. 
   The World Bank estimates that perhaps between $280 million and $350 million was spend worldwide on finding a vaccine for AIDS in 1999, or somewhere between 10 and 15 percent of the total amount spent on AIDS research. 
   Furthermore, of the $300 million or so spent on HIV vaccine research, less than $50 million came from private sector research and development budgets. Simply put, our biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries do not believe that investing in AIDS vaccine research is a good investment. 
   So, Mr. President, we have a responsibility, an obligation, to change this perception. Investing in an AIDS vaccine is one of the best investments we as a nation can make. And for Africa, it is the only hope for survival. 
   And while continued and expanded investments in our research engines are vitally important--I am referring to AIDS research at the National Institutes of Health--the time has come for us to explore additional strategies for stimulating private sector AIDS vaccine research and development. 
   We must look for innovative financing mechanisms. We must instill the financial incentives for our pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors to engage in areas that have previously ignored. 
   Mr. President, I was amazed to learn that of the $56 billion a year spent globally on health research, well over 90 percent is spent on research into health problems that concern only 10 percent of the world's population. 
   Amazingly, of the 1,200 new drugs commercialized between 1975 and 1997, only 13 were for tropical diseases--diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis which combined kill close to 3 million people a year. 
   Why is it that pharmaceutical companies don't invest in these diseases? Because there is no hope for finding a vaccine for malaria? No hope for finding an affordable vaccine for tuberculosis or HIV? Is the science just insurmountable? 
   Absolutely not. 
   Companies don't invest in these diseases because they don't foresee a profit. A malaria vaccine, while offering the potential to save millions of lives, does not offer the same return to shareholders as the return from Viagra, Lipitor, Prozac, or other blockbusters here in the United States. I don't blame the pharmaceutical industry for concern about their shareholders, but I believe it is morally imperative to jumpstart research into vaccines as quickly as possible. 
   What then, is the answer? Should we turn our back on these diseases as a casualty of the way free markets function? Should we dump billions into new government bureaucracies to tackle these problems? The answer on both counts is no. We as a nation, and as a responsible member of the international community, should create the market incentives to encourage our pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the best and brightest companies in the world, to invest in those diseases which are a scourge to the world. 
   What we need to do is give pharmaceutical companies the financial incentives to achieve what we know is possible and let them work their magic--these are the same engines of growth and technological progress which have helped extend life expectancy beyond what was imaginable at the turn of the century. Now, let's help them turn their attention to those diseases which kill millions upon millions in developing countries. 
   I think this type of public-private partnership is the most efficient means of addressing the world's growing health care pandemics. How would it world specifically? 
   The legislation I introduce today, the ``Vaccines for the New Millennium Act,'' provides a number of market incentives to encourage private sector investment in lifesaving vaccines. These incentives can be classified in one of two ways. Some of them provide a ``push'' mechanism--lowering the cost of R&D at the front end. Others provide a ``pull'' mechanism, demonstrating that a market will exist if the pharmaceutical companies provide the product. 
   On the push side, first, the bill expands on the research and development tax credit by increasing the credit rate from 20 percent to 50 percent for research related to developing vaccines for AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, or any infectious disease which kills over 1 million people a year. The tax credit is incremental such that the credit applies to research spending which exceeds a base amount. In effect, the credit rewards incremental increases in lifesaving vaccine research--thus giving our drug companies an incentive for more focus on lifesaving vaccines.  
   Second, the bill allows small biotechnology companies which do not have tax liability to pass a smaller tax credit through to investors. Firms with assets under $50 million may choose to pass through a 25 percent tax credit to investors who provide financing for research and development on one of the priority vaccines. The credit would apply to stock issued after the date of enactment and used within 18 months to pay for qualified vaccine research expenses. 
   Both of these proposals have been endorsed by a combination of public health advocacy groups and industry--including AIDS Action Council, the Global Health Council, the American Public Health Association and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. 
   Third, the bill authorizes voluntary contributions to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations and the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. The Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunizations is an international partnership recently established to expand and improve access to existing safe and cost-effective vaccines. It is being supported by a number of nations and international donors, including an incredibly generous founding gift by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. A similar provision was included in the President's budget. By working to improve the delivery of existing vaccines, the Global Alliance not only offers the opportunity to save lives, it will improve health delivery systems for the distribution of future vaccines. 
   Fourth, the bill authorizes voluntary contributions to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative. In effect, the initiative provides financing to industry in return for international access to the vaccine. For example, under a typical IAVI/industry agreement, IAVI will provide financing in exchange for an agreement with the manufacturer to sell the vaccine to developing countries at very reasonable prices. Once again, the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation provides a large portion of IAVI's funding. 
   To further accelerate the invention and production of lifesaving vaccines, the bill includes a tax credit proposed in the President's budget. Under the proposal, every dollar paid by a qualifying organization to buy a lifesaving vaccine would be matched by a dollar of tax credits--thereby doubling the purchasing power of nonprofit organizations and others that purchase vaccines for developing countries. The credit only applies to vaccines not yet developed, thus demonstrating the existence of a market if drug companies fill the void. The credit would apply to vaccines for AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis, or any other disease which kills over 1 million people annually. 
   The bill also establishes a Lifesaving Vaccine Purchase Fund. This approach has been advocated most prominently by Harvard economist Jeffrey Sachs, a witness on the third panel. 
   Under my proposal, Congress would authorize and advance appropriate $100 million a year, over ten years, to a fund for the purchase and distribution of newly-developed vaccines for AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis. The first appropriation would not occur until a vaccine has been licensed and approved. In effect, by establishing a guaranteed market, the proposal would provide a real incentive for additional private sector research. However, the money would not be spent until the vaccine was developed, thus postponing any cost to the government. 
   Finally, the bill directs the Administration to initiate negotiations with officials of foreign governments for the establishment of an international vaccine purchase fund that would purchase and distribute in developing countries vaccines for malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, or any infectious disease which kills over 1 million people. It is assumed that if such an agreement is reached, the domestic fund described above would be integrated into the multilateral agreement. 
   This is a comprehensive plan, Mr. President, which I have worked on for two years. This past weekend, it was endorsed as a positive step by academics, pharmaceutical executives and governmental leaders at a high-level conference convened by the University of California at San Francisco, World Bank and the Global Forum for Health Research. 
   Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI will introduce identical companion legislation in the House and it is my hope that our colleagues will give it equally serious attention.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there has been a long discussion here. I do not know if I am the last in the course of the afternoon. If I am, I apologize profusely to those who are enduring until we are released, but I would like to share some thoughts regarding this bill, if I may. We are not sure what the status will be tomorrow morning with respect to debate or opportunity to comment on it. 
   I just heard the Senator from Minnesota say the sky is not falling in. It is not the end of public education for the small amount of experiments that have taken place in Minnesota. I am sure that is absolutely true, looking at the amount of money involved, maybe $7 a year to a family using it for K-12, because once they have put whatever money aside they could in order to take advantage of K-12, the amount of interest buildup is not that great. So obviously we are not talking about the grandest sums of money. That is not what is really at stake. 
   In point of fact, the small amount of money is, in and of itself, an argument against doing what we are doing because it barely makes a difference to most of these families--though our colleagues who are advocating it argue that whatever difference it makes, it is worth trying to make that difference. But that obscures what is really at stake here. It obscures the very significant, large issues about what the Senate ought to be doing, about what the real priorities of education in the country are, and about the inappropriateness of the underlying principle on which this bill is based. 
   So it does not matter how much money, whether it is $10, $20, $30. It is a question of whether or not we are addressing the real concerns of education; whether or not this is what the Senate ought to be doing as its first act of speaking on the issue of education in the year 2000. It is astonishing to me that given the breadth of the education needs of the country, and given everybody's acceptance that education is perhaps the single most important issue to the Nation, here we are, when we could spend weeks on the critical issue of a broad-based approach to education, we have one little tidbit, one little piece of bait hanging out there as a statement of where our colleagues on the other side of the aisle seem to want to come from with respect to the larger issue of education itself. 
   What am I talking about? In the legislation, on page 5, where it talks about a qualified elementary and secondary education expense, it says specifically that this can go to anyone who is:  
   ..... an elementary or secondary school student at a public, private or religious school..... .  
   This is an enormous transition for the United States of America because what we are talking about is a first-time extension of a significant tax approach to secondary and elementary school, private, and religious education. We have historically always drawn a critical line between higher education and secondary and elementary education. We do that for a lot of different reasons, not the least of which is that the Federal Government has never assumed fundamental responsibility as a national priority, if you will, for every person in America going on to higher education. Though we hope it, we want it, we encourage it, we have Pell grants, we have student loans, we have all kinds of ways in which we encourage people to do that, but we do not have the breadth of touch on the students because of the great breadth of educational opportunity that has grown up privately in the country. 
   That is not true in public education, which has been a commitment for secondary and elementary schoolchildren since this country's founding when Thomas Jefferson first talked about the pillars of education; since the days when we first made our commitment to a public education system that would help serve as the great melting pot/equalizer, if you will, by which we help to bind the country together as a country. That was going to happen, not through divisions of wealth but, rather, through people knowing that by every child in America sharing in the opportunities of public education we would build that kind of country. 
   All of us understand the educational system we have today is not performing, in some places, in the way we desire. It is, I might add, performing an awful lot better in a lot more places than many people want to admit. The fact is, there are some stunningly capable, extraordinary public schools across this country. They are providing students for the best universities in the Nation. 
   What we need to talk about on the floor of the Senate is how we are going to empower every public school in the country to be able to replicate the best practices that take place at those other extraordinary public schools, or, I might add, at a private school, or at a religious school. But we do not fund it, and that is what this legislation seeks to do. 
   It is called the Affordable Education Act. I am not sure why it is called the Affordable Education Act because only those who can already afford to send their kids to a parochial or to a charter school or some other kind of school really are going to benefit from it. It is hardly going to be affordable to the families for whom the question of affordability is most important. It is certainly not going to be affordable even for those families who are already making savings because the amount of money they are allowed to put away hardly makes anything affordable. Finally, it really is not affordable because it applies to so few kids. 
   Ninety percent of the children in America go to school in public schools, and nothing in this act is going to alter that one iota. Ninety percent of the kids in America go to school in public schools. What we really ought to call this act is the Alternative to Public Education Act because that is really what it seeks to do. It seeks to establish a new principle by which we can come back each year and begin to build up the amount of money that some will fight for to put into savings accounts so that ultimately it will grow to a sufficient amount that, indeed, will become the alternative to public education for those who have the ability to make that choice or, for various reasons of abandonment of the public school system, are encouraged to do so as the only way to send their kids, in their judgment, somewhere that will make a difference. 
   What we ought to be talking about in this Chamber today--in fact, every day until we complete the task--is how we are going to guarantee that every school within the public school system has a fair opportunity to make of itself what schools in the richest communities make or schools which are the beneficiaries of remarkable endowments or parents in various parts of the country who have enormous sums of money and, in some cases, schools which are not necessarily dependent on  a significant amount of money but which have a core group of parents and students which allows them to behave in a way that is different from some schools in the inner cities or in rural areas where it is much tougher to build that kind of support. 
   The question the Senate ought to be debating is why we are not here as our first act trying to guarantee the real promise of America, which is to make certain that all of our children have an opportunity to go to schools that will make a difference in their lives on the positive side of the ledger. 
   We have been around this sometime before in the Senate, and it grows increasingly frustrating as we continually come back with these scatter-shot, little tidbit efforts. I know my colleague from Georgia does not view it as a tidbit. I know this is important to him personally. I know it is important to some colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But you cannot look me or anyone else in the eye and suggest this can pretend to be a comprehensive approach to the education needs of this country. If it is not, you cannot convince me that this is where we ought to begin the debate about what we are going to do to fix the schools in the country. 
   I have come to the floor and said this to my colleague from Georgia. I do not understand it. I know no one is going to accuse me of not being here long enough to understand it. I think I have a pretty good sense of how the politics of these issues work, and I still am frustrated and do not understand it because I do not think we are always that far off. Yet we continually keep talking past each other. 
   I heard the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. DOMENICI, argue that we ought to have a very significant increase in the amount of money we put into education. I am confident that when he was Governor, the Chair understood full well the difficulties of some of the urban centers of the State he represents on how hard it is, based on a low tax base, to provide for computers or provide for sports programs in the afternoons or for libraries that stay open or afterschool programs or remedial programs for kids who are having trouble learning. These things do cost money. 
   The fact is, there are communities in our country that do not have a tax base to go to. Yet we have an agrarian-based structure that suggests we still ought to have a school system working on those old hours as well as on the old funding mechanism. 
   Where does the money come from? The money comes from property taxes, except to the degree they get money from the State treasury in either some form of education reform or other disbursement. For too many communities, they have zero ability. 
   In our State, we had the same tax revolution everybody else in the country had. We had a limit on the amount property taxes can be increased--and properly so, I might add. There are a lot of families on fixed incomes. There are a lot of senior citizens who have paid for their homes who do not have the income stream to support an increase in revenue. There are a lot of young families starting out who do not have the ability to find the extra cash-flow to pay for the property tax increase that might be necessary to adequately fund a really excellent school system. 
   What do we do? We merrily go down the road ourselves ignoring this fundamental reality. 
   I am with my colleagues on the other side of the fence. I do not want to throw money down a dark hole. I do not want to give money to a school system that is layered with politics, or has an inability to hold the teachers accountable, or does not have a structure that involves parents and has accountability of what kids are learning. I do not think anybody in the Senate wants to do that. 
   So I am having difficulty understanding why it is we cannot find a formula by which we are prepared to put some money into the system requiring those systems to embrace real reform, leaving up to those systems--and this is important--the determination of how they will get their kids to the end goal of a superlative education. 
   I do not think the Federal Government ought to run that. I do not think we ought to come trotting in with some new mandate and tell people, if you do not do this--that is not what this is about. We are only 7 percent of the budget of schools across this country. 
   Moreover, it is a steadfast principle that none of us wants to break that somehow the Federal Government ought to be involved in running the schools. We do not want that. I do not want that. I believe in local control, but local control has to mean also local empowerment, local capacity, local ability to do some of these things. 
   None of our colleagues can ignore the fact that if you are a young law student getting out of law school, one of the better law schools in the Nation, and you go to work in Boston or New York, you are going to start out now at $140,000 with the top law firms. Right out of law school, you can earn as much as a Senator, which may not be an appropriate measurement of anything, but that is what we are valuing. 
   A teacher comes out of college with $50,000 to $100,000 of loans, which they are required to start paying back the minute they go to work. They are going to start at $22,000, $21,000, $23,000, maybe work their way into the thirties after they have 15 years and a master's degree, and, depending on the school system, they can be at some school systems where they can get into the sixties, but with most of them they are in the forties after almost a career of service. 
   How do we turn to any student saddled with those loans in college and say: Ignore all those dot coms where you can earn 60,000 bucks almost right out of school, ignore the opportunities of the marketplace where there is 4-percent unemployment and you have this extraordinary gap in all the technological fields where the greatest restraint on growth to our Nation is going to be the lack of an available skilled labor pool, and we are going to say to kids who are facing that kind of job market: Come teach and be a pauper; 
   come teach, but forget the notion that you can share in that cape cottage or buy that extra car or have a longer vacation; you are going to just eke it out, you are going to just make it, but we expect you to raise your family the same way everybody else does and to live by the rules, and so forth and so on. 
   Are we crazy? We have lost all sense of proportion if we are not willing to try to recognize that if you are going to value teaching, you have to value teaching. That means valuing it by putting a fair market value on the people you want to have teach. 
   Does that mean that in exchange for that fair market value, you had better get your return? You bet it does. Does that mean accountability? Yes. Does that mean if you are not doing the job properly, you ought to be able to be fired? Yes. Does that mean you may have to work longer hours in return for that? Yes, it does. 
   I do not understand why we cannot come to some kind of an agreement that liberates every school system to go out and be the best it can be, and to let parents have choice, and have competition within the public school system. I am all for that. That is the best form of accountability there is in America--competition. 
   I have seen this happen. I have gone to many blue ribbon schools and have said: Why is this a blue ribbon school? What is it about this school that makes it a place where parents are clamoring to put their kids, but you go 10 blocks away and there is a school nobody wants to go to? You can very quickly pinpoint real, tangible reasons those differences exist. 
   Generally it begins with the principal. There is a great principal in every blue ribbon school I have visited. One of the great deficits in America today is our lack of capacity to attract, in some of the more complicated systems, the principals we really need in the context of modern education. Once again, that is a reflection of the money involved. It is a reflection of the school system, the structure, and other kinds of things. 
   But we ought to be on the floor of the Senate with a comprehensive approach as to how we attract young corporate chieftains, who are able to retire today with extraordinary wealth, to perhaps come in and be the principal of a school for a short period of time, lending their expertise. Ex-military officers, who retire after 20, 25 years, and are still young and have great talents in leadership, could help to manage.  
   I forget the name of the general out in Seattle who passed away a year and a half to 2 years ago who did an extraordinary job of doing just that. He became beloved in the school system because of the leadership skills he brought to the task. 
   We should have a national effort geared to try to attract people and pull them into these jobs. If we did that, we could begin to create energy in our schools where they competed with each other. As the parents say: I want to go over to the Driscoll school. I think what has happened over there at that Bartlett school is not working for my kid, but over at the other school all the parents are raving about the school system. The kids are doing better in their homework. They seem to have more discipline. All of a sudden, the schools are going to reverberate with parents making that kind of choice. 
   This isn't novel. There are a lot of places in the country where that is happening today. It is working. There are many other ways in which we could have a greater level of 
   accountability in our school system. All of this underscores what the real debate ought to be. 
   I am also astonished that we are quick to come to the floor of the Senate to put more money into tougher sentencing. We will put people away for longer periods of time in jail. We will build more jails. We provided more assistance in the crime bill to do that. All of those things are important. But isn't it equally important to try to prevent some of those kids from falling into those kinds of troubled lives when it makes a difference? 
   We know, to an absolute certainty, that the time when most of these kids get into trouble is in the afternoon when they are out of school, unsupervised, and they go back to apartments or houses where there is no adult until 6 or 7 o'clock in the evening. 
   I believe it was almost 8 or 9 years ago that the Carnegie Foundation did an extensive study pinpointing most of the difficulties teenagers had in the afterschool hours--unwanted pregnancies, drug experimentation, trouble on the street corners. All of these things have occurred because they were not in school and because schools did not have the afterschool programs necessary to provide the value-oriented structure they need. 
   Ask any child psychologist in the United States of America, ask any penologist in the United States of America, and they will tell you children need structure. When you release kids at 1:30 or 2 o'clock in the afternoon to almost a half a day of no structure, you are inviting the kinds of problems we have invited in the last years. It would be much cheaper to invest in long-term education, afterschool programs, early childhood education, et cetera, than to build $50,000- to $75,000-a-year prison cells for the people we have allowed to slip through the cracks. 
   People say: Do we really allow them to slip through the cracks? Let me tell you, I have visited some schools where kids have dropped out. In America, it used to be that you had a truancy system. If you dropped out or you left your school for a couple of days, teachers actually cared about it. They said: Wait a minute. Johnny is not here today. Where is he? Somebody went after him to find out what was going on. 
   Today, in cities all across America, a kid may not show up for school, and nobody does anything about it. Parents do not even know the kid did not show up. There is no money for truant officers? There is no money to track anybody? There is no way to do that? What do you mean? We are the richest country on the face of this planet. We have created more wealth in the last 10 years than at any time in American history. We have 460-plus billionaires in America today. We have had a surplus now for the second year in a row. We are sitting around toying with whether or not we are going to give seven bucks a year to people who already have money so they can send their kid to a religious school or a private school. What are we doing? 
   This place is losing its relevancy to the real problems of America if we cannot start at the beginning. The beginning is this broad-based problem that exists with respect to education in America. It is rampant. We understand that. How can our colleagues not come to the floor and say: It really does make a difference whether a teacher is being asked to teach 35 kids, 40 kids, 30 kids, 28 kids, or 18 kids. 
   I have talked to first-grade teachers who tell me they have 
   kids coming into the first grade today who cannot do the things kids used to do when they went to the first grade. They cannot do simple shapes. They cannot recognize colors. They cannot do early numbers. The teacher has to take that kid and somehow mainstream that child while managing the educational life of all the other kids in the classroom. I challenge any of my colleagues to do that for a day or two and see how they feel at the end of that effort. When you shortchange that teaching capacity, you are shortchanging every kid in the classroom. It has lasting impact. 
   I will give you another example. Not so long ago, I visited the Castle Square Early Child Development Center in Boston. There are 67 kids--infants and toddlers--who are in the Early Child Development Center. Of those 67 kids, I think 98 percent are the sons and daughters of single parents. That is a cycle we are trying to break. We do not want to pass that on to the next generation. The best way not to pass it on to the next generation is to guarantee kids have the kind of structure that makes a difference in their lives. But for the 67 kids who were in the early child development center, there were 550 on the waiting list. Maybe 5, maybe 10 of the 550 will be lucky enough to cross the threshold of that child development center before they have to report for the first grade. 
   Under the law of the land, you are supposed to report for the first grade ready to learn. But as we are learning, too many of these kids come to the first grade and are not ready to learn. So we have built a deficit into the system before we even begin. Then we turn around and respond by saying: The roof is falling in on the public education system of America. What are we going to do about it? Well, we are going to give kids an opportunity to go somewhere else. Where? To a private school, to a parochial school, to a charter school? 
   Mr. President, there aren't enough places in private schools, in parochial schools or charter schools in this country to save a generation of American children. We can't build those schools fast enough. There aren't enough seats. So we can talk about that as an alternative all we want. It is no alternative. 
   The alternative is to fix the public school system where 90 percent of the kids in this country go to school. Again and again, I say it, 90 percent. If we had the most ambitious program my colleagues on the other side of the aisle could design to have a voucher or to create some alternative, we couldn't take care of 5 to 10 percent of America's children, let alone 90 percent. If we want to fill those high-tech jobs, if we want America to match the increased focus of Asia, Europe, Latin America, and other countries on education as their primary need with respect to the digital divide and the economies of the future, if we are going to do that, we have to pay attention to 
   the educational opportunities afforded to our youngest children at the earliest stages of life. It is incomprehensible to me that we can't find the capacity to make certain that those 550 kids can all get the kind of early input they need so we can alleviate some of the crises in our school system by sending kids to school ready to learn. 
   All of this is part of a mosaic: early child education, early maternal input. Whether a mother is able to properly provide nutrition for a child affects a child's learning ability. All of these things do. It is very fashionable by many in the Senate to say that is the responsibility of parents. Yes, it is. It is the responsibility of parents. I agree. But what do you do when there aren't any parents? What do you do when there is only one parent who is working two to three jobs in order to make ends meet because that is also what we want them to do in America? They can't find the adequate child care. They don't have grandma and grandpa living in the house anymore. That is another change in America. People don't live that way anymore in the United States. So we don't have that great continuum that came down through generations that used to be the great teaching mechanism. But that is gone now. We have empty households.  
   So what do we do? We can talk about family. We can talk about values. We can also talk about the other great teachers. Religion is one of the other great teachers, absolutely. But without the parents, too many of these kids don't have that either. If they are dropping out of school, they don't have the other great teacher. So we have millions of kids, literally, around the United States of America who don't have any of the three great teachers in life. They don't have the family teacher, they don't have the organized religious teacher, and they don't have the teacher teacher in school because they are at risk in dropping out. 
   How do we fill the gap? We don't. We are debating whether or not to fill a nonexistent gap, to give some money to people who have already made a choice to send their kids to these schools. That is who most benefit by the legislation on the floor of the Senate. The people who benefit by this legislation are people who can save that kind of money. They are the people whose kids are probably already in a religious school or a private school. They are the kids who are already availing themselves of those benefits. 
   I am not saying to my colleague there is no value in providing relief for one of those parents. That is why we voted for tax relief. That is why we provide student loans. We do lots of things to provide that kind of relief. I am all for that. But let us get our priorities straight. 
   It seems to me the first obligation of the Senate is to come here embracing an overall concept. I might add to my colleague from Georgia, here we are being asked to spend $1-plus billion, $2 billion. It is as in a vacuum. I am being asked to give $2 billion to parents whose kids may go to religious or private schools without even knowing that the rest of the budget is going to be for any of the other things I have talked about. Are they going to be cut? Are we going to have less money for after school? Are we going to have less money for chapter 1? How much money are we going to have in the School Lunch Program this year? How much money will we have for Head Start? If I have to cut those or can't have as much as we ought to have, would we then take this $2 billion and put it elsewhere? 
   This is simply not timely. It is not appropriate. I hope it is not a statement of the full measure of priority of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I hope it is not. 
   There are other colleagues waiting to speak. I have gone on longer than I had intended. I hope this year can be a year in which the Senate can find its way to a comprehensive, across-the-aisle dialog, to bring ourselves together in a spirit of compromise. So far the only compromise I have seen with respect to the so-called Straight A's plan and the approach of our friends has been on our side of the fence. It is my hope we can have that real dialog. 
   I look forward to it and thank the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me underscore that distinction to my friend. The Vice President, No. 1, laid out the most comprehensive plan set forward by anybody running for President of the United States. He set forward a plan that included $115 million for a trust fund over 10 years. He set forward a plan to attract principals, to deal with teachers' pay, and with standards. It was a broad-based plan, and the section that the Senator from Georgia refers to does not apply to private secondary and elementary schools. It is college and job training. 
   Historically--and I drew this distinction--the Congress of the United States has always drawn a distinction between the higher education structure and the secondary and elementary structure. The problems I cited are precisely the reason why you need to have a broad-based approach before you throw any piecemeal legislation out there.

Now, when I see chapter 1 unfunded, or I see urban centers where they don't have computers, and I see so many kids in so many parts of the country whose families can't afford any of the amenities that make a difference, I find it very hard as a matter of choice to suggest that even that 50 percent is appropriately spent. 
   Now, I am not arguing with the Senator. I am not suggesting to him or saying that some family in public school may not benefit from this. I understand some public schools have uniform codes and a parent may be able to go buy a portion of the uniform. I don't know how much $7 a year is going to do. If you are doing it K through 12, that is the interest. The only benefit under the Finance Committee rule is the tax benefit of the tax-free interest savings. So you can withdraw the money you have put into the savings account, but all you are really getting the benefit on is the tax-free component. Say you put $500 in there and you have to draw it out in 2 years at 6 percent, or 5 percent, which is what they are earning nowadays--these things aren't even marketable; none of the major houses are marketing them, so you are going to earn base interest on it and you are not going to get much money as a consequence of that. So when you have very few resources, I say to the Senator, what is the justification?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I say to my colleague--and he knows this full well--there are Members of the Senate who basically have been fighting for years to create sort of a full-fledged support system, through the Federal Government, for education and/or for schools outside the public school structure. That has been a great fight in the Senate. 
   What I said is it is not the $7 that is critical here; it is the principle. If we adopt in the Senate a notion that we are going to now in the United States have a full-fledged support system for parochial schools and religious schools through the elementary and secondary level, that is new. Once we have made it $7, you are going to come back--or someone is--and say we haven't given them enough; we have to give them $500 because that is more meaningful. Of course, if we were willing to support either private or religious schools previously, what would stop us from giving them more money now? That is what this fight is about; it is not about the $7. Although, as a matter of choice, I don't see why it is we reward people who are already capable of sending their kids to these places and have made that choice versus the people who are having the hardest time making ends meet.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, my friend knows full well that the famous teacher Stanley Surrey, I think at Harvard Law, coined the phrase ``tax expenditure.'' We make choices in the Senate that if you forego a tax you expect to collect, it is an expenditure. Now, that is a well-known principle in terms of how we operate.

   Mr. KERRY. For the purposes of this, let us say it is 50 percent. I don't understand the public policy rationale for 50 percent of this benefit that we are going to grant going to private schools when 90 percent of America's children are in public schools, and of that 90 percent, the vast majority are poorer than those 52 percent who are going to get the benefit. It just doesn't make sense.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and celebrate the public service of Mary Ford, who recently stepped down as the Mayor of Northampton, Massachusetts. Throughout her 8 years in office, Mayor Ford has elevated the City to one of the jewels of New England, and I join all of her friends, family, and constituents in honoring her today. 
   As Mayor of Northampton, Ms. Ford oversaw the improvement of the school system, conducted comprehensive infrastructure improvements, modernized city services, and restored fiscal discipline. Perhaps the largest measure of her contributions to the city rests in the fact that, in the course of managing an annual budget of $55 million dollars, she erased a $3.2 million deficit. This financial turn-around allowed the city to entertain larger goals; the renovation and expansion of Northampton High School, the establishment of an innovative trust to preserve Section 8 assistance, and establishing Northampton as an attractive place to start new businesses. 
   Her leadership on the budget, which includes the general fund, schools, and enterprise funds, has been complemented by computerizing all the city office's and raising hiring standards. She set the policy priorities for all the city's administrative departments, including; housing, health and safety inspection services, planning, culture and arts, finance, as well as economic and community development. Mayor Ford orchestrated all of these elements into a cohesive, focused set of services that was delivered in an effective and efficient manner, thus improving the lives of all residents. 
   Due to Mary Ford's leadership, The City of Northampton is now one of the state's thriving, growing cities. 
   The list of her accomplishments on behalf of the city's revitalization is varied and extensive; she improved the city's emergency response capabilities by allotting $5.5 million for a state-of-the-art firehouse, renovated one third of the city's roads, and conducted comprehensive traffic re-designing for increased safety. Her accomplishments in education include securing an investment of $25 million for the modernization of Northampton's high school, a $12 million middle school expansion program, and work with the entire system's faculty and staff in implementing staff recommendations, reforming curriculum, and increasing parental involvement. 
   She has also shared her expertise in municipal and governmental affairs with state and national organizations. From 1995-99, she was a member of the Human Development Committee in the National League of Cities, a founding member of the Regional Education Business Alliance, Chair of the Task Force on the Future of State and Local Revenue Sharing for the Massachusetts Municipal Association, and President of the Women Elected Municipal Officials organization in 1998. 
   Mr. President, I am proud to regard Mary Ford as a friend, colleague and partner in maintaining Massachusetts's economic prosperity and growth. She has performed an enormous task for the City and its residents, and I join with all of Northampton in thanking her for her exemplary public service and leadership.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as we approach the budget debate this year, I think it is important for us to take a moment ahead of time to think about the broad outline of what we spend money on and also what we do not spend money on--how we allocate the priorities of this budget--because the budget is, after all, the most concrete, clearest expression of the priorities and intentions of the Congress. 
   I would like to walk through that for a moment, if I can, and then make a proposal to my colleagues, which I hope might, in the context of this year's surplus and the choices we face, be attractive. 
   The reality is, of the $1.8 trillion we will spend this year, the largest single expense, as we all know, goes to Social Security. The Federal Government is going to spend $400 billion or 22 percent of the Federal budget on monthly retirement and disability payments for about 45 million Americans who are either senior citizens or disabled. 
   The second largest commitment will be made to Medicare, nearly $220 billion or 12 percent of the Federal budget, ensuring that virtually every individual over the age of 65 receives health insurance benefits covering hospitalization, physician services, home health care, limited nursing home care, and laboratory tests, and providing health benefits to roughly 5 million disabled people. 
   In those two expenditures alone, we have spent a little over one-third of our budget on Social Security and Medicare. Of the remaining $1.2 trillion of that budget, we will spend $115 billion or about 6.5 percent of the budget on Medicaid. Those are, obviously, the health care benefits we provide to the least able to afford health insurance. In addition, we will spend about $110 billion or a little over 6 percent of the budget on Federal, civilian, and military retirement and disability benefits as well as veterans benefits. 
   When you throw in the other mandatory entitlement programs--such as foster care, unemployment compensation, farm price supports, food stamps, and supplemental security income, which is, as everybody knows, an income safety net for the poorest people in America--we then reach over $1 trillion in Federal spending. 
   This year, of the $1.8 trillion Federal budget, over $1 trillion will go towards the mandatory entitlement programs that, while vitally important, are on autopilot. We are not going to make individual judgments about them except to the degree we decide we need to shore up the Medicare program or shore up the Social Security program. They are basically on autopilot in terms of their existence. The consensus of the Congress wants them; the country wants them. We support them. They don't need to be renewed, and they don't need to be reauthorized. They obviously are not appropriated on an annual basis. 
   When we talk about the budget that we, as Members of Congress, are going to be dealing with in terms of discretionary spending, where we will make long-term investments, where we have some flexibility, we are dealing with about $800 billion. 
   All of us understand what happens very quickly to that remaining portion of the budget, to those $800 billion. Two hundred twenty-four billion or 12 percent of the Federal budget will go almost immediately to interest payments on the national debt. We are grateful that having reached the point of having a surplus, and with the President's proposal, we can see an end to the payments of interest on the national debt by the year 2013. But for the moment, 12 percent of the Federal budget this year is going to go to pay interest on the national debt. Those payments are not optional. 
   Putting that spending aside, we are now left with about one-third of the overall Federal budget or $600 billion which we now can use to cover all other Government functions. But that disappears very quickly. Two hundred eighty-three billion of that budget will be spent on national defense this year, nearly 16 percent of the Federal budget. Another 2.5 percent of the budget will be spent building highways, channeling harbors, 
   financing mass transit, all to a cost of about $45 billion this year. Then you factor in housing assistance, nutrition programs, at a cost of about $42 billion, that is another 12 plus percent of the budget. And less than 2 percent of all the budget will go to health research, public health programs, searching for a cure to cancer, for HIV-AIDS, licensing new drugs for the marketplace, programs to attack teen smoking, services for the mentally ill. 
   One and a half percent of the budget will go to crime control, putting cops on the street, fighting drug trafficking, and barely 1 percent of the budget will go to foreign aid. Many Americans labor under the perception that somehow foreign aid is this vast proportion of the Federal budget. In fact, foreign aid is a significantly less percentage and real expenditure than it was under Ronald Reagan. I think we spent two or three times as much under Ronald Reagan in foreign affairs than we are spending today, which, I might add, is particularly ironic when you measure the changes in the world and the need for the United States to be more involved, not less involved, in a world that is increasingly globalizing and where we are all feeling the impact and forces of technology. 
   The point I make to my colleagues today: For what most people agree is the single most important investment we can make in America, there is precious little money remaining. How many of my colleagues in the last years, recognizing the impact of the technology revolution, have come to the floor emphasizing the importance of education in America? We reap the benefits and the deficits of our attention to education in a thousand different ways. When Senators come to the floor and talk about the increasing problem of children having children, babies being born out of wedlock, the number of kids in America who are at risk, we should be directly examining how many of our schools stay open into the evening, how many of our schools have afterschool programs. How many of our schools don't even have an ability to be able to track children who are truant? 
   It used to be that in the United States of America there was an ethic that when children were not showing up in school, the truant officer went out and found the kids. We did something about it. Today, you can be a kid in school and not show up and nobody even stops to wonder what happened. In too many schools in America they may not even contact what is too often a single parent and find out whether that single parent might have had time to be able to be aware that their kid might not be in school or what they might have time or ability to be able to do about it. 
   I don't raise this issue of spending to try to disparage the other budget priorities. I think they are all priorities. I vote for them. I support them. I think everybody in the Senate understands the importance of all of the things I listed. We have built up a very real bipartisan consensus on the importance of most of these investments.  
   But why is it that in the year 2000, after years of talking about education's importance and education reform, we are so absent a consensus in this institution on the need to be investing in communities that have no tax base with which to improve the school system? Ninety percent of America's children go to school in public schools. We waste more time on the floor of the Senate debating some alternative to public schools, such as vouchers or charters, rather than figuring out how we are going to fix the public school system and invest in it properly so those 90 percent of our children have a place to grow up properly and share in the virtues of this new world that America is increasingly witnessing and even playing a critical role in developing. 
   Every one of us meets with the extraordinary creative energy of the new technology community of this Nation. We have remarkable people doing remarkable things. We have companies that have built up more wealth faster than at any time in the history of this Nation. But there is an enormous gap for those companies in their capacity to grow over the coming years. Every chief executive of every technology company in our Nation will tell us again and again and again that their greatest restraint on growth is the lack of an available skilled labor pool. There are some 370,000 jobs going wanting today in the technology field.

   Mr. KERRY. We are going to debate in Congress whether we are going to expand visas to bring immigrants from other countries to fill the jobs a properly educated young American ought to be able to fill or would want to fill if they had the opportunity to be able to do so. I think it is important to point out that out of a $1.8 trillion Federal budget, we are spending a relatively tiny amount of money to empower local communities to improve student achievement, to support teacher and administrator training, to help finance and encourage State, district, and school reforms, to recruit teachers, to fix failing schools, and to provide children the extra help they need to meet the challenging academic standards that are needed to make it in today's world. 
   Let me speak quickly to the teacher situation, Mr. President. For 3 years now, some of us have been coming to the floor of the Senate to warn our colleagues and America of our need to hire 2 million new teachers in the next 10 years. Why do we need to hire 2 million? Because we lose 40 percent of the new teachers in the first 3 years; because the schools are in such disarray, they have burnout in a mere 3 years, or they find the support systems are so inadequate they don't want to continue to teach. But we are also losing them because we have a whole generation of teachers reaching retirement age and we need to renew the teaching profession. 
   Ask any kid in college today: Do you want to go teach? How many kids plan to go teach in today's world? I read in the newspapers yesterday that the starting salary for an associate in a major law firm in Boston or New York is now equivalent to the salary of a Senator--about $140,000 a year. That is what you get the day you get out of law school and go to work for a large law firm. 
   If you want to, coming out of college today--and most kids need to because the average student gets out of college with about $50,000 to $100,000 worth of loans--they can look to go into some dot-com company where they can earn $60,000 or $70,000 within the first year or so of employment. What does a teacher get--$21,000, $22,000 a year? And after 15 years of teaching, when you have broken through and gotten your master's degree, you can get into the midthirties or high thirties. In some school districts, you may break into the forties. You can wind up an entire career of teaching and be earning maybe somewhere in the low fifties, high fifties, and very few districts hit the sixties. How do you attract anybody, under those circumstances, to do what we pretend is the most valued profession one can undertake--teaching. 
   So this year we are going to spend a grand total of slightly over $19 billion for all elementary and secondary education initiatives--or just barely over 1 percent of the $1.8 trillion Federal budget. When we hear our esteemed budget committee leaders talk about the great commitment on the part of Congress or the Federal Government toward improving education, I ask people to remember that what we are talking about is 1 percent of that Federal budget. We put so much more money into the back end of life in America, whether it is through Medicare or through Social Security, or just dying in a hospital--I hate to say it, but, tragically, in the last 2 weeks of life in America. We spend so much more at the back end of life than we invest when the brain is developing and it is in the most important stage of life. 
   Not one scientist will fail to document that what a human being will be--their capacity to think, their capacity to socialize, their capacity to be able to learn and to be a full participant in society--is 95 percent determined in the first 3 years of life. And we invest a fraction of a percentage of our budget to guarantee that children are safe and nurtured and, indeed, given the opportunities to have the maximum amount of brain development and opportunity for safety in those stages. 
   Our young people pull in about a penny on every dollar in terms of the investment priorities of the U.S. Congress. The National Center for Educational Statistics reports that the Federal Government provided 8.4 percent of total expenditures for elementary and secondary education from 1970 to 1971. It was 9.2 percent from 1980 to 1981. Yet last year we provided only 6.1 percent. The school population goes up, the demand goes up, but the commitment of the U.S. Congress, in total terms, goes down. 
   Let me put this in a different perspective, if I may. Let me compare the cost of investing in our children to the cost of some of our recently enacted tax provisions. In 1997, the President proposed, and Congress agreed, to create a new capital gains exclusion on home sales. Today, a homeowner can exclude from tax up to $500,000 of the capital gain from the sale of a principal residence. Obviously, we all agree that exempting the sale of a home from capital gains taxation is a good thing, and I am for that. Calculating the capital gain from the sale of a home is perhaps one of the most complex tasks a typical taxpayer faces because they have to keep detailed records of transactions on home improvements, they have to draw distinctions between improvements that add to the home's basis and repairs that 
   don't. But what does it say about our national priorities--that the cost of exempting up to $500,000 of gain on the sale of a home will cost the Federal Government $18.5 billion this year. We are going to give up $18.5 billion of our revenue because we have decided it is important to reflect this ``priority.'' That is almost exactly the amount of money we spend as a nation on all elementary and secondary education. 
   Mr. President, I think that is a disturbing budget reality, and it is an incontrovertible fact, which I believe requires us to try to reconcile with the current demands we face from millions of Americans, whether they are parents, teachers, or business leaders, all of whom are asking us to help improve the schools of this Nation. 
   Now, I point this out because I believe now, when we enjoy the greatest economic expansion in the history of our Nation, we have an opportunity to lay the foundation for a new era in America. It is an opportunity to fix our schools, to increase their accountability, to recruit more and better teachers, and to reduce the average class size. I share with my Republican colleagues the desire to guarantee that we have a new accountability in the school systems. I believe we can reach a consensus and achieve that. But it must be done by some commitment of additional resources in order to allow the reformers at the local level to empower their States and local school districts to be able to turn their schools around. 
   Under the CBO's most recent estimates, the on-budget surplus--that is, the non-Social Security surplus--will amount to somewhere between $800 billion and nearly $2 trillion. I believe their most conservative estimate is probably the better place for us to start. That conservative estimate assumes that spending will continue to  increase at the rate of inflation. It assumes the continuation of emergencies, such as droughts in the Midwest and hurricanes on the east coast. It even assumes the continuation of unlikely events such as a decennial census every year--when we all know that expense occurs only once every 10 years. 
   I ask my colleagues to focus on the fact we are not talking about just Social Security now. We are assuming that the Social Security surplus is locked up, as it ought to be and as we wanted it to be. But we must decide to dedicate a portion of these surpluses towards the appropriate investment priorities of the Nation. Yes, that includes Medicare reform and putting it on solid footing. Yes, it includes a prescription drug benefit to help people pay the extraordinary costs of prescription drugs. We should dedicate a portion of that surplus towards debt reduction so we can keep reducing interest rates, and reduce the future interest obligations and extend the virtuous cycle of fiscal discipline which is at the heart of our economic expansion. Yes, we ought to pass some targeted tax cuts for middle-income families--such as the marriage penalty, estate tax relief, and an increase in the standard deduction. We can do those things. 
   We can also reserve an appropriate amount of money for the education of our young people--to raise that education to the level of rhetoric, to the level of campaigning, and to the level of debate that has existed in the Congress in the past years. I think the Congress has a unique opportunity this year to tell America that our young people at those critical stages of development are worth more than one penny on the dollar. 
   I intend to introduce a 21st century early learning and education trust fund. This legislation would set aside 20 percent of the most conservative CBO estimate of the on-budget surplus over the next 10 years only. I believe, with all of the debate on both sides of how to raise student achievement and reform public education, about the growing acknowledgment on both sides that reform costs money, that we should at the very least take a step that locks up a portion of the budget surplus and dedicate this money to early learning, and to education as a whole, where the country gets the greatest return on investment. Almost every analysis suggests that for $1 put into education at that stage, a minimum of $6 is returned to the Federal coffers over the course of the next years in one way or another. 
   My proposal would set aside $2.2 billion this year, $30 billion over 5 years, and nearly $170 billion over 10 years for education, for early learning, for childhood interventions, which will make a difference in building the fabric of families. That will help us break the cycle of children having children out of wedlock. That will help us solve the problem of parents who do not have time to be parents and be with their children in those critical hours of the afternoon when most kids get into trouble. 
   It will literally turn around the fabric building of our own Nation and ultimately provide us with an educated workforce that has the ability to continue the extraordinary economic growth we experienced these last years, as well as, I might add, empower us to be able to guarantee that a citizenry that grows up in a world of more information has the skills and capacities to be able to manage that information and, indeed, contribute to the wise decisionmaking--the wise choosing of policies in a world that will become increasingly more virtual, more capable of making faster decisions with more information being thrown at people and people trying to discern the truth for themselves. As Thomas Jefferson and George Washington, the Founding Fathers of this country, understood, nothing is as important as that effort of guaranteeing that your citizenry is educated. 
   The funds that would be held by the education trust fund 
   could be used--and only used--to finance legislation to approve the quality of early learning through secondary education above the current inflation-adjusted baseline. Eligible uses include but would not be limited to programs and reforms authorized under the Elementary and Secondary Education Act and the Head Start Act. Trust fund expenditures would have to traverse the normal budget process. 
   If Congress were unable to agree on how to use trust fund revenue or if Congress simply doesn't commit enough resources to trigger the use of the trust fund, the trust fund assets would be carried over to the next year. The trust fund would work similar to the Social Security trust fund. On paper, those assets would carry forward to the next fiscal year. In reality, unspent funds would be used to pay down the public debt. 
   Trust fund revenue would not be available for anything other than these education specifics. Appropriators could not tap those trust fund moneys for sugar subsidies, for pet projects, or for other related purposes. Tax writers could not tap into trust fund money to pay for special interest tax breaks. But tax writers could use the trust fund money for education purposes ranging from school construction bonds to any other number of priorities on which the Congress could reach consensus. In effect, the trust fund would create a budgetary firewall protecting our national commitment to young people for early learning and education generally. 
   I have strong views about how some of that money might be best spent. But that is a debate for a different day. The question before us, as we think about the budget as a whole, particularly since it is the first budget of the new millennium, is, What is our commitment as a nation to education? Are we satisfied that one penny per dollar less than we used to commit under Ronald Reagan and less than we used to commit under Richard Nixon is currently being committed by the Federal Government for the purpose of building the future fabric of this Nation? I don't think I am alone in believing that surplus funds ought to be used to some degree in some manner for these education expenses. 
   In the State of the Union Address, the President pledged to increase our commitment to the Nation's education system by using surplus funds. In fact, his fiscal year 2001 budget requests an increase in discretionary spending for $5.7 billion for elementary and secondary education. I wholeheartedly support that critical increase. But I know and you know, Mr. President, and all of us in this Congress know that if we put together the proper structure that requires accountability that changes the relationships that currently exist in our public education system, that embrace choice, competition, accountability; that if we unleash the capacity of our school systems to be the best they can be, whether it means adopting the best of a charter school, the best of a parochial school, the best of a private school, the best of the best public schools, we have the ability in this Congress to find a way to guarantee that local communities embrace real concepts of reform. But none of those concepts can be properly implemented without some commitment of resources for communities that have no tax base and no ability to fund those systems through the property tax. 
   This is our mission, and $5 billion is not enough to fix our schools, or to guarantee a qualified teacher in every classroom, or to provide students with meaningful afterschool 
   programs. 
   I am not suggesting a Federal mandate. I am not suggesting the long arm of Washington reaching in and telling people how to do it. To the contrary. I am suggesting that we leverage the capacity of local districts to make those choices for themselves. If we don't tell them how to get there as true fiscal watchdogs looking over our taxpayers' dollars, we will look on the back end to see they did get where they said they were trying to go. If we in this body intend to make education a top priority and work for serious reform, we have to guarantee children have access to those things that will contribute to their education's success. 
   I have never been able to reconcile in the Senate how it is that we are so ready to augment the expenses for the juvenile justice system, build new prisons and house people for the rest of their life for $35,000 to $75,000 a year, but we are unwilling to invest $35,000 a year to keep them out of those prisons and to provide them with a set of other choices when it matters the most. That, it seems to me, is the obligation of this country. The American people want funding for education increases. The American people in community  after community know they can't take any more on the property tax burden. Seniors who want to live out their years in the house they paid for can't see the property tax go up. Young families with a fixed stream of income who bought into their first home can't see the property tax go up. However, we fund our education system as if we were still the agrarian society which set up the entire structure for property tax in the first place. 
   Our obligation is to find a way to release the creative energies and learning capacities of our Nation. If we were to find a bipartisan consensus and reach across the aisle to end this wasted debate about saving a few kids rather than saving all of the kids, it seems to me we would have the ability in the Congress to achieve something that would truly be a long and lasting legacy. It would be a great beginning for this millennium. 
   Education is the No. 1 issue in America. It deserves more than a penny, a dollar. That, it seems to me, is the mission we should embark on over the course of these next months. 
   I suggest the absence of a quorum.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President today I am introducing the Home Heating Readiness Act, which I offer with Senators LAUTENBERG, LIEBERMAN, and JEFFORDS. The goal of this legislation is to prevent sharp and sustained increases in the price of home heating fuel, like the kind of price spike we are experiencing right now in Massachusetts and other northeastern states. 
   Mr. President, at the end of December, the price of a gallon of home heating oil in Massachusetts average $1.78 across the state, and in some local areas consumers are complaining of prices as high as $2.00 per gallon. Only several weeks ago, when the weather was warmer, the price was far lower, about $.98, but as soon as the weather turned cold--as soon as families needed more oil to heat their homes--the price spiked. I want to be clear, on average, it appears that this winter will be warmer than most. Our problem is not the weather alone, something else in the supply chain of heating oil has failed. The Home Heating Readiness Act is an effort to learn, before it's too late, the steps we can take to correct deficiencies and prevent price spikes. 
   Already the Energy Information Administration examines the price of heating fuel each fall in a report called the Winter Fuels Outlook, and the Administration has done, overall, an excellent job of examining supply, demand and potential weather scenarios and estimating the price of heating oil and propane. This legislation would ask the Administration to go farther and examine the functional capability of the industries, to search out potential problems and help us prevent or mitigate them. It asks EIA to examine the global and regional crude oil and refined product supplies; the adequacy and utilization of refinery capability; the adequacy, utilization, and distribution of regional refined product storage capacity; weather conditions; refined product transportation system; market inefficiencies; and any other factor affecting the functional capability of the industry to provide affordable home heating oil and propane. In addition to identifying problems, EIA will make recommendations on how those problems can be corrected, and how price spikes can be avoided or at least mitigated. 
   Mr. President, with this legislation we are asking the EIA to do more and we should appropriate more funding to get the job done. For now, this legislation does not authorize a specific amount. It is my hope that the Clinton administration will work with us to determine an appropriate authorization level that we can add into this bill at an appropriate time. To help alleviate our current fuel crises the Clinton administration has released roughly $175 million to help low income families. I want to applaud that decision--those resources are urgently needed. However, I want to also point out that if we prevent these price spikes with better evaluation of the industry, we may have to spend less of those emergency funds in future winters. Finally, I want to work with Energy and Natural Resources Committee to get its input on how this proposal can be improved to meet our goals. 
   The old adage that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure certainly holds true in this case, and I hope that we act to create the Home Heating Readiness Report.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today we will vote overwhelmingly in support of a measure to dramatically reform the bankruptcy system. I join my colleagues in support of this bill, because I believe it is time we repair the bankruptcy system and I believe that this bill should progress to conference. However, the bill we support today is seriously flawed. It is my hope that some of the bill's more serious problems will be addressed in conference. 
   The Bankruptcy Reform Act fails to provide disclosures which would tell consumers how long it would take to pay off their balance at the minimum rate and what their total costs in interest and principle would be. Without this simple provision, American consumers will not receive the kind of specific information that will encourage them to pay their balance off more quickly, and avoid falling into debt in the first place. 
   I am also concerned that this bill fails to protect women and children who are entitled to child support and alimony. The bill increases the amount of debt for which debtors will remain liable through the creation of new types of nondischargeable debts to credit card companies and by permitting coercive ``reaffirmation'' agreements. With more competition for limited debtor resources, the bill fails to insure that parents and children will prevail over credit card companies and banks. 
   This bill includes an arbitrary and inflexible means test to determine which debtors must file Chapter 7 bankruptcy instead of Chapter 13. It is based on IRS standards not drafted for bankruptcy purposes that do not take into account individual family needs for expenses like transportation, food and rent. If we are going to shift individuals from Chapter 7 to Chapter 13 bankruptcies, we must ensure that we are taking into account individual needs and do not inadvertently harm those who need bankruptcy protections the most. 
   The bill also contains a number of nongermane provisions that concern me. The methamphetamine amendment increases the sentences for powder cocaine, thereby causing further overcrowding in prisons and increasing the representation of young minority males in prisons. I am also opposed to another provision that authorizes the use of public funds to pay for private school tuition for students who were injured by violent criminal offenses on public school grounds. 
   Despite its flaws, which I sincerely hope will be addressed in conference, the bill has a number of provisions I support, I take this opportunity to thank the managers of this bill, Senators GRASSLEY, TORRICELLI, and Ranking Member LEAHY for their consideration and assistance in accepting three amendments that I believe are important to fishermen in Massachusetts and small businesses across America. 
   First, I believe that the small business provisions originally in this bill establish too short a time for small businesses that must resort to bankruptcy. These provisions are counter to this country's long held policy of fostering small business creation and expansion. The amendment to the bill which was accepted will increase the time for small businesses to develop a reorganization plan to 300 days. This will allow small businesses to continue to have adequate time to develop a reorganization plan during bankruptcy proceedings. The amendment will also allow bankruptcy judges more discretion to develop an appropriate time frame for small business reorganization. 
   I thank Senator COLLINS and her staff for their fine work in developing an amendment which was accepted to make Chapter 12 of the Bankruptcy Code, which now applies to family farmers, applicable for fishermen. I was proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor of this amendment that will make bankruptcy a more effective tool to help fishermen reorganize effectively and allow them to keep fishing while they do so. 
   The final amendment which was accepted allows the expansion of the credit committee membership under Chapter 11 bankruptcies to include a small business when it is determined that the small business' claims are disproportionally large to its gross revenues. This will ensure better access to information for those small businesses not included in the committee by allowing the committee to be open for comment and subject to additional reports or disclosures. 
   It is my hope that each of these amendments will be included in the Conference Report for the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1999. I look forward to working with the Managers of the bill during Conference on these and other issues.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased that Sec. 2002 of S. 1948 directs the Federal Communications Commission to expedite its review of license applications to deliver local television signals into all local markets. it's my understanding that the FCC has had applications pending before it since January, which, if approved, would clear the way for nationwide deployment of an innovative digital terrestrial wireless system for multi-channel video programming. This new technology will benefit all Americans by providing robust competition to incumbent cable systems in Massachusetts and across the entire nation. Equally important, it will provide rural Americans with the same access to local signals as their urban and suburban counterparts. Under Sec. 2002(b)(2), the FCC shall ensure that licensees will not cause harmful interference to existing primary users of the spectrum. Moreover, the FCC, consistent with its mission to manage the spectrum in the public interest, will address, any coordination related to new users of a particular band.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, earlier this week I laid out an agenda for restoring the federal role in expanding the nation's stock of affordable housing. Today, I am making a small downpayment on that promise with the First Time Homebuyer Affordability Act. This legislation, which I am introducing with Senator BRYAN, will create new homeownership opportunities for many Americans by allowing them to borrow from their Investment Retirement Accounts (IRAs), or their parents or grandparents IRAs, on a tax free basis for a downpayment on a first home. The legislation would also allow IRA funds to be used under an equity participation agreement. In both cases, the funds would have to be repaid to the IRA. 
   We have all talked about the importance of homeownership. Indeed, homeownership makes a very significant contribution to solving many social problems we face in America. Children of homeowners are less likely to become involved in the criminal justice system; they are less likely to drop out of school, or have children out of wedlock. Homeowners vote more often and participate more in community organizations and activities. 
   Yet, the single biggest barrier to homeownership is a downpayment. This legislation will help hundreds of thousands of homeowners surmount this barrier and realize the American dream. 
   Mr. President, it is ironic that IRAs today can be invested in almost any asset, including real estate investment trusts, except one's own home. Yet, homeownership continues to be a winning investment, both for the family and the community. 
   Under current law, individuals may borrow up to $10,000 from their 401(k) retirement accounts to help buy a home without paying taxes. This legislation would put IRAs on the same footing as 401(k) plans while unlocking $2 trillion in IRA saving to help families become homeowners. It has a number of protections to ensure that the loan or investment will be repaid, with interest, or a taxes will be owed and a penalty assessed. 
   This is good legislation, which has been endorsed by the Mortgage Bankers Association, the National Association of Realtors, and the National Association of Homebuilders. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to share with all of my colleagues, particularly with the citizens of Massachusetts, the deepest sense of appreciation I have for the longest serving member of my staff, someone I have been privileged to have work with me since I entered elective office in 1982. Jeanette Boone Smith is leaving my staff after serving all of that time, since 1982, both in the Lieutenant Governor's Office of Massachusetts and in  the Senate. Throughout those years, Jeanette has symbolized the values and the priorities I have tried to represent in the Senate. I am, indeed, extraordinarily fortunate to have had her friendship and her counsel throughout my public life. 
   Jeanette embodies the fight for equality and for social justice that defines the entire second half of this century. Her life is filled with stories of personal struggle, public struggle, and of triumph, of sacrifice, and of victory. She was born in Englewood, NJ, and she remained in that State throughout young adulthood. For Jeanette, public service and political action came very early. She became president of Englewood's Fourth Ward Democratic Club, where she worked for local and national Democratic candidates. Her commitment to ensuring equality of opportunity and access to resources led her to fight tirelessly for the integration of the Englewood schools and for public housing. The success of the campaign in which she was involved opened up education and affordable housing to the whole community, and it serves as just one example of the countless times Jeanette sacrificed her time and her energy to help provide a better life to people who had traditionally been denied the full measure of the American dream. 
   Jeanette interviewed with me in January 1983 when I was putting my staff together for the Lieutenant Governor's Office. From that time on, through those early years, she served as my executive assistant, performing the endless and thankless tasks that all here understand are so vital to our ability to be able to manage our schedules and our State operations. As the years passed, she took on greater responsibilities as the director of constituent services where her warm, generous, open personality, and remarkable compassion for people in need allowed my office to advocate successfully to open and to successfully complete the work on more than 100,000 individual cases throughout Massachusetts. 
   As my colleagues well know, constituent services are critical in serving the people of our States and they are sometimes the most thankless and the most difficult tasks we confront. Jeanette assembled and managed a team that continues to help people in search of housing, education opportunities, and nutritional assistance. She has also overseen many complex housing partnerships with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and State agencies, helping to bring quality, affordable housing to thousands of people throughout the State. 
   Jeanette is leaving to enjoy more time with her husband Perry, her son Tracey, and his sons, and the South End community she loves so dearly. Within the South End, she formed the Four Corners Neighborhood Association, which led to the construction of the Langham Court Apartments. This complex is a wonderful example of Jeanette's abilities and her commitment to improving her community. It has been recognized with awards for its architecture and innovative program of mixed-income housing. She is also deeply involved in the Roxbury Presbyterian Church where she serves as an elder, a trustee, a member of the choir, and a member of the renovation committee. 
   These words today--and I know my colleagues will share this sense for any long-term staff person who departs--cannot fully recognize Jeanette's contributions to the people of Massachusetts or the full extent of my personal appreciation for her time with me. Although she departs my staff tomorrow, the principles she has represented in her work will never leave; rather, they will do as Jeanette has done, which is to serve as a moral compass pointed toward a better world where a bright future is open and available to everyone in this country. 
   I am deeply grateful for her time with me, and I extend to her and Perry my very best wishes as they begin a wonderful new chapter in their lives. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am opposed to amendment No. 2771 to S. 625, the bankruptcy bill, because it contains a provision allowing school districts to use funds from any federal education program to provide a school voucher to any student attending a Title I school that has been the victim of a violent crime on school grounds. I believe that providing vouchers to students to attend private or parochial schools is a wrong-headed policy notion that would do nothing to improve the education system that 90% American  children depend upon. Further, the HATCH amendment attempts to relieve only those students against whom a violent crime has been committed, but does nothing to improve school safety for students remaining in the public schools. 
   Federal funding must be focused on improving educational excellence in our nation's public schools. Money provided by the federal government to state and local education agencies is critical to increasing student achievement and improving teacher quality. A disservice to the public school system is done with this money is directed to private or parochial schools. School reform should not translate into an abandonment of our nation's public schools. 
   I agree with Mr. HATCH in that there is a crisis of violence and disruption undermining too many classrooms. Last year 6,000 children were expelled from public schools and there were 4,000 cases of rape or sexual battery reported. Parents, students, and educators know that serious school reform will only succeed in a safe and orderly learning environment. But Mr. President, my solution for stemming the tide of violence differs radically from that of Mr. HATCH. Instead of abandoning the public schools, the legislation that Mr. SMITH of Oregon and I introduced would establish a competitive grant program for school districts to create ``Second Chance Schools.'' In order to receive the funds, school districts would need to have in place district-wide discipline codes which use clear language with specific examples of behaviors that will result in disciplinary action and have every student and parent sign the code. Additionally, schools could use the funds to promote effective classroom management; provide training for school staff and administrators in enforcement of the code; implement programs to modify student behavior including hiring school counselors; and establish high quality alternative placements for chronically disruptive and violent students that include a continuum of alternatives from meeting with behavior management specialists, to short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to off-campus alternatives. Schools could implement a range of interventions including short-term in-school crisis centers, medium duration in-school suspension rooms, and off-campus alternatives. Mr. President, I advocate a solution to the problem of violence in our schools that would help troubled students and ensure those students do not act out again, in their schools, in their homes, or in their communities. 
   Mr. President, I also oppose this amendment because it would require local school officials to determine whether a student has committed a drug felony on school property. Administrators and educators in this country's public schools are not trained or well-suited to perform the job of law enforcement officers. Their job is to establish policies regulating drugs, alcohol, and tobacco on school grounds, but the business of suspected drug felonies should clearly be handled by law enforcement officers.

   Mr. KERRY. I understand from some of the publicity around a similar suit filed by the New York Attorney General that some of the modifications being made to power plants were significant. For example, one company allegedly replaced a reheater header and outlet, a pulverized coal conduit system, the economizer, and casing insulation. While it is impossible to judge any of these types of modifications without additional information, it certainly seems like utilities created a loophole in the law to essentially rebuild the system without considering it as a major modification. Would a legislative rider on this issue essentially pre-judge the court's findings as to whether the modifications undertaken at the plant are indeed ``major''?

   Mr. KERRY. I understand that some suggest that it would be impossible to achieve new pollution standards because of technological limitations. I would like to address that point. States in Northeast have already taken steps to reduce pollution to comply with Clean Air Act requirements, including instituting major controls on these older power plants ed plants. Northeast Utilities has spent $40 million in the last 8 years to reduce fossil plant emissions. In a July 31, 1998 letter to Administrator Browner, Northeast Utilities wrote that ``in our experience the Merrimack Station selective catalytic reduction technology is effective in removing NOX, can be installed fairly quickly, and the installation has minimal impact on the availability of the generating unit.'' Other companies, including Pacific Gas & Electric and Southern Company have made similar  investments at plants in Massachusetts. While these are only a few examples, the experience of these companies is echoed by others. Real world experience bears out the fact that solutions are available and are cost effective. It is also interesting to note that the Tennessee Valley Authority, which is the subject of the enforcement action, recently announced plans to implement state of the art ozone controls. The solutions are out there, and as utilities in New England have demonstrated, when there is a will there is a way. 
   I would like to address what is, in my opinion, the fundamental problem with this rider. These power companies and our Department of Justice have a legal dispute, and that dispute should be settled through the legal process. I understand that some of the defendant companies, and some in the Senate, may feel that the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Justice are being overzealous in pursuing this enforcement action or that there are politics at play here. I respectfully and strongly disagree, and I urge my colleagues to disregard such rhetoric. It has been estimated that as many as 1,000 people each year die in Massachusetts from air pollution from power plants, automobiles and other sources. And, in particular, emissions from coal-fired plants, the dirtiest of which are outside my state, cause high levels of ozone, which increases the incidence of respiratory disease and premature aging of the lungs. Acid deposition from sulfur can severely degrade lakes and forests. Mercury, which is highly poisonous, accumulates in fish locally. In other words, there is a very real cost to this pollution. Indeed, for some, the price they pay is their very health and well being. I can accept that some of my colleagues may feel that the Department of Justice or the Environmental Protection Agency is pursuing a flawed legal argument, but I cannot accept that the people who are alleging harm, who are paying the price for this pollution, should be denied their day in court. The Department of Justice should not serve at the pleasure of Congress and defendants with the power influence Congress, it should serve the law and the people. I yield to my colleague Senator LIEBERMAN.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senator LAUTENBERG for developing this important piece of legislation that recognizes the importance of rail in our overall transportation system as we approach the 21st Century. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the High Speed Rail Investment Act, which will provide Amtrak with much needed resources to pay for high speed rail corridors across the country. This legislation is crucial for the country, and for my home state of Massachusetts, and I am hopeful we can move it quickly through Congress. 
   This bill will give Amtrak the authority to sell $10 billion in bonds over the next ten years to finance high speed rail. Instead of interest payments, the federal government would provide tax credits to bondholders. Amtrak would repay the principle on the bonds after 10 years, however, the payments would come primarily from required state matching funds. I know many states will gladly participate in this matching program, as their governors and state legislatures are eager to promote high speed rail. Amtrak would be authorized to invest this money solely for upgrading existing lines to high speed rail, constructing new high speed rail lines, purchasing high speed rail equipment, eliminating or improving grade crossings, and for capital upgrades to existing high speed rail corridors. 
   Let there be no mistake, this country needs to develop a comprehensive national transportation policy for the 21st Century. So far, Congress has failed to address this vital issue. What we have is an ad hoc, disjointed policy that focuses on roads and air to the detriment of rail. We need to look at all of these modes of transportation to alleviate congestion and delays on the ground and in the sky and to move people across this country efficiently. Failing to do this will hamper economic growth and harm the environment. 
   Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in Europe and Japan, and also in the Northeast corridor here in the U.S., passenger rail is severely underfunded. We need to include rail into the transportation mix. We need more transportation choices and this bill helps to provide them. 
   In the Northeast corridor, Amtrak is well on its way to implementing high speed rail service. The high speed Acela service should start running from in January. This will be extremely helpful in my home state of Massachusetts, where airport and highway congestion often reach frustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, the fewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways. 
   But new service in the Northeast corridor is only the beginning. We need to establish rail as a primary mode of transportation along with air and highways. This bill well help us achieve that goal across the country and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of such an important piece of legislation.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to co-sponsor a bill introduced by Mr. BREAUX, that is called the Atlantic Highly Migratory Species Act of 1999. 
   This legislation closes large areas to longline gear, including the important spawning areas where juvenile bycatch of swordfish and other billfish species are the highest. This legislation will also provide a fair and equitable program for longline vessel owners who are adversely impacted by the fishing prohibition. Funding of the permit buyback program would come through a partnership of the recreational and commercial fishing industries and federal funds. Lastly, this legislation directs the National Marine Fisheries Service to conduct a comprehensive research program in cooperation with the U.S. longline fleet to identify and test a variety of longline gear configurations to determine which are the most effective at reducing billfish bycatch in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico. 
   We are introducing this legislation at an important time. It will serve as an example to show the international community at next week's negotiations in Brazil, at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT), that the U.S. embraces use of time-area closures to help swordfish recover. 
   I believe that this legislation will serve as one prong, of a two-prong U.S. strategy in international negotiations on swordfish quotas that ensures the total mortality of swordfish, including discards, is limited to levels that will allow the stock to recover in 10 years. 
   I look forward to working with Mr. BREAUX and other cosponsors of the bill to ensure that this legislation is both consistent with the principles of the Magnuson-Stevens Act and part of an effective national plan to ensure recovery of the North Atlantic swordfish stock within 10 years.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, since 1938 we have had a minimum standard we accept as the lowest possible wage in our society. Today we are engaged in debate about the need to raise that standard. The modest proposal before us seeks to raise the minimum wage by $1.00 over the next two years. Even then--even if we succeed in doing what is so obvious, so reasonable, and so fair--Mr. President the real value of the lowest acceptable wage will only reach what it was in 1982, over 17 years ago. We're not really talking about an increase here, we're talking about trying to keep pace, about making work pay, about restoring minimum wage workers to the purchasing power they had nearly two decades ago. 
   Mr. President, opponents of a minimum-wage increase argue that it increases unemployment rates for entry-level workers, thereby hurting the very  people it is meant to help. But this is not a radical proposal--as some Republicans claim--that will cause a dramatic spike in the unemployment rates and cripple small business. Numerous empirical studies, Mr. President, have found that recent hikes in the minimum wage have had little or no effect on job levels. A 1999 Levy Institute survey of small businesses revealed that more than three-quarters of the firms surveyed said their employment practices would not be affected by an increase in the minimum wage to $6.00. A September New York Times editorial reported that ``..... a modest hike is not likely to cause higher unemployment, even among low-skilled workers. Indeed, jobless rates fell after the 90-cent minimum-wage hike of 1996-7.'' 
   We have not in the past nor are we now advancing a radical proposal that will reverberate dangerously throughout our economy. We are merely considering a moderate increase in our Nation's wage floor, one that will bring us just back to where we were nearly 18 years ago. 
   And while the increase is a modest one, it is crucial to today's working families. A $1.00 increase in the minimum wage will affect 11.4 million workers. Full-time workers will make an additional $2,000 each year. Many minimum wage jobs do not provide pensions or health care. An additional $2,000 each year might mean the difference between being sick and getting treatment, the difference between a sickly child and a thriving one. An additional $2,000 each year might mean the difference between being hungry and being fed. 
   Currently, a full-time minimum wage worker earns $10,712 per year--an income well below the poverty line for a family of three or four. Increasing the minimum wage will bring workers wages up to $12,800 per year, an income still below the poverty line for a family of three. So while we refer to the minimum wage as the lowest wage acceptable in our society, we must acknowledge that even after we pass this modest increase, a full-time minimum wage worker cannot safely raise a family on his/her earnings. 
   Right now we are facing the greatest wage inequality since the Great Depression. Income inequality between the Nation's top earners and those at the bottom has been widening since the early 1970s. The strong economy and these generally prosperous times cause us to overlook the struggles faced by hard-working families. The growing wage gap between the rich and poor threatens our social fabric and the stability of our Nation. It is our job in the Congress to ensure that stability is maintained--that hard-working individuals are paid a fair wage--that working families can afford the basic necessities of life--that we are the kind of country that values work--and which values the contributions of each working American. It is time we meet that responsibility.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, seven months ago I introduced the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999, a bill to help our Women's Business Centers weather the increasingly harsh climate of fundraising. These centers play an important role in our economy and in promoting economic independence for women. They help women take an honest look at their strengths and interests to find out whether they should strike out on their own. They teach women how to turn their talents into a business. And they train women in the fundamentals of starting and running a successful business. The centers are located in rural, urban and suburban areas, and direct much of their training and counseling assistance toward socially and economically disadvantaged women. 
   Through the Women's Business Centers Program, business development resources and assistance available to women have steadily improved. The program opened its first 12 centers in 1989. Ten years later, women receive assistance at 81 centers in 47 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. In addition to increasing self-sufficiency among women, Women's Business Centers strengthen women's business ownership overall and encourage local job creation. Over the past decade, the number of women-owned businesses operating in this country has grown by 103 percent to an estimated 9.1 million firms, generating $3.6 trillion in sales annually, while employing more than 27.5 million workers. In 1998, women-owned businesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million small businesses in the United States. 
   In spite of the important contributions the Women's Business Centers make to the national economy, we are in danger of losing many effective centers if we don't change the funding structure before their five-year funding runs out. Currently, the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers program provides five-year grants of up to $150,000, matched by non-Federal dollars, to private-sector organizations so that they can establish business-training centers for women. From Senate and House hearings at the beginning of the year, we know that without the Federal matching grant, most centers cannot afford to continue providing the same quality of services or to keep their doors open. That money is their bread and butter, as well as indispensable for leveraging fundraising dollars. I believe the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 is a fair way to let WBCs recompete for the base funding. 
   The Women's Business Centers Act creates a four-year pilot that allows graduating and graduated centers to recompete for five-year matching grants of up to $125,000. It requires the SBA to do site visits as part of the final selection process so that we can  better judge which centers merit a sustainability grant after five years in the program. It includes a provision from Senator BOND to increase management oversight and review of Centers to better evaluate the viability of centers and improve SBA's management of the program. And it incrementally raises over four years the annual authorization levels from $12 million in fiscal year 2000 to $14.5 million in fiscal year 2003. The increased authorization levels ensure that there are adequate monies to fund 45 existing centers, an average of eight recompeting centers annually, and an average of 10 new centers per year. 
   The Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999 has tremendous support. It is also the product of old-fashioned cooperation between Democrats and Republicans, and the House and Senate. I want to thank not only the 30 Senators--20 Democrats and 10 Republicans--who are cosponsors of this bill, but also the staff members on the House Small Business Committee who work for Chairman TALENT, Ranking Member NYDIA VEL&#193;ZQUEZ, and Congresswoman KELLY. 
   For the record, I would like to recognize the 30 cosponsors of my bill--BOND, HARKIN, BINGAMAN, DOMENICI, LEVIN, ENZI, KENNEDY, ABRAHAM, SARBANES, AKAKA, EDWARDS, FEINSTEIN, LANDRIEU, BOXER, CLELAND, KOHL, WELLSTONE, BURNS, LEAHY, SNOWE, HUTCHISON, DURBIN, SANTORUM, MURRAY, MIKULSKI, INOUYE, JEFFORDS, LIEBERMAN, BENNETT and ROBB. 
   Mr. President, I know how important this bill is to members on both sides of the aisle. I thank my colleagues for their support.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I express my genuine appreciation to all the members of the Senate Banking Committee for their hard work, commitment and dedication to resolving the tough and contentious issues surrounding the conference report that we are considering today. It is no exaggeration to suggest that this conference report represents more than 15 years of hard work and perseverance in tackling one of the most important issues in the new economy. 
   I support the conference report. However, I do so with some reservations about the way the final product was developed and because it does not include a number of important consumer protection provisions. For example, the legislation will pre-empt important state legislation prohibiting certain predatory lending practices that result in poor, vulnerable, elderly homeowners being bilked out of thousands of dollars or, in some cases, losing their homes.  
   However, I believe enactment of financial modernization is a critical first step toward breaking down barriers to allow financial services companies to provide better services at lower costs to consumers and to help insure American dominance of global finance in the 21st Century. 
   As we all know, breaking down the walls that separate commercial banking from the insurance and securities industries is of enormous importance to the future of the financial services industry, which has undergone an immense transformation in recent years. Dramatic changes in technology along with historic mergers, consolidations, and acquisitions have reordered the structure of the financial services industry and made the statutory distinctions that have existed in the law until today less and less relevant in the real world. 
   As a result of these changes, large corporations have begun bypassing traditional financial institutions and accessing capital markets directly. Many large corporations now meet their funding needs by issuing commercial paper, rather than by borrowing from banks. Banks and thrifts are also experiencing increased competition from non-banking institutions that offer a range of financial products and services. During this time, commercial banks have been unable to provide consumers with a number of important financial products and services. 
   The conference report that the Senate is considering today repeals the Glass-Steagall Act, which has separated banks from securities firms since the 1930s. It also repeals a similar provision that has separated banking and insurance. It will permit the creation of new financial holding companies that could offer banking, insurance, securities and other financial products. 
   I am very pleased that the Treasury Secretary Summers and Federal Reserve Bank Chairman Alan Greenspan have come to an agreement on the operating subsidiary issue that was included in the conference report. Banks will now be able to choose the corporate structure under which to conduct new non-banking activities--either through an operating subsidiary or through an affiliate. The bill would allow operating subsidiaries to engage in merchant banking activities, but only if the Federal Reserve and the Treasury jointly agree that the activity is permissible. A bank would have to be well capitalized and well managed after deducting its equity investment in an operating subsidiary from its capital in order to take advantage of these new activities. I believe that this compromise will let banks choose their own operating structure and will help maintain safety and soundness in our financial system. 
   The operating subsidiary provisions also include language that would retain state authority over state chartered bank subsidiaries. Section 121(d)(1) of the final bill provides that nothing in Section 46(d) supersedes the current authority of the FDIC over bank subsidiary activities under Section 24 of the Act. The provision recognizes that, consistent with current and proposed rules of the FDIC, investment authorities of state-chartered bank subsidiaries are not to be restricted to any greater extent that those authorized for a state bank itself. More particularly, in several states, including Massachusetts, state banks have a long history of exercising limited authority to invest in common stocks either directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries. The FDIC has acknowledged and approved such investment authority through so-called investment subsidiaries. It is my understanding that the newly added Section 46(d) acknowledges and preserves that authority and does not contemplate imposition of additional regulatory requirements or impediments. 
   I am also glad that the conference report will permit financial institutions to engage in merchant banking activities. This will allow banks to invest in small companies for the purpose of appreciating and ultimately reselling the investment. The merchant banking provisions limit the day-to-day management of companies by financial institutions and the duration of the investment. I am hopeful that these new powers will allow banks to provide more capital for small businesses, which have been leading contributors to the economic growth of our country. 
   The conference report includes an important limitation on banking and commerce which eliminates the ability of commercial firms to form new unitary thrifts unless they had owned or had applied to own a unitary thrift by May 4, 1999. Under the conference report, current unitary thrift holding companies and their savings association subsidiaries would be able to continue their normal activities. However, future sales of unitary thrift holding companies would not be allowed to commercial firms. Sales would be limited only to financial holding companies. 
   Building this fence around financial firms to keep them largely isolated from joint ownership with commerce and industry is an extremely important safeguard in this legislation. My first priority as member of the Senate Banking Committee is to maintain the safety and soundness of our financial system to insure that American taxpayer funds are not necessary to bail out our financial institutions. However, we are now in an era in which banks and other firms are becoming ``too big to fail'' where the government will intervene if its collapse would cause a major harm to the economy. With the enactment of this legislation, banks, insurance and securities conglomerates will grow even larger and more intertwined. The failure of any one of these new conglomerates could disrupt our financial system and risk a taxpayer-funded bailout that would dwarf the savings and loan payout. For example, recently the Federal Reserve Bank felt compelled to rescue the Long Term Capital, a hedge fund, even though it was not a federally insured bank. 
   That is why I strongly supported including a provision that would have required large banks to back some portion of their assets with subordinated debt. Holders of this type of debt would have a strong incentive to monitor each financial institution's level of risk to protect their investment. This approach could also serve as an early warning signal for regulators of banks that are engaged in risky activities. Unfortunately, this requirement was reduced to only a study. I will be working with my colleagues and with federal regulators to address this problem in the future. 
   I am also very disappointed that the conference report does not include acceptable language regarding mutual insurance companies. Many States currently have laws that restrict the hostile take over of a mutual insurance company that has recently converted to a stock insurer. However, the conference report allows these state laws to be preempted ``so long as such restriction does not have the effect of discriminating, intentionally or unintentionally, against an insured depository institution or an affiliate thereof *.*.*.'' I believe that this language, as currently written, would allow only banks whose takeover attempts were denied by a state 
   insurance commissioner to litigate. The ability to litigate would not be extended to any other potential acquisitor. 
   This law means that any state restriction of a banking organization's attempts to takeover a demutualizing insurance company could be construed by a court as discrimination against the bank. I believe that this could lead to costly and time consuming litigation for every insurance company that attempts demutualization. Further, if a court were to fail to interpret the word ``discrimination'' narrowly, this new language could essentially end the important state preemption provision only in cases where a bank is the proposed acquisitor. It would not allow other potential acquisitors to litigate. 
   I am also very concerned about the provision included in the conference report that will allow mutual insurance companies to redomesticate to another state and reorganize into a mutual holding companies or stock companies. I believe that this provision will allow some mutual insurance companies to move to states without adequate consumer protections and could endanger policyholders during a conversion from mutual to stock form. 
   I am pleased, however, that the conference report includes the PRIME Act, which will provide an opportunity to lend a helping hand to those in need of financial aid and technical assistance so that they can fulfill their personal, family, and community responsibilities. Microenterprise development has  given many a chance to break the cycle of poverty and welfare and move toward individual responsibility and financial independence. 
   Specifically, the PRIME Act authorizes funding for technical assistance to give microentrepreneurs access to information on developing a business plan, record-keeping, planning, financing and marketing, which are crucial to small business development. 
   For example, PRIME would augment funds for valuable programs run by Working Capital, located in Massachusetts and a recipient of a Presidential Award for Excellence in Microenterprise Development in 1997. Working Capital currently offers a number of valuable programs to its microenterprise customers which could be augmented by additional funding under PRIME such as providing business credit to microentrepreneurs and providing business education and training on how to draw up business plans and prepare financial projections. These programs instruct microentrepreneurs on how to use these tools in managing their businesses. This type of assistance is crucial to the development of our low-income communities and throughout the United States. 
   I very much appreciate that the conference report includes a provision to repeal the Savings Bank Provisions in the Bank Holding Company Act. Section 3(f) was added to the Bank Holding Company Act in 1987 to provide a special grant of authority to savings banks, but court decisions and Federal Reserve Board interpretations now make it restrictive for many Massachusetts banks. Repeal of this provision will bring the treatment of Massachusetts savings banks in line with that of other financial institutions. 
   Mr. President, I also want to emphasize that although I strongly believe that we have to take this first step to toward modernizing our banking industry and although I will support this conference report, I remain committed to strengthening and improving consumer privacy protections and to encouraging greater community investment by financial institutions. 
   I believe that we can and must do more to safeguard the financial privacy of every American. Every American deserves to control his or her personal financial information. I am concerned that the changes in technology and in the marketplace have diminished every American's ability to safeguard his or her personal financial privacy. The conference report gives customers of financial services companies only limited control over their personal financial information. Customers will now have the right to object to their institutions' sharing their financial data with third parties and will require these institutions to provide notice to customers when they disclose financial information within an affiliate. Fortunately, the conference report does not preempt stronger state privacy laws. 
   I want to note for the RECORD that I supported stronger privacy protections that would have given every customer the right to see what financial information would be shared with affiliates or third parties. I also supported an opt-in standard for consumers whose financial institution provides their personal financial information to unaffiliated third parties. This provision was supported by 26 state Attorneys General and many others. I will be working with my distinguished colleagues including the Senator from Maryland Mr. SARBANES, as well as Senators BRYAN, SHELBY and others to work on strengthening safeguards to protect the privacy of every American. 
   All throughout the consideration of this legislation, from the very first meetings of the Banking Committee, through floor consideration and the conference negotiations, Congressional Democrats and the Administration have insisted that the Community Reinvestment Act must be allowed to grow and adapt to the new circumstances being created for the financial industry. Despite the most aggressive, uninformed, and sustained attack on that important law I have ever witnessed, I am happy to say that the new law will reflect this important goal. 
   The new law established that, as a precondition for any bank to exercise any of the new powers authorized by this legislation, either de novo or through a merger or acquisition, a bank must have a satisfactory CRA rating. This test will be applied each time a bank seeks to take engage in a new activity, so that a bank will have to, as a practical matter, both have and maintain a satisfactory CRA rating to take advantage of the new law. Prior to this agreement, a bank could start up a securities affiliate without any regard to its CRA rating, so this new law is clearly a step forward. That is why Reverend Jesse Jackson and the Local Initiatives Support Corporation (LISC) support the CRA provisions in the bill. 
   I understand and share the concerns of some of my colleagues who believe that the conference report does not go far enough. Certainly, the alternative that and my fellow Democrats supported would have been more acceptable. However, I believe that this legislation clearly meets the objective of ensuring that CRA remains a central part of every financial institution's operations into the next century. 
   The conference report would also require certain agreements between a bank and community groups made in connection with CRA to be fully disclosed and would reduce the frequency of CRA compliance exams for certain banks with less than $250 million in assets. 
   I am concerned that further attempts to weaken the Community Reinvestment Act will occur during the 106th Congress. Let me be absolutely clear: I will strongly oppose any attempts to weaken CRA in any manner whatsoever. CRA is a fundamental tool to insure that all creditworthy Americans, regardless of the neighborhood they live in, regardless of their race or circumstances, have access to the bank loans that are needed to buy a home or start a business. It is a law that breathes life into the rhetoric we all use extolling the virtues of equal opportunity. We cannot and must not return to the days of poverty and desperation borne of bank redlining in too many communities across the nation. 
   This conference report is far from perfect, but few compromises ever are. A product that represents more than 15 years of hard work and the debates of literally hundreds of individuals and disparate constituencies could hardly represent a perfect product to every side. This report is no different. But I will tell you, and I think almost all of us would agree that in the American system of free enterprise the interests of consumers and industry are best served if we permit competition as long as that competition is fair and does not give any industry or player an advantage over another. I believe that this legislation is an important step in facilitating that competition and it meets that test by allowing every American access to a broader group of financial services at a lower cost. We have a historic chance to provide meaningful financial services reform. I will support the conference report and I urge my colleagues to support it as well. And, remembering as I think we all should, that this legislation represents not an endpoint but a starting point, I would respectfully suggest that we all focus in the months and years ahead on the potential role this Senate can play in helping to create the environment in which financial services work to the best advantage of every American. Our goal should be nothing less.

   Mr. KERRY. Today we must vote on a package of bills that are intended to promote trade and thereby lift-up the economies of sub-Saharan African and Carribean Basin nations. I believe strongly in that premise. I believe that  free and fair trade can improve the lives of workers in developing nations and is vital to improve our economy at home. On balance, this achieves those goals, and I therefore support it. 
   Much of the debate surrounding this package of trade bills has centered on the provisions dealing with Africa. This is proper, as it is the AGOA portion of the bill that I am most concerned about. Many argue that AGOA is the last chance for Africa to develop a textile industry. In 2005, current quotas on textiles from Asia and other parts of the world will be lifted. If we lift those quotas on sub-Saharan African countries now, those countries may have some chance to develop their textile industry in the next five years, before Asia--especially China--has a chance to dominate textile manufacturing. If Africa does not develop its textile industry now, there is no way it will be able to compete with China in 2005. This would not only hurt African nations, who will be without a textile industry, but it will hurt US apparel manufacturers, who will have one less resource to produce their products and will be forced to send more of their work to China. 
   That said, this bill fails to address many of the crucial problems facing Africa, and it would be tragic if this were the final word on Africa. First, this bill fails to address the perhaps the single greatest barrier to economic growth and development in Africa: the spread of AIDS. Unless our efforts to combat this epidemic are bolstered immediately, this public health disaster will result in severe economic distress for African countries. The effect of this disease, which strikes people in their most economically productive years, cannot be ignored if we expect these countries to be effective trading partners. It is imperative and entirely appropriate to include AIDS relief in this legislation. A recent study in Namibia estimated that AIDS cost the country almost 8 percent of its GNP in 1996. Another analysis predicts that Kenya's GDP will be 14.5 percent smaller in 2005 than it would have been without AIDS, and that income per person will be 10 percent lower. 
   The microeconomic outlook is not much better. Businesses across sub-Saharan Africa are already suffering at the hands of HIV. In Zimbabwe, for instance, life insurance premiums grew four-fold in just two years because of AIDS deaths. Some companies there have reported a doubling of their health bills. In Botswana, companies estimate that AIDS-related costs will soar from under one percent of wages in 1999 to five percent by 2005. In Zambia and Tanzania, some companies have already reported that costs resulting from AIDS-related health costs and lower productivity have exceeded total profits. Without addressing a health crisis of this enormity, we are ignoring one of the most important impediments to development of the African continent. 
   The second concern I have with the AGOA bill is that it ignores the great albatross of debt that hangs around the neck of the African people and is a tremendous impediment to their economic growth and development. AGOA provides no debt relief to Africa, despite the fact that Africa's crushing $230 billion debt burden is a massive obstacle to economic and social 
   progress. By ending the vicious circle of debt and debt servicing, debt relief for Africa would open the way for private investment in African enterprises, investment that is critical to the long-term development and growth of every economy. 
   I believe that the United States should play a prominent role in reducing the debt burden of nations that are unable to achieve sustainable economic growth and development under the constraint of servicing their national debts. Our economic relationship with Africa must take the long view and advance policies that will build a solid basis for continued growth, rather than simply extending the short-sighted, debt-centered policies of decades past. 
   Unfortunately, many amendments that would have begun to address the weaknesses of the AGOA bill failed on the Senate floor. I supported amendments that would have improved labor and environmental standards and that would have better addressed transhipment concerns. Although those amendments failed, I will, nevertheless, support this package, not because I am fully satisfied with its treatment of Africa, but because as a whole, the package includes other important trade measures that will not only bolster the economies of developing nations, but will have a positive economic impact here at home. I have long been a proponent of Trade Adjustment Assistance as a way to help U.S. workers and industries that have been harmed by trade. The Generalized System of Preferences is also a crucial to developing countries by stimulating their exports. I am pleased that this package includes these very important programs. 
   Finally, the CBI portion of the package will put our neighbors in the Caribbean on more equal footing with Mexico. By providing duty free treatment to apparel assembled in the Caribbean basin only if US fabrics are used, this bill will strengthen the economy and long term stability of Caribbean Basin countries. This will go a long way to help them to recover from the extensive damage they suffered during Hurricanes Mitch and Georges. The U.S. has a trade surplus with Caribbean Basin which has led to more and better jobs in my home state of Massachusetts and throughout the country. 
   Because the balance of the package of trade bills before us today is favorable, I support the bill with the sincere hope that we revisit the issues of concern to sub-Saharan Africa soon.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating Senator LAUTENBERG for developing this important piece of legislation that recognizes the importance of rail in our overall transportation system as we approach the 21st century. 
   I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the High Speed Rail Investment Act, which will provide Amtrak with  much needed resources to pay for high speed rail corridors across the country. This legislation is crucial for the country, and for my home State of Massachusetts, and I am hopeful we can move it quickly through Congress. 
   This bill will give Amtrak the authority to sell $10 billion in bonds over the next 10 years to finance high speed rail. Instead of interest payments, the Federal Government would provide tax credits to bondholders. Amtrak would repay the principal on the bonds after 10 years, however, the payments would come primarily from required state matching funds. I know many states will gladly participate in this matching program, as their Governors and State legislatures are eager to promote high speed rail. Amtrak would be authorized to invest this money solely for upgrading existing lines to high speed rail, constructing new high speed rail lines, purchasing high speed rail equipment, eliminating or improving grade crossings, and for capital upgrades to existing high speed rail corridors. 
   Let there be no mistake, this country needs to develop a comprehensive national transportation policy for the 21st century. So far, Congress has failed to address this vital issue. What we have is an ad hoc, disjointed policy that focuses on roads and air to the detriment of rail. We need to look at all of these modes of transportation to alleviate congestion and delays on the ground and in the sky and to move people across this country efficiently. Failing to do this will hamper economic growth and harm the environment. 
   Despite rail's proven safety, efficiency and reliability in Europe and Japan, and also in the Northeast corridor here in the United States, passenger rail is severely underfunded. We need to include rail into the transportation mix. We need more transportation choices and this bill helps to provide them. 
   In the Northeast corridor, Amtrak is well on its way to implementing high speed rail service. The high speed Acela service should start running in January. This will be extremely helpful in my home State of Massachusetts, where airport and highway congestion often reach frustrating levels. The more miles that are traveled on Amtrak, the fewer trips taken on crowded highways and skyways. 
   But new service in the Northeast corridor is only the beginning. We need to establish rail as a primary mode of transportation along with air and highways. This bill will help us achieve that goal across the country and I am proud to be an original cosponsor of such an important piece of legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. 
   Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation on behalf of thousands dedicated volunteers around the country. The legislation I am offering addresses an inequity in the tax code that adversely affects AmeriCorps volunteers. I urge my colleagues to pass it immediately. 
   Since 1994, in 4,000 communities across the country, AmeriCorps participants have tutored and mentored more than 4 million children, developed after-school programs for over one million young people, and helped build more than 11,000 homes. Their dedication and commitment are a tribute to the American tradition of public service. Currently, at the conclusion of 1,700 hours of service, AmeriCorps members receive an education award of $4,725. The award may be used by former volunteers to pay for tuition expenses or the repayment of student loans. 
   Under long-established tax law, scholarships and grants are excludable from income. However, because the AmeriCorps awards are considered to represent payment for services rendered, they must be included in taxable income at the end of the year. This tax treatment creates a significant hardship for former volunteers. Because AmeriCorps education awards are sent directly to the loan agency or educational institution, they do not represent income from which a portion may be reserved by the beneficiary for the payment of tax. After serving in AmeriCorps, many former volunteers work part-time to pay for college, and the education award pushes their income above the standard income tax deduction, creating tax liability for an individual with little means to pay for it. 
   Mr. President, allow me to illustrate. Maleah Thorpe of Sunderland, Massachusetts, is a two-year AmeriCorps participant. Most recently, Maleah served as a volunteer with Massachusetts Campus Compact. The Massachusetts Campus Compact coordinates formal and informal assistance for students, staff, and faculty in the areas of: America Reads and early childhood literacy initiatives, America Counts and math education initiatives, and other Campus and community partnerships. Maleah's service has benefited our community and our country, while at the same time, has provided a rewarding personal experience. 
   Listen to what Maleah has to say about AmeriCorps:  
   My experiences with AmeriCorps have been life-changing, introducing me to so many opportunities and a new appreciation of both the diversity and strength of people in our nation. I consider myself fortunate and am thankful that I will have not one, but two educational awards should I need to use them. However, I am at the same time dreading the out-of-pocket expense that will accompany their use *.*.*. Although I was anxious to use the educational award earned during my first year of service to reduce my undergraduate loan debt, the cost of paying taxes on the amount has prohibited me from doing so. 
   When I entered AmeriCorps two years ago, I did so for the service. I also anticipated that approximately 75 percent of my undergraduate loan debt would be paid within three years of graduation, something that helped justify the financial cost of living on only the minimal stipend. Instead, I will enter graduate school in the fall, my undergraduate loans will continue to accrue interest and I will likely acquire additional loans to cover some expenses because I can simply not afford to use and pay taxes on my educational awards while I am a student. 
   I know that I am not alone in this predicament. Many alumni with whom I served are either students or completing additional years of service, solely responsible for educational and living expenses. Many of us do not have additional income to pay taxes on the educational awards nor the ability to ask friends or relatives to assist us. 
   I have given two years to serve my fellow citizens of the nation and the Commonwealth and would never give up those experiences. However, I should not now be punished for this choice by the burden of additional taxes.  
   Similar situations arise with other programs. Congress has recognized these inequities and acted to address them. For example, this summer's Taxpayer Refund and Relief Act would have specifically provided that scholarships received through the National Health Service Corps, the Armed Forces Health Professions program, and the National Institutes of Health Undergraduate program are tax exempt. Let's do the same for the thousands of volunteers who, through the AmeriCorps program, give up two years of their lives to make a difference in communities across our nation. 
   The AmeriCorps Scholarship Fairness Act clarifies that AmeriCorps education awards should receive the same tax treatment as a traditional college scholarship. Under the proposal, amounts received by an individual as part of a national service education award would be eligible for tax-free treatment as a qualified scholarship  under section 117 of the tax code, without regard to the fact that the recipient of the scholarship has provided services as a condition for receiving the scholarship. The Joint Tax Committee estimates the cost in lost revenue would be $2 million the first year, $15 million over five years, and $32 million over ten years. 
   The government should cherish, not punish, volunteerism and public service. I hope my colleagues will join me in enacting this simple but meaningful legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing our great sorrow for the loss of JOHN CHAFEE. He was a really remarkable, special soul, a very gentle person, who nevertheless had a will of steel. He was, in many ways, sort of an archetypal New Englander, for those of us who come from that part of the country. There was a great quality of independence, a great ability to march to the beat of his own drummer. He did that. I think that in very special ways he was one of the bridges in the U.S. Senate. 
   I first crossed paths with JOHN CHAFEE back during the Vietnam war. I am proud that his signature is on my medals. We talked a lot about that after I came back. He had the great capacity to reach out across the aisle. I recall this summer, as a matter of fact, how he came up to me one evening and said, ``I am a bachelor; Virginia is not here.'' My wife, Teresa, wasn't here at the time. He said, ``Let's go to dinner.'' So we went down to the Metropolitan Club, where I heard some other colleagues say he often went to dinner. We just sat and talked a lot about life,  about war, about his experiences; and all the divisions of the Senate sort of melted away because of his gesture. But it was not strange for JOHN to do that. Those of us who worked with him over the years here know that he was always reaching across the aisle trying to build a bridge, trying to pull people together. 
   I remember when we were in the throes of a fight over the clean air amendment in 1990. There were great meetings in the room back here with George Mitchell. JOHN CHAFEE, Senator Mitchell, and a few others with great calming voices, were reaching out trying to pull people together and find a path of common sense. That is really one of the great legacies, the commitment that produced that amendment and also produced a whole host of advances with respect to the environment. 
   I traveled with JOHN to Rio. We were part of the delegation for the Rio conference when we had that huge summit. 
   I traveled with him again to Kyoto. I remember one very peaceful moment when we snuck away to a beautiful Japanese garden. He was busy looking at the architecture, experiencing the remarkable peace of that place, and laughing at the fact that he had stolen away from a conference for a few moments to do so. 
   JOHN was one of the great calming influences in this body, a man of extraordinary common sense, a person who always tried to stand for principle--not for party, not for ideology, but for what was best for the State, best for the country, and best, in his judgment, for families and for the future. 
   He was passionate about Rhode Island, and passionate about the country. And in the end, I think his legacy will be measured not only by the legislation that he worked on, not only by his remarkable efforts to help us get a health care bill in 1993 and 1994, but meetings which I will forever remember in his hideaway where he brought people together trying to forge a centrist plan, which, ultimately, I might add, helped pave the way for Kennedy-Kassebaum and for other things that we have contemplated. 
   But he understood what his course was. He had a great sense of who he was, of what this place meant to him, and what all of us could achieve. He always placed those aspirations on the table as directly and as honestly as anybody I know in the Senate. 
   JOHN was also a warrior--a great warrior. Underneath the remarkable, docile, and temperamental person that we grew to know, there was really this other person who knew how to fight for country and for things that were bigger than him. He did so at Guadalcanal, he did so in Korea, and he did so in a remarkable way. 
   I will always remember Col. Terry Ball--he became a general, and he is now retired, just recently, about a week or two ago--telling me of the remarkable journey he took with JOHN, a journey he talked to JOHN about before he took it, to go back and visit in the South Pacific those great places that he was part of with the Marine Corps. 
   I remember reading William Manchester's book, ``Return to Darkness.'' In many ways, that was the journey JOHN went on when he went back there to revisit those places where he had served with such distinction but where he also knew such a profound loss. 
   This past summer, we shared another great moment together. We had the privilege of joining the Secretary of the Navy on the USS Constitution at Boston Harbor for a dinner. He was there with his family--the greater part of his family. It was a dinner in honor of JOHN and his service. A number of us went up there to share that evening. 
   I must say the sparkle in his eye at being aboard the ship with the flags raised, the colors presented, with his presentation of a walking cane from the Constitution itself, the sparkle in his eye that evening is something I will always remember. 
   I will never forget his passion for the Armed Forces, and particularly, of course, for his beloved Marines. 
   The Marines have their motto semper fi, ``forever faithful.'' It is clear that motto was the guiding light of JOHN's life--forever faithful to his family, to his love, Virginia, to his children, his grandchildren, to the Senate, to his State, and to the principles which guided them. 
   He is really Mr. President, with all respect for all of our colleagues, the kind of person in this great institution who is worth emulating. I hope there will be others such as him in the future. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, first of all, I thank Senator MCCAIN and Senator FEINGOLD for their efforts, though I must say I take exception to the comment of Senator MCCAIN which he made earlier. He is my very close friend. I have worked with him very closely on a lot of issues. But when he suggests there is a bipartisan opposition to reform, I think he is not paying tribute to the fact that no Democrat voted against cloture. No Democrat voted against proceeding to the full measure of germane amendments that would precede the bill. So even though the Senator from New Jersey, Mr. TORRICELLI, may feel very strongly about not just dealing with soft money, he was prepared to accept the verdict of the Senate in a normal process of amendment. This is not bipartisan in opposition. There is only one group of people who voted against proceeding to campaign finance reform, only one group, and I regret it is entirely on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans, because, obviously, we are not trying to make this partisan. 
   We were very grateful for those courageous Republicans who decided the time has come to vote for campaign finance reform. Obviously, we want them. We desperately need more Republicans who are willing to embrace campaign finance reform. 
   But the fact remains that on the critical votes of whether or not the Senate was prepared to eliminate the extraneous amendments, have cloture, and proceed to the process of debating this bill, not one Democrat said no to that. It was only Republicans who have stopped the Senate in its tracks. 
   Where do we find ourselves? What did the Senator from Kentucky say? He recited a few days of histrionics, a few days of sort of maneuvering. We had a whole morning, this morning, as the Senator from Wisconsin was saying, where we could have debated this. Why didn't we debate this morning? The Senate did not even convene until 1 hour prior to having the votes, and that was because under the consent order previously entered into, with the two cloture votes, those votes were going to take place 1 hour after the Senate convened. 
   So what could be more convenient? Convene the Senate as late as possible so that you have no time to debate and then proceed to have two votes. Why? Because you cannot turn up the heat on the issue; because the television cameras will not be on; because the galleries are not open; because the American people will not be sharing in a real debate about the impact--the corrosive impact--of money on the American political system. 
   And our 47 and 48 colleagues on the other side of the aisle who stand there and close down the process ought to take a sampling of the people who are in the galleries. I know we are not allowed to do that, but I bet if you asked every single one of them, as they leave this Chamber, ``Do you think there is too much money in American politics? Do you think the money gains access to the system? Do you think the money distorts the process? Do you think the money somehow does favor for certain issues over the general interests?'' Every single one of those people, or at least 85, 90 percent would tell you, yes, there is too much money in American politics, and it separates the average citizen from the people they elected to represent them. Overwhelmingly, Americans believe that. And, overwhelmingly, Americans understand there is a connection between what happens in Washington and what does not happen in Washington and all of the contributions. 
   This is the fight that some of us came to have: The fight over whether or not we are going to have a fair political system. 
   I understand a lot of our friends on the other side of the aisle do not want to change the system. Politics has a certain amount of self-interest in it; and the self-interest of getting reelected is a powerful one. A lot of our colleagues over on the other side of the aisle have a lot more money available to them than Democrats. 
   I was outspent in every election I ran in until the last election when a Republican agreed with me to do something different. We had a fair playing field. He was a sitting Governor. I was a sitting Senator. So you know what we did. We both banned soft money--no soft money in our campaigns; we banned independent expenditures--no independent expenditures; and we actually reached an agreement that we would both limit ourselves to how much money we would spend in our race. 
   Then we did something else different. We had nine 1-hour 
   televised debates so the people in our State could share in a good, healthy exchange about the issues that matter to them. 
   So you can do it differently. You can do it differently. But if a lot of incumbents sit here and say: Boy, I like that money; it's so much easier for me to go  down to the Hyatt Hotel or the Hilton Hotel or the Sheraton and have an event; and there are a whole lot of people who can afford the flight, the air ticket to Washington, and then can, after the air ticket, afford to bring a big check to me, come and meet me for a little while, and I can collect a whole lot of money--that way, I can fund a campaign--that is pretty easy. Most challengers in this country cannot do that. 
   The end effect of that is literally to strip away the vibrancy of our own democracy because what happens is the money is very well represented. But the points of view that do not have the money are not as well represented. And no one here can deny that. No one here can deny that. 
   We have heard a lot of talk in the last few days about corruption. We have heard about the way money corrupts politics, about how it corrupts the system. I express my admiration to the chairman of the Commerce Committee, my friend who is on the floor of the Senate. I think he has a lot of guts. He has a lot of courage to come to the floor of the Senate and tell a lot of people the truth. And a lot of people do not like to hear it. 
   So it got very personal last Friday--very personal--as we got led off into a tangential debate where one Senator was challenging Senator MCCAIN, was challenging him to name names, lay out for us a list of those in the Senate who have been corrupted. 
   I say to my colleague who was asking that question: Where does that line of questioning take us? Where does that line of questioning take us? No Member of the Senate that I know of runs around impugning the character or the integrity of another colleague. That is not what the Senator from Arizona was doing. 
   What the Senator from Arizona was doing was having the courage to point out that we are all prisoners--something he knows something about. But in this case, we are also the jail keepers because we have the key. We have the ability to release every single one of us from this prison--where we have to go out and raise these extraordinary amounts of money, where we allow ourselves to be proselytized by groups of people who spend $100 million a month in this city, either to get us to do something or to stop us from doing something. Think about it. 
   Then go out and ask how many of the average Americans are contributing to that $100 million. Ask the folks working two or three jobs, ask the folks who pay their taxes and struggle to send their kids to a good school, and who know their kids need technology and child care and health care and a whole lot of other things if they feel well represented by that $100 million. 
   How many of them are lined up outside the Commerce Committee or the Banking Committee or the Ag Committee, or any other committee, when we have a markup around here? 
   How many of them can afford to send a young messenger to wait in line, from the early hours of the morning, so they are assured of having a seat where the action is taking place? 
   I think we ought to get away from the side arguments and the side diversions and understand what the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Wisconsin, the Senator from Minnesota, and a whole lot of other Senators, a majority of the Senate, think about that, a majority. 
   This is not some wild-eyed, crazy fringe, tiny group of Senators who are somehow trying to stop the Senate from doing business. This is a majority of the Senate who believes the time has come to have campaign finance reform. Oh, sure, we all know the rules say it takes 60 votes. That is a supermajority. We all understand that. But on the great fights of the Senate, people were willing to stay and fight. It took 6 weeks, I think, of filibuster for the Civil Rights Act to pass. 
   We can go back in history through a lot of other great debates of the Senate. It took a long time, with serious work, serious meetings, serious efforts to try to reach agreement. 
   Let me give Senators a critical fact concerning the perception among the American people today. I don't think anybody can disagree with this. Some people want to avoid it, but I don't think an honest, intellectual assessment would allow them to disagree with it. Every poll shows it; every conversation anybody might have, even with the top corporate chieftains of this country. I have talked to some of the top CEOs of some of the biggest Fortune 500 companies in the country about how they feel about fundraising--from a Democrat or from a Republican. Those are the people who are increasingly turning off the current system. They are scared. They don't voluntarily get out of it. 
   There are a few who have. The committee of businessmen that has come together with a new plan has had the courage to say: We are not going to give to Republicans, and we are not going to give to Democrats, either. I have heard so many of these CEOs say: I know it is bad; I know it is corrupting. I don't like it; I don't want to be part of it. But if I unilaterally stop doing it, my competitor will be at the table, and I won't be at the table. 
   That is what happens. So they don't do it. The fact is, the majority of Americans believe the amount of money spent on campaigns gains a special access to the political system for those who are most capable of contributing, whatever side they are on, whatever side of the issue. 
   Let's assume, for the sake of argument, no Senator is affected by the money that is given. Take the word ``corruption'' off the table, as it applies to any specific act of any legislator. Ask yourself, by fairer judgment, if the group that wants to achieve goal A can go out and raise tens of millions of dollars and have the ability to then load that money into campaigns for people who will vote for what goal A is, and the people in goal B are all pretty poor or don't have access to money or aren't organized and don't have the ability to contribute the same way, but their goal may be equally worthy or, in fact, more worthy, is there a fairness in the system? Is there a form of corruption of the political process, not of the people but of the political process, that denies the kind of fair playing field I think is at the heart of the kind of democracy this country wants to provide its citizenry and for which it really stands? 
   I think the perception of that unweighted playing field, the perception of that unfairness ought to concern every Member of the Senate. 
   We can sit back and point to our own personal integrity. We can say we don't make decisions on public policy based on campaign contributions. The truth is, we are extraordinarily exposed to the general awareness and perception and belief and cynicism that is now attached to the system which says that the money speaks and that it makes a huge difference. 
   I think such a significant portion of Americans are affected by this that, in point of fact, the standard set up by the Supreme Court with respect to the perception of corruption is met. 
   When the Senator from Kentucky--I will talk about this a little later--talks about the first amendment, there is a sufficient test under first amendment standards that would allow the Court to make a decision in favor of some restraints. They have already done that. They did it in 1972, in 1974. We certainly have the right to do it now. 
   I ask my colleagues, every year 20,000 Americans are poisoned with the E. coli bacteria when they eat contaminated food. They have found tuberculosis in beef, and two-thirds of chickens contain the potentially deadly campylocbacter bacteria. That is not a finding of politicians. That is what scientists tell us. But in spite of the rapid spread of food-borne illnesses, we haven't responded. We haven't done anything. Walk into a room of 50 ordinary Americans and tell them we haven't done anything to promote public health needs on this issue, that every single bill that has come before us on food-borne illnesses has been killed, and then tell them the food industry has made $41 million in campaign contributions to congressional candidates over the last 10 years. Almost every person who hears that will say: I bet you there is some kind of connection there. 
   Seventeen thousand people were killed by drunk drivers last year. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, the National Safety Council, and hundreds of other organizations formed a coalition to pass stricter standards on drunk driving, in order to keep drunk drivers off the road and get tougher on them when we catch them. Almost  everyone agrees this would save lives. But the regulations didn't pass. Surprise. 
   Ask the average person on the street if they think our inaction on something as obvious as that has any connection to the over $100,000 spent by Alcohol Wholesalers, by the National Restaurant Association, Wine and Spirits Wholesalers, other alcoholic beverage organizations, that gave to both sides, 
   Democrats and Republicans alike. Ask them if they think there is a connection. 
   Last year, we tried to do something to respond to the fact that every day 3,000 kids become smokers. We know, because the doctors and scientists tell us, that half of those children will wind up dying early and costing us enormous sums of money in our medical care system until they ultimately die from their addiction. Ask the average American if they believe all our legislative efforts on tobacco fell apart, or at least in any part was it connected to the fact that Philip Morris and all the other big tobacco companies spent millions of dollars over every year for several years in contributions to both parties to hundreds of candidates for the House and the Senate. Was that a spending in the general public interest? Was that a spending in the interest of the Nation? 
   Certainly--and I agree with my colleague from Kentucky--if it wasn't spent to elect a candidate, if it was spent to sell the virtue of tobacco or of something that had nothing to do with an election, certainly that fits under the first amendment. I understand that. That is a separate issue that can be dealt with separately. 
   I think we have to be even more frank than that in sort of acknowledging the kind of connection people perceive. The truth is, I think all of us know, to varying degrees, we are trapped in a reality where big money gets its calls returned. Big money gets its meetings. Big money gets the face time it asks for and looks for. We can see it in all of the fundraisers that take place in this city and in other parts of the country. Every single one of us is sensitive to that reality. I understand that. 
   There are very few Senators who don't work hard to try to undo that, the notion of the walls of the prison, if you will. I don't think Senators like it particularly. Some are content to live with it, even though they may not like it. The reality is, nonetheless, it changes the way the institution operates. 
   We only have to listen to someone such as Senator BYRD, the former leader, who has seen it on every side and has seen it change over the years that he has been in the Senate. He will tell us how the Senate has changed in the way it operates because of the amount of money in our system today. 
   I say to my colleagues, rather than put current Members on the spot, listen to what some of our colleagues who have retired from Congress, who are liberated from having to raise the money, who are out of the system, have said about the current game in which they were once trapped. 
   Representative Jim Bacchus, a Democrat from Florida:  
   I have, on many occasions, sat down and listened to people solely because I knew they have contributed to my campaign.  
   There is an honest statement by a former Representative. I don't expect all my colleagues to stand up and say that, but that is what he said. 
   When asked whether Members of Congress are compromising the institution of Congress when they solicit contributions from the special interests they regulate, former House minority leader Bob Michel, a Republican from Illinois, said simply:  
   There is no question. I don't know how you even change that. It is a sad way of life here.  
   That is a former leader in the House of Representatives, and a Republican. 
   I don't have the quote, but I remember my friend, Paul Laxalt, one of the closest friends of Ronald Reagan, who, when he left the Senate, said unequivocally:  
   The amount of money being raised in the U.S. Congress was corrupting the process, and it was having a profound impact on the quality of the U.S. Congress.  
   Listen to what former Representative Peter Kostmayer said:  
   You get invited to a dinner somewhere, and someone gives you money, and then you get a call a month later and he wants to see you. Are you going to say no? You are just not going to say no.  
   Why do the special interests give money? I think everybody would agree that former Senator and majority leader George Mitchell was a man of enormous integrity. He led the Senate. He has been leading the peace talks in Northern Ireland, a person of huge integrity, a former U.S. district judge, a former Senate leader. George Mitchell summed it up saying:  
   I think it gives them the opportunity to gain access and present their views in a way that might otherwise not be the case.  
   That is fundamentally the flaw. The Senator from Kentucky and others can take umbrage at the notion of the use of the word ``corruption,'' but you don't have to be specifically corrupt in some way that breaks the law to be sharing in a general corruption, an ``impairment of the integrity,'' as Webster defines it, of the institution, and the integrity of this institution is impaired by the current system. 
   I mentioned a moment ago some of the best minds in the business community--CEOs and others--who have shared with me, and I know with other colleagues, that they find the current system nauseating, sickening. They are tired of being ``shaken down''. That is their term, not ours. I know there are letters that have been sent by Members of the Congress to those groups that don't give. People have been threatened not to give to the other party. People have been threatened. These stories have all appeared in the Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Boston Globe--stories all across the country. People believe if they don't play the game on the fundraising circuit, they will lose out in the subcommittees, the committees, and on the floor. 
   We saw, this summer, that some prominent business executives joined a coalition for campaign finance reform, called the Committee for Economic Development. They promptly received a letter from the Senator from Kentucky, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee telling them in no uncertain terms:  
   If you disagree with the radical campaign finance agenda of the CED, I would think that public withdrawal from this organization would be a reasonable response.  
   So what is the message there? The business leaders told me what they thought the message was. They said: We find it ironic that you are-- 
   This is what they sent to Senator MCCONNELL. This is their response to the people who are trying to keep us from voting for campaign finance reform. The business leaders wrote:  
   We find it ironic that you are such a fervent defender of First Amendment freedoms, but seem intent to stifle our efforts to express publicly our concerns about a campaign finance system that many of us believe is out of control.  
   I don't raise these issues to suggest in any way that any individual Member of this body is corrupt. I am not saying that, nor is the Senator from Arizona. But the system is leading us all down a road that diminishes the trust of the American people in this institution and that diminishes our connection to the American people and therefore their faith in the system of Government and in the capacity of this Government to do what our Founding Fathers wanted it to do. 
   This is less and less a real democracy, and more and more a ``dollar-ocracy,'' a democracy mostly decided and impacted by the amounts of money that can be raised and spent, and not by the quality of the ideas that are put forward and debated in the great manner of Lincoln and Douglas and others who took ideas to the American people. 
   Are we scared of ideas? Do we have to pitch every idea in a 30-second advertisement, or a 60-second advertisement, and flood the airwaves with seductive, distorted, completely contrived messages, rather than laying out to the American people a series of facts and relying on them to choose? 
   I have been here now for 15 years, and every year I have been here we have tried to achieve campaign finance reform. In fact, I was the author, together with Senator Boren, Senator Mitchell, and others, of an original effort that had a component of public financing. We actually passed that on the floor of the Senate when the Democrats were in the majority. President Bush vetoed it. Subsequently, we got  as many as maybe 46--I think it was--votes for a bill that might have had some component of public financing. 
   But, each year, as the Republican majority has grown, the number of people willing to embrace a broader set of reforms has also diminished, leaving us now with a stripped-down version of McCain-Feingold--stripped-down to the point that many people on our side of the aisle fear that it may have the unintended consequences of the 1974 reforms; that if you do one component of reform, but you don't have a fair playing field, you simply unleash torrents of money into other sectors that may wind up having a negative impact on the ability of people to be elected. 
   I think we have to act. I say to my colleague from Kentucky, the notion that the members of the media are going to sit there--those who have covered the Senate for years--and believe that 4 days of truncated, half-hearted debate somehow 
    represents a legitimate effort on campaign finance reform is beyond anything credible. I don't think a member of the media could believe that when we sit here and say, well, we went to this last Thursday, and on Friday half of the Senate left to go home, and on Monday half of them hadn't come back, and on Tuesday morning there was absolutely no debate at all, and then we had two votes, and pretend somehow that the Senate has done anything serious about campaign finance reform. What a farce. What a joke. 
   My colleagues on the other side of the aisle need to understand that this is an issue that isn't going to go away. We must begin to be serious about having a fair playing field--and I do mean a fair playing field, not trying to jockey it for Democrats or for Republicans but deciding as a matter of common sense how we can approach an election. 
   We are supposed to be the premier democracy on the face of this planet. We are supposed to be setting the example for people in other parts of the world. And more and more people look at our system, and say: That is what it is all about? They spend $20 million in States such as Nevada chewing each other apart trying to prove what an evil American the other guy or woman is. How extraordinary. 
   I think everybody on our side of the aisle was prepared to go into long and serious meetings. We are prepared to caucus. We are prepared to have efforts to try to decide how we can come up with a fair playing field. We ought to have a real debate because we need to understand that the costs of campaigning are eliminating the capacity for fully representative government for most Americans. Some people do not believe that. I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue with fervor that the first amendment is represented by money, and the more money you can raise, the fairer it is. You can go out and campaign. 
   In 1996, House and Senate candidates spent more than $756 million. That is a 76-percent increase since 1990. And it is a sixfold, 600-percent increase since 1976. 
   The average cost of a race in 1976 was $600,000 for a winning Senate race. The average cost went to $3.3 million. 
   Many of us in 1996 were forced to spend more than that. My race in 1996 was the most expensive race of that year in the country--a paltry sum compared to the Senator from California. I think she and her colleague had to raise upwards of $20 million, and I think perhaps $30 million was spent against Senator FEINSTEIN. I am not sure of Senator BOXER--but somewhere in that vicinity. My race in Massachusetts was cheap compared to that. We had only $12.5 million, maybe $13 million 
   for 6 million people. 
   In constant dollars, we have seen an increase of over 100 percent in the money spent for Senator races from 1980 to 1994. 
   I know Senators don't do this. Not every Senator is raising money every single week. But many are because of the vast sums they have to raise. But on average, each Senator has to raise $12,000 a week for 6 years to pay for his or her reelection campaign. That is just the tip of the iceberg now because we have had this incredible explosion in soft money. 
   Soft money represents everybody taking advantage of the loopholes. It wasn't the intention of campaign finance reform or Congress to allow soft money. I must admit some Democrats managed to develop that loophole rather more effectively at the outset than some Republicans. It doesn't make it right. 
   In 1988, Democrats and Republicans raised a combined $45 million in soft money; in 1992, that number doubled to $90 million; and in 1995 to 1996, that number tripled to $262 million. 
   Do you know where it comes from? It comes from U.S. Senators who are passing legislation making telephone calls, or having meetings with high-powered corporate types, or very rich people who write checks for $50,000, $100,000, $200,000, and $300,000. Indeed, I believe the last year, in 1996, there were nine people in America who wrote checks for $500,000. 
   That is where it comes from. And don't let anybody kid you. It goes into campaigns. It wasn't meant to originally. But now it goes almost directly into campaigns. 
   So you, frankly, have corporations and a lot of big money directed into the campaign process which was never the intention of the U.S. Congress back in 1974 when they passed campaign finance reform. 
   Do you know why ordinary citizens believe they are being shut out? Do you know why the average American doesn't believe the system is on the up and up? Do you know why the average American thinks big money gets influence over their money? I will tell you why. Because fewer than one-third of 1 percent of eligible voters donated more than $250 in the electoral cycle of 1996. 
   I want to repeat that. Why do people think the system is out of whack? Because fewer than one-third of 1 percent of all the eligible voters in America gave more than $250 in the electoral cycle. 
   Think what would happen in this country if we invited people, as we used to do in the Tax Code, to take a tax deduction for a $50 or $100 donation. And those tax deductions, when people were encouraged to take them, in fact, added up to about $500 million a cycle, which would have paid for almost all the races back then. You could do it with small donations, if they wanted to--if they wanted to. But they like to go out and get the bigger dollars. One-third of 1 percent of Americans contribute over $250. 
   Ask most Americans what they think they are capable of giving to campaigns or are able to contribute, and you will get a sense of the great divorce in this country, a huge gulf, a Grand Canyon of campaign finance gap that is separating the average American from the political process. 
   Then we have another problem in the system--the issue ads. These are those ubiquitous TV and radio ads bought by all kinds of special interests to persuade the American people to vote for or against a candidate. Usually, these ads are 
   negative. They are usually inaccurate. But they are one of the driving forces of the American political process today. They violate the spirit of campaign finance laws in the country. Of course, they do. 
   Listen to what the executive director of the National Rifle Association Institute for Legislative Action said. He said:  
   It is foolish to believe there is a difference between issue advocacy and advocacy of a political candidate. What separates issue advocacy and political advocacy is a line in the sand drawn on a windy day.  
   Mr. President, the American people want us to fix this system. 
   An NBC-Wall Street Journal poll shows that 70 percent of the public believes campaign finance reform is needed. 
   So what the Republican Party is doing today is saying, well, we don't care what 70 percent of the American people are willing to do. They are unwilling to pass campaign finance reform that is fair, unwilling even to deal with it in a serious way. 
   Last spring, a New York Times poll found that an astonishing 91 percent of the public favor a fundamental transformation of the system. 
   I believe we ought to be able to deliver on that kind of reform. 
   Some of our colleagues believe that reforming the current finance system in a comprehensive manner would violate the Constitution. The constitutionality of a ban on soft money could raise questions. I think the issue of a total ban on soft money, depending on how it is structured, could conceivably be worked out in a thoughtful and artful way. But the point is it is fundamentally a sham issue as it is being  presented by the other side. And the first amendment is being used as a shield to prevent the proper scrutiny of this issue and to prevent us from changing it. 
   The truth is there are ways that you can reform the system within the confines of the first amendment. 
   On the critical soft money issues, leading constitutional scholars and former ACLU leaders agree that banning soft money contributions will not violate the Constitution if properly constructed. And we forget that the Supreme Court in Buckley versus Valeo held that limits on individual campaign contributions do not violate the first amendment. It simply cannot be said the first amendment provides an absolute prohibition of any and all restrictions on speech. 
   When State interests are more important than unfettered free speech, that speech is appropriately allowed to be narrowly limited. 
   Speech is already limited. We know in cases of false advertising and obscenity. And I think it is clear that under the limits of Buckley we can deal with the risk of corruption or the appearance of corruption and the warranted limits on individual campaign contributions. 
   The ban proposed in McCain-Feingold simply requires all contributions to national political parties be subject to the existing Federal restrictions on contributions to those parties that are used to influence Federal elections, and it would bar State and local parties from raising soft money for activities that might affect a Federal election. Groups remain completely free to spend as much money as they want on speech. 
   This is a red herring, a straw man. It is well used, I might add, by the Senator from Kentucky, but it is wrong. I am convinced the courts would ultimately hold it so, were we to do our work properly. 
   We've also heard that if we ban soft money, we will unconstitutionally infringe upon the rights of special interest groups to engage in free speech. I would respectfully suggest that there is some real confusion here. The ban proposed in McCain-Feingold would simply require that all contributions to national political parties be subject to existing federal restrictions on contributions those parties use to influence federal elections, and it would bar state and local parties from using soft money for activities that might affect a federal election. Groups would remain free to spend as much as they wanted on speech--they simply could not funnel that money through the political parties. 
   Another favorite argument offered by those opposed to reform is that we already have bribery laws to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption. This argument ignores the fact that the Supreme Court in Buckley explicitly considered and rejected the same claim. The Court said that it was up to Congress to decide whether bribery and disclosure laws were enough to address the federal problem with real and perceived corruption. A majority of the Members of the House and Senate do not believe the bribery laws are sufficient to limit 
   corruption or the appearance of corruption. 
   Opponents of campaign finance reform are vehement that any effort to control or limit sham issue ads would violate the first amendment. They argue that as long as you don't use the words ``vote for'' or ``vote against'', you can say just about anything you want in an advertisement. But that is simply not what the Supreme Court said in Buckley. It said that one way to identify campaign speech that can be regulated is by looking at whether it uses words of express advocacy. But the Court never said that Congress was precluded from adopting another test so long as it was clear, precise and narrow. It is exactly that kind of test that is included in Shays-Meehan and that I hope can be put back into the reform bill we are debating here today. 
   I believe reasonable people can come together and work through these first amendment questions. Certainly that ought to be a challenge the United States Senate is capable of meeting. And I believe that if we can do that we can move on to a question no longer of whether to reform the campaign system, but how. 
   I believe that the amendment offered by our minority leader would help us embrace reform. Though not a cure, embracing the Shays-Meehan model passed in the House treats the most serious symptoms that threaten the health of our whole democratic system. 
   Let me say again, this amendment is by no means sweeping reform. It does not limit spending by candidates. It does not replace private campaign contributions with clean money. But, it does address two of the most serious problems with our current, broken campaign finance system. It bans soft money and it clamps down on phony issue ads. We must attack both of these problems simultaneously if our campaign finance system has any hope for recovery. 
   And I would remind the Senate that even those of us who agree that there is a serious problem have different ideas on how to fix it, or what aspect in particular most desperately needs a cure. 
   I have long been an advocate of one particular kind of reform. I joined 
   Senator WELLSTONE once again this year in offering a clean money bill that would take special interest money out of the political system. But I am a realist. The Senate is not yet ready to embrace something as broad as clean money, in spite of its merits. that is not going to happen yet, but I continue to hope and believe that it will someday. 
   In the meantime, we must focus on finding a remedy for the worst of the problems from which our campaign finance system suffers. I believe Shays-Meehan can do that. 
   And, Mr. president, I believe we can move this debate forward and pass this legislation if we can avoid the hot-button issues on both sides, the poison pill amendments we've encountered again and again which have stopped us in our tracks. 
   One amendment which particularly worries me is the so-called paycheck protection amendment. Some of my colleagues on the other side are advocating that unions obtain written authorization from all union members before using any portion of union dues for political activity. The amendment would not require corporations to obtain the same written authorization from shareholders before using corporate treasury funds used for political activity. Proponents of this amendment complain that union dues are used to run issue advocacy campaigns that are really thinly disguised electioneering. However, rather than closing the issue advocacy loophole, which would comprehensively solve the problem, my colleagues on the other side would inhibit unions only while leaving corporations as well as conservative advocacy groups untouched. 
   If paycheck protection were passed, it would limit almost all political activities by unions, not just use advocacy. It would gut the funds the unions use for internal communications activities, particularly get out the vote activities. Rather than adopting this inherently unfair amendment, which would target only unions, a better solution is to close the issue advocacy and soft money loopholes. I hope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me in opposing a paycheck protection amendment if one comes up. 
   Mr. President, I hope we can avoid those poison pills, I hope we can actually pass something this week, and that we can support the campaign finance reform bill that was passed in the House, so that we have the tools to remedy both sham issue ads and soft money. 
   There is an awful lot riding on this debate. Because we have been down this road before, many think the result is a foregoing conclusion. In a front page article last Tuesday, the Washington Post stated, 
   ``. . . opponents of reform will rest easy in the knowledge that nothing will be accomplished.'' I hope the Post is wrong. I believe we can make the system better. We are not going to take all of the steps that would be necessary for a cure, but we can take care of the parts of the system that are hurting all of us the most. And that is a course of action on which all our citizens--and this Senate--ought to be able to agree. 
   I urge the Senate not to turn away from a real process where we sit together, work through the objections, have honest debate and discussion, and allow the Senate to work its will on the floor of the Senate rather than  walking away again from one of the most urgent needs as expressed by our fellow citizens in this country. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the FY 2000 Agriculture Appropriations Conference Report because it provides important emergency assistance for America's farmers and will provide $15 million in disaster assistance for the commercial fisheries failure in the Gulf of Maine. I believe that this funding is crucial to the survival of fishing industry in New England. It will allow our fishermen to use their fishing vessels as research platforms to do, among other things, cooperative research activities in partnership with the New England Fisheries Management Council and the National Marine Fisheries Service. 
   I thank appropriations committee Chairman, Mr. STEVENS, and the Democratic ranking member, Mr. BYRD, for their support of New England fishermen and their assistance in obtaining the funding included in the Conference Report. I also thank Agriculture appropriations subcommittee chairman, Mr. COCHRAN, and Democratic ranking member, Mr. KOHL, and their staffs. Finally, I thank Mr. KENNEDY, Mr. GREGG, and Ms. SNOWE for their support in including this provision in the conference report. 
   Last year, we were able to secure $5 million in emergency assistance for cooperative activities to assist fishermen who were negatively affected by groundfish closures in the Gulf of Maine. These new funds will be used to help fishermen overcome drastically reduced trip limits. A trip limit of 30 pounds, about 2 cod, was imposed immediately after the fishery opened. This was raised to 100 pounds by Commerce Secretary Daley at the request of the New England Fisheries Management Council. 
   These trip limits have had a severely detrimental economic and social impact on many fishery-dependent communities in New England. Ongoing stock recovery requirements have required continued reductions in fishing and resulted in continuing hardship. The additional funding included in the Conference Report will be used to employ fishermen in cooperative research programs, fund on-vessel observer programs, and provide training and education for fishermen. 
   I thank my colleagues for recognizing that New England fishermen and their communities require disaster assistance until our fisheries have a chance to rebuild.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to thank the Senator from Delaware for his terrific leadership on this issue over the last few days, and for a long period of time. 
   Let me quickly address, if I may, one point. The Senator from Delaware a few moments ago referred to the strange dynamic that has set in here in the Senate. I just want to underscore that, if I may, for a moment. 
   I grew up, as many of us did, looking at the Senate with a sense of great respect and awe for the capacity of the Senate to come together around the most significant national security issues that faced the country. I think all of us always looked at this institution as the place that, hopefully, could break through the emotions and find the most common sense solution that is in the interests of the American people. 
   Some of the great history of the Senate has been written about those moments where Senators crossed the aisle and found commonality in representing the interests of the Nation. I must say that in the 15 years I have been privileged now to serve here, representing Massachusetts, I have never seen the Senate as personally and ideologically and politically divided and willing to subvert what we most easily can define as the common national interest for those pure ideological or political reasons. And I don't think that is mere rhetoric when I say that. 
   I noticed when Presidents Reagan and Bush were in office, there was a considerable thirst on the other side of the aisle for adventures in Granada, Panama, and Somalia, and the obvious need to respond to the threat in Iraq and the Middle East. But suddenly, with President Clinton, we saw those very people who were prepared to support those efforts, even in a Granada or in a Panama, suddenly people argued that Kosovo didn't have any meaning, Bosnia didn't have meaning, and even Haiti, where there was an incredible influx of refugees and chaos right off our shore, failed to elicit the same kind of responsible international reaction as we had seen in those prior years. Now, regrettably, this treaty finds itself being tossed around as the same kind of ``political football,'' to a certain degree. And I think that is unfortunate, and it certainly does not serve the best interests of the Nation. 
   Mr. President, preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons is one of the most important issues facing the United States today. Since the end of the Cold War, we have made great strides in reducing the danger to the American people of the vast nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union. But the nuclear danger persists, and the job of nuclear arms control is far from finished. Multiple nuclear tests detonated by India and Pakistan emphasize 
   the need for greater U.S. leadership on this critical issue--not less. 
   In the last week, we have been told by critics of the CTBT that, for a variety of reasons, it will increase, rather than reduce the danger from nuclear proliferation. I believe that a careful examination of the criticism of this treaty will show that, on balance, it will enhance--not undermine--U.S. national security interests. 
   First, critics argue that, in their desire to conclude a comprehensive test ban, the Clinton administration made key concessions resulting in a flawed Treaty that is worse than no Treaty at all. Let me say at the beginning that I believe the CTBT is far from perfect. I am not going to argue with my colleagues on the other side that you can't find a legitimate point of disagreement about the Treaty. I'm not  going to argue with those who don't like the way a particular compromise was arrived at in the treaty, or that think a particular principle might have been fought for harder and the absence of victory on that particular principle somehow weakens the overall implementation of the Treaty. 
   The negotiating record--which has been subject to great scrutiny in recent days--reflects as many compromises from the original U.S. position as triumphs in achieving our objectives. There are legitimate reasons for concern that we did not achieve all of the original goals of the United States in negotiating this Treaty. I certainly take to heart Secretary Weinberger's admonition that you should not want the end goal so much that you give up certain substance in arriving at that end goal. I think that is a laudable and very important principle around which one ought to negotiate. 
   But my colleagues in this body understand better than most the necessity of compromise in finding pragmatic solutions to the many difficult problems we face. And the compromises we agreed to in the CTBT will allow us to achieve the nonproliferation goals we seek. 
   What has often been lost throughout this debate is that the United States enjoys a tremendous technological advantage over the other nuclear powers in both the sophistication of our weapons and our ability to maintain them reliably. The Administration and the Congress initially agreed to seek a test ban that would permit only the lowest-yield nuclear tests, which was soundly rejected by our negotiating partners because it would essentially ensure that only the United States, with the technical capacity the others lack to conduct those low-yield tests, would be permitted to continue testing its nuclear stockpile. 
   As Ambassador Stephen Ledogar--the head of the U.S. negotiating team--testified before the Foreign Relations Committee last Thursday, the other four nuclear powers argued that they needed a higher threshold in order to gain any useful data. Russia argued that, if a testing threshold were to be established for the five nuclear powers, it should allow for nuclear yields of up to ten tons of TNT equivalent, hardly a level that constituted an effective testing restriction. 
   Our negotiators quickly rejected that idea, and President Clinton decided the best way to resolve the impasse and protect U.S. interests would be to pursue a policy of zero-yield--a ban 
   should be a ban. The Russians were not happy with this proposal, but eventually were persuaded to accept a total ban on any nuclear test that produced any nuclear yield. 
   Clearly, the United States would have been better off if we had been able to negotiate a test ban that allowed us to continue testing. But it is ridiculous to argue that, because the CTBT does not protect the U.S. advantage it represents a dangerous capitulation on our part. To implement and verify a zero-yield test ban, we need not be worried about distinguishing between a low-yield test and a medium-yield test to determine if the Treaty has been violated. Any test of any yield is a violation. In this regard, the Treaty's strength is in its simplicity. 
   Second, critics argue that we shouldn't ratify the CTBT because we can't verify compliance. There has never been an arms control treaty that is 100% verifiable, and the CTBT is no exception. We will not be able to detect nuclear tests down to the most minute level of nuclear yield. But we will be able to verify that the Test Ban is accomplishing what it is meant to accomplish: an end to nuclear testing that advances the sophistication of current nuclear stockpiles or the development of new nuclear stockpiles. 
   The key to a successful verification system is that a potential violator must believe that the risk of getting caught is greater than the benefit of the violation. The lower the yield of the nuclear test, the smaller the chance of detection by seismic means. But at the same time, the amount of useful information a nation would get by conducting a low-yield clandestine test would be limited. As a result, a potential violator would likely decide that the risk of getting caught is greater than the benefit of conducting the test. In addition, clandestine testing will not allow any developing weapons program to approach current U.S. capabilities. 
   For those who are concerned about the danger from low-yield nuclear testing, I would also argue that defeating this treaty will make it more difficult, not less, for the United States to detect those tests by denying us the benefits of the International Monitoring System that will verify the CTBT. The International Monitoring System will include 50 primary seismic monitoring stations and an auxiliary network of 120 stations, 80 radionuclide stations for atmospheric measurements, 11 hydroacoustic stations to detect underwater signals, and infrasound monitoring as well. This system will be augmented by the very powerful national intelligence-gathering technologies currently operated by the U.S. and others. 
   The CTBT also allows any state party to request an on-site inspection of a questionable seismic event. The Treaty calls for on-site inspection requests to be submitted to the Executive Council of the CTBT Organization--the body charged with implementing the Treaty--along with supporting data, collected either from the monitoring and data mechanisms established under the Treaty or from national technical means. The Executive Council will have representatives from every region, and nations within each region will rotate membership on the Executive Council on a set schedule. The United States has reached agreement with the 
   nations in our region that we will always be one of the 10 nations representing our region, so we will always have a vote on the Executive Council. 
   Thirty of the 50 members of the Executive Council must approve an on-site inspection request. Critics have argued that it will be very difficult for the United States to garner the support of 30 nations to allow for an on-site inspection. They argue that our traditional adversaries will use the Executive Council to block inspections that are necessary to protecting the U.S. national interest. 
   It is true that countries such as North Korea, Iran, Iraq and their few supporters can be counted on to block U.S. and other requests for on-site inspections. However, most of the nations of the world have no interest either in pursuing nuclear weapons or allowing their neighbors to pursue them unchecked, which is why this Treaty enjoys such strong support throughout the international community. 
   Rogue nations would have to find support among more than 40 percent of the Executive Council to block our request for an on-site inspection. But it is unlikely that the United States would not be able to persuade at least 30 members of the merits and importance of our inspection request. 
   The CTBT will give us access to tools we otherwise would not have for monitoring nuclear tests, and an option for on-site inspection of seismic events that we do not fully understand. Defeating the treaty would deny our intelligence community the additional benefits of those additional tools. 
   Third, critics argue that the CTBT will not end nuclear proliferation, because key countries of proliferation concern will not sign or ratify. This is an important argument, because it goes to whether this Treaty can accomplish the fundamental purpose for which it is designed--stopping the proliferation of nuclear weapons. 
   It is true that countries will halt nuclear testing, or not, based on a calculation of their own national interest. But by creating an international norm against nuclear testing, the CTBT will add a powerful factor in a rogue nation's assessment of whether its national interest will be helped or harmed by the conduct of a nuclear weapon. A nation that chooses to test will face considerable costs to its political, economic and security interests. U.S. ratification of the CTBT will lay the basis for universal enforcement of the Treaty, even against the few nations that may not sign. 
   The CTBT is a critical component of broader U.S. strategy on nuclear non-proliferation, which has the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at its core. In 1995, states parties to the NPT agreed to extend that Treaty indefinitely, in large part based on the commitment of the declared nuclear weapons states to conclude a CTBT. The failure of the United States to ratify  the CTBT will seriously undercut our ability to continue our critical leadership role in the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. 
   Formal entry-into-force of the Treaty requires ratification by the 44 countries that have nuclear power reactors or nuclear research reactors and are members of the Conference on Disarmament. 
   And in my mind, it is altogether appropriate that a treaty banning the testing of nuclear weapons requires the participation of all the nuclear-capable states before it can enter into force. Of those 44, 41 have signed the CTBT, and 23 have ratified. All of our allies have signed the Treaty. Russia and China have signed the Treaty. Only India, Pakistan and North Korea have not signed. 
   Now, some have argued that the United States should be in no hurry to ratify the Treaty, that we should wait until Russia, China, India, Pakistan and North Korea have ratified. They worry that the United States will forfeit its ability to conduct nuclear tests with no guarantee that the countries we are most concerned about will make the same commitment. But the United States has already concluded that we do not need to conduct nuclear tests to maintain our vast nuclear superiority. 
   No one on the other side of the aisle is arguing we should go out and test tomorrow. Why? Because we don't need to test tomorrow. We don't need to test next year. We don't need to test for the foreseeable future, according to most scientists in this country, because we don't test the nuclear explosion itself for the purpose of safety and for making judgments about the mechanics of both the electrical and mechanical parts of a nuclear warhead. 
   The CTBT binds us to a decision we have already made, because it is in our national interests to stop testing. And if, at some point down the line, it becomes necessary to resume testing to preserve the reliability of our nuclear deterrent, we can withdraw from the Treaty to do so. 
   Clearly, we want countries like India and Pakistan to ratify the Treaty and commit themselves to refraining from nuclear testing. Aren't we more likely to convince them to do this if we ourselves have already ratified the Treaty? As Secretary Albright correctly pointed out on Thursday, waiting is not a strategy. During the debates on the Chemical Weapons Convention, there were those who advocated taking this passive approach to protecting our interests. But in fact, after the United States ratified the CWC, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and Cuba followed our lead. The best chance for achieving the nonproliferation goals of the CTBT is for the United States to lead. If the Senate were to reject the Treaty, international support for the test ban would be gravely undermined, and countries like India and Pakistan would have no reason to refrain from continued testing. 
   Aren't we better off with a treaty that gives us the capacity to monitor, the capacity to continue to show leadership with India and Pakistan, the capacity to set up a process with China before the Chinese test in a way that gives them the ability to translate the information stolen--referred to in the Cox commission report--into a real threat to the United States? 
   That seems to me to be a very simple proposition. The Cox Report, and others, all acknowledge that at this point in time China has not created a new weapon or changed its nuclear capacity, using our information. And we know that, in order to do so, using on our information, they have to test. China has signed the treaty, and is prepared to adopt the restraints of this treaty. Those who argue that we are better off allowing China the window to go out and test and now profit from what it has stolen elude all common 
   sense, in my judgment. How would the United States be better off with a China that is allowed to test and translate the stolen information into a better weapons system? That is not answered on the floor of the Senate. But some argue that that is the way they would like to proceed. 
   U.S. ratification of the CTBT won't end nuclear proliferation, but U.S. rejection of the Treaty undermine the credibility of U.S. leadership on nonproliferation, which will jeopardize U.S. work to prevent North Korea from developing nuclear weapons, to eliminate weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, and to block the sale of sensitive technologies that could contribute to proliferation. 
   Finally, critics argue that the United States will not be able to maintain a reliable nuclear deterrent without nuclear tests. I take very seriously the argument that, without nuclear testing, the credibility of the U.S. nuclear deterrent will be undermined. The security of the American people--and the security of our friends and allies around the world--depends on maintaining the credible perception that an act of aggression against us will be met with an overwhelming and devastating response. If I thought for a minute that U.S. ratification of the CTBT would undermine this deterrent, I would not--I could not--support it. 
   In fact, the United States has today and will continue to have in the future high confidence in the safety, reliability and effectiveness of our nuclear stockpile. This confidence is based on over 50 years of experience and analysis of over 1,000 nuclear tests, the most in the world. 
   Most of the nuclear tests the United States has conducted have been to develop new nuclear weapons; for the most part, we use non-nuclear tests to ensure the continued reliability of our nuclear arsenal. 
   This is a key point--even with no test ban, the United States would not rely primarily on detonating nuclear explosions to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. Most of the problems associated with aging nuclear weapons will relate to the many mechanical and electrical components of the warhead, and the CTBT does not restrict testing on these non-nuclear components. Moreover, we have already proven that we can make modifications to existing designs without nuclear testing. In 1998, we certified the reliability of the B-61 Mod 11, which replaced an older weapon in the stockpile, without conducting a nuclear test. 
   Looking to the future, the center of U.S. efforts to maintain our nuclear stockpile is the Science Based Stockpile Stewardship program, initiated by President Clinton in 1992. This 10 year, $45 billion program has four major objectives: to maintain a safe and reliable stockpile as nuclear weapons age; to maintain and enhance capability to replace and certify nuclear weapons components; to train new weapon scientists; and to maintain and further develop an operational manufacturing capability. 
   And it is already working. Since our last test in 1992, the Secretaries of Defense and Energy and the Commander-in-Chief of Strategic Command have certified 3 times (and are about to certify for the fourth time) that the U.S. nuclear stockpile is safe and reliable. It is only in the distant future--2010 perhaps, but we 
   don't know the answer to this yet--that conceivably the physics package of a nuclear weapon might provide the level of deterioration that might not be able to be replaced with totally new parts and therefore might somehow lessen our nuclear deterrent capacity. To enable us to respond to such a situation, President Clinton has established six Safeguards that define the conditions under which the U.S. will remain a party to the CTBT. 
   Presidential Safeguards A through F, as they are known, outline the U.S. commitment to maintaining a science-based stockpile stewardship program to insure a high degree of confidence in the reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile. The final safeguard, Safeguard F, states U.S. policy--as embodied in the official negotiating record of the CTBT--that, if the President is advised that the safety or reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile can no longer be certified, the President, in consultation with the Congress, will withdraw from the CTBT under the ``supreme national interests'' clause of the Treaty. 
   Now, critics of this Treaty have suggested that a future President, upon learning from his Secretaries of Defense and Energy that the nuclear stockpile can not be certified, and upon confronting all the scientific data that tells him our nuclear deterrent is eroding, will somehow fail to act--fail to invoke the ``supreme national interest'' clause--and withdraw the United States from the Treaty. I ask my colleagues, Is there one among us who, when confronted with this information, would hesitate to act? When the Congress is informed of the status of the  nuclear arsenal--and those reports are given in full to the Congress--is there anyone who doubts that the Congress would immediately demand that the White House take action to protect our nuclear deterrent? 
   Surely, the critics of this Treaty who doubt that a President could find the political will to withdraw the United States from the CTBT when our ``supreme national interests'' are at stake aren't suggesting that there is a confluence of political factors that could possibly place the sanctity of a treaty above the sanctity of the lives of the American people. No one can tell me that any President of the United States is going to diminish the real national security interests of this country against some desire to keep a treaty in effect for the sake of having a treaty if, indeed, doing so will threaten the real interests of this Nation. 
   U.S. ratification of, and adherence to, the CTBT will not jeopardize our nuclear deterrent, because the United States does not today, and will not tomorrow, rely on nuclear explosions to ensure the safety and reliability of our nuclear stockpile. We have embarked on a high-tech, science-based Stockpile Stewardship Program that will allow the United States to maintain the superiority of its nuclear arsenal. And in the event that we can not certify the reliability of our nuclear deterrent, we have given notice to our negotiating partners that we will not adhere to the CTBT at the expense of our supreme national interests. 
   So, in effect, we are talking about what we could achieve by passing this treaty and showing leadership on the subject of implementing an international regime of monitoring and of nonproliferation, versus continuing the completely uncontrolled capacity of nations to provide a true threat to the United States. 
   Mr. President, critics of this Treaty argue that the United States today faces too many uncertainties in the realm of nonproliferation to commit ourselves to a leadership position on the CTBT. I can not speak to those uncertainties, but of the following, I am absolutely certain: if the Senate rejects the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, there will be more nuclear tests conducted around the world, not fewer, and we will be no better equipped than we are today to detect and monitor those tests; the U.S. nuclear arsenal will not be made more reliable--and other nuclear nations will have the freedom to conduct the necessary tests to bring their weapons on a technological par with our own, undermining the strength of our nuclear deterrent; and finally, the American people will be more vulnerable, not less, to the nuclear danger, because we will have undercut more than 30 years of work to build and fortify international norms on nuclear nonproliferation. 
   The Senate has before it today an opportunity to send a signal to the world that the United States will continue to lead on international efforts to reduce the nuclear danger. We also face the prospect of acting too soon, after too little time for deliberation, and sending a signal that the United States can no longer be counted on to stand against the forces of nuclear proliferation. 
   It seems to me that when the President of the United States makes a request in the interest of our Nation to the Senate to delay a vote, it is only politics that would drive us to have that vote notwithstanding that request. 
   My plea would be to my colleagues in the Senate that we find the capacity to cool down a little bit, to have a vote that delays the consideration of this treaty so that we may proceed to answer properly each of the questions raised by those who oppose it, and, if need be, make changes that would not send the message that the United States of America is rejecting outright this opportunity to embrace a policy that from Eisenhower on we have fought to try to adopt. 
   I hope that the leadership of the Senate on both sides of the aisle can be prevailed upon to prevent a tragic misstep that I fear will have grave consequences for the strategic interests of the United States and our friends and allies.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 with my friend and colleague from Illinois, Senator DURBIN. 
   Mr. President, each year malaria, tuberculosis and AIDS kill more than 7 million people, disproportionately in the developing world. Each of these diseases is potentially preventable by vaccination. 
   A recent column in the Boston Globe by David Nyhan sums up the situation facing the developing world succinctly. 
   Tuberculosis causes more deaths than any other infectious disease, killing 3 million people annually. One hundred thousand children die from TB each year. The World Health Organization estimates that between now and 2020, ``nearly one billion more people will be newly infected, 200 million people will get sick, and 70 million will die from tuberculosis, if control is not strengthened. Tuberculosis is not just an issue for some faraway countries; in the United States, more than 19,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually and increasingly we are seeing drug-resistant strains of tuberculosis in this country but especially in the states of the former Soviet Union where, according to one CDC doctor, an epidemic is taking place of ``the worst situation for multidrug resistant tuberculosis ever documented in the world.'' Other areas of the world, such as central India, Bangladesh, Latvia, Congo, Uganda, Peru are also experiencing near-epidemic tuberculosis crises. 
   According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills more than 2 million people every year, and the disease is an important public health problem in 90 countries inhabited by almost half of the world's population. Each year, one million children under the age of five die from complications associated with malaria. Again, Mr. President, malaria is a disease we tend to associate with foreign exotic lands, and overlook the fact that in this country, more than one thousand people are stricken by malaria each year. Researchers at the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases contend that ``conventional control measures ..... appear increasingly inadequate..... As a result of drug-resistant parasites and insecticide-resistant mosquitoes, fewer tools to control malaria exist today than did 25 years ago.'' 
   Last year, the human immunosuppressant virus took the lives of 2.5 million, of which more than 500,000 were children under the age of 15. In the United States, almost one million are currently living with HIV-disease and 40,000 are newly infected each year. In Zimbabwe and Botswana, as many as 25 percent of the adult population is infected with HIV. In Zambia, 72 percent of households contain a child orphaned by AIDS. South Africa, which was largely isolated from HIV during its apartheid years, is now home to 10 percent of the new infections in Africa, and in the country's most populous province, KwaZulu-Natal, one-third of adults are HIV-infected. Analysts claim that India is an AIDS disaster-in-waiting: half a million people in one of India's smallest rural states (Tamil Nadu) are HIV-positive, as are fifteen percent of the women in one of India's more populous states (Maharashtra). 
   While AIDS is entirely preventable in this country and abroad, and while behavioral interventions for HIV have proven effective at reducing infection rates, many factors, including political obstacles, insufficient prevention funding, forced sexual encounters, and the difficulty of maintaining safe behavior over a lifetime, mean that a vaccine will be required for control of this worldwide epidemic. 
   And, yet, Mr. President, biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies in the United States, the home of the most innovative research and development in the world, are not working on vaccines to the world's largest killers. Market disincentives--especially the lack of a viable, cash-rich market--play against investment into these vaccines. Private-sector scientists and chief executive officers have a difficult time justifying to their boards an investment in developmental research toward these vaccines as long as other pharmaceutical research and development into products appealing to the developed world, like anti-depressants or Viagra, present more attractive investments. 
   This market failure and the need for incentives is shown most dramatically by last year's survey by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America. Of the 43 vaccine projects found to be in development by the survey not one was for HIV, malaria or tuberculosis. To find vaccines for the biggest infectious disease killers in the world, both the private and public sectors must be engaged in a bolder, more creative and dramatic way. 
   Mr. President, with that in mind, we are introducing the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act, which establishes an income tax credit for 30 percent of the qualified expenses for medical research related to the development of vaccines against widespread diseases like malaria, HIV and tuberculosis, which according to the World Health Organization, cause more than one million deaths annually. 
   This bill also declares that it is the sense of Congress that if the vaccine research credit is allowed to any corporation or shareholder of a corporation, the corporation should certify to the Secretary of the Treasury that, within one year after that vaccine is first licensed, the corporation will establish a good faith plan to maximize international access to high quality and affordable vaccines. In addition, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that the President and Federal agencies (including the Departments of State, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury) should work together in vigorous support of the creation and funding of a multi-lateral, international effort, such as a vaccine purchase fund, to accelerate the introduction of vaccines to which the vaccine research credit applies and of other priority vaccines into the poorest countries 
   of the world. Lastly, the bill expresses the sense of Congress that flexible or differential pricing for vaccines, providing lowered prices for the poorest countries, is one of several valid strategies to accelerate the introduction of vaccines in developing countries. 
   Mr. President, this legislation has received the support of the American  Public Health Association, the Global Health Council, AIDS Action, the AIDS Policy Center for Children, Youth and Families, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative and the AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition. And, I am especially pleased that the Clinton Administration has signaled their approval of our approach. At his most recent speech before the General Assembly of the United Nations, President Clinton committed ``the United States to a concerted effort to accelerate the development and delivery of vaccines for malaria, TB, AIDS and other diseases disproportionately affecting the developing world.'' 
   This bill is highly targeted: it will cost relatively little to implement but would have a profound impact on America's response to international public health needs. And it would complement--certainly not supplant--current federal efforts at USAID, the NIH and other federal agencies to assist developing countries and to bolster vaccine research. 
   Mr. President, this legislation is a companion to a bipartisan bill introduced in the other body by my friend and colleague from San Francisco, Congresswoman NANCY PELOSI, and 36 co-sponsors. Over the years, I have had the honor to work with the distinguished Congresswoman on various pieces of legislation. The nation is in her debt for her tenacity and her overwhelming sense of duty to country. Her constituents benefit daily from her leadership, and I am pleased to be associated with her again today. 
   I am hopeful that the positive response Congresswoman PELOSI has found in the other body is replicated in the Senate and that our colleagues join the Senator from Illinois, Senator DURBIN, and I in passing the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act as quickly as possible.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment before us today provides a chance not just to make this spending bill better and stronger, not just to move forward by completing another stage of the budget process the American people are already unsure we can complete, but to take this spending bill and use it as a real vehicle for reform of our public schools. Today we can make the single largest investment in accountability ever at the Federal level--today we can help serve as a catalyst for the innovative and, I think, critical reform efforts taking shape around this country. The amendment would reserve $200 million of title I funds for disadvantaged children to provide assistance and support to low-performing schools. This amendment will compel school districts to take strong corrective actions to improve consistently low-performing schools. Passage of this amendment signals our commitment to the public schools. Our commitment to their success. And our commitment to ensuring failing schools turn around. 
   For too long in this Nation we have tolerated low standards and low expectations for our poor children. The standards movement has begun to turn the tide on low expectations and we must build on that momentum and demand accountability from schools that fail our children. We have this opportunity at a time when the American people are telling us that--for their families, for their futures--in every poll of public opinion, in every survey of national priorities--one issue matters most--and it's education. Good news for all of us who care about education, who care about our kids. But the bad news is, the American people aren't so sure we know how to meet their needs anymore. They aren't even so sure we know how to listen. 
   Every morning, more and more parents--rich, middle class, and even the poor--are driving their sons and daughters to parochial and private schools where they believe there will be more discipline, more standards, and more opportunity. Families are enrolling their children in charter schools, paying for private schools when they can afford them, or even resorting to home schooling--the largest growth area in American education. 
   This amendment comes at an important time for our schools, you might say it comes at an even more important time for this Congress. We have to break out of the ideological bind we've put ourselves in--we can't just talk about education--it's more than an issue for an election--we've got to do something about it. Parents in this country believe that public schools are in crisis and despite a decade of talk about reform, they give them no higher grade than a decade ago. 67 percent are dissatisfied with the way public education is working; 66 percent use the word crisis to describe what's going on in our schools today. But the American people--at times more than we seem to be in the Senate--are firmly committed to fixing our public schools--fixing our schools--not talking about fixing them, not using kids as pawns in a political chess game. 
   It boils down to one fundamental, overriding concern: Americans want accountability for performance and consequences for failure in the public school system. Americans support a variety of innovative approaches to improving education--it's actually Washington that is more afraid of change than the citizens who sent us here. And it is time for us to be a catalyst for change--to help facilitate more innovation, not less--to improve the state of education in America: to address the problem of reading scores that show that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level. 
   The time to lay down the marker of accountability for student performance is now. That's why today's discussion is so important--because we have the opportunity today to do it--to stop 
   talking past each other--and to deliver on the most important principle of real education reform--accountability. 
   When schools begin to fail, when there is social promotion, when kids are being left behind, we need to hold those schools accountable for taking those best practices and turning around low performing schools not 5 years from now, not some time in the future, not after another study, but today--now. And if we can commit ourselves to that kind of accountability then we will have taken an incredible leap forward, not just building public confidence in public education, but in making all our schools better. It is past time that we coalesce around an approach to reform grounded in four simple concepts: high standards; teaching to those standards; giving every student the opportunity to meet those standards; and building strict accountability into the system to make those standards meaningful. 
   Mr. President, 49 States have embraced or will soon embrace meaningful standards; there should be no partisan divide over this issue--and now is the time for us all to embrace the policies which empower our teachers to teach to standards and give every student the real opportunity to meet high standards. Now is the time for us to embrace the accountability that has worked so well for real leaders like Gov. Tom Carper in Delaware, and Mayor Daley in Chicago--now is the time for us to say not just that we hope schools will meet high standards, but that we'll work with them--holding them accountable--to get them there. It's time for us to say that we're willing--in our title I spending--to hold schools accountable for meeting those high benchmarks--to reach out to low performing schools and give them the intensive help they need to turn things around and help raise student performance. It boils down to real accountability--to acknowledging that though the Federal role in education, in terms of pure spending, has been relatively small, it does provide the leverage--if we are willing to embrace it--to empower schools in need of reform to turn themselves around rapidly--to cut through layers of bureaucracy--to access new resources--to shake up staff--and, if need be, to reconstitute itself--to become a new school in a fundamental sense--or to turn itself into, essentially, a charter school within the public school system. We know that title I itself, with the early accountability reforms already in place have raised accountability--but I would say that in this amendment we could do so much more--and we should. 
   Consider the impact more accountability would make--the ability we would have to truly adhere to high standards throughout the system: to raise teacher quality; reform certification; provide mentoring and ongoing education; embrace merit pay; higher salaries; and end teacher tenure as we know it. 
   Consider the ability to hold schools accountable for our childrens' needs--to say that we will not allow schools to be the dumping ground for adult problems--and to acknowledge that we need to fill those hours after school with meaningful study--curriculum--and mentoring. 
   Consider the ability to hold students accountable for discipline and violence: to allow schools to write discipline codes and create second chance schools: to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into arenas of violence. 
   We need to do these things now--to be willing to challenge the status quo--to do more for our schools, to help every student achieve, to guarantee reform when they don't--and--in no small measure--to renew the promise of public education for the 21st century. 
   This will not happen overnight, but it will happen. I look forward to joining with all of my colleagues in that effort: to pass this amendment, to make accountability the foundation of reform, and to face the challenge of fixing our public schools together.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to spend some time this afternoon speaking to my colleagues to vote against the amendment before us today, the amendment that would prohibit the Department of Labor or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration from issuing any standard or regulation addressing ergonomic concerns in the workplace for one year. 
   Mr. President, this prohibition would come just as OSHA prepares, in the next few weeks, to publish its proposed rule on ergonomics for public comment. This would be a blow to American workers and a real step backwards for the kind of cooperative approach to business and the workplace that we need in this country. 
   Mr. President, let's be clear about the issue before us, the question of ergonomics and which workplace injuries will continue to occur if this amendment becomes law. 
   Ergonomics is the science of fitting workplace conditions and job demands to the capabilities of the working population. The study of ergonomics is large in scope, but generally, the term refers to the assessment of those work-related factors that may pose a risk of musculoskeletal disorders. It is well-settled that effective and successful ergonomics programs assure high productivity, avoidance of illness and injury risks, and increased satisfaction among the workforce. 
   Many businesses and trade associations have already implemented safety and health programs in the workplace and have seen productivity rise as fewer hours on the job are lost. According to Assistant Secretary of Labor Charles N. Jeffress in his testimony before the House Committee on Small Business, programs implemented by individual employers reduce total job-related injuries and illnesses by an average of 45 percent and lost work time injuries and illnesses by an average of 75 percent. 
   Ergonomic disorders include sprains and strains, which affect the muscles, nerves, tendons, ligaments, joints, cartilage, or spinal discs; repetitive stress injuries, that are typically not the result of any instantaneous or acute event but are usually chronic in nature, and brought on as a result of a poorly designed work environment (these injuries are common causes of muscoskeletal problems such as chronic and disabling lower-back pain); and carpal tunnel syndrome. 
   And let's be clear that this, Mr. President, is a real problem for American businesses and workers. Industry experts have estimated that injuries and illnesses caused by ergonomic hazards are the biggest job safety problem in the workplace today, as each year more than 600 thousand workers suffer from back injuries, tendinitis, and other ergonomic disorders. In fact, OSHA, estimates that injuries related to carpal tunnel syndrome alone result in more workers losing their jobs than any other injury. The worker compensation cost of all ergonomics injuries is estimated at over 20 billion dollars annually. 
   What is most troubling, Mr. President, is that these types of injuries are preventable. There is something that can be done to protect the American worker. It should be noted that in drafting its proposed rule--a rule Mr. President, that is scheduled to be issued in just a few weeks--OSHA worked extensively with a number of stakeholders, including representatives from industry, labor, safety and health organizations, State governments, trade associations, and insurance companies. OSHA has drafted an interactive, flexible rule that allows managers and labor to work in unison to create a safer workplace environment. OSHA even placed on its Website a preliminary version of the draft proposed rule, in order to facilitate comments from the public. Mr. President, this is not a ``command and control'' regulatory action. 
   As noted by Assistant Secretary Jeffress: ``An employer [should] work credibly with employees to find workplace hazards and fix them ..... the rule creates no new obligations for employers to control hazards that they have not already been required to control under the General Duty Clause under Section 5 of the Occupational Safety Act or existing OSHA standards.'' 
   In other words, Mr. President, this rule is simply an interactive approach between employee and 
   manager to protect the assets of the company in ways that are either already being done, or should be done under existing rules. This new rule is a guide and a tool, not an inflexible mandate. 
   According to the Department of Labor, thirty-two states have some form of safety and health program. Four States (Alaska, California, Hawaii, and Washington) have mandated comprehensive programs that have core elements similar to those in OSHA's draft proposal. In these four states, injury and illness rates fell by nearly 18 percent over the five years after implementation, in comparison with national rates over the same period. 
   I'd like to share with my colleagues two examples from my home state of Massachusetts that show how business and labor can benefit from successful ergonomics programs. Crane & Company, a paper company located in Dalton, Massachusetts signed an agreement with OSHA to establish comprehensive ergonomics programs at each of their plants. According to the company's own report, within three years of starting this program, the company's musculoskeletal injury rate was almost cut in half. 
   Lunt Silversmiths, a flatware manufacturer in Greenfield, was troubled by high worker's compensation costs. One OSHA log revealed that back injuries were the number one problem in three departments. By implementing basic ergonomic controls, lost workdays dropped from more that 300 in 1992 to 72 in 1997, and total worker's compensation costs for the company dropped from $192,500 in 1992 to $27,000 in 1997. 
   That's the difference this common sense approach can make. And, Mr. President, in spite of the arguments for the Bond amendment, there bulk of the science and the research proves that an ergonomic standard is needed in the American workplace. 
   The National Academy of Sciences, the same group directed in this amendment to complete a study on this issue, already has compiled a report entitled Work-Related Musculoskeletal Disorders. And the report tells us that workers exposed to ergonomic hazards have a higher level of pain, injury and disability, that there is a biological basis for these injuries, and that there exist today interventions to prevent these injuries. 
   In 1997, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health completed a critical review of epidemiologic evidence for work-related musculoskeletal disorders of the neck, upper extremity, and lower back. This critical review of 600 studies culled from a bibliographic database of more than 2,000 found that there is substantial evidence for a causal relationship between physical work factors and musculoskeletal disorders. 
   Furthermore, Mr. President, we are not talking about a new phenomenon, or the latest fad. In 1990, Secretary of Labor Elizabeth Dole, in response to evidence showing that repetitive stress disorders (such as carpal tunnel syndrome) were the fastest growing category of occupational illnesses, committed the agency to begin working on an ergonomics standard. This rulemaking has been almost ten years in the making. Now is the time to put something in place for the American worker. 
   This rule has been delayed for far too long. In 1996, the Senate and the House  agreed to language in an appropriations conference report that would prevent OSHA from developing an ergonomics standard in FY 1997. In 1997, Congress prevented OSHA from spending any of its FY 1998 budget on promulgating an ergonomics standard. Last year, money in the FY 1999 budget was set aside for the new NAS study cited in this amendment, and the then-Chairman and Ranking Members of the House Appropriations Committee sent a letter to Secretary of Labor Alexis Herman, stating that this study ``was not intended to block or delay OSHA from moving forward with its ergonomics standard.'' 
   Mr. President, we should wait no longer for this standard to be proposed, and workers should not have to wait until a new study is completed to be directed from preventable injuries. The time to protect the American workplace is now. 
   People on the other side of this issue may argue that this is an expensive rule, or that the science is inadequate. This is simply not true. The changes envisioned by the rule will increase productivity and save costs. The studies have been numerous. Preventing OSHA from even working on an ergonomic standard, much less issuing one, at the eleventh hour is not the right approach for American workers. 
   This standard is a win-win for workers and management: the better that workers are protected, the more time they spend on the job. The more time they spend on the job, the more productive the workplace. And it is obvious, but it bears restating, the more productive the workplace, the more productive this country. Workers want to be at work, and their bosses want them at work. 
   We ought to be capable--as a Senate--to put that common sense approach and this simple ergonomics standard into place and we all be able to vote against the Bond amendment and help out workers and our businesses move forward together.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my distinguished colleagues, Mr. SPECTER from the State of Pennsylvania and Mr. HARKIN from the State of Iowa, for accepting in the manager's amendment of S. 1650 the sense of the Senate that my friend from Oregon, Mr. SMITH  and I offered on comprehensive education reform. Our amendment expresses the sense of the Senate that the federal government should support state and local efforts to reform and improve our nation's public schools, and further, that every child should begin school ready to learn; that training and development for principals and teachers should be a priority; that public school choice should be encouraged to increase options for students; that support should be given to communities to develop additional counseling opportunities for at-risk students; and that school boards, administrators, principals, parents, teachers, and students must be accountable for the success of the public education system. 
   I appreciate that my distinguished colleagues have acknowledged the importance of a bipartisan, comprehensive approach to reforming the public education system that emphasizes the principles enumerated above. If education reform is to succeed in America's public schools, we must demand nothing less than a comprehensive reform effort. We cannot address only one challenge in education and ignore the rest. We must make available the tools for real comprehensive reform so that every aspect of public education functions better and every element of our system is stronger. We must empower low-performing schools to adopt all the best practices of our nation's best schools--public, private, charter or parochial. We must give every school the chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what works in any other school--and with decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, and real accountability. Numerous high-performance school designs have been created such as the Modern Red Schoolhouse program and the Success for All program. The results of extensive evaluations of these programs have shown that these designs are successful in raising student achievement. 
   We must also restore accountability in public education--demanding that each school embracing comprehensive reform set tangible, measurable results to gauge their success in raising student achievement. We must reward schools which meet high standards and demand that those which fall short of their goals take immediate corrective action--but the setting of high standards must undergird comprehensive reform. 
   In order to do this, we must break out of the ideological bind we have put ourselves in. We cannot only talk about education--it's more than an issue for an election--we must do something about it. We have the opportunity to implement comprehensive education reform at a time when the American people are telling us that--for their families, for their futures--in every poll of public opinion, in every survey of national priorities, one issue matters most, and it's education. That is good news for all of us who care about education, who care about our kids. But the bad news is, the American people are not so sure that we know how to meet their needs anymore. They are not even sure we know how to listen. Every morning, more and more parents--rich, middle class, and even the poor--are driving their sons and daughters to parochial and private schools where they believe there will be more discipline, more standards, and more opportunity. Families are enrolling their children in Charter schools, paying for private schools when they can afford them, or even resorting to home schooling--the largest growth area in American education. 
   Earlier in this debate, I supported two amendments offered by the distinguished Senator and my senior colleague from the State of Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY. I am deeply disappointed that neither of these worthy amendments were adopted by the Senate. Mr. KENNEDY's amendments would have exempted education from the across the board cuts in discretionary spending that Republicans have proposed and provided increased funding for teacher quality. We know the American people are willing to spend more on public education. Yet the Senate voted to allow cuts. And we know that the American people want qualified teachers in their children's schools. Yet the Senate did not appropriate the fully authorized level of the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program. 
   I am also distressed that an amendment offered by my distinguished colleagues, Mr. BINGAMAN and Mr. REED, and myself was not adopted by this body. Our amendment would have, for the first time, provided real accountability to poor children and ensure they attend successful schools. The American people have said time and again that education is their top policy concern. And we have heard time and again that the American people want their public schools held accountable. Yet we rejected this important amendment, that would have appropriated no new funding and would have ensured low-performing schools would be turned around, was rejected. 
   Given our inability to pass these important amendments, I am particularly pleased that Mr. SMITH and I could come together and offer this bipartisan amendment. The sense of the Senate we offered is the essence of our bill, S. 824, the ``Comprehensive School Improvement and Accountability Act.'' Our bill emphasizes the principles embodied in this sense of the Senate, such as early childhood development programs, challenge grants for professional development of principals, second chance schools for violent and disruptive students, and increased funding for the Title I program. We contend that these and other tenets are fundamental to the comprehensive reform of public schools.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are now entering the third decade of the AIDS epidemic and while we have made some progress in fighting this devastating disease, our federal response is still lacking. 
   More than 400,000 people have died of complications associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome since 1981. Last year, more than 54,000 new cases of AIDS were reported in this country. This trend is staggering and belies the misperception that somehow the AIDS epidemic in this country or abroad has abated. While it is true that therapeutic and treatment breakthroughs have led to longer and more productive fulfilling lives for those living with HIV, and that the death rate from AIDS has fallen in recent years, the fact remains that this epidemic has no cure and the rate of new infections has not slowed. 
   But these are days of great hope, Mr. President, in the fight against AIDS. During the years of inaction by the Reagan and Bush Administrations during the 1980s, we entered the second decade of the epidemic on a much different note: treatments were few, toxic and largely ineffective; training of physicians in the care of patients with HIV was incomplete, uneven and erratic; discrimination and abuse of people living with AIDS in housing, employment and medical care was rampant and abhorrent. It was difficult to have much hope as we entered the 1990s. 
   But this decade has seen great promise. We have made significant strides. No longer an immediate death sentence, AIDS has lost some--but certainly not all--of its social stigma. In that dark dawn of the epidemic, Mr. President, who would have believed that we would see a decade in which two Miss Americas would be AIDS activists, touring the country and speaking out on AIDS prevention and care? In the early 1980s, who would have believed that we would have an Office of AIDS Research at the National Institutes of Health, that funding for the Ryan White program would increase by 260 percent, or that funding for AIDS research would increase by 67 percent? 
   And yet, Mr. President, the rumbling of the epidemic has not been stilled. In the early 1980s, who would have believed that some African countries would have 25 or 35 percent infection rates, or that an entire generation of gay men in the United States would be lost? Who would have believed that infection rates would continue at staggering paces at the same time leading voices would declare the epidemic over? Have we truly become victims of our own success? 
   I certainly hope not, for as Tony Kushner wrote at the end of his monumental play, Angels in America, ``great work remains to be done.'' 
   Until we have an AIDS-free day in America, I will not become complacent. As ranking member of the Housing subcommittee, I know that great work remains to be done in finding shelter for people living with AIDS. I was pleased that my colleague from Missouri, Senator BOND, and my friend from Maryland, Senator MIKULSKI, were able to answer my request 
   positively to increase funding by $7 million for the Housing Opportunities for People With AIDS program in the VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2000. This money is crucial as people living with AIDS have a fundamental need for adequate and safe housing. I will continue to work with all of my colleagues to keep the HOPWA program sufficiently funded. 
   Great work remains to be done on HIV prevention. We are lacking in our commitment to adequately fund the Centers for Disease Control in their anti-HIV efforts. Until a cure is found, we must ensure that the federal government issues information widely which is accurate, blunt and unequivocal. Prevention efforts work, Mr. President. I have seen the work of the AIDS Action Committee in Boston and I can tell you that their innovative programs are working to slow the spread of AIDS. Unlike the increase in funding which the National Institutes of Health has received, the CDC's prevention efforts have remained at roughly the same level in the past few years. It was my hope that the appropriators would have recognized the unmet needs related to HIV prevention in this country and it is my fear that the failure to keep pace with that need portends a disaster. 
   For example, in this legislation as in other legislation this year, we again were subjected to the perennial ill-informed debate on the issue of needle exchange. I am dismayed that the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill will include language which deprives the Secretary of Health and Human Services from using her discretion based on science and empirical academic study to determine if needle exchange programs reduce the transmission of HIV without encouraging illicit drug abuse. This is bad public policy, when Senators act like scientists, and it is bad health policy. It is my hope that the conferees on this bill will restore the Secretary's discretion. 
   Great work remains to be done in combating AIDS abroad. We are a failure in our policy toward Africa. Our international efforts need to be bolstered to assist developing countries crippled by the effects of HIV disease. My distinguished colleague and friend from Vermont, Senator LEAHY, has been stalwart in raising the funding levels to fight AIDS abroad in the Foreign Operations appropriations bill and the Congress needs to follow his guidance by continuing to increase these levels. In addition, tomorrow I will introduce the Lifesaving Vaccine Technology Act of 1999 to spur research of vaccines to combat diseases which kill more than one million people every  year, and I will have much more to say on this topic at that time. 
   Great work remains to be done for hemophiliacs. There is perhaps no greater neglect by the federal government in responding to the AIDS epidemic than the ignoring of our hemophiliac population. On November 11, 1998 the Ricky Ray Hemophilia Relief Act was signed into law. The bill, authored by the Senator from Ohio, Senator DEWINE, received overwhelming bipartisan support, and I was proud to be an original co-sponsor of the bill. When it passed, hemophiliacs felt their thirteen year battle to be compensated for the lapse in regulation of our nation's blood supply was over. 
   In the early 1980s, it became apparent that HIV was being improperly screened, and 
   HIV-tainted blood product was being distributed to patients across the country. At the time, there were 10,000 Americans suffering with hemophilia, an illness which requires regular infusions of blood clotting agents. 
   According to the Institute of Medicine's report on HIV and the Blood Supply, ``meetings of the FDA's Blood Product Advisory Committee in January, February, July and December 1983 offered major opportunities to discuss, consider, and reconsider ..... and review new evidence and to reconsider earlier decisions, [yet] blood safety policies changed very little during 1983.'' In effect, the report found the FDA was at fault for not responding to clear evidence of transmission dangers. As a result, more than sixty percent of all Americans with hemophilia were infected with HIV through blood products contaminated by the AIDS virus. Currently, more than 5,000 have died and more are dying each day. In my office, I have been visited by courageous hemophiliacs and when they leave, I never know if I will ever see them again. This population has been decimated, Mr. President, and the personal tragedy is unspeakable. 
   We must fully fund the Ricky Ray Relief Act. The Senate version of the Labor-HHS-Education bill appropriates $50 million out of the $750 million needed to fund the Ricky Ray Trust Fund, and that is certainly better than the inadequate level of the other body, but it is a far cry from the level needed by the hemophiliac community. Members of this community never anticipated the one-time compensation from the trust fund, intended to assist with staggering medical bills and improve the quality of their lives, would turn out to be a pay-out to their estates. 
   You need only to speak to some of my constituents, like Therese MacNeill. She will tell you, as a mom, the hardship she has experienced in coping with the tragedy of losing one son to AIDS and caring for another who is HIV-positive. Terri MacNeill will let you know in no uncertain terms why we must fully fund Ricky Ray to help families who for years were storing HIV-infected blood product in their family refrigerators next to the lettuce and milk, and now are struggling under mountains of medical bills. 
   Other countries have recognized the plight of hemophiliacs who were infected by poorly screened blood. Australia, Canada, Denmark, France, Italy, and Switzerland are just some of the countries which have established compensation programs. Sixty Senators signed on as co-sponsors of the legislation authorizing the establishment of the Ricky Ray Trust Fund. Now is the time to realize our commitment to the hemophiliac population on par with other countries as well as our own actions in authorizing the bill. I hope that when the appropriations conference committee meets on this bill, the funding levels for the Ricky Ray act are raised substantially. 
   Mr. President, let me conclude by saying that I am heartened by the response of my friends, the distinguished Senator from Pennsylvania, Senator SPECTER, and the able Senator from Iowa, Senator HARKIN, in crafting this legislation. They have risen to an incredible challenge in the funding of programs designed for AIDS care, research and treatment, and I remain committed to work with them during this year and next to finish some of the great work that remains to be done, especially in regard to HIV prevention programs and the Ricky Ray Trust Fund.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank my senior colleague for this amendment, as well as for his extraordinary leadership on the subject of education. I think everyone here will agree there simply is no stronger voice for the quality of our schools and the opportunities for our children than my senior colleague. 
   The great battle in the Senate over the past years has been to establish standards by which we would raise the education level of our schools. The fact is, a few years ago we basically won that battle because now 49 States in the country have agreed to put standards in place or have them in place. Those standards vary. In some States they are stronger than they are in other States, but the great challenge now is fourfold. 
   One is to stay the course in putting the standards in place and raising the standards. The second is to guarantee that teachers can teach to the standards. The third is to guarantee that students have the opportunity to learn to the standards. That is not being dealt with specifically, though partly, in this amendment. The final one is accountability. All of this has to be accountable. We have learned that. You have to know that what you are trying to teach and what kids are learning are, in fact, being taught and learned. 
   What the Senator from Massachusetts, my senior colleague, and Senator REED and I and others are joining in is a recognition that we have an extraordinary challenge before us. I was going to use the word ``crisis,'' but I don't want to use it because it is overused. We have all heard the quotes about the number of teachers we need to hire in the next few years. We know maybe as many as 2 million teachers are needed, perhaps half of them in the next 5 years. We also know we are losing 30 to 40 percent of new teachers within the first 3 to 4 years. We know there are ways to make a difference in teachers staying at what is increasingly becoming one of the toughest jobs in America. 
   It is interesting that a survey, released about 4 months ago, showed what teachers have been telling us for some time. Our own teachers in this country acknowledge that they don't feel fully prepared for the modern classroom. By modern classroom, we mean a lot of different things. We mean the technology needed to teach. We mean some of the modern teaching methodologies, pedagogies. We also mean the nature of the student who comes to school today. That student comes burdened with a whole set of problems, unlike the students of the past. We also know that because of the multicultural, racial diversity of our Nation, we have teachers coping with different cultures, with a diversity that is absolutely extraordinary but also challenging. 
   The fact is that fully 80 percent of our teachers tell us they don't feel equipped to be able to do the job. They are crying out for help. That is what the Kennedy amendment delivers. It makes education programs accountable for preparing high-quality teachers, for improving prospective teachers' knowledge of academic content, through increased collaboration between the faculty and schools of education and the departments of arts and sciences, so we will ensure that teachers are well prepared for the realities of the classroom by providing very strong, hands-on classroom experience and by strengthening the links between the university and the K-through-12 school faculties. 
   We also need to prepare prospective teachers to use technology as a tool for teaching and learning. We need to prepare prospective teachers to work effectively with diverse students. 
   The truth is that we as Senators talk about the difficulties of teaching today in America. The fact is that it is one of the most difficult jobs in our Nation. It is extraordinary to me that the Senate, at this time of urgent need in the country, might not be prepared to make the most important investment in the country. It is extraordinary to me that kids just 2 or 3 years out of college can earn in a Christmas bonus more than teachers will earn in an entire year. It is impossible to attract some of the best kids out of our best colleges and universities because we are not willing to provide the mentoring, the ongoing education, the support systems, and the capacity to really fulfill the promise of teaching in the public school system. 
   So I hope our colleagues will support the notion that all we are trying to do is raise to the original requested level the spending for the teacher enhancement grants, with the knowledge that this is the most important investment we can make in America. Teachers need and deserve respect from the Senate and from those who create the structure within which they try to teach our kids so that they can, in fact, learn and we can do better as a country.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with Senators DASCHLE, KENNEDY, ROCKEFELLER and others to introduce the Medicare Beneficiary Access to Care Act of 1999. 
   In July, during consideration of tax relief legislation, I offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate to carve out $20 billion from the tax bill and devote it towards relief for Medicare providers from the unintended consequences of the Balanced Budget Act. Although the amendment received the support of 50 Senators, including seven of my Republican colleagues, it did not gather the necessary three-fifths majority required for passage. Today's legislation, a $20 billion package of specific measures to address the shortcomings of the Balanced Budget Act, represents the embodiment of our continued commitment to ensure that this relief is enacted before the end of the congressional session. 
   Mr. President, I cannot fully express the urgency of this matter. Here in Washington, we often throw around numbers with little realization of the real impact on America's communities. In this instance, I assure you, the impact is real. Take the town of Quincy, Massachusetts, population 88,000, and the birthplace of former presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams. As we introduce this bill, the community hospital in Quincy, Massachusetts stands at the edge of closure. Jeffrey Doran, the hospital's CEO, has been working overtime to ensure that if the hospital closes, patients will be safely transferred to health care providers outside the community. Over the past several weeks, I have been on the phone multiple times with our State leaders asking them to step in and provide the needed relief where the Federal Government has failed. Failed, Mr. President, because the Medicare cuts enacted in 1997 have gone above and beyond what we intended or desired. The budget savings have exceeded the levels we envisioned at the time of enactment. 
   Alternatively, Mr. President, let's take a look at the home health care industry. Home health care providers deliver rehabilitative services to Medicare beneficiaries in the safety and comfort of their home. In the State of Massachusetts, just since passage of the Balanced Budget Act, we have witnessed the closure of 20 home health care agencies who are no longer able to cover their costs as a result of cuts in Medicare payment reimbursements. The same is true with our nursing homes and extended care facilities. 
   And just to provide some perspective, the cost of the legislation we introduce today amounts to less than three percent of the cost of the tax bill President Clinton vetoed last month. The cost of the entire bill is less than one provision in the tax bill to subsidize the interest expenses of American multinational corporations operating overseas. In fact, we could have passed this bill, repealed the interest expense provision, and saved American taxpayers an additional $4 billion. 
   What a sad reflection on our state of affairs when the Senate would approve a tax provision to expand eligibility for Roth IRAs for people making over $100,000 a year, a provision that would cost over $6 billion, but has yet to address the dire needs of our teaching hospitals. A full legislative remedy for the Medicare payment problems facing teaching hospitals would cost $5.7 billion. 
   Mr. President, the time will come for this debate, and the time will come before we adjourn. The bipartisan support exists. Let's keep the doors of our teaching and community hospitals, nursing homes, home health care agencies, and rural clinics open. Let's accept responsibility for the unintended effects of our previous legislation. Let's not wait any longer.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise in support of the amendment from the Senator from California. I say to my colleague from Pennsylvania that if at some point in time he needs to proceed forward on a unanimous consent request, I would be happy to accommodate. 
   Mr. President, the amendment of the Senator from California is an extraordinarily important amendment for a lot of different reasons. I should like to share some thoughts about that with my colleagues in the Senate. 
   It is perhaps a propitious moment for the Senator from Oregon to assume the chair because he has joined me in an effort to try to change this very debate that we are having right now on the floor of the Senate, where we have already had one series of votes that have been predicated essentially on the same old breakdown of communication with respect to how we are going to deal with education. It was a pretty much party-line vote. It was a vote that reflected an effort to try to block grant money so States could have adequate flexibility to be able to make choices, but on the other hand it did not target it sufficiently and clearly enough for those on the Democrat side, and there was no real meeting of the minds. 
   So once again, the Senate--on the subject most important to Americans--talked past each other, and we wound up with a fairly rote, very clearly partisan vote that takes us nowhere. 
   The Presiding Officer, the Senator from Oregon, and I have obviously tried to suggest to our colleagues that there is a different way to approach this question of education, and that, in fact, most of us are not that far off. We are sort of fighting at the margins, when the real fight is in the center over how best our children can be educated. 
   I do not believe that it is impossible for us, as Members of this great deliberative institution, to be able to come to agreement on things that are best for children. 
   We are not trying to build a system for adults. We are not trying to perpetuate a system that serves the administrators or just the teachers or just the principals; it is the children this is about. It seems to a lot of us here in the Senate that there are some better ways to come at that. 
   The specific amendment of the Senator from California is to fund the afterschool programs to the level that the President requested. 
   I find that there is a great circularity in the arguments of our colleagues on the Senate floor that somehow misses the mark, even when you are talking about this amendment of the Senator from California. 
   We often hear from colleagues: Well, we want the local communities to be  able to do these things and make up their minds about them. The fact is, local communities all across this country have made up their minds about afterschool programs. 
   I think it is about 95 percent of the local communities in this country that would like to put an afternoon program into their school structures, but they cannot. Here it is: 92 percent of Americans favor afterschool programs. 
   I am saying that I believe if you ask the administrators in any particular school district, they will leap at an afterschool program. Give us an afterschool program. They plead for it. Their teachers plead for it. Why? Because kids are going home from school to apartments or houses where there is no adult. As an alternative to the afterschool program, they turn on the TV, if they are lucky, if they have a TV. Other kids are hanging around in a courtyard with other kids playing various kinds of games, often getting into trouble, sometimes being sucked into gangs or other kinds of activities. 
   The fact is, most mayors in the country, most school boards in the country are trying to put together afterschool programs. So what is the hangup? The hangup is, far too many urban centers and rural settings in America simply can't afford to put in the programs because their schools are paid for from the property tax. The schools are set up, as schools were originally designed, to essentially follow the old agrarian pattern. You go to school early in the morning; you get out in the afternoon; you work in the fields. That was the original concept. 
   That is not what happens in America anymore. Every day we turn out 5 million of our children who go back to homes and apartments where there is no adult, sometimes until 6 or 7 in the evening. About 8 or 10 years ago, the Carnegie Foundation told us the hours of 2 to 6 in the evening are the hours when most children get into trouble. They get into trouble with the law or they get into trouble with value systems, when they do things such as having children that children are not supposed to have, age 13, 14, 15. Most of the unwanted pregnancies in this country, according to the Carnegie Foundation study, occur during those hours when parents aren't there. Then we wind up with a whole host of subsidiary problems as a consequence of that. 
   Our colleagues are absolutely correct, at least in this Senator's judgment. We don't want the Federal Government telling us precisely what to do. We don't need the Federal Government telling us what kind of afterschool program works best. But if in countless numbers of communities they simply can't afford to even do what they want to do, what they think is best, do we not have a fundamental responsibility to try to step up and help to bridge that gap? Hasn't that been a traditional effort of the Federal Government throughout the years in the Federal, State, and local partnership? The answer is resoundingly, yes. 
   For years, countless lives in the United States of America have been made different and better, and we have fulfilled the promise of opportunity in this country because the Federal Government was prepared to help local communities be able to make ends meet. Countless communities in this country can't do it. Every one of us has a community like that in our State. 
   We have too many of them in Massachusetts. You can go to Lowell, Lawrence, New Bedford, Fall River, Holyoke, Springfield, countless other cities, old urban centers; they don't have the tax base. They can't raise the property tax. They can't and don't want to properly raise taxes on their citizens. Yet here we are with a surplus, with a $1.7 trillion budget, with no greater priority in our country than raising the standards of education, and we are struggling over $200 million. 
   Again, we hear from our colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Well, a lot of these problems that the Democrats want to try to cure are problems that families ought to take care of or that responsible children ought to somehow be able to solve by themselves. Once again, that is a circular argument. Every single one of us in this Chamber knows that almost 50 percent of the children of this Nation are being raised in single parent situations. Because we properly passed a tough welfare bill a few years ago that changes the culture in this country about work, we now require parents, single parents, to be working, and we should. 
   But we have to understand the consequences of that. 
   The other part of the circular argument is that we are always hearing from people on the Senate floor about personal responsibility and the capacity of local communities to solve these problems. If you analyze the reality of that situation, based on what I said about the change in the American family, the requirements of a single parent to be working and the lack of adequate child care, the lack of adequate safety places for children, the fact is the absence of afterschool programs, in fact, winds up costing us a huge amount of money. Children who are unsupervised wind up not having their homework done, getting into trouble, being less capable of learning, maybe repeating grades, certainly some of them entering that zone of chronic capacity for unemployment. In fact, we wind up raising the cost to the taxpayer in the long run for the lack of willingness to invest in the short run. 
   I guarantee my colleagues that what I said is not rhetoric. We can go to countless afterschool programs in this country and talk to the students who are in those programs. They will tell us the difference it makes in their lives. 
   Two weeks ago I went to Lawrence, MA, to a program called Accept the Challenge. This is an afterschool program where they go into the high school and interview kids. They find kids who want to accept the challenge of going into this afterschool program, which is tough. It is rigorous. 
   I will tell you something. I met the brightest group of kids who want to achieve, who want to go to college, who want to live by rules, who are gaining enormously in their educational capacity as a result of their participation in the program. 
   What was interesting is, I even heard from one kid--a Hispanic child--who said he was always talking Spanish in school because they had a bilingual program. He hung around with his friends, he then went home, they spoke Spanish at home, and he wasn't learning English. But he went into the Accept the Challenge Program, an afterschool program. It required that he speak English, interacting with the other students, learning in English. The result was that he himself said: I am proud now, the way I can speak English, and I am far better equipped in my capacity to go beyond, to college, to take the SATs, and to get a good job. 
   So there you are--an afterschool program providing the kind of structure that kids need. Ask any child psychologist, or any psychiatrist, or any child interventionist. Every single one of them will tell you, as most wise parents will tell you, children need structure, children need a certain amount of guidance. 
   We historically have always looked to college as the first moment when kids kind of break away and begin to learn how to live without their kind of structure. Some kids can make it sooner. Some kids can go to college. It is extraordinarily hard in the first moments of college, without the structure, to be able to make ends meet. Some kids flounder in that atmosphere. Some kids go to college with more structure, or less structure. 
   Why is it, when we know this so well, that we adults allow our school system to institutionalize the lack of structure in children's lives by letting them go home and letting them out of school knowing they are going to come to school the next day without their homework done and without the capacity to be able to meet the standards of the school? I don't understand it. I don't think most Americans understand the reluctance for accountability. 
   Here we are debating whether or not we are going to put $200 million into afterschool programs that provide structure and guidance and safety for children--safety; I underscore that. An awful lot of kids in this country go back to situations after school where it is chaos; you couldn't do your homework if you were trying to. 
   We ought to be more concerned about that. We have an opportunity to be. General Colin Powell--there is not a more respected figure in the United States--is struggling trying to make what is called ``America's promise'' a reality, struggling to try to leverage the private sector's capacity to help  make a difference in the lives of our children. 
   You can go into countless numbers of those efforts, whether it is a boys and girls club, Big Brother, Big Sister, YMCA, YWCA, the City Year programs, or countless numbers of programs, and you will find the kids who are in them are thriving and the kids who are outside of them are generally challenged and having difficulties or where you find the kids who are having difficulties, they tend to be the kids who are outside of it. 
   In countless numbers of these programs, there are waiting lists that are absolutely mind-boggling, with hundreds of kids waiting to get in with the few kids who are on the inside. And the question is, Why? Are we such a poor country that we don't 
   have the ability to offer sanctuary in afterschool programs to every child who needs it or deserves it? 
   That ought to be the goal of the Senate. We ought to declare that every single community in this country, with a combination of corporate, local, State, and Federal effort, is going to be able to provide sanctuary, safety, and structure for children in an afterschool setting. That is the great challenge of the Nation. 
   We are going to have a vote tomorrow morning where we are going to have people come to the floor and kind of play a game. They are going to suggest, gee, we ought to really fully fund IDEA so we take care of that program the Federal Government already mandated, and we are going to strip it away from here. 
   I agree. We ought to fully fund IDEA. We ought to vote if we are really going to have a first-class education system in this Nation. Frankly, I think we can do both. But the question will be put to the Senate ultimately at some point in time as to whether or not we are prepared to do that or whether we just want to play these games that go back and forth and in the end do not ultimately reform our education system. 
   Mr. President, in closing, let me say I am convinced there is a capacity to build a bipartisan compromise on education. I think we all have to begin to look for a different way of doing that from that which we have allowed ourselves to embrace over the course of these past years. If all we do is come to the Senate floor and debate whether or not we are going to have vouchers versus school construction or one particular program versus another, then I think we are going to be guilty of perpetuating the crisis of education in America. 
   If, on the other hand, we try to be holistic--looking at the whole question of the education system, respecting the capacity and desire of local communities to be able to make their decisions, but empowering them to be able to do so by leveraging the specific kinds of things they would like to do by placing large sums of money at their disposal to be able to do it with a strict accountability for the back end--not for the micromanagement of how they go about doing it but to the back end--that we measure at the end whether or not whatever route they choose to undertake is in fact educating their children when measured against the rest of the children in the country, that then we could begin to have accountability in those schools that are failing, I believe we could marry the best programs of what the Republican Party has offered in their ``Straight A's'' and the business of what the Democrats are trying to achieve in the various proposals we have put forward. 
   I hope that ultimately the Senate is going to come to recognize that that is the only way we are going to solve this problem. 
   You could give a voucher to every kid in America. But the bottom line is, they have nowhere to go. Take that voucher. Where are you going to go? There are limited seats at the parochial table. There are limited charter seats. There are clearly limited private seats because a lot of private schools don't want 90 percent of the kids who go to the public school system. 
   Ultimately, there is only one way to fix the education system of America. That is to fix the place where 90 percent of America's children go to school; that is, the public school system. 
   Every time we have something like a voucher program come along, we are basically offering America a kind of ``Schindler's List'' for schoolchildren. We are saying to them: If you have money, you can buy your way out of your predicament, but we are only going to take so many of you. For the rest of you, you are stuck. 
   That is what happened. Some may not think the analogy is accurate. But I will tell you, for those kids stuck in some of those schools where they don't have opportunity and they don't have progress, it is a kind of living death because they are condemned to the lower standards of our economy, to the lower opportunities, to the lower pay scales, and in many cases, unfortunately, because of other things that happen to them, to prisons or even sometimes to violent death in the streets of this country. 
   We can do a lot better than that. It is very clear to me that a country that produced generations that won World War I and World War II, that took us through the remarkable transition of the cold war--most of those leaders coming out of public schools and most of this country's core citizenry coming out of public schools is evidence of what those schools can be. 
   That evidence is everywhere in this Nation. We have great public schools in places where people are lucky enough to have broken out or to have put together the ingredients of that great school. 
   The Senate needs to embrace those things that have allowed those schools to be what they wanted to be, to adopt the best practices of any other school in the country and to allow them to have the kinds of accountability that will lift the entire system. That is the only debate we ought to be having--not saving part of it but saving all of it. 
   What the Senator from California is trying to do with this amendment is to recognize one critical component of that, one of the most important components. It is absolutely vital. 
   There are four critical ingredients of educating. One, we continue to have standards. Mr. President, 49 States have now adopted standards or are about to adopt standards. Those standards will make a difference. 
   Two, we have to permit our teachers to teach to the standards which require quality of teaching, ongoing teacher professional development, mentoring, higher pay, more teachers, less class size, all of the ingredients of being able to teach to the standards. 
   Three, we need to provide an opportunity for the children to learn to the standards. That means afterschool programs, the opportunity for remedial work, the opportunity for the kind of teachers and other efforts that make a difference in their education. 
   Four, we need strict accountability. That means the capacity to be able to fire people who don't perform, to be able to help people to perform, the capacity to be able to improve our ability to attract a broader cross section of people into the great challenge of teaching, and to respect those who are there doing the enormous job they are doing. 
   I hope we can engage in that larger and real debate sometime over the course of the next few days. I congratulate the Senator from California. This amendment embraces one of the single most important considerations of how we will protect our children to learn and how we will provide schools with the capacity to be able to live up to the standards we all want. 
   I congratulate the Senator for this fight. I hope our colleagues will join in a vote for the protection of the children of this country.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am introducing today a bipartisan bill, together with Senator BROWNBACK of Kansas. This is the Workplace Religious Freedom Act of 1999. 
   This bill would protect workers from on-the-job discrimination related to religious beliefs and practices. It represents a milestone in the protection of the religious liberties of all workers. 
   In 1972, Congress amended the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to require employers to reasonably accommodate an employee's religious practice or observance unless doing so would impose an undue hardship on the employer. This 1972 amendment, although completely appropriate, has been interpreted by the courts so narrowly as to place little restraint on an employer's refusal to provide religious accommodation. The Workplace Religious Freedom Act will restore to the religious accommodation provision the weight that Congress originally intended and help assure that employers have a meaningful obligation to reasonably accommodate their employees' religious practices. 
   The restoration of this protection is no small matter. For many religiously observant Americans the greatest peril to their ability to carry out their religious faiths on a day-to-day basis may come from employers. I have heard accounts from around the country about a small minority of employers who will not make reasonable accommodation for employees to observe the Sabbath and other holy days or for employees who must wear religiously-required garb, such as a yarmulke, or for employees to wear clothing that meets religion-based modesty requirements. 
   The refusal of an employer, absent undue hardship, to provide reasonable accommodation of a religious practice should be seen as a form of religious discrimination, as originally intended by Congress in 1972. And religious discrimination should be treated fully as seriously as any other form of discrimination that stands between Americans and equal employment opportunities. Enactment of the Workplace Religious Freedom Act will constitute an important step toward ensuring that all members of society, whatever their religious beliefs and practices, will be protected from an invidious form of discrimination. 
   It is important to recognize that, in addition to protecting the religious freedom of employees, this legislation protects employers from an undue burden. Employees would be allowed to take time off only if their doing so does not pose a significant difficulty or expense for the employer. This common sense definition of undue hardship is used in the ``Americans with Disabilities Act'' and has worked well in that context. 
   We have little doubt that this bill is constitutional because it simply clarifies existing law on discrimination by private employers, strengthening the required standard for employers. This bill does not deal with behavior by State or Federal Governments or substantively expand 14th amendment rights. 
   I believe this bill should receive bipartisan support. This bill is endorsed by wide range of organizations including the American Jewish Committee, Christian Legal Society, Family Research Council, General Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, National Council of the Churches of Christ in the U.S.A., and the Southern Baptist Convention. 
   I want to thank Senator BROWNBACK for joining me in this effort. I look forward working with him to pass this legislation so that all American workers can be assured of both equal employment opportunities and the ability to practice their religion.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I appreciate the chairman's willingness to engage in a colloquy regarding the FY00 Energy and Water conference report. The conference report, which passed the House last night and is being considered in the Senate Chamber this morning, includes $1 million in Department of Energy's Biological and Environmental Research (BER) account for cancer research at the Burbank Hospital Regional Cancer Center. It is important that the word ``research'' be addressed in the RECORD, since the original request by my Massachusetts colleague in the House, Representative JOHN OLVER, asks that funds be made available for the Burbank Hospital Regional Cancer Center in Fitchburg, MA. 
   Since this is a small hospital serving a rural area, I and my colleague in the House want to stress the importance of the $1 million's being dedicated to the hospital for the underserved population, rather than for research purposes. If the chairman could clarify to the Department that the $1 million should be made available to the Burbank Hospital in Fitchburg, MA, without its being contingent on ``research,'' it would be greatly appreciated. I thank the gentleman very much for his time and effort.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will be proceeding momentarily on two amendments, one of which will be accepted, and one of which, it is my understanding, we still want to have a discussion about to see how we can proceed. 
   Before we do that, last evening, the chairman and the ranking member graciously agreed to include in the legislation an amendment with respect to the Montreal Protocol. Senator CHAFEE and I, the original cosponsors, along with Senator BROWNBACK and others, were not able to be here at that time. We wanted to take a very quick moment on that amendment, if we could. We promise not to tax our colleagues' patience. We want to say a few words about this because of its importance. We are very grateful to Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for working with us to accept this amendment. 
   I am very grateful to Senator CHAFEE for his long commitment and labor in this area. He is chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, and he is one of the architects of the very successful Montreal Protocol. 
   I also want to thank our colleagues, Senators BROWNBACK, SNOWE, LIEBERMAN, LEAHY, MOYNIHAN, KENNEDY, BINGAMAN, JEFFORDS, DASCHLE, ROTH, BOXER, and GRAMS, who are cosponsoring this amendment. 
   Let me say very quickly where we are with respect to this. 
   The Montreal Protocol is the landmark international agreement to halt and eventually reverse the growing hole in the Earth's ozone layer. It is extremely important as an agreement in the context of international efforts for the environment as well as for public health. The destruction of the ozone layer and the resultant increase in ultraviolet radiation has been clearly scientifically linked to higher instances of skin cancer, premature aging, and other skin problems; to cataracts and other eye damage; and the suppression of the human immune system. 
   The American Cancer Society reports melanoma, the most serious form of skin cancer, is expected to be diagnosed in 44,200 people in 1999. It is one of the fastest growing cancers in the United States--growing 4 percent per year since the early 1970's. And, according to the EPA, one in five Americans will develop skin cancer in their life time--and that amounts to one American dying every hour from this disease. 
   According to a scientific assessment called the Environmental Effects of Ozone Depletion and published in 1998 by the United Nations, exposure to increased UV radiation can be highly destructive to the human eye. The assessment concludes that, ``The increases of UV-B radiation associated with ozone depletion are likely to lead to increases in the incidence and/or severity of a variety of short-term and long-term health effects.'' The effects, according to the report, will include cataracts, blindness from cataracts, ocular melanoma and other eye cancers, and death associated with cancers of the eye. Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world, and in 1992 alone, the United States spent $3.1 billion treating cataracts. 
   It is because of this danger to human health that American Academy of Dermatology and the Physicians for Social Responsibility are supporting this amendment. 
   In addition to these health impacts, increased exposure to UV radiation can degrade terrestrial and aquatic species, including commercial crops. The damage caused to ecosystems can vary widely depending on the species in question--and we're learning more about how UV radiation can subtly--and not so subtly--damage a species. For example, it is becoming increasingly evident that UV-B and UV-A radiation have adverse effects on photoplankton, macroalgae and seagrasses. Now, I know it's not every day that we talk about photoplankton, macroalgae and seagrass, but if you care about fisheries and the well-being of our oceans, then to you these things matter. They are the building blocks of the marine ecosystem, the matter of the web of life and if they're not healthy, then our ocean and fisheries will not be healthy. 
   The multilateral fund, which is the specific program that our amendment  supports, is the policy mechanism within the Montreal Protocol to reduce the emissions of ozone-depleting substances from developing countries. 
   I want to emphasize this. It happens by chance that the Chair at this moment is deeply involved in the issue of Kyoto and global warming. This is not global warming. But it does reflect the same principle of getting less developed countries to participate in the effort to be responsible about environmental damage. 
   The Montreal Protocol specifically brought developing countries into the process through the efforts of the multilateral fund. 
   The United States and other nations leading the effort to protect the ozone layer have long understood that emissions from developing countries which were not included in the last round of cuts because of their relatively low emission levels and their relative inability to act in the long run would be equally as destructive to the ozone layer as the emissions from the United States. 
   So to address the problem in 1990 we passed this effort, and we are now restoring $12 million to the funding within EPA's budget in order to support the Montreal Protocol. 
   To address this problem, the United States negotiated in 1990 the Multilateral Fund to provide technical and financial assistance to developing nations to undertake projects to reduce their emissions. It has been extraordinarily successful. 
   Mr. President, let me say now what this amendment would do--it's very simple. It restores $12 million in funding within EPA's budget to support the Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund. Unfortunately, the VA-HUD bill now provides no funds for the EPA to participate in the Multilateral Fund--despite President Clinton's request of $21 million. 
   To fund this $12 million increase in the Multilateral Fund, the amendment makes an across-the-board cut to other accounts in the EPA's budget. I have sought this offset reluctantly. I strongly believe that Congress is making a mistake by cutting our national investment in environmental protection and natural resource conservation year after year. If it were my decision alone, this Senate would not have capped natural resource spending at $2.4 billion below last year's budget and $3.1 billion below the President's request. I opposed these low caps precisely because they jeopardize important federal programs Multilateral Fund. And, I want to stress that I commend Chairman BOND and Ranking Member MIKULSKI for the work they done to craft the VA-HUD Appropriations bill--under what I believe are more demanding constraints than any other appropriations committee. 
   Nonetheless, I strongly believe that we should fund this program, and I want to stress that it is only because of critical importance of the Multilateral Fund that I accept this shifting 
   of funds within the EPA accounts. 
   Mr. President, I have asked my colleagues to support this amendment for the following reasons. 
   First and foremost, the Montreal Protocol is a success. In 1998, NASA, NOAA and other scientific bodies coauthored a report called the Scientific Assessment of Ozone Depletion. The assessment concluded--and it could not have been more direct or more succinct--that ``The Montreal Protocol is working.'' 
   Too often we come to this floor to debate the failure of international agreements, whether they're about the environment, trade or peace--but not today. The Montreal Protocol, with the participation of over 162 nations, is working. 
   To support this claim, NASA and NOAA cited two compelling observations that clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of the Protocol: 
   Firstly, the abundance of ozone depleting chemicals in the lower atmosphere peaked in 1994 and is now slowly declining. Thanks to the Protocol we have turned the corner and we are now reducing the accumulation of these destructive substances in the atmosphere. 
   Secondly, the abundance of substitutes for ozone depleting chemicals in the atmosphere is rising. The abundance of chemicals that have been created to replace CFCs and other ozone depleting chemicals are on the rise in the atmosphere. These chemicals are providing us the same services we require, but not destroy the ozone. 
   This isn't to say that a danger doesn't still exist. One does--and that's the point of this amendment. The fact is that the ozone hole over the Antarctic was the largest it has ever been in 1998. While we have turned the corner, we must stat vigilant, follow through and get the job done. 
   Mr. President, I want to make an important point: In their report, NASA and NOAA concluded that the success of the Protocol would not have been possible without the strengthening amendments of 1990 that created the Multilateral Fund. The report reads ``It is important to note that, while the provisions of the original Montreal Protocol in 1987 would have lowered the [growth rates in ozone depletion], recovery would have been impossible without the Amendments and Adjustments.''--and it specifically includes the 1990 amendments creating the Multilateral Fund. 
   Second, the Multilateral Fund itself is working. Since its inception in 1990, 32 industrialized nations have contributed $847 million to the Multilateral Fund. These funds have sponsored more than 2,700 projects in 110 nations, whose implementation will phase out the consumption of 119,000 tonnes of ozone depleting substances. 
   These projects for technical and financial in developing countries are selected by an Executive Committee, which the U.S. chairs. In fact, it is the EPA that takes the lead in the U.S. role as chair of the Executive Committee. The Agency provides technical expertise and experience that has been crucial to the Multilateral Fund's success. 
   And the program has been well-run. In 1997, the GAO reviewed the Multilateral Fund's performance and concluded that it was well managed and fiscally sound. GAO reported that the Executive Committee reviews projects for their cost effectiveness and rejects projects that fail to meet cost standards. Further, the GAO concluded that the administrative costs of operating the Fund were appropriate. In fact, the GAO made a single recommendation to improve the program's fiscal operation relating to use of promissary notes--which the Clinton Administration has since instituted at the EPA. 
   Third, the Multilateral Fund has strong business support. I have a letter from the Alliance for Responsible Atmospheric Policy urging Congress to fund the U.S. treaty obligations. This letter demonstrates America's leadership in the development, 
   manufacture and marketing of ozone-safe products. Alliance members include General Electric, Ford Motor Co., General Motors Co., Whirlpool, Johnson Controls, AlliedSignal and dozens of the others. These are some of leading names in American business. 
   In their statement, the Alliance writes that they support the fund for very simple reasons: 
   Firstly, the Multilateral Fund was part of the deal when the Montreal Protocol was negotiated in the late 1980s. They argue that American industry has been supportive because a fund to assist developing nations assured world wide compliance. 
   Secondly, U.S. industry has invested billions of dollars in ozone-safe technologies and the Multilateral fund will facilitate the world wide use of these technologies, creating markets for U.S. companies and reducing pollution. These companies know that we are creating jobs and profits by exporting American-made, ozone-safe technologies. According to EPA, the overwhelming majority of ozone-safe products utilized in the Fund's projects are American. 
   Thirdly, these more than 100 companies recognize that the phase out of ozone depleting chemicals in developing nations is the final step in protecting the atmosphere. 
   In a statement to Congress, the Alliance writes,  
   The international effort to protect the Earth's stratospheric ozone layer has been one of the most successful global environmental protection efforts ever, with an unprecedented level of cooperation between and among governments and industry. To not fulfill our treaty obligations at this time is bad environmental policy, hurts U.S. credibility around the world, especially in important developing country emerging markets, and is self-destructive toward U.S. industry and workers who have, in effect, already paid for this contribution.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to discuss how it is that we decided to seek $12 million. This year the U.S. commitment to the Multilateral Fund is $38 million. The Senate has approved roughly $26 million in the International Operations Programs at the State Department. By restoring $12 million into the EPA program, this amendment will allow us to fulfill the U.S. commitment of $38 million. Further, we have funded the EPA program for the Multilateral Fund at $12 million in FY96, FY97 and FY98, and at nearly $12 million in FY99. Therefore, by providing $12 million we will meet our 1999 obligation and essentially level fund this program. 
   I want my colleagues to know that even if this amendment is accepted, it will do nothing to pay down the U.S. arrears to the Multilateral Fund--which is now at $23.8 million. Mr. President, that is unfortunate. I wish that we could do better--and I applaud President Clinton for requesting enough to pay our debt to the Fund--and urge my colleagues to support this amendment so that, at the very least, we can meet our obligations for this year. 
   In closing, I want to stress the bipartisan nature of this effort, and not just this amendment. The Montreal Protocol was finalized in 1987 by the Reagan administration, and it passed the Senate by a vote of 93-0. The Multilateral Fund was created in 1990 by the Bush administration. Under the Clinton administration, with the EPA and the State Department's stewardship, the Protocol has been strengthened and the Multilateral Fund operated effectively and efficiently. And today, our amendment is sponsored by 9 Democrats and 6 Republicans. 
   The Montreal Protocol's Multilateral Fund deserves our nation's full support. I believe the offset we have chosen is reasonable and fair. I thank my colleagues who have sponsored this amendment, and want to thank again Senator BOND and Senator MIKULSKI for accepting the amendment.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment increases housing opportunities for people with AIDS--the AIDS account--and the section 811 disabled housing account by $7 million each. 
   As I said, this is with the consent of the Chair and the ranking member. I appreciate their willingness to work with me on this amendment. 
   These funds are going to help provide housing for an additional 1,850 people with HIV-AIDS, and also crucial new housing for the disabled. 
   This particular effort, housing opportunities for people with AIDS, serves a unique function within the HUD budget. It is a vital program for people with HIV-AIDS. Fully 60 percent of them will face a housing crisis at some point during their illness. Tragically, at any given time, half the people with AIDS are either homeless or on the brink of losing their homes. 
   This amendment would go a long way to solving that problem. I look forward to working with the Chair and the ranking member to maintain this in conference.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, let me summarize this as succinctly as I can. It is a critical topic and one I want to talk a couple of minutes on in order to share with my colleagues where we stand with respect to housing and section 8 in the effort to try to provide affordable housing in the country. 
   I have nothing but enormous respect for the difficult circumstances under which the Chair and ranking member of the Appropriations Committee have labored. It is fair to say their situation has been unfair, untenable, and it wasn't until there was a raid on the labor and education money that they conceivably had enough money to try to bring a bill to the floor. 
   Most Members know what will happen: There will be some other kind of raid which will take place to try to restore some money back into the labor and education fund so we can somehow bring a bill to the floor and create a fiction that we were able to do something. 
   My comments are not directed at the Chair or the ranking member, who have done an exemplary job of dealing with the most difficult constraints of almost any committee within the Senate. But there are some tough realities about which the rest of us, properly representing our States and our citizens, need to talk. Those tough realities are the situations we face with respect to housing in the country. 
   The amendment I have offered redirects $288 million in funds needed to renew the existing section 8 contracts, and to use those funds to provide an additional 50,000 section 8 vouchers. I come after this as the ranking member of the authorizing committee with an understanding there are back-end costs. I know the Chair will say it is not just the 50,000 you put up today; there will be back-end costs. I will talk about that in a moment. I fully acknowledge that reality. 
   However, the amendment we offer is supported by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, by the National Alliance to End Homelessness, the National Housing Conference, the Catholic Charities USA, the Center for Community Change, the National Housing Law Project, and the National Association of Home Builders which call for an increase in section 8 vouchers. I also point out the statement of administration policy in their letter on this bill says they object to the committee's decision not to fund new incremental section 8 vouchers. 
   The President asked for 100,000 new vouchers. I think the President's request for 100,000 new vouchers represents the commitment we reinstituted last year to try to begin a process of recognizing what was happening to housing in the country. The fact is we now face an extraordinary and growing shortage of affordable housing for poor and working families in America. It seems to me, and to a lot of my colleagues, in the economic times we have in this country, when the stock market--though obviously it is up and down, and yesterday was down--is at its highest level, the economy has been remarkable in its sustained consecutive months of growth, unemployment is at a record low--we all know those statistics--in the middle of this remarkable growth, when ownership of homes is at a new and historic high, we are seeing the stock of affordable housing decline. Indeed, we now have a record number of families that face a housing crisis of some proportion. Nearly 5.6 million American families have what is called worst case housing needs. Yesterday, HUD released new data showing that number was added to by some 260,000 households in the past 2 years. We are talking about worst case needs, according to our own definition. 
   These families pay one half of their income in rent. I ask all of my colleagues to think about that. We have a pretty good salary and a lot of Members in the Senate have income from other sources and don't face some of the choices that a lot of our fellow citizens have, but one half of family income going to rent for these families is an unacceptable level by any of the standards or guidelines we offer. Increasingly, these families are working families. For them, the economic bump in the road that can result is a bump that brings shortages of food, utility cutoffs, and even evictions and homelessness. 
   This is illustrated by a study recently completed by the Institute for Children and Poverty which shows that homelessness is rising among working families. The study shows that in Newark, working families constitute 44 percent of the homeless families. Mr. President, 44 percent of homeless families are also working families. In Boston, I know we found a huge increase in the rental market. So there is increasing difficulty for working families with students to be able to find adequate housing. 
   I might add, it is not just in the short term that this presents us a problem, it is in the long term that it presents us a problem. We have 50,000 or 100,000 vouchers we are looking for, which will only take care of a fraction of the need or the demand. But it is help that is sorely needed, and it reflects the efforts of the Government to try to respond within the limits we face today.  I might add, this money is available. We are not taking it from somewhere else. We are taking it from unspent funds within HUD itself because of their lack of expenditure at this point in time. 
   Let me share with my colleagues one of the aspects of this problem on which a lot of people do not focus. Dr. Alan Meyers, who is a pediatrician at the Boston Medical Center, did a series of studies on the impact of high housing costs on child nutrition. In each case, he found that children of poor families receiving housing assistance were better nourished and in better health than similar families without such assistance. In a stark illustration of the choices the unassisted families face, he found children were most likely to be undernourished during the 90 days after the coldest month of the year, highlighting what he called the ``heat or eat dilemma.'' 
   In addition, let me underscore that lack of proper nourishment is only one problem that comes out of the housing crisis. The fact is, children who have a housing crisis are also forced to move from school to school. Social workers in Charlotte, NC, have told us about children they have seen going to as many as six different elementary schools in a single year. One expert estimated that as many as half the children in the Washington, DC, foster care system could be reunited with their parents if their families had access to stable housing. 
   So here we are in the Senate, arguing about changes in the welfare culture, arguing about schools that do not work, arguing about the need to have parents involved in families, and clearly one of the links that reunites parents with families and provides stability in the school system and capacity for children to stay out of trouble is available, affordable housing. It is an astonishing statistic, that half the children in Washington, DC, in the foster care system could actually be reunited with their parents if we had adequate housing available. 
   Some people will say to us that this costs a lot of money and is hard to do. There was a report that came out recently called ``Out Of Reach,'' which was done by the National Low-Income Housing Alliance. In my home State of Massachusetts, a person would have to work 100 hours every week at the minimum wage just to afford the typical rental on a two-bedroom apartment. It is even worse in a number of other cities where you need to work 135 hours a week or earn the equivalent of $17.42 hourly, more than three times the minimum wage, in order to afford to put a roof over your head. Massachusetts is not alone. Virginia, Maine, Maryland, Montana, New Hampshire, and other States are 
   feeling the economic crunch of the housing shortage and the impact on families as a consequence of that. 
   We also talk a lot around here about making work pay. The fact is, if people go to work and work according to all the rules but they have a work-week of 135 hours, or 100 hours, at a wage of $17, which is three times the minimum wage, we are obviously creating a gap that breaks faith with the capacity of the Government to provide value for that work. I think that is a serious issue. 
   In addition, let me point out, this is not an enormous request. I ask my colleagues to look at this chart. In 1978, we were putting out 350,000 housing units a year; in 1979, close to 350,000; in 1980, 200,000; 1981, about 200,000; and from 1981 through the entire 1980s we went through a dramatic drop in housing, and in 1984, with the passage of the Balanced Budget Act, we went through the most dramatic decrease in housing, and we have had zero increase in housing starts until last year when, thanks to the good efforts of the chairman of the committee and ranking member and others working on it, we were able to get the first year's increase in 50,000 initial, new vouchers for section 8 housing. 
   But that only tells one part of the story. My colleagues in the Senate--and I share this belief--understand we have a lot of budget problems. But we ought to be treating things fairly. Every time we have a crisis in the Senate, in the budget, whether it is a hurricane, whether it is a farm problem, whether it is some other issue of Government, where we need to find funding for some project, the piggy bank is housing. What we have seen over the last years is what I call the ``Great HUD-Way Robbery.'' 
   From 1995 until 1999, we have seen a year-by-year cut, or rescission, or diversion from housing. So it is not that housing was not originally on people's minds. It was not that we did not have an original sense that housing ought to be part of the budget process. But every time somebody wants to fund something else, they take it out of housing's hide. 
   The fact is, in 1995 we had $6.462 billion of rescissions; the next year, $114 million; the next year $3.8 billion; $3.03 billion the next year; $2 billion the next year. So we have had rescissions of $15.41 billion. We have had program cuts of $4.8 billion. So housing has lost $20 billion-plus in the course of the last years. 
   It is absolutely imperative that housing receive its fair share within this budget. In the final analysis, it is as critical a component of the social fabric and the social security of this country as almost anything else we do. We need to make work valuable. We need to ensure our citizens understand, if they play by the rules, it pays off. It is most important for our children and for a generation that are shunted from place to place, or separated from their parents, or taken from school to school to school. This is one of the things that contributes to juvenile violence, to the problems we have in our cities, people feeling disconnected--not just in the cities, also in rural communities--and I hope we will change it. 
   I look to our colleagues on the committee, who I know are committed to trying to do something, to hopefully share with us this sense that, even though in the conference ultimately there will be a negotiation--we all know that; ultimately there is going to be a showdown on what the final numbers are going to be--to guarantee, when that showdown comes, housing is not again going to be the piggy bank for everything else; it will be a priority at the forefront of our efforts and we will be able to continue the good work the chairman, I know, cares about, and the ranking member is equally committed about, that they began last year where they began to increase funds for housing. 
   Again, this is not a problem of their choice or their making. I know they share a belief this ought to be different. They were given the toughest budget figures of anybody in the Senate. That is why this is one of the last appropriations bills to be able to come to the floor. Everyone knows it only came to the floor by robbing Peter to pay Paul, by taking money from education and from the labor account in order to even make this possible. I hope we are going to change that trend in the next weeks. We certainly have that opportunity. I also believe we have that obligation and responsibility. 
   I know a couple of others of my colleagues wanted to say a few words. 
   Several Senators addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. A final, quick comment. I couldn't agree more with what the Senator from Missouri, the chairman, said about the problems of the budget. What we are asking today is, when we go into the final negotiations and the numbers that are being fought over as to what the allocations really will be, when we have an opportunity to perhaps make good on certain efforts, that this program, this effort of housing, will be at the forefront of those priorities. We understand the limitations of the current allocation, but most people are assuming we have an opportunity to change that. 
   Secondly, the Senator from Missouri is correct about the problem of building housing, but that will never resolve the current problem of low-income working families who are simply out of reach of affordable housing. I think everybody understands that section 8 and other affordable housing efforts within HUD are the key measures that try to lift people up when they play by the rules, go to work, do their best to try to get ahead, but simply can't afford to put one half of their entire earned income into rent, therefore, at the expense often of health care, of food, of adequate clothing, and of the other essentials of life. I think that is really what we are talking about. Even in the best of circumstances, if we start building housing today, there will still be millions of American families in that worst-case situation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Illinois for the substance of his comments, and also for his generous comments about my efforts and the efforts of the ranking member and others on this bill. 
   I thank each of our colleagues who have come to the floor--the Senator from Michigan, the Senator from Rhode Island, and others--each of whom have spoken very eloquently and very forcefully about the need to increase housing, and section 8 particularly. 
   All of us are very mindful of the particular predicament the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from Missouri have faced. We have said many things on the floor this morning about their commitment to this effort. I am particularly grateful to the Senator from Maryland for her statements a moment ago about the efforts they will make in the course of the conference. 
   After discussions with Secretary Cuomo, and discussions with the chairman and with the ranking member, we are convinced the best course at this point in time is to continue to respect what the ranking member said--that this is a working process--to do our best in the course of the next weeks to honor the efforts of those Senators on the floor today who have spoken about the need. I am convinced we can do that. 
   I think there is no purpose at this point in time in taking the Senate to a vote, given the assurance of those efforts by the administration and ranking member, and therefore I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted to withdraw the amendment at this time.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to one of the most inspirational and unifying individuals I have had the privilege of knowing and working with. Today, in Boston, people from all over Massachusetts are gathering to recognize and celebrate Lenny Zakim, Executive Director of the New England Regional Office of the Anti-Defamation League, and I rise today to join them in honoring this important friend. This evening's ceremony, though, has a purpose far deeper and broader than his notable leadership at the ADL. Tonight is a reflection of the love that has flowed from this man to the people of Boston, and now, it's flowing back to him as he confronts his own personal challenges. 
   For over 20 years, Lenny Zakim has courageously traveled the world, bringing a message of tolerance and respect. Through hundreds of meetings, conferences and visits to the countless places of worship, Lenny has turned racial and cultural divides into bonds amongst people and built bridges between communities. Mr. President, one of this country's greatest inspirational figures, Helen Keller, said in 1890, ``We could never learn to be brave and patient if there was only joy in the world,'' and I believe that this quote captures the values and goals that have guided Lenny Zakim's life. What Helen Keller was saying is that our true nature only surfaces when we are confronted with adversity, and, time and time again, Lenny has turned ignorance into enlightenment, crisis into opportunity, and hostility into support. 
   Groundbreaking collaborations with the Ten Point Coalition and Cardinal Bernard Law illuminate the often-overlooked common ground that we quietly cherish but celebrate together far too infrequently. His public meditations on subjects such as the Middle East, relationships between African Americans and Jews, and Judeo-Christian values in a modern world elevate our public dialogue and focus our attention on some of the most compelling issues of the day. On issues global he has worked with Hosni Mubarak, Menachem Begin, Yitzak Shamir, and Shimon Peres. I am fortunate to share his vision of a Middle East with a sustainable peace, a vision that he sculpted and shared with my predecessor, Paul Tsongas. 
   Beyond the global dimension of his work, perhaps his most expansive and wisest endeavors have been those with children and young adults. He is one of the founders of A World of Difference, an anti-bias education project that has had over 350,000 teachers participate in lessons that bring the lessons of tolerance and cooperation to classrooms for thousands of children every day. He also started Team Harmony, the nation's largest annual, interracial gathering of youth. Every year, thousands of young adults from Greater Boston come together and pledge to bigotry and celebrate their support of diversity and inclusion. These two programs will allow Lenny's vision of a peaceful and respectful world to reach far beyond those that he meets directly. I have witnessed firsthand how A World of Difference and Team Harmony will help build a better world for all our citizens. 
   Tonight's event will bring together Lenny's hundreds of friends and supporters to raise funds for the completion of the Zakim Center for Integrated Therapies at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Collectively, we thank Lenny for all of his work, and most importantly for what he has brought out in all of us and our communities.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the bill that I am sending to the desk is the Community Development and Venture Capital Act of 1999. I am pleased to share the introduction of this with Senators WELLSTONE, BINGAMAN, SARBANES, LEVIN, and CLELAND as cosponsors of it. This small business legislation is designed to promote economic development, business investment, productive wealth, and stable jobs in new markets. 
   It establishes a New Markets Venture Capital program that is part of President Clinton's New Markets Initiative that he mentioned in the ``State of the Union Address'' and promoted on a 4-day tour this summer. 
   New Markets are our country's low- and moderate-income communities where there is little to no sustained economic activity but many overlooked business opportunities. According to Michael Porter, a respected business analyst who has written extensively on competitiveness, ``..... inner  cities are the largest underserved market in America, with many tens of billions of dollars of unmet consumer and business demand.'' Many rural areas also contain low- and moderate-income communities. 
   Think of the inner-city areas of Boston's Roxbury or New York's East Harlem, or the rural desolation of Kentucky's Appalachia or Mississippi's Delta region. These are our neediest communities--urban and rural pockets that are so depleted that no internal resource exists to jump start the economy. These are places where there have been multi-generations of unemployment and abandoned commercial centers and main streets. 
   To get at this complex and deep-rooted economic problem, this legislation has three parts: a venture capital program to funnel investment money into our poorest communities, a program to expand the number of venture capital firms that are devoted to investing in such communities, and a mentoring program to link established, successful businesses with businesses and entrepreneurs in stagnant or deteriorating communities in order to facilitate the learning curve. 
   The center piece is the New Markets Venture Capital Program. Its purpose is to stimulate economic development through public-private partnerships that invest venture capital in smaller businesses that are located in impoverished rural and urban areas or that employ low-income people. 
   Both innovative and fiscally sound, this legislation creates a new venture capital program within the Small Business Administration that is built on two of the agency's most popular programs. It is financially structured similar to the Agency's successful Small Business Investment Company program, and incorporates a technical assistance component similar to that successfully used in SBA's microloan program. 
   However, unlike the SBIC program which focuses solely on small businesses with high-growth potential and claims successes such as Staples and Calloway Golf, the New Markets Venture Capital program will focus on smaller businesses that show promise of financial and social returns--what we call a ``double bottomline.'' These businesses tend to be higher risk, need longer periods to pay back money, need intensive, ongoing financial, management and marketing assistance, and have more modest prospects for return on investment than SBIC investments. For example, the returns on investments typically range from five to ten percent for community development venture capital funds versus SBIC's expected 20 to 30 percent rates of returns. 
   To balance out the equation, they also provide quality, stable jobs, create productive wealth in and among our neediest communities and need a smaller equity investment. Equity investments for community development investment funds will range from $50,000 to $300,000 versus the $300,000 to $5 million of typical deal sizes in the Agency's SBIC program. 
   Among other conditions, in order for an organization to be eligible to participate and approved as a New Markets Venture Capital company, it must have a management team with experience in community development financing or venture capital financing, be able to raise at least $5 million of non-SBA money for debentures, and raise matching funds for SBA's technical assistance grants. 
   Community development venture capitalists, we should be reminded, use all the discipline of traditional venture capitalists. 
   At the Small Business Committee roundtable we held in May on the Agency's SBIC program and other venture capital proposals, community development venture capital groups from Massachusetts to Minnesota to Kentucky talked about profit. Like traditional venture capital funds, community development funds have to make prudent investments to earn profits in order to attract and keep investors. But they balance that with social objectives. One of the most important social goals for Boston Community Venture Fund is job creation and job quality. 
   Elyse Cherry, who is President of the Boston Community Venture Fund, invited me, former Treasury Secretary Robert E. Rubin and former Congressman Joseph P. Kennedy II and others to tour a company her Fund invested in called City Fresh Foods. Located in Roxbury, one of Boston's neediest neighborhoods, Glynn and Sheldon Lloyd started a company that manufactures prepares African-American and Hispanic meals for the community and corporate clients. And through the Meals-on-Wheels program, this company serves the elderly in Roxbury and Dorchester districts. In addition to providing a needed service, City Fresh Foods has created 20 jobs, hires from the community, pays its employees from $8 to $16 per hour, and offers training and opportunity for them to move from entry-level jobs to supervisory positions. 
   There are more success stories like this around the country. The Community Development Venture Capital funds across the country have a proven track record in making smart, responsible investments in small businesses in their communities, but the capital needs of firms in economically distressed areas far outweigh the existing capacity of these organizations. Compared to the more than 1,143 traditional and SBIC venture capital firms in the U.S., only some 40 funds nationwide concentrate on investing in companies that show promise of financial and social returns. We simply need more community development venture capital funds to reach more of these underserved communities. 
   The second component of this bill, the ``Community Development Venture Capital Assistance Program,'' recognizes that need and is designed to increase the number and expertise of community development venture capital funds, such as New Markets Venture Capital companies, around the country. A Community Development Venture Capital organization has a primary mission of promoting community development in low-income communities through investment in private businesses. 
   Senator WELLSTONE has carried the water on community development venture capital concept and deserves special credit for educating the Small Business Committee about this important economic development tool. He introduced this initiative in March. It is virtually identical to the bill he introduced in the last Congress and passed the full Senate as part of a comprehensive small business bill, H.R. 3412. 
   First, the Community Development Venture Capital Assistance program would authorize $15 million for SBA grants to private, nonprofit organizations with expertise in making venture capital investments in poor communities. These organizations would use these grants to provide hands-on technical assistance to spawn and develop new and emerging CDVC or NMVC companies. The intermediary organizations would match the grants dollar-for-dollar with non-Federal sources. 
   Second, this program would provide $5 million in SBA grants to colleges, universities, and other firms or organizations--public or private--to create and operate training and intern programs, organize a national conference, and fund academic research and studies dealing with community development venture capital. 
   Finally, to complement the venture capital investments and the program to foster the emergence and growth of more community development venture capital companies, this legislation would build on the BusinessLINC grant program. Already a successful public-private partnership that the SBA and Department of Treasury launched last June, it encourages larger businesses to mentor smaller businesses, enhancing the economic vitality and competitive capacity of small businesses located in the targeted areas. This Act will authorize $3 million a year to further promote and expand this program. 
   It's easy to stare past the broken inner cities and boarded up rural towns to the intrigues and fantasies of a booming Wall Street, flourishing suburbs and record-low national unemployment. But as we trumpet the successes of our economy, we must be smart and leverage that prosperity to jumpstart and strengthen our communities that are struggling. This legislation aims to do just that.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the current situation in East Timor is spiraling dangerously out of control. Members of the international community are meeting to discuss this issue in New Zealand as I speak, while violence is escalating in East Timor and uncertainty is rising in the minds of many about the future of Indonesia as a whole. Indonesia's strategic position in South East Asia, as well as its economic and political stability, are of utmost importance, not only to the United States, but to the international community which has an interest in securing a stable and democratic future for South East Asia and a lasting peace for East Timor. 
   The Indonesian government holds the primary responsibility for restoring peace and stability to East Timor. I concur wholeheartedly with U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan that the Indonesian government has so far failed to take adequate steps towards that end. The Indonesian government must move immediately to restore the portion of its credibility that was lost for not preparing adequately for the onslaught of civil strife that was predicted after the August 30 vote. The government must reign in the military factions, disarm the militias, restore law and order on the ground in East Timor, and provide for humanitarian assistance to the thousands of East Timorese who have been displaced from their homes and are fleeing the region. If it cannot, or is unwilling to, then the Indonesian government must accept the international community's offer to send in a peacekeeping force. 
   To his credit, President Habibie took an important step forward by allowing East Timor's political future to be decided democratically. It truly was significant that for the first time in twenty four years, the Indonesian government made a ballot in East Timor possible. I have long believed that the government should take this action and I have supported numerous pieces of legislation urging the Indonesian government to that effect. However, the Habibie government, once having made the decision to hold a consultation on the future status of East Timor, assumed responsibility for the security of its people during and after the ballot was held. 
   The international community was watching closely as the May 5, 1999 agreement detailing how the ballot was to be conducted--was signed by the governments of Indonesia and Portugal and the U.N. This agreement held great promise that the future of East Timor could be determined peacefully. However, anti-independence militia leaders refused to sign and refused to disarm, vowing to oppose violently any steps to give the East Timorese their independence. The militia groups have followed  through on their commitments, regrettably. The Indonesian government, I fear, has not. 
   The Indonesian government, in no uncertain terms, has the responsibility to curb the violence now and work to create a peaceful atmosphere so that the results of the ballot can be implemented. It must also protect the humanitarian missions that remain in East Timor and secure the safe passage of humanitarian aid to the region. No reasonable justification exists for the Indonesian military cutting off the water supply and electricity inside the U.N. Compound. That only leaves us with the question, who is really calling the shots? 
   Indeed, the history of the Indonesian military is far too bleak to have given it free reign to operate under martial law. We have already seen evidence of the military directly firing on civilians, forcibly removing them from their homes, or just turning a blind eye to the havoc being unleashed on them by the paramilitary forces. I do not believe that martial law--which establishes curfews, enables the military to shoot violators of the curfews on sight, and provides for unwarranted searches--is the step that the Indonesian government should have taken if it wanted to stop the violence and re-establish credibility for itself in the international community. 
   Martial law has only succeeded in unleashing more violence and greater terror. It is especially problematic since many members of the Indonesian military remain inextricably linked to the militia forces or have joined radical military splinter groups. 
   I do not believe that the Indonesian government has taken adequate steps, if any at all, to disassociate itself from the civilian militias and to dismantle and disarm them when it became apparent that these groups would not work to bring peace to the region. The human rights abuses they have committed over the years was only a prologue to the devastation they are orchestrating today. The alarm bells were ringing months ago, but was anyone listening? 
   The Indonesian military's direct involvement in committing human rights abuses and perpetuating violence in Indonesia led me to support a restriction on U.S. arms sales and International Military Education Training (IMET) aid to Indonesia, which Congress initiated in 1993. I believe it is crucial to suspend all of the remaining U.S. military contacts with the Indonesian armed forces and all arms sales to Indonesia. 
   The outcome of this crisis will have implications not only for East Timor but for Indonesia as a whole. We need to be responsive to the crisis in East Timor, but we must carefully consider the implications of any action on the larger political, economic and social climate in Indonesia. 
   I believe it is vital for the Indonesian government to accept the international community's offer to send an international peacekeeping force to East Timor and that force must be robust, with the capacity to restore law and order on the ground. The U.S. must continue to work with its allies in the region in order to urge the Indonesian government to invite this force in. I am pleased that the Australian government has taken the lead in this effort by offering up to 7,000 peacekeepers to operate in such a force and has sent war ships to the waters off East Timor as a message to the Indonesian government that the global community is serious. 
   The East Timor crisis will be, and indeed should be, the top priority for discussion at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Forum this weekend. There is no issue of greater importance to the region at the moment. I believe that the U.S. must play a strong role in coordinating the efforts of all APEC nations in order to formulate a strong, multilateral response to the crisis. All members of APEC have a direct interest in preventing the further escalation of violence and political instability. 
   I urge the Administration to continue to work aggressively with APEC nations to make it clear to the Indonesian government that the clock is ticking on a resolution of this issue. In addition to the diplomatic efforts, we must take some steps to demonstrate our own disapproval of the government's response to the situation to date. I support the Administration's decision to cease our direct military-to-military contacts with Indonesia. I believe we also should offer to send humanitarian aid to both East Timor and governments in the region that accept refugees. There are other steps that we can take as well. 
   That is why I have joined my colleague Senator RUSS FEINGOLD in introducing a bill to suspend international financial assistance to Indonesia pending resolution of the crisis in East Timor. Specifically, this bill would suspend the remaining U.S. military assistance to Indonesia, require the United States to oppose the extension of financial support to Indonesia by international financial institutions such as the IMF, and require Congressional approval before any FY 2000 bilateral assistance to Indonesia may be allocated. I see the introduction of this bill as a way to send a signal--not only to President Habibie, but to all of the players in Jakarta--that we regard this issue very seriously. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to talk about East Timor and I yield the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President I thank the distinguished ranking member. I share the affection and feeling expressed by the Senator from Montana, about how much we will miss the remarkable insightfulness and stewardship of the Senator from New York. 
   Let me also associate myself with his praise of the Senator from Montana. That was a very thoughtful and very honest statement about what has happened in the Senate. I haven't been here quite as long as the Senator from Montana. I have been here 15 years. But I have never seen this body as polarized, as personalized, and as partisan as it is at this moment. I think it is very dangerous. It is dangerous for the country; divisive and difficult for the institution itself. I find it very hard, frankly, to understand. 
   I guess I can understand it in macro terms. I find it hard to understand in the context of why we all run for the Senate and what we are in politics to try to achieve. There is something more than just winning elections. There are some people around here who do not believe that, but I am convinced the American people believe that. Indeed, I think an adherence to that notion is what has made us different from other countries, and the best moments of the Senate have been when we have tried to adhere to that notion. 
   This is not a bill. This is not a tax bill. This is a political statement, a raw, fundamental, basic political statement. The statement is essentially one that seeks to say: Democrats want to spend money. Republicans want to give you back your money. That is the political statement. But it is not real when you look underneath it 
   because the Republicans will join in September and October in spending the money because none of them are going to go back and tell the citizens of their State they are going to cut veterans hospitals, they are going to cut the Coast Guard, they are going to cut the FBI, and a host of other programs. None of them are going to do that. They are positioning themselves to say to their electorate: Gee, Clinton made me do it, but I wanted to give you back your money, even though the money wasn't there to give back. 
   It is one of the great posturings and one of the great frauds of recent time from the very people who brought you Gramm-Rudman that fell on its face, the very people who built the great deficits of the early 1980s when they adopted the Stockman philosophy of how to create crisis in Government and undo Government itself, the very people who predicted in 1993 that if we passed the 1993 Deficit Reduction Act there would be economic chaos, unemployment lines, massive economic failure. 
   The results are, here we are today with the best economy we have ever had in this country, with unemployment at record low rates, with the stock market at high rates, with the greatest sustained period of growth, and the very same people who brought you those three great failures are now trying to sell this snake oil to the American people. 
   Let's look at it as a political statement. That is what it is. It is a political statement. It is a political statement in which they are prepared to take the House tax bill that was worse than the Senate bill and bring most of it back so that their political statement is: 60 percent of American taxpayers get 14 percent of the tax break that won't happen. On the other hand, their political belief is that the top 10 percent of income earners in America ought to get 47.6 percent of the benefits of their tax statement that won't happen. So they can run around and say: Gee, we tried to service those who service us the best in the process of campaign financing. But the reality is, it is just a political statement. 
   The conference report remarkably delays the Senate's marriage penalty tax relief for earned-income tax recipients. I cannot tell you how many times we heard people on the other side of the aisle saying: Oh, my God, marriage is being destroyed in America; we have a disincentive for marriage, particularly among the poor in this country. 
   We heard it all through the welfare debate. We heard it from the Republicans year after year. Many of us say we ought to get rid of the marriage penalty. We voted to get rid of the marriage penalty, but they come back and delay for working people the capacity to get rid of the marriage penalty. In exchange for delaying getting rid of the marriage penalty, what do they think is more important?

   Mr. KERRY. They eliminate the alternative minimum tax that guarantees that the wealthiest of Americans will pay some kind of tax. So they trade off: Don't give the marriage penalty to the working poor, but give the wealthiest of Americans an exemption from the alternative minimum tax that guarantees fairness. 
   That is not all they do. They wipe away the tax relief for child care. They dropped the Senate provision. They provide additional capital gains tax relief for investors, but they provide no tax relief to the people who pay most of their taxes through the payroll tax in America, which is the vast majority of Americans. 
   There are many other egregious transfers to the wealthy at the expense of the average American. So let's take this as the political statement it is. It is a political statement that makes clear the priorities of their party, and it makes clear that they are prepared to even risk the high-technology boom we have been through, because when you give a tax cut of this level without sufficient money to pay for it at a time when the economy is doing well, as Alan Greenspan and countless Nobel laureates and economists have said: You are going to reduce capital formation and increase interest rate costs and, in effect, may even reverse some of the plus side that has given us this option. 
   It is a political statement that I think ultimately will come back to haunt them because Americans know better. There is no American in this country who does not appreciate the vast commitment we have had to children, to education, to higher education, to technology creation, transfers, to a host of things which make this country what it is: a better country and, in fact, an extraordinary country measured against all the other nations of the world in today's economy. I do not think we should put it at risk, and I hope colleagues will join in rejecting this political statement and in rejecting this irresponsible direction they seem prepared to adopt. 
   I thank my friend for the time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support this bill. A little more than a year ago, SBA Administrator Aida Alvarez formed a task force to study the needs of veterans with a talent, skill, dream or need to start their own business. I commend the Administrator for her initiative. And thanks to the quick and earnest work of the task force representatives, particularly the Veterans Service Organizations and advocacy groups, a report was drafted in three short months. 
   H.R. 1568 gives life to many of the 21 report recommendations. Appropriately, it includes S. 918, the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999--the fourteenth report recommendation--that I introduced on March 29th and the full Senate passed by unanimous consent last week, on July 27th. Reservists have been asking for this safety net since 1991 to keep their businesses going while they are called to active duty. I am glad that we will again put this bill one step closer to enactment for the men and women who--whether deployed in Iraq, Bosnia or Kosovo--could benefit from the provisions of this bill now. 
   These provisions should already be available for those who need it, and I deeply regret that it wasn't enacted earlier, either as S. 918 or as part of this bill, H.R. 1568. The nature of the provisions are uncontroversial. As S. 918, it passed the Committee on Small Business June 9th, almost 60 days ago, by unanimous consent and has 51 Senators co-sponsors--21 Republicans and 30 Democrats. Since then, it has also passed the full House and the Senate Committee on Small Business as part of this bill before us tonight, H.R. 1568. 
   As much as I am frustrated by the delay, it probably doesn't compare to that of reservists who are on active duty and losing sleep over how they are going to keep their businesses going and avoid ruining their credit records. Ask the truck driver who serves in the Missouri National Air Guard and reported to active duty more than four months ago. He bought a new rig shortly before being called up and has hefty monthly payments to meet. He lined up a replacement to drive his truck while he was gone to keep money coming in, but the driver backed out of the agreement right before the reservist was to leave. 
   He tried to do the right thing--to implement a contingent plan--and yet something beyond his control interfered. It's hard to keep your customers happy when their merchandise isn't getting delivered. And it's even harder to make your loan payments when you're not bringing in enough money. 
   Or ask the reservist from Oklahoma who has supported his wife and four children for the past five years with a carpet and upholstery business. In 1998, he was called up for eight months, and he's been active this year since May 8th. What made it particularly damaging for his business this year was that he was called up at the beginning of the industry's high season. January to April are slow times, and April to December are the money-making months. He called my office a month ago to find out about this bill and find out how he could get assistance. 
   Though this bill was still waiting for action by the full Senate, we put him in contact with the SBA office in Oklahoma City to find some way to help. After reviewing his options and what it would take to resuscitate his business, he called to say that he was closing shop for good: ``I'm just going to close my business down. I'm not going to try to get a small business loan. I want to cut my losses now.......'' 
   I look forward to spreading the message that reservists, such as this man from Oklahoma, will soon be able to apply for loan deferrals, reductions on interest rates, low-interest disaster loans, and get training assistance for  the employee or family left behind to run their businesses. 
   Importantly, this bill goes further, making more comprehensive changes for all veterans. Incorporating other recommendations that are designed to help service-disabled veterans and veteran form and expand small businesses, H.R. 1568-- 
   Elevates the SBA's Office of Veterans Affairs so that it has more credibility and visibility. 
   Creates a federally chartered corporation to facilitate technical and management assistance to veteran entrepreneurs. 
   Establishes a three-percent procurement goal for service-disabled veteran-owned businesses. 
   Requires the Federal Procurement Data System to collect data on the percentage and dollar value of prime contracts and subcontracts awarded to small businesses owned and controlled by veterans and service-disabled veterans. 
   According to the SBA and the Department of Veterans Administration, out of the estimated 22 million veterans in this country, 4 million own their own businesses. I encourage the SBA and the veterans groups to use these tools to make real progress in expanding and strengthening small businesses owned by veterans and service-disabled veterans so that they can have the dignity and financial benefits of self-sufficiency. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for supporting veterans and small business. It's one vote that will help thousands.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me share with my colleagues what this is. Under the Balanced Budget Act, we set out to save some $103 billion in Medicare expenditures with respect to hospitals, home care, et cetera. The problem is the unintended consequences of the way that has happened, coupled with the managed care process, in fact, about $205 billion in Medicare payments has been reduced. The result is that, in hospitals, home care facilities, and nursing homes all across the country, all of our States are significantly affected in the quality of care that is being delivered. 
   Special care units in hospitals are closing. Home care facilities are refusing patients. There has been a significant reduction in the quality of care across the country. Our teaching hospitals are threatened. What we are saying is that we need to reserve some $20 billion in order to be able to adequately make up for the unintended  consequences of the Balanced Budget Act.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished ranking member. 
   Mr. President, I appreciate the hard work and the thinking that went into the so-called centrist approach. I would like to associate myself with that thinking and with the reasonableness that I think guides most of their actions. 
   But may I say, respectfully, that something is in the air in Washington that I think is clouding people's thinking a little bit, about where we are on this whole tax bill. 
   I am all for giving a tax cut when you have the money to give as a tax cut. But everybody here understands  some plain truths. Notwithstanding those plain truths, the Senate has in front of it a $792 billion tax cut. 
   A moment ago we were talking about a $500 billion tax cut. The fact is that most of the analysis that is reasonable, dispassionate--and certainly not pie-in-the-sky sort of dreaming about the future--suggests we have nothing near a $1 trillion, let alone $3 trillion, surplus. 
   Everyone here has accepted the fact that $2 trillion is going to go to pay down the debt and protect Social Security, and, indeed, a little bit for Medicare, hopefully. But that set aside, whatever prospect there is for a surplus is outside of that $2 trillion. The problem is that the hard reality already tells us an entirely different story from that which Senators are acting on in voting on the size of the tax cut on which we are voting. 
   We are already breaking the caps. There are appropriations bills that everybody knows are being marked up in a fictitious manner with an understanding that come September or October there is going to be an agreement to change the caps because you cannot meet the appropriations bills without changing the caps. 
   We are already $30 billion-some over the caps. We are doing it with the fiction of emergency spending. We are calling the census an emergency spending. 
   Everybody knows these games are being played right now. Nevertheless, the Senate is poised to act on this fictitious surplus. 
   I do not know one Senator who has gone back to their constituents and said: We're going to cut veterans' benefits. We're going to cut highways. We're going to cut border guards. We're going to cut drug fighting. We're going to cut the Coast Guard. Nobody is saying we are going to cut these things. But the absolute inescapable reality of this budget is that unless you increase the spending of discretionary by something reflecting inflation, you are going to cut. 
   I heard the Senator from Indiana say: What is it that says we're going to go out into the future increasing these budget accounts by inflation? The fact is, we have done it every year. We do it. That is what happens. It gets more expensive. 
   The Government isn't somehow exempt from the inflation figures and factors to which the rest of the economy is subject. Prices go up. Costs of contracts for the Government go up. Fuel costs go up. Insurance--whatever it is. The fact is, we already know what is happening to medical costs in the country. Yet everyone knows we are not sufficiently laying out the amount of money that it is going to cost the Government to do its business. Not withstanding that, we are poised to carve out, to fix in concrete a measure of give-back that predicates that if you go down that road and you freeze Government at the level that the figures are based on, you are going to have a 38-percent cut, or so, in all of the discretionary budget. 
   Tell me the year in which we have not increased defense spending. Tell me the year, particularly, that the majority party has not set out, as a goal, to increase defense spending. But they did not even figure that into the level of spending that we have here. 
   This is the reality. If you keep the current accounts at their current level, plus inflation--and no one here has said to America they are going to reduce those accounts all across the board by X percentage--you are going to spend an additional $595 billion. So you have to subtract that $595 billion from the so-called $1 trillion that has been set aside from the $3 trillion because we are protecting Social Security with $2 trillion. 
   That leaves about $400 billion. But every year we have had an average of $80 billion of emergencies. Are people suggesting there are going to be no emergencies next year, even though every year we have had a budget there has been an emergency expenditure? Just taking the average of $80 billion, you will have an absolute, predictable additional $31 billion in Social Security Administration costs. Those aren't counted into the Republican bill. You will have absolutely $178 billion of additional interest rates because of the money you are not paying down on the debt. You will have to pay that interest. That is not calculated. That is an additional $178 billion. That leaves us conceivably with this little red block, not a trillion dollars, but this little red block, which might amount to $112 billion or so, depending on what we do for prescription drugs, for Medicare, and a lot of other issues facing America. 
   The real choice in front of the Senate is considerably different than the fiction we are being fed. I heard the distinguished ranking member yesterday talk about the reality that we lived through in the 1980s, the creation of fiscal crisis as a means of achieving ideological and political goals. I respectfully suggest that what we are looking at is a form of Stockman 2. That is what is going on. This is Stockman 2. We are going to come in with a tax cut that has no money, that isn't predictable, and we are going to create a new crisis in our Government, where we are going to face a whole set of choices that a lot of people here will love because we know they hate those particular expenditures. But they are expenditures that time and again, year in and year out, our fellow citizens have said they want us to make. And time and again, the Congress, when it has had that great clash with the President, has capitulated and made them. 
   So this is a remarkable new kind of thinking, where if one big mistake is a mistake, we are going to come in and say we will make it a lesser mistake, but it is still somehow better thinking. So instead of $791 billion, some people would argue we ought to do 500 or 300. The fact is, all of those figures are out of sync with the reality of what we have in front of us. 
   We don't even show a real budget surplus until the year 2006. In the year 2006, assuming that you have spending plus some little measure of inflation, the way we have traditionally, you have only $29 billion of surplus by the year 2006. That is the hard reality. 
   I hear my colleagues come to the floor and say: We have the highest measure of taxation against our gross domestic product that we have ever had. What they don't tell you is the reason it is so high is because so many people are cashing in on their capital gains. We lowered the capital gains tax. They don't tell you the capital gains tax isn't even counted in the measure of the gross domestic product. So you have a completely artificial set of numbers, when they come in and tell you the tax rate is up. 
   That is the way it is supposed to work. That is why we have a progressive tax structure. When the economy does brilliantly, you are supposed to get a little more money into the Government so that you have the ability to do the things that are important for the long-term of our country. 
   Recently, I had the pleasure of meeting with a number of high-tech presidents. And to a person, these people, who are fueling the engine of our productivity growth in America and creating the high value-added jobs, will tell you they need an America that has a citizenry that is educated and capable, that depends on investment. You don't measure the debt of this country by the figures that show up on debt. You measure the debt of this country by the people who can't access those high value-added jobs, who don't have child care and the ability to live with clean water and clean air and so forth. 
   Mr. President, I think we are measuring things backwards, wrong. I think we are on a very dangerous track which will have long-term implications for the full measure of the citizens of our country. I express that concern as we come, sometime, to a vote on this issue.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise also in support of the amendment of the Senator from New Mexico. It is a smart amendment. It invests in the future of our country by making certain that, at a time when our schools all across the Nation do not have the resources necessary to prepare students for the future, we will do so as a matter of priority. 
   I must say I was struck by the Senator from Arkansas a moment ago. He said this benefits not the wealthy but, rather, it benefits 61 percent of the people in his State. He was only pointing to one component of the program; that is, the lowering of the tax bracket from I think 15 percent to 14 percent. That is about a $150 billion part of the $791 billion. 
   But when you add in the other parts of the $791 billion, here is exactly what happens. In the whole tax package the Republicans are giving, the lowest 20 percent of income earners in America will get $22, the second 20 percent will get $120, the middle 20 percent will get $276, and the top 1 percent gets $22,964. The next 4 percent gets $3,400, and the next 15 percent gets $1,500. You have to be in the upper-income brackets to get the larger amount. 
   The Republicans will always come to the floor and say, Gee, Democrat Senator, did you just wake up to the fact that that is how it works? If you earn more money, you get more money? If you are a bigger taxpayer, you get more money back? 
   I understand that. I understand basic mathematics. But basic fairness, basic decency, dictates if you are really trying to help the lower-income person, you set the figures of the tax break so the person with the smaller income gets the bigger amount. 
   Why is it that the lowest 20 percent doesn't get $100 and the top 1 percent gets maybe $1,000 back? It is because that is the way they rigged the bill. That is the difference in approach and philosophy. It is a difference that fundamentally divides us. 
   Let me speak for a moment, if I may, to an issue in one of the amendments that will be coming up very shortly, but we will not have time to do full measure on it, and that is the question  of where we are with respect to Medicare. There is an amendment Senators ROCKEFELLER, MIKULSKI, I, and others have introduced to ask the Finance Committee to go back and set aside $20 billion, about 3 percent of the total size of the tax cut, in order to guarantee that we will undo the damage the Balanced Budget Act is currently doing to America's health care system. Today, despite the fact that we have a remarkable economy, there are 43 million individuals in our Nation who do not have health insurance--1 out of every 6 Americans. Experts anticipate that is going to increase by 1.5 million per year. 
   For the uninsured, academic health centers, the teaching hospitals of our country, have created an enormous safety net. Teaching hospitals have stood by to ensure there is care available to everyone in our country when it is absolutely needed. Today, at a time when teaching hospitals are more important than ever before, the combination of cost containment measures imposed by managed care and the effects of the Balanced Budget Act in reducing Medicare payments has literally made the future of our Nation's academic medical centers unclear. 
   I would like my colleagues to think about the impact of what is happening today because of the reduction of Medicare reimbursements. At the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta, the training facility for the State university system's medical school, officials are now raising room fees by an average of 28 percent and they are increasing the cost of lab tests and other services by 10 percent. 
   In Tennessee, Vanderbilt University recently decided it can no longer accept Medicare patients from outside the State. 
   In March, Massachusetts General Hospital eliminated 130 positions and raised prices. 
   In New York City, which has the Nation's largest concentration of teaching hospitals, city hospitals have cut their staffs by 10 percent since 1993. 
   In California, Medicare cuts are largely to blame for the loss of over 1,250 jobs at the USFF, Stanford Health Care Network. 
   In May, the University of Pennsylvania health system announced it was going to lay off 450 people, 9 percent of its total health care workforce. 
   Detroit's hospitals have eliminated 4,500 jobs since January, but as my colleagues will tell you, the problems associated with the Balanced Budget Act are not unique to hospitals. In Massachusetts, as of mid-June, 20 home health care agencies have closed since late 1997. 
   The administration may be busy sort of brushing off some of this as the simple corrections of market inefficiencies, but I could not disagree more, and I think many of my colleagues would disagree with that. 
   I do not direct my colleagues' attention to statistics to debate the bottom line for health care providers. This has never been a debate about the interest of hospitals or nursing homes. It is a debate about the fact that if we do not act, we will further reduce the access to quality care so critical for our Nation's elderly, our Nation's poor, and our Nation's rural communities. It means something to real people. In Massachusetts alone, in South Shore, in the last 2 years the South Shore Hospital has had to lay off close to 50 of their visiting nurses. They have had to close their satellite offices, and their budget is more than 40 percent less than they require just to meet the needs of elderly and disabled patients. Who suffers as a result of that? 
   Let me share with you a real elderly couple, a man and a woman with heart disease, lung disease, asthma, and hypertension. The wife of this gentleman has heart disease. They are 89 and 90 years old, and one of their greatest hopes has been to live together in the home they saved for years to buy, living as independently as they can in old age. They have been able to do it with the help of a visiting nurse from the South Shore Hospital. But now that is gone. Now, because the services are being cut because the Medicare reimbursements are so low, the impact is that those people can no longer continue to do it. 
   I recently received a letter from another constituent named Harlan Smith. He says the following:  
   Dear Senator KERRY: My 80-year-old father was discharged from my hospital to his home Friday afternoon, and we are meeting with home health care nurses and physical therapists today to plan a strategy for my 80-year-old mother and us to manage him at home. This is ironic since the cuts from the Balanced Budget Act have caused my hospital to cut services to the point where my mother and family now have to hire the required help privately.  
   They cannot afford it. 
   These days, that story is repeated in countless communities across the country. When the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 passed, the Congressional Budget Office projected the 335 provisions of the law were going to cut Medicare payments by $103 billion over 5 years. But today, CBO estimates that Medicare spending is going to drop $205 billion--a 100-percent increase above what the expectations were supposed to be. 
   The projected net on-budget surplus for fiscal years 1998 through 2002 is $100 billion. You are seeing the surplus we will have in the country is basically going to come out of the hides of elderly infirm patients, people who cannot afford it, hospitals that are being forced to close, and medical care that is being reduced. 
   When the Balanced Budget Act passed, total Medicare spending inflation was expected to drop from almost 10 percent in 1997 to approximately 5 percent in the outyears. But in April, the Treasury Department reported that total Medicare spending in the first half of the year had fallen by over 2 percent. 
   In 1999 alone, the BBA was projected to cut Medicare spending by less than $16 billion. Instead, we anticipate Medicare spending is going to fall by $38 billion in 1999--$22 billion more than was expected. Medicare hospital spending is plummeting, and the quality of care is plummeting with it. 
   When the Balanced Budget Act passed, CBO had projected a 2.5-percent increase in part A spending, hospital insurance, for 
   1999. But actually, spending fell almost 5 percent during the first half of the year, and the impact on hospitals is clear. 
   Total hospital Medicare margins are expected to decline from 4.3 percent in 1997 to only 0.1 percent this year. We have a fundamental crisis. I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, as we are busy giving back this tax money, we need to consider the impact on our hospitals, on health care, on home health care, and rural communities. I beg my colleagues to try to find the money that is going to save us from the loss of the crown jewels of the American health care system--our teaching hospitals.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, I have listened with interest to the debate for some time now, and I listened with great interest to the Senator from Idaho. After listening to the Senator from Idaho, I really believe the fundamental confrontation here was not addressed by the Senator in his comments. He made a lot of references to the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior and to the decision that he alleges was made in the dead of night and that we should not rush forward with a sudden decision by a bureaucrat to change the how we regulate mining on public lands and the relationship between mining companies and the Bureau of Land Management and the Congress. 
   Let's try to deal with facts. Let's try to deal with the reality of the situation rather than obfuscating and avoiding the confrontation that has been going on in the Congress for a long period of time. 
   This is not something that is happening just at the whim of a bureaucrat. This is not something that is happening this year, now, suddenly for the first time. There has been a 10-year effort to try to change how we regulate mining in this country, and every time we get close to accomplishing that, some argument or another is used to try to avoid making the right choice--the choice that is part of the original law itself on which all of this is based. 
   That law is the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 by which the BLM published its current regulations in 1980. Those regulations are required under the law. It is the law of the land that the Secretary of the Interior must take any action necessary, by regulation or otherwise, to prevent unnecessary or undue degradation of public lands. That is the law. 
   The Secretary is required to take action to prevent undue or unnecessary degradation of the public lands. We have been debating in the Congress, as long as I have been here, the level of degradation that is taking place, and its impacts, as a result of the hard rock mining. 
   The BLM published regulations in 1980. They became effective in 1981. That was the first attempt of the BLM to try to provide some kind of effective management ever since the mining law of 1872. A review was supposed to take place 3 years later. That review never took place. But in 1989 a task force was created, and a rulemaking was begun in the Bush administration to consider amendments of the 3809 regulations. The fact is, there was a failure to enact that. Why? Specifically, to give Congress the opportunity to develop its own reform and pass it. 
   Contrary to what the Senator from Idaho said about secret, last-minute meetings, the fact is that in the 103rd Congress Senator Bumpers introduced  legislation. Representative NICK RAHALL of West Virginia introduced legislation, and the House passed his legislation by 316-108. One of the major concerns of those who opposed the measure was that it included an 8-percent royalty on net smelter returns, which would have, according to the arguments of some, and I suspect that includes Western Senators and Representatives, made some mines uneconomic. 
   So we go back to 1993 when legislation was introduced that would have instituted the very royalties that we were just heard the opponents of the Murray amendment tell us they would accept. But they fought the royalties, and they fought the bill, and the bill died. 
   Two less comprehensive and almost identical bills were introduced in April of 1993. In those, patents were to continue to be an option, but patent fees were going to reflect the fair market value of the surface estates. A 2-percent net value mine mouth royalty was going to be imposed. In the Senate that year, there was an industry-backed bill. That was passed by the Senate in May of 1993, but once again it was stopped dead because the House and Senate conferees could not bridge the gap between the industry-backed legislation and the environmentally-backed legislation. It died. 
   In the 104th Congress the Mineral Exploration and Development Act of 1995 was introduced by, again, Representative Rahall and others to overhaul the mining law. That was almost identical to the bill the House passed in the 103rd Congress. 
   Three mining reform bills were introduced in the Senate. One was introduced by Senator CRAIG. It was supported by the mining industry. Another was introduced by Senator Bumpers. The one introduced by Senator CRAIG more closely resembled the Rahall bill. The bill Senator Bumpers introduced was supported by most of the environmental and conservation community. And a third bill was introduced by Senators Johnston and CAMPBELL that resembled a later 
   version of what then-Chairman Johnston incorporated into the conference debate. 
   But again no further action was taken. Why? Because once again the industry refused to accept some of the provisions that included to protect the land adequately, including clean up, holding sufficient bonding, do the things necessary which the Senator from Nevada has offered to do on the floor tonight. But there is a long legislative history of the opponents of the amendment refusing to do that. That is why the Bureau of Land Management has finally come to the point of saying we have to do something. And what they are doing is justified. 
   Since 1980, the gold mining industry in the United States has undergone a 10-fold expansion. I know it is now on facing many challenges as the world market for gold has pushed prices down, but nevertheless, it has grown substantially over the past two decades. Many of those gold mines are located on the public lands that we are suppose to be protecting. Much of this increased production comes from the fact that, as a result of new discoveries and technologies, you can mine ore of a much lower grade. Mine operations are able to move millions of tons of material and move it around the landscape to produce just ounces of gold. The new techniques use cyanide and other toxic chemicals for processing. 
   In short, even though I agree that we are more environmentally concern today than in years past, the fact is that today's mines have an even greater capacity to cause environmentally negative impacts. We did not hear the Senator from Idaho talk about how we are going to ensure that these mine clean up. Of course, there is an economic impact in trying to clean up a mine. But, I respectively as my colleagues that they don't come to the floor of the Senate and start complaining that suddenly a bureaucrat is coming in the dead of night to do what we have been fighting to do for 10 years in the Senate, and what I think most people understand is a huge struggle between those who want to protect the lands adequately and those who want to continue the practices that are endangering them. 
   The fact is--and this is a fact--this provision is simply the latest addition in a series of riders that have prevented the Clinton Administration from enforcing the 1872 mining law and reforming the sale of our Nation's mineral assets. 
   Coal does not get the privileges of hard rock mining. Oil and gas do not get the privileges of hard rock mining. It is absolutely extraordinary that at a time when Senators will come to the floor of the Senate and talk about giving money back, in tax cuts, to the citizens of this country, who deserve the money, that they will vote against giving them the money they deserve from the land that they own. This land belongs to the American citizens, and it is nearly being given away, without royalties, to mining companies that leave behind devastation. The are not paying their fair share, not just for cleaning it up, but also on the gold, silver and other minerals that they profit from, and that Americans own. I think it is the wrong way to legislate the priorities of our lands and the protection of them. 
   The Bureau of Land Management tried to update environmental protections in 1997. Respectfully, I ask that my colleagues not come to the floor and tell us that this all of this happened in the dead of night or some secret effort. The Clinton Administration tried to enact some reforms in 1997, and they were blocked by a rider on an appropriations bill. It was stopped again by a rider in the 1998 Interior appropriations bill that prohibited them from issuing proposed rules until the Western Governors were consulted and, then, until after November of 1998. 
   Here we are in July of 1999. The BLM satisfied the requirements of that rider of 1998. 
   They then resumed the rulemaking process. It wasn't in the dead of night. It wasn't a surprise. The Clinton Administration, again, took up the rulemaking after they had been required to consult with the western Governors. The BLM satisfied that. But then they were stopped again by a rider in the fiscal year 1999 omnibus appropriations bill calling for a study by the National Academy of Sciences and delaying the rules at least until July, which is where we are right now. However, not even that was enough. In February of this year, the BLM issued proposed rules, and it entered a public comment period, not the dead of night, not some surprise effort by the rulemakers. They were proceeding according to how Congress had told them to proceed. And then another rider was inserted into the year 2000 supplemental appropriations bill so that we could further delay the rulemaking process. 
   Now we are considering a fourth rider, the fourth rider for the mining industry since 1997 in the fiscal year 2000 Interior appropriations. 
   While these riders are slightly different legislatively, they have all protected a flawed system that continues to allow us to sell an acre of land for as little as $2.50; $2.50 for an acre of land to go in and mine thousands of dollars of worth minerals and possibly cause excessive environmental damage, certainly alter the landscape in a dramatic way. 
   I am as strong an admirer of the Senator from Nevada as anybody in the Senate. He is a friend, a good friend. He is representing his State and he has to. He has 13,000 miners there. But one has to wonder about the cost of reclaiming the land and who will pay it. At some point we may find cheaper for the United States of America to pay those miners not to mine than to pay for the kind of environmental damage that has been presented here today by the Senators from Washington and Illinois. Rivers have been ruined, the toxics spilled into the environment. What is it, $32 billion to $72 billion is the estimated cost of cleaning up chemicals that have been released in these operations and other environmental damage to drinking water and water systems. It is cheaper to tell them not to do it than to continue to do this. 
   What are we doing? Well, we have a law, the 1872 Mining Law, that restricts each mine claim of up to 20 acres to a mill site of 5 acres to dump waste and process material. 
   In his decision, the Solicitor did not amend, he did not reinterpret the law. Even the mining industry has agreed that the 5-acre mill site limit is the law, I point to an article from 1970 when a law firm representing the industry openly concede that point. They may argue a different case now, but before this opportunity presented itself,  the mining industry agreed. All the Solicitor did was recommend that the BLM start enforcing this provision again. That is all. Enforce the provision.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. 
   The BLM is simply seeking to enforce the existing law once again. No reinterpretation, no change. This is not a far reach. This is existing law, which, as I say, very clearly in 1970 and in other times has been acknowledged as the law even by the mining industry itself. 
   It was likely under pressure from the mining industry in the 1960s and 1970s that the Federal Government started to overlook the provision and permitted mining operations to use more than the single 5-acre mill site. What we are saying is that was a mistake of enormous environmental and fiscal consequences. 
   The BLM ought to enforce the law. It is one of the few protections that we have. 
   Let me try to share with colleagues what the consequences of the current law are, why it needs reform and why it should be enforced. According to an editorial in the USA Today newspaper, in 1994, a Canadian company called American Barrick Resources purchased 2,000 acres of public land in Nevada that contained $10 billion in gold. How much do you think they paid for the 2,000 acres and the $10 billion of gold? They paid $10,000. 
   Every time in the last few years that we have tried to have a fair meeting of the minds on the subject of what is an appropriate royalty or what is an appropriate bonding, it hasn't worked. It is public land. There ought to be requirements, more than we have now, for a mining company that wants to mine public land, take out billions of dollars of gold, and pay the taxpayers only $10,000. They don't say to you: We are going to degrade the land, damage rivers and leave the place unusable for other purposes. 
   If they said that, do you think anybody in the Senate would stand up and vote for it up front? No. But you are voting for it. That is the effect of what happens here, unless we turn around and say, no, we are going to enforce the law. 
   I understand the economics of this, but one of the problems we have across the board nationally and globally is that we don't value the environmental impact on the cost of goods. Nobody wants to be responsible for doing that, for incorporating in the cost of a product the cost reducing our national resources. So we keep doing things that actually cost us an awful lot more, but it is never reflected in the cost of the product. But we pay for it; the American taxpayer pays for it. 
   The environmental toll is high. Over 12,000 miles of streams have been destroyed, according to the Mineral Policy Center, which is group expert in the impacts of mining. I don't understand how we can risk, especially in the West where water availability is a problem, polluting our watersheds this way. We have one major, enormous reservoir for water for the United States under most of the mid-central section of the nation. We are increasingly depleting that reservoir of water. And we are currently, mainly through agriculture, using that water at a rate exceeding its resupply. We can't afford to destroy 12,000 miles of streams. 
   What is the economic value of those streams? Has anybody calculated that? 
   Has anybody calculated the economic value in the cost of lost drinking water because of chemical that contaminated it? This is a matter of common sense, and we are not exhibiting that kind of common sense as we approach it. The fact is that there are almost 300,000 acres of land owned by the citizens of the United States of America, public land that has been mined and left unreclaimed. Abandoned mines account for 59 Superfund sites. There are over 2,000 abandoned mines in our national parks. The Mineral Policy Center estimates the cleanup cost for abandoned mines, as we mentioned earlier, is at the high end, $72 billion, and at the low end, $32 billion. 
   Will the Senators from the West come forward with that $32 billion? Where is the offer by those who want to continue these practices and run that bill up even higher to pay the bill? Is there an offer to pay the bill? 
   I think the Senate ought to put an end to this process, to protecting a flawed policy, by supporting the Murray amendment, by opposing rider or provision of Senator CRAIG and Senator REID. I will, if for no other reason so I can simply represent the taxpayers in good conscience. The costs of continuing this program are far greater than the costs of enforcing the law and doing what is required. The Senator from Nevada asked, a moment ago, of the Senator from Illinois: What would you like us to do? He said: What do you think the mining companies ought to do? 
   Let me respectfully share with you what the Bureau of Land Management wants them to do, which the mining companies and these constant riders are blocking us from doing. Here it is very simply: Protect water quality from impacts caused by the use of cyanide leaching, thereby safeguarding human environmental health in the arid West. Second, protect wetlands in riparian areas, which provide essential wildlife habitat in arid regions, as well as promoting long-term environmental health, and sharply limit or eliminate any loopholes to the requirement to get advance approval of mining and reclamation plans. 
   Moreover, there are significant things that could be done. Require financial guarantees for all hard rock mining operations; base the financial guarantee amount on the estimated reclamation costs; require the miner to establish a trust fund to pay for long-term water treatment, if necessary. Is that asking too much? If you come in and use the land and you degrade the water, shouldn't you be required to provide water treatment in order to protect the water? 
   Is it asking too much that you should post a bond in order to guarantee that once you strip the mine of all of its economic value and have taken out billions of dollars and walked away with your profits, that you should have some requirement for reclamation, and that there is a sufficient bonding from those profits. Even if you don't pay royalties, shouldn't you pay to guarantee the land is going to be cleaned up? 
   So they ask what should we be able to do. The things they should do are clear as a bell, and they have been blocked. Blocked for the 10 years that I have watched this being fought here. I watched Senator Bumpers from Arkansas pace up and down there with  these arguments year in and year out. And year in and year out, unfortunately, the industry works its will against the better common sense of true conservationists, against the better common sense of those whom I believe care deeply about the land. 
   It is incredible to me that we of good conscience can't find adequate language and compromise to protect this land, to be able to do this properly. We require more of coal miners, and we require more of oil and gas than we do of hard rock mining, and it is public land. 
   So I say to my colleagues we have an opportunity to do what we have been trying to do as a matter of common sense, which is enforce the law of the land. That is all we are asking--enforce the current law of the land as it was before, as it should have been, and as it must be now, in order to adequately protect the interest of the citizens. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, after weeks of difficult decisions, decisions which have in too many respects divided us by party, we have today an easy vote--a vote on which we can all agree. We can support reservists and small business by voting for S. 918, the Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999. When I introduced this bill on April 29th, it had 31 cosponsors. It now has the endorsement of 52 Senators--31 Democrats and 21 Republicans. 
   A majority of the Senate--Senators from Maine to Utah, Michigan to North Carolina--have said that the men and women who serve as reservists need and deserve help maintaining their businesses while they are serving on active duty. That is an important statement about our commitment to the reservists who serve our country. 
   Today, more than 4,700 reservists are serving on active duty around the world. Where are they? In Haiti, Iraq, Bosnia, and Kosovo. And where are their businesses and jobs? Pick any state--Massachusetts, Arizona, Georgia, Ohio, Michigan. 
   When these men and women are called to action, they often have little notice, and their families face financial and emotional hardships. With half of America's military forces serving in reserve and National Guard units--a total of 1.4 million Americans--the Pentagon has acknowledged that extensive missions now require quicker call-ups. As a veteran of the Vietnam War and Ranking Member of the Small Business Committee, I know how disruptive active service can be for reservists who are suddenly called away from their families and work to serve our country. 
   What does a small business with few financial or personal reserves do without the owner, manager or employee who is essential to the daily operation and success of the small business? If you're in a rural area or small town, it will be hard to find a replacement. And if your family steps in, often they don't have the experience or time to run the business. A Commander from Danvers, Mass, who owns two gas station convenience stores said the tight job market only exacerbates the difficulty of finding a replacement, and that training someone well enough to ``leave the  business in [their] hands would be near impossible.'' We need to help these men and women, their families and communities, bridge the gap between when the troops leave and when they return. 
   The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act of 1999 offers small businessmen and women three types of assistance. First, it authorizes the SBA to defer loan repayments and to reduce interest rates on any of its direct loans, including disaster loans. The deferrals and reductions authorized by this bill are available from the date that the military reservist is called to active duty until 180 days after his or her release from active duty. 
   For microloans and loans guaranteed under the SBA's financial assistance programs, such as the 504 and 7(a) loan programs, the bill directs the Agency to develop policies that encourage and facilitate ways for SBA lenders to defer or reduce loan repayments. For example, a microlenders' ability to repay its debt to the SBA is dependent upon payments from microborrowers. So, with this bill's authority, if a microlender extends or defers loan repayment to a borrower who is a deployed military reservist, in turn the SBA would extend repayment obligations to the microlender. 
   Second, the bill establishes a low-interest economic injury loan program to be administered by the SBA through its disaster loan program. These loans would be available to provide interim operating capital to any small business when the departure of a miliary reservist to active duty causes substantial economic injury. Under the bill, such harm includes three general cases: inability to make loan payments; inability to pay ordinary and necessary operating expenses; or inability to market, produce or provide a service or product that it ordinarily 
   provides. Under this provision, an eligible small business may apply for an economic injury loan from the date that the company's military reservist is ordered to active duty until 90 days after release from active duty. 
   Third, the bill directs the SBA and all of its private sector partners, such as the Small Business Development Centers and the Women's Business Centers, to make every effort to reach out to those businesses affected by call up of military reservists to active duty and offer business counseling and training. Those left behind to run the business, whether it's a spouse, a child, or an employee, while the military reservist is serving, may be inexperienced in running the business and need quick access to management and marketing counseling. We need to do what we can to help them keep their doors open and reduce the impact of military conflicts and national emergencies on the economy. 
   Finally, at the insightful suggestion of my colleague Senator LEVIN, the bill will be effective for all qualified reservists who are demobilized as of March 24th, 1999. According to the Department of Defense, 1,266 reservists have been demobilized from Bosnia, Iraq and Kosovo since the 24th. 
   The provisions for this bill should already be available for those who need it, and I deeply regret that this bill hasn't been acted on earlier. The nature of the legislation is uncontroversial, it passed the Committee on Small Business June 9th, almost 50 days ago, by unanimous consent and, to repeat, it has the endorsement of 51 Senators. Since then, it has also passed the full House and the Senate Committee on Small Business as part of H.R. 1568, the Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business Development Act of 1999. 
   As much as I am frustrated by the delay on this bill, it probably doesn't compare to that of reservists who are on active duty and losing sleep over how they are going to keep their businesses going and avoid ruining their credit records. Ask the truck driver who serves in the Missouri National Air Guard and reported to active duty four months ago. He bought a new rig shortly before being called up and has hefty monthly payments to meet. He lined up a replacement to drive his truck while he was gone to keep money coming in, but the driver backed out of the agreement right before the reservist was to leave. 
   He tried to do the right thing--to implement a contingent plan--and yet something beyond his control interfered. It's hard to keep your customers happy when their merchandise isn't getting delivered. And it's even harder to make your loan payments when you're not bringing in enough money. 
   Or ask the reservist from Oklahoma who has supported his wife and four children for the past five years with a carpet and upholstery business. In 1998, he was called up for eight months, and he's been active this year since May 8th. What made it particularly damaging for his business this year was that he was called up at the beginning of the industry's high season. January to April are slow times, and April to December are the money-making months. He called my office a month ago to find out about this bill and find out how he could get assistance. 
   Though this bill was still waiting for action by the full Senate, we put him in contact with the SBA headquarters in Oklahoma to find some way to help. After reviewing his options and what it would take to resuscitate his business, he called to say that he was closing shop for good: ``I'm just going to close my business down. I'm not going to try to get a small business loan. I want to cut my losses now.......'' 
   We have yet to know the full impact on and needs of reservists currently deployed, but, unfortunately, we know the veteran reservists of the Persian Gulf War, Operation Desert Storm, suffered substantial set-backs while away from their businesses. They left their businesses or companies in good shape and returned to hardships ranging from bankruptcy to financial ruin, from deserted clients to layoffs. 
   When I introduced this bill, I talked about a small-business owner from New England, a physician and Lieutenant Commander in the Navy Reserve. He was called up for Operation Desert Storm as a flight surgeon in January 1991. For ten years, he had been a solo practitioner. After six months of service, he had to file bankruptcy. That bankruptcy affected not only him and his wife, but also his two employees and their families. After one year on duty, he returned home to face civilian life without a business or a job. He was only one of many. We must never let that happen again. 
   The Military Reservists Small Business Relief Act is timely because it can help those 6,500 reservists who have been serving in Kosovo since as far back as March. Even those who have already come home and are struggling to keep their businesses afloat. However, it is also important for future reservists because it can offer them relief if they serve any future contingency operations such as Kosovo, military conflicts or national emergencies. 
   For example, in 1993, the National Guard in Missouri was deployed for two months to help with the devastating flood of the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers that left 14 miles of Missouri river-front land under water. While on active duty, two reservists, one with a successful hair salon in a suburb of St. Louis and another with a painting business in Rolla, lost so many of their clients they eventually had to close their small businesses. One of them resigned from the National Guard after that experience because he felt it had taken too big a toll on his life. At a time when America so badly needs more of our citizens to give of themselves, to sign up as military reservists, to make a sacrifice, we must pass this bill to make sure that service will not mean financial ruin. We must pass this legislation to take a stand for our reservists. 
   In closing, I want to thank and acknowledge Jan Behon of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and Dr. Harold V. Nelson of Louisville, Kentucky, who volunteer for SERRR, the Self-Employed Recalled Reservists and Retirees committee, for their support, years of sacrifice and experience that they lent to this bill.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my colleague from Michigan, Senator LEVIN, in introducing the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Technology Transfer (STTR) Volunteer Mentoring Program. This bill seeks to increase, through company-to-company mentoring, the number of SBIR awards given to small businesses located in areas, known as ``low participation areas,'' where historically few awards have been made in proportion to other areas of the country. 
   The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is a great example of how government and business can work together to advance the cause of science and a healthy economy. The results have been dramatic for small, high-technology companies participating in the program. Since 1983 when the program was started, some 16,000 small, high-technology firms have received more than 46,000 SBIR research awards through 1997, totaling $7.5 billion. 
   Complementing the SBIR program, we have the Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) program, another important R&D opportunity for small businesses. It was established to provide a strong incentive for small businesses and technical experts at research institutions to team up and move ideas from the laboratory to the marketplace. 
   Technological advancement is a key element of economic growth. According to a recent Congressional Research Service Report, Small, High Tech Companies and Their Role in the Economy: Issues in the Reauthorization of the Small Business Innovation (SBIR) Program, ``technical progress is responsible for up to one-half the growth of the U.S. economy and is one of the principle driving forces for increases in our standard of living.'' 
   As Ranking Member of the Senate Small Business Committee, and a Senator representing a state with one of the most active hi-tech industries in the country, I am always interested in new initiatives, or improving existing ones, to develop and nurture technology-based companies throughout the region and the nation. 
   The SBIR program has been good to my home state of Massachusetts. So good that we are the second largest recipient of SBIR awards in the country. In 1997, Massachusetts' small, hi-tech firms won 702 awards, totaling $164 million. But it's not by coincidence--it's because we have the right mix of small high-tech companies, an active venture capital community, and a cluster of universities that understand the benefits of technology transfer, attract academic research funds and graduate a highly qualified workforce. 
   Similarly, a variation of that combination is also what cultivates and supports innovative hi-tech companies in states such as California, Virginia and Ohio that have historically been among the largest recipients of SBIR awards. 
   We on the Senate Small Business Committee have the tough job of crafting a solution that helps small businesses in states that don't have this infrastructure. However, we should not change the program's reliance on competition. Merit is the only way to maintain the integrity of the research. Only one in seven or eight Phase I proposals is awarded. The highly competitive nature of SBIR awards is one of the main reasons the program has been so popular and successful. 
   One of the experiments working around the country is mentoring--experienced SBIR award winners helping SBIR applicants navigate the process. For example, Innovative Training Systems (ITS) in Newton, Mass., mentored Pro-Change Behavior Systems out of West Kingston, RI, when it applied for its first SBIR award. ITS specializes in health care multi-media programs such as smoking prevention and cessation for high school students and has gotten several SBIR awards from the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Pro-Change also specializes in health care multi-media for health behavior change and needed help getting an SBIR award for cancer prevention from NIH. Pro-Change says, among many things, the mentoring helped by explaining the rating system (it learned to target resources to those aspects of the proposal that counted most) and by saving the company time and reducing confusion on the financial and business requirements behind a proposal. As a representative for Pro-Change said, ``SBIR mentoring leads to long-lasting business partnerships, spawning exciting new ventures.'' 
   Mentoring may not be exclusively responsible for Pro-Change's success in getting its first SBIR award, but it played an important role. Just look at the numbers. The process is highly competitive, with only one in seven or eight Phase I proposals getting funded. Furthermore, this company got another award in Rhode Island, a state where only six awards were given in 1997. Since that first award in 1998, Pro-Change has gone on to apply for three more Fast-Track Phase II proposals and one Phase I proposal to NIH. We can and should replicate and facilitate this process. 
   This bill would elevate and reinforce that informal mentoring by authorizing competitive grants, ranging from $50,000 to $200,000, to any entity that represents small businesses that participate in SBIR or STTR programs. The entity would be obligated to match experienced, successful SBIR or STTR award winners with small businesses located in low SBIR-participation areas--advising and guiding them from application to award to project completion. 
   Though it will be up to the SBA Administrator to define what areas receive a disproportionate amount of awards, this bill is intended to help states such as such as Maine and Montana, which received only five awards in 1997, and rural pockets of states such as Michigan and Massachusetts which do well overall in the program but get the concentration of awards in university towns or the largest city. 
   Because founders of hi-tech companies are often more scientific inventors than business experts, the mentor companies could help with management assistance, proposal writing, commercialization or venture capital networking. The mentor companies would be volunteers, but would be eligible for reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses, authorized travel and reasonable bills for telephone calls and faxes. And like the volunteers in SBA's successful volunteer business counselor program, the Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), SBIR mentor volunteers would get automatic liability coverage. 
   I know the Committee on Small Business will have a roundtable on August 4th to discuss with program managers, SBIR companies and SBIR advocates how to increase the low number of awards given in certain states, and I look forward to hearing comments on this bill and on any alternative programs. 
   Mr. President, in closing, I want to thank Senator LEVIN for his work on this bill and ask that a letter of support from the Small Business Technology Coalition be included for the RECORD.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware. I am delighted to join with him as an original cosponsor of the amendment. I am pleased to work with him with respect to this question of the funding of the COPS Program nationally. 
   As the Senator from Delaware knows well, back in 1994 I brought the original amendment to the floor for the 100,000 police officers at a time when people said we weren't going to be able to find the money. 
   We managed to reach an agreement through the ingenuity of the distinguished Senator from West Virginia, Mr. BYRD, and an agreement with Senator GRAMM back then to split some money with respect to prisons, which ultimately became the foundation of a rather remarkable increase in funding for police officers on a national basis. 
   The Senator from Delaware, then chairman of the Judiciary Committee, had spent many long years working and fighting to recognize the need to have police officers in the streets of America. My own experience as a former prosecutor brought me to the  Senate with a long-term understanding of and commitment to the notion that crimes usually aren't committed right in front of a police officer. On too many streets in America, and too many corners of our communities, we were literally, only a few years ago, abandoning those streets to criminals. The ratio of police officer to a felony was diminishing. Felonies were going up; the police officers were going down. And there was a direct correlation to the disorder, even the chaos in some places, that we were inheriting as a result of the lack of capacity for enforcement. 
   Having run one of the largest district attorney offices in America, one of the 10 largest counties in the country, Middlesex County in Massachusetts, I learned firsthand it is not just a police officer on a street at a particular moment of time who is going to intercept a crime or break up a fight or provide order; those police officers who make arrests have to go to court. They have to be able to testify in cases. They have to have time to investigate cases. It takes an enormous amount of street work, of nonvisible work, to be able to adequately staff and supply the police force of the country, the investigative capacity of the country, in order to bring cases. 
   We too often were losing cases because we couldn't bring the officer to court. The officer needed to be out on the streets because of the shifts. Judges would dismiss cases because prosecutors were failing to put them together in time to meet the swift and speedy prosecution standards. 
   Finally, we got people to understand that it makes a difference to have a police officer walking a beat. That is another problem that occurred in America for a long period of time. We put police officers in a car; they drove around; criminals could pretty well predict when the car was going to come through. The car created a barrier between the officer and the street, so to speak. People didn't build relationships. They didn't build relationships with good citizens in the community, and they also didn't build relationships with bad citizens from whom they often learned who may have done one thing or another against the law. 
   Through awareness of that in 1994, we began an effort to put police officers back on the streets of America, to build those relationships, and to provide our departments with the indispensable foundation on which the life and economic development of a community exists. That is called the opposite of chaos. It is peace. That is why they are called peace officers. 
   The fact is, we have been on a wonderful trend line, an extraordinary trend line, where crime has been going down. Most violent crime has been going down, although not all; there are a couple areas that have gone up in the last year. The fact is, the kind of threat the average citizen felt in their community has diminished. In community after community after community, all across this country, police chiefs, police officers, mayors, everybody involved in the effort to provide order, will share stories of the remarkable ways in which the community policing program has made a difference in the lives of our fellow citizens. 
   It is extraordinary to me that plans were laid in the original Republican budget to eliminate funding for this, one of the most successful programs that we have had. 
   If you look at the city of Bost on in the 1990s, we had a gang epidemic. There was a surge in youth violence. The Boston Police Department responded by developing a very innovative youth violence task force, an aggressive intervention strategy, and a program to control trafficking of firearms. However, much depended on the $750,000 COPS anti-gang initiative grant. That has become a model program in the country. Countless police chiefs and others have used that program as a way of instituting a similar effort in their own cities. 
   Every year since 1993, the number of juveniles killed by guns has decreased, a 60-percent decrease from 1990 to 1998. From July 1995 to December 1997 not one youth was killed with a firearm. 
   The rate of violent crime involving a firearm has decreased 43 percent since 1995. Property crime has dropped to its lowest levels since the 1960s and has been cut in half since 1990. House break-ins and car thefts have also hit a 35-year low. 
   The federal assistance through the COPS program has given local communities like Boston the tools to fight crime effectively. This makes our streets and schools safer, our homes more secure and improves the quality of life for everyone. In 1997, a Boston Public Safety Survey found that more than three-quarters of the residents feel somewhat to very safe alone in their neighborhoods at night, an increase of close to 20 percent just since 1995. Feeling save to walk the streets is a right, not a privilege for those who can afford it. Every community deserves the type of security that Boston residents currently enjoy. The COPS program has played an important role in fostering that security. 
   Listen to what Paul Evans, Commissioner of the Boston Police Department, has had to say. In a letter to me, which I will now read, Paul reminds us that  
   Over the past five years, the COPS office has been a strong and effective partner in our efforts in Boston, and in cities across the country. COPS funds have supported the hiring of 109 new officers like Jamie Kenneally, who has quickly become a community fixture, walking his beat and serving as a one-man-anti-crime unit on Centre Street in Jamaica Plain.  
   Mr. President, other COPS initiatives have supported Boston's internationally recognized youth violence strategy, which yielded a 75-percent decrease in youth homicides. Also, COPS supported the citywide Strategic Planning and Community Mobilization Project that brought together more than 400 police and community stakeholders to create partnerships for public safety that have been replicated in communities across the country. 
   The effects of the COPS programs in Boston have been replicated across Massachusetts and across the nation. Here is a letter from Edward Davis, Superintendent of Police in Lowell, Massachusetts. In the letter, Superintendent Davis says the Lowell Police Department has seen a dramatic decrease in crime and the fear of crime over the past six years. Violent crimes have decreased more than 60 percent as a result of the hard work of police officers, citizens, and the support of the Federal Government. 
   Paula Meara, Chief of Police of Springfield, Massachusetts believes that COPS funding has unquestionably improved the quality of life for Springfield residents. In 1997 and 1998, Homicides in Springfield have declined by 40 percent and serious crime has dropped by 12 percent. Chief Meara believes that any reduction in funding for the COPS program will have catastrophic results and will be detrimental to the quality of life for every resident in Springfield. 
   The COPS program has been a demonstrated success in Massachusetts and across the nation. It deserves continued federal support. Adopting the Biden amendment is a good first step toward continuing federal assistance for local communities. However, there is much more that we need to do. First, we must find additional funds for the COPS program in conference to insure that communities that are currently plagued with crime and violence can fight back with a cop on the beat. Second, we must continue to work with local police departments to develop innovative community-based approaches to fighting crime. This approach will help allow evey community free itself of the crime and violence that lowers the quality of life and limits economic development. Mr. President, it is time we end the debate of whether to fund the COPS program, and move onto the far more important question of how to enlarge and expand this successsful program for the challenges before us today.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I join my colleague and friend from Missouri, Senator BOND, in supporting the additional funding for the Office of Advocacy. This is a substantial increase over FY 1999 funding, which I believe is important for the ability of the Office of Advocacy to carry out its important mission on behalf of small business. Among others, those responsibilities include conducting research on a number of issues that are critical to small minority-owned and women-owned firms, and the cost of Federal regulations. I commend my colleagues, Senator GREGG and Senator HOLLINGS, for their initiative in providing this increase. 
   We are also very concerned about the current staffing needs of the Office of Advocacy, which has declined significantly in recent years. In FY 1990, there were 70 full-time employees assigned to the Office of Advocacy. During the current fiscal year, it is my understanding the SBA Administrator has allocated 49 full-time staff for the Office of Advocacy.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will shortly be sending to the desk for appropriate referral the Coastal Stewardship Act which I am introducing today, along with Senators HOLLINGS, BREAUX, INOUYE, BOXER, FEINSTEIN and KENNEDY. The goal of the Coastal Stewardship Act is to significantly strengthen our national commitment to and capacity to protect the coastal communities and all of our coastal and ocean environment. 
   Our coasts--I know the Chair knows this because he represents a State that has enormous fishing interests--our coasts and our oceans are increasingly fragile environments, and they are increasingly threatened. Their health depends on a very complex chain of ecosystems that includes rainwater runoff from inland, estuaries, wetlands, flood plains, tidal basins, coral reefs, our fisheries and the whole deal more. Damage to any one of those ecosystems can wind up degrading and damaging the others, and they can cause severe cultural and economic impact for all of our coastal communities. 
   Moreover, as our coastal population grows and as coastal development increases, as it has been almost every year for the last 50 years, we are placing more and more stress on these fragile and increasingly unique and interconnecting ecosystems. 
   Since 1960, the coastal population in the United States has increased by over 50 percent, and that trend is expected to continue. Indeed, it is predicted that over the course of the next 10 years or so, well over 75 percent of the American population will live within 50 miles of coastline of one kind or another. In the next decade alone, an additional 14 million Americans are expected to settle in coastal areas. 
   The impact is very clear. On the Atlantic coast, we have had toxic outbreaks of pfiesteria. In the Gulf of Mexico, we have a dead zone that has formed that harms shrimp stocks and kills off other species. Our Nation has lost more than 89 million acres of coastal wetlands, and our commercial fisheries are depleted from a combination of mismanagement and also ecosystem impacts. Parts of the Great Lakes have suffered from nutrient enrichment which is destructive to those ecosystems. Finally, even urban areas along our coasts face a unique challenge as they work to clean up polluted industrial sites and bring their waterfronts back to life. 
   The Coastal Stewardship Act creates the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund to receive permanent funding from Federal oil and gas leasing on the Outer Continental Shelf. The fund would accrue 10 percent, or a minimum of $250 million of OCS revenues each year. 
   The CSA uses funds from the Ocean and Coast Conservation Fund and general revenues to support the restoration and preservation of our coastal and marine resources. The specific investments include the following:  
   First, the CSA provides increased support to the Coastal Zone Management Act. The CZMA is a highly flexible program that allows States to prioritize, design, and implement management plans, meeting broad national objectives for coastal environmental protection and economic development. 
   Second, the CSA establishes a new highly flexible program within the Department of Commerce to fund coastal habitat, restoration, and preservation projects. With these block grants for conservation, States set priorities and decide how and when projects proceed within broad national goals. 
   Third, it enhances the Federal commitment to the National Marine Sanctuary Program, a very successful program that 
   designates unique ocean habitat for protection and research. Our 12 national marine sanctuaries restore and rebuild marine habitats to their natural condition and monitor and maintain already healthy areas. 
   Four, the CSA creates a coral reef restoration and conservation program at the Department of Commerce. The legislation recognizes the importance of maintaining the health and stability of coral reefs for their environmental and economic value, and it builds on the work of the U.S. Coral Reef Task Force. 
   Five, one of the most difficult challenges to overcome in developing sound policy for U.S. fisheries has been the lack of high-quality information. The CSA establishes a comprehensive program to improve the quality and quantity of fisheries information available to evaluate stock status, design control measures, and monitor effectiveness of those control measures. 
   Six, the CSA increases Federal support of State and local enforcement by expanding existing cooperative enforcement agreements. These joint ventures allow States and local governments to tailor enforcement procedures to fit the local needs and available resources, and also allow for collaboration between State and local enforcement agencies and Federal agencies. 
   I will close my comments, Mr. President, by saying to my colleagues that some have expressed concern that somehow this broader effort might have an impact on reauthorization of coastal zone management and national marine sanctuaries, et cetera. 
   I assure my colleagues this legislation is in addition to and supportive of and supplementary to each of those other efforts which I have personally had the privilege of leading in the past years when I was chairman of the committee. We have reauthorized those in past years, and always we have found that a comprehensive approach has been a far more effective and a, frankly, far more needed approach. But nothing will stand in the way, I am confident, of our efforts to cooperate on each and every one of those efforts. 
   We need to better meet the needs of our coastal communities, and it is absolutely essential that we look in this country at this issue, not as individual pieces that come at us one by one, but as the sum total of the parts they represent. We need a national policy to reflect that sum total. 
   I say to Senator BOXER and Senator LANDRIEU, who have legislation of their own regarding the Outer Continental Shelf, that I am proud to be an original cosponsor of Senator BOXER's Resources 2000 effort, and I look forward to working with them to try to address all the concerns we share regarding these issues. 
   Finally, I am very pleased my colleagues on the Commerce Committee have joined in this. As the Senate knows, the Commerce Committee has primary jurisdiction over our Nation's major coastal programs, and Senators HOLLINGS, BREAUX, INOUYE, and others bring very valuable experience to these issues. I am pleased to include their efforts in this legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Senator from Montana. 
   Mr. President, I rise to oppose the effort of the Senator from New Hampshire whose efforts on this are long and untiring. I respect his commitment to the opposing point of view, but I disagree with him, as I know a number of my colleagues do. 
   I agree with the procedural arguments that the distinguished chairman of the Finance Committee has made. On the merits of the issue, I strongly support the President's decision to renew the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment for Vietnam. There is no question that overturning that waiver would have serious consequences--negative consequences--for our bilateral relations with Vietnam and for our larger interests in the region. 
   The United States has very important interests, as we know. One is for obtaining the fullest possible accounting of American servicemen missing from the war. That still remains the first priority of our relationship. But in addition to that, we have interests in promoting freedom of immigration, promoting human rights and freedoms, and encouraging Vietnam to maintain its course of economic reform and to open its markets to American and to other companies. 
   We also have important political and strategic interests in promoting the stability of the often volatile region of Southeast Asia, as well as in balancing some of the interests of China in the region, and clearly our relationship with Vietnam is important in that effort. These interests, in my judgment, dictate that we should maintain a very active presence and a very effective working relationship with all of the countries in the region, including Vietnam. 
   The real question to be asked is, How do you promote the 
   most effective relationship in the region, and with Vietnam? It is, in my judgment, not by denying Vietnam trade and other benefits of interaction with the United States, nor do we do it by engaging them in an incremental process of building an effective and mutually beneficial policy of engagement. 
   Some of us have been engaged in this issue for a long time in the Senate. I have been involved in it for the 15 years I have been here. 
   As the former chairman of the POW/MIA committee that set up the policy whereby we began to get some answers to the questions regarding our missing servicepeople, let me just say that there is one clear fact that is irrefutable. For 20 years we denied a relationship. For 20 years we didn't engage. For 20 years we refused to build the kind of cooperative effort in which we are currently engaged. For those 20 years after the war, we didn't get any  answers at all regarding our missing. The fact is that it was under President Reagan and President Bush that we began a process of engagement. President Bush and General Scowcroft moved us carefully down that road, and President Clinton has continued that policy of eliciting from the Vietnamese the kind of cooperation that has provided the answers to many families in this country about their loved ones who are missing in Vietnam. 
   I have recounted that progress many times in this Chamber. I don't intend to go through it again now, in the interest of time. Let me just emphasis one very important point. 
   Last year, those who opposed the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment suggested as one of the arguments for opposing it that POW/MIA accounting was going to stop or it would decrease. In fact, the opposite is true. Their predictions of dire impact last year have proven wrong, just as the predictions that, by being more hard-line and not involving ourselves with them, we would get answers have proven wrong. 
   The Vietnamese have continued to conduct bilateral and unilateral investigations and document searches and to cooperate in the trilateral investigations. Leads that might help resolve outstanding discrepancy cases continue to be investigated by the Vietnamese and the American teams. In fact, the waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment last year served as an incentive for continued progress on immigration. As a result, the processing of our applicants under the orderly departure program and the ROVR program have continued to the point that we are extraordinarily satisfied. 
   Although progress in the area of human rights is not everything we want it to be, even liberalization has continued over the last year, as evidenced by increased participation in religious activities, Vietnamese access to the Internet, 60 strikes by workers, including strikes against state-owned enterprises, as well as the release of 24 prisoners of conscience. 
   If we overturn the Jackson-Vanik waiver, in my judgment and in the judgment of Senator MCCAIN, Senator BOB KERREY, Senator CHUCK ROBB, and Senator HAGEL, and others who have served, we run the risk of setting back progress on these issues as well as negating the current extraordinary progress on the bilateral trade agreement, which I believe is extraordinarily close to being signed. 
   Our step-by-step approach to normalizing relations is working, and it is in keeping with the many interests of our Government that I have expressed. I believe we should stay the course and therefore oppose the efforts of the Senator from New Hampshire.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to speak for just few minutes today in support of President Clinton's Executive Order of June 3, 1999, which ordered the Federal Government to undertake a comprehensive program to save energy, save money and cut pollution. 
   The Federal Government is the nation's largest consumer of energy, purchasing energy to light, heat and cool more than 500,000 buildings and power millions of vehicles. Each year the Federal Government purchases more than $200 billion worth of products, including enormous quantities of energy-intensive goods. Current efficiency programs already save more than $1 billion a year according to an estimate in the Wall Street Journal of July 15, 1999. In addition, the government's vast purchases give it significant market influence to impact the development, manufacture and use of clean energy technologies. 
   This Executive Order sets worthwhile--and unfortunately too long overlooked--goals, including the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy efficiency improvements, increased use of renewable energy, reduced use of petroleum, water conservation and changes in how we measure energy use. I believe these goals have tremendous merit and will deliver the ``win-win'' results of sound environmental and energy policy, because each goal stresses reduced pollution and reduced costs. 
   To achieve these goals, the Order sets in place several new administrative policies for organization and accountability. To begin, each agency will designate a single officer to oversee implementation. Agencies will submit a budget request to the Office of Management and Budget for investments that will reduce energy use, pollution and life-cycle costs, and they will track and report progress. The Order applies to all Federal departments and agencies, with an appropriate exception for the Department of Defense when compliance may hinder military operations and training. 
   Federal agencies will be able to employ a range of Federal programs including Energy Star, sustainable building design research from the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency and others. For example, to the extent practicable, agencies will strive to achieve the Energy Star standards for energy performance and indoor environmental quality for all facilities by 2002. Agencies will apply sustainable design principles to the siting, design and construction of new facilities--meaning energy use, costs and reduced pollution will be optimized across a facility's life. And such measures will extend to transportation, including the use of efficient and renewable-fuel vehicles. 
   Finally, the Executive Order endorses the use of ``source energy'' as a measure of efficiency. Measuring energy consumption by ``source''--as opposed to ``site''--means taking into account not only the energy consumed by a light bulb, appliance or other product to perform a certain function, but also the energy consumed in the generation, transmission and distribution of that energy to the product in question. Research in energy use increasingly shows that a ``source'' measurement is a more accurate measure of the total costs that we pay to operate appliances and other equipment. 
   Mr. President, I add my sincere appreciation to President Clinton for executing this Order and endorsing its policies. I believe that if this Executive Order is properly implemented, it will pay dividends for the environment and taxpayers.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have heard the horror stories: An HMO delays a breast cancer patient's treatment until the cancer has spread throughout her body. Parents are forced to drive their critically ill child to a hospital 50 miles away from their home because their insurer refuses to let them take the boy to a hospital 5 miles from their home. A patient complaining of chest pains is not allowed to see a cardiologist, and as a result suffers a fatal heart attack. Americans want their doctors--not managed care bureaucrats--to make their medical decisions. And when managed care wrongfully delays or denies care, Americans want the right to bring a lawsuit to hold managed care responsible for its misconduct. 
   And let me tell you directly--the Gregg amendment won't do a thing to help Americans who suffer from the abuse of HMOs. It will maintain the provision in ERISA that allows patients in employer self funded plans to only recover damages in court from an HMO related to the cost of the treatment delayed or denied. It denies the right of Americans to receive punitive damages that send the message to insurance companies that when they do wrong, they'll be held accountable for the wrong they do. 
   The Gregg amendment sets up a weak appeals process where patients could first dispute the HMO's ruling with a doctor within the insurance plan (but not the one they saw for treatment) and if they are still not satisfied then they can talk to a second doctor that is outside of the insurance plan but regulated by either a state or federal agency. Whatever each of the doctors rule would then be binding. The Gregg amendment only exacerbates a bureaucratic nightmare. It doesn't allow Americans to hold insurance companies accountable in court. It doesn't address the real impediment to accountability in health care: ERISA. 
   Today, even if an HMO has been directly involved in dictating, denying or delaying care for a patient, it can use a loophole in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to avoid any responsibility for the consequences of its actions. ERISA was designed over 25 years ago, long before managed care companies became the powerful entity in controlling the health care of Americans that it is today. ERISA was originally designed to protect employees from losing pension benefits due to fraud, mismanagement and employer bankruptcies during the 1960's, but the law has had the affect of allowing an HMO to deny or delay care with no effective remedy for patients. 
   Judge William G. Young, a Reagan appointed US District Judge, in his landmark opinion in one case, laid the problems out before us in clear language. He said, and I quote, ``ERISA has evolved into a shield of immunity that protects health insurers, utilization review providers, and other managed care entities from potential liability for the consequences of their wrongful denial of health benefits. ERISA thwarts the legitimate claims of the very people it was designed to protect.'' Judge Young was barred by law from awarding damages for wrongful death in an HMO case--his hands were tied by ERISA--but he laid out the point we're trying to make today. We need to end the ERISA nightmare that is hurting ordinary Americans. 
   We have built a system that puts paperwork ahead of patients and ignores the real life and death decisions being made in our health care system. We must do better. Americans deserve better care, and 
   deserve the right to hold insurers accountable if they do not receive that care. 
   Our opponents erroneously argue that ensuring that plans are held accountable will drive up premium costs and result in lost coverage. They fail to acknowledge however, that the timely appeals mechanisms in our amendment could prevent lawsuits before harm can occur. In fact, an independent study by Coopers and Lyband found that the Democratic provision to hold health plans accountable would cost a mere 3 to 13 cents a month. Ironically, the industry's cry that liability will raise costs assumes that health plans are very negligent and that patients do indeed suffer real harm. 
   History bears out our case: access to the court system for ordinary Americans--the right to seek redress--rescued America from Pintos that caught on fire, it gave us seatbelts, bumpers, airbags in cars, and every innovation in safety for consumers that we've witnessed over the last thirty years. 
   So why would we oppose access to the court system for patients injured by runaway insurance companies? Well, some have said it will clog the courts and increase costs and premiums on insurance. And all the studies that prove otherwise aren't enough for these ideologies. Well, they might want to take a look at the State of Texas, where, over Governor George Bush's objections, they gave Texans the right to sue their HMO. And what's been the result? In 2 years since an external review process was established, only 480 complaints have been filed with the Texas Independent Review Organization--about 30 times less than the 4,400 complaints that were predicted in the first year alone by the Texas Department of Insurance. Even more important, only one medical malpractice lawsuit has been filed under this law. Mr. President, the Republicans have been asking America to look towards Texas for some answers--Mr. President, this is one issue on which I think we ought to follow Texas's example. It works. 
   Americans overwhelmingly favor holding managed care plans accountable. A Kaiser Family Foundation/Harvard School of Public Health survey released in January of this year found that 78 percent of voters believe that patients should be able to hold managed care legally accountable for malpractice. A poll released in September of 1998 by The Wall Street Journal and NBC News revealed that 71 percent of voters favor legislation that gives patients the right to hold managed care accountable for improper care, even if that might increase premiums--which studies show it would not. 
   Mr. President, it is clear that accountability is the key to enforcing patients' rights. A right to emergency room care on a ``prudent layperson'' standard or a right to specialty care does little to protect patients if such care can routinely be delayed or denied. Only legal remedies provide adequate protection against managed care's biggest abuses. And it's time we embraced those legal remedies. That is something about which we should all agree.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague from Massachusetts, who I think has hit the nail on the head when he talks about what the insurance companies will allow or not allow, for the average American listening to this, the immediate question is--it seems incomprehensible--how can we not be covered if that is the purpose of the bill? 
   The Republicans are going to hide behind a number of false arguments. I wonder if my colleague would share with us what the reality is of the cost, because the Republicans are going to hide behind the notion that somehow what the Democrats want to do, which is cover more Americans, is too costly, and they will bring out the old Harry and Louise chart again and try to confuse Americans about what will happen.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is, indeed, the most important vote with respect to this issue. I congratulate my colleague from Massachusetts for his extraordinary leadership in putting this issue before the American people. 
   It is extraordinary to me; in the years I have been in the Senate, I think this is perhaps the single most contradictory, craven moment, in some regards, before the Senate. To come to the Senate and suggest you are going to have a Patients' Bill of Rights that in State after State after State leaves out 77, 80 percent, 89 percent of the American people is a contradiction on its face that denies any kind of reasonableness. I think most people in America will understand that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spent more time and energy protecting the right to bear arms than the right for citizens to get decent medical care. 
   What will happen in this legislation if the Republican charade passes--and they have the votes--is, once again, the American people will be left behind and business--and business only, the bottom line--will be the victor. 
   They are going to suggest there are costs, there is administrative overhead. We are going to go through the whole ``Harry and Louise'' thing again. Literally millions of dollars are being spent to scare Americans and confuse them. 
   When it is convenient for the Republicans, they love the Congressional Budget Office. The Congressional Budget Office provides the best figures, the most neutral and independent assessment of expenditures. But here, the Congressional Budget Office comes out and says the real costs of this are only 3 to 13 cents per month per beneficiary. There isn't an American I know who wouldn't pay 3 to 13 cents to have the decent kind of coverage and the protections they need in order to guarantee that coverage in a health care system that has run amok.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have the best specialists, the best delivery system in the world. We have people who come here from all over the world to share in the remarkable expertise and capacities of our specialists in this country. Yet the fact is, under the Republican plan millions of our own citizens would be denied the right of access to specialists. 
   The stories of individuals are remarkable. I know every single one of us has received letters from anguished parents who run into the most extraordinary barriers of resistance from an HMO that is simply concerned with its bottom line and not concerned with the proper delivery of health to the individual they represent. 
   I will speak for just a few minutes today about one of the issues I believe cuts to the heart of this debate over managed care reform in the Senate today, and that is the broader question of what kind of access we are going to guarantee to specialists. Mr. President, in the United States, we are fortunate to have world-renowned health care facilities and some of the best doctors and researchers in the world. Each year thousands of people from around the world travel to this country because we have the best specialists in the world. But at the same time, every year, thousands of letters pour into my office from constituents in managed care plans who can't see the specialists their own doctors know have the expertise to meet their medical needs--because their HMOs won't permit it. Mr. President, there's something disturbing in the dichotomy we are facing: all the world knows our doctors are the best trained, our specialists the best educated and the most highly skilled--but our citizens aren't permitted to see them when they need them most. What can we say about that system which defies the limits of common sense and every notion of human compassion? I believe we should all be able to say that it demands reform--today. 
   When the American people say they support managed care reform, they are rejecting the one-size-fits all brand of health care practiced by many HMOs. Let me assure you, as well, that one of the most critical elements of any Patients' Bill of Rights must be access to quality speciality care--literally, the difference between life and death for thousands upon thousands of Americans each year. 
   Too many of the tragic cases that we hear about in the United States are the result of delay and denial of access to cardiologists, oncologists, surgeons, pediatric specialists and the doctors who have the specialized knowledge absolutely critical in so many cases today. I will never forget the story of Morgan smith--four years old, diagnosed with brain cancer, facing a life-threatening tumor. Imagine the horror of her parents, hearing that grim diagnosis. And you can understand her parents' reaction when pediatric oncologists at Hasbro Children's Hospital in Providence told them that Morgan needed to go to New England Regional Medical Center in Boston for a special chemotherapy treatment--her mother said ``I need to do whatever it's going to take to save my daughter's life, and I'm going to 
   listen to our doctor.'' 
   But can you imagine how Morgan's mother felt when she got a letter in the mail from her HMO denying payment for a specialist--demanding that she get a second opinion? Meanwhile, Mrs. Smith took Morgan to Boston for her treatments, unsure about how she would pay for it, but knowing that she couldn't afford to risk Morgan's health while she fought the insurance company. Despite a second opinion that Morgan needed the expertise of specialists in Boston, the HMO still refused to pay for the treatment. Mrs. Smith had to wage her own battle against the HMO by starting a letter-writing campaign, along with Morgan's doctors. 
   Fortunately, Morgan's story, unlike too many others, has a happy ending. Close to a month after Morgan had started her treatment, the insurance company finally agreed to cover the procedure that all the medical professionals agreed was necessary. But I would remind you that had Morgan's parents followed the HMO's mandate, their daughter may not have received the treatment that saved her life and it was at the very least, delayed. Morgan's parents have since changed insurance companies, but their health plan contract will be rewritten in August and the family is very nervous about possible changes that may affect Morgan's health care. Morgan will be six years old this November and she is attending kindergarten. We need to take the right steps today to guarantee that Morgan and children like her never face another HMO nightmare like the one that could have cost her and her family her life. We need to take the necessary steps to prevent the kind of bureaucratic nightmare that almost killed Sarah Pederson. Sarah Pederson's parents lives were changed overnight when their healthy, beautiful seven month old baby was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor--a condition which had to be monitored carefully by a specialist. But the Pedersons' HMO--in spite of the recommendation of their pediatrician--would not allow Sara to see a pediatric neuro-oncologist. A seven month old baby with a brain tumor, a brain tumor so complicated that the Pedersons' pediatrician knew only of a few pediatric neuro-oncologists capable of treating it, and the HMO said ``no''--they insisted that this child be sent to an adult neuro-oncologist. Why? No explanation was given other than ``this is our policy.'' And it goes on and on. The HMO refused to 
   approve the chemo-therapy regimen prescribed by their specialist--until it was approved by another one of their specialists. And what happened during that month of delay? The tumor grew. And in the end, what saved Sarah Pederson? Did the HMO relent and allow the doctors and the family to make decisions in the best interests of this child? No. The Pedersons only found relief when they left their HMO--and mortgaged their home to join a fee for service program. I challenge any one to look the Pedersons in the eye and tell them we don't need managed care reform to guarantee appropriate access to specialists.  
   Mr. President, I can tell you that--thanks to parents who didn't give up, who put their own financial security on the line, who fought and fought the red tape--Morgan Smith and Sarah Pederson survived. They survived in spite of their HMO's. Jack Jennings wasn't so lucky. Jack was from Andover, Massachusetts. He was diagnosed with mild emphysema, and later on with a pneumothorax, which can lead to a collapsed lung. His doctor believed a lung reduction procedure could not just improve his quality of life, but actually save his life--but this primary care doctor knew it would take a specialist to perform that operation. Jack was referred to see Dr. Sugarbaker, a top physician in Boston. The HMO rejected the referral. Jack's doctor wrote a lengthy appeal. The HMO rejected it. Months went by. Jack appealed again and again--literally taking a break from his oxygen machine to speak on the phone with the HMO claims adjuster. Finally, a letter arrived at the Jennings household, the referral for a specialist approved, a date for surgery set. But here's the tragedy: Jack Jennings had died before the letter reached his house, before the surgery was approved. And the letter from the HMO was right there in a pile of mail, surrounded by condolence cards. Mr. President, how can we say with a straight face that HMO's aren't running roughshod over patients in dire need of specialty care. How can we say that this isn't a gross abuse of fundamental patients' rights? 
   Our access to specialists amendment helps to ensure that patients will be able to secure the health care they need, no matter what the circumstance. All patients with special conditions absolutely must have access to providers who have the expertise to treat their problems. 
   Our amendment delivers on these common sense propositions: ensuring access to specialists by allowing 
   patients in an HMO network of physicians to find specialty care outside that network at no extra cost if there is no qualified specialist available in the network and allowing patients who are seriously ill or require continued care to have their specialists coordinate their care without being required to ask permission again and again from a primary care provider. The Republican bill does not ensure access to speciality care; it lacks basic protections to ensure that patients can see doctors qualified to treat their condition. For example, if a child with cancer needed access to a pediatric oncologist, there is no guarantee in the Republican bill that she will have access to that specialist. 
   Not only that, but the Republican bill does not allow patients with diseases or disabilities requiring continuing care by a specialist to designate their specialist as their primary care doctor who can coordinate their care. Under the Republican bill, patients could be charged more for out-of-network specialty care--even if the plan is at fault for not having access to appropriate specialists. The Republican bill would not allow patients to appeal a denial of access to appropriate specialists. If the Republicans pass the legislation that they want to pass, children and adults with diseases such as cancer or severe arthritis will continue to face insurance company red tape when they go for routine visits to the oncologist or rheumatologist. 
   Mr. President, our opponents will say their bill includes access to specialty care but the fact is that their bill leaves out the key elements needed to ensure access to specialty care. Their bill may have the title Patients' Bill of Rights, but it sure doesn't have the substance. At a time when millions upon millions of Americans are feeling the squeeze from their HMO's, when millions of Americans are suffering needlessly because decisions are being made by bureaucrats rather than doctors, the style without the substance won't do a single thing to make health care better--it won't save Morgan Smith's family from another battle with an HMO when her family's energy should be dedicated to a fight against cancer, it won't do a single thing to prevent the all-too-real suffering that has become standard practice in the maze of red tape that is managed care health care in the United State today. Mr. President, we can do better than the Republican propsoal--we can actually guarantee access to a specialist. And that is a responsibility every one of us ought to work towards fulfilling.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today in support of the Act to Save America's Forests. Over the past 200 years, 95 percent of America's forests have been logged. The Act to Save America's Forests is an effort to save the remaining 5 percent of these original forests. 
   The legislation is based on our best science and recognizes that we can preserve our national forests for future generations and still harvest the renewable resource of timber. It is supported by over 600 scientists, who wrote to Congress that the act will ``give our nation's precious forest ecosystems the best chance for survival and recovery into the 21st century and beyond.'' 
   The truth is, this bill represents a prudent approach. It has been criticized by those who want to ban all logging on national lands and by those who feel that our current forest policy is too restrictive. I am optimistic that it will bring opposing sides together around common progress. 
   The Act to Save America's Forests will protect some of the most treasured wild lands in America. Millions of Americans visit our national forests every year, generating more than $100 billion for local economies. In our forests, families hike, fish, boat, mountain climb, bird watch ad even dog sled. And, they act as watersheds and are home to rare species. 
   In Oregon, our national forests have trees over 1,000 years old. The Sequoia National Forest in California is home to the world's oldest trees. These are true natural--and national--treasures. 
   In New England, we have the Green Mountain and White Mountain National Forests. Only 100 miles from Boston, they are home to Mt. Washington, the Old Main of the Mountain and the Appalachian Trail. These are favorite spots for our citizens to back-pack, ski, canoe, kayak and witness the fall foliage. 
   The remaining unbroken forests in the Green Mountain draw wildlife from great distances, such as migratory song birds from central and South America. The Lamb Brook, Glastenbury and Robert Frost Mountain forests, which are threatened with clearcut logging, are critical habitat for New England's black bear population, who needs these remote areas of solitude to breed and forage. The Act to Save America's Forests would permanently protect these forests and their biodiversity from logging or roadbuilding. 
   Today, there are 490 million acres of harvestable timberlands in the United States. Only approximately 20 percent of this harvestable timberland, some 98 million acres, are owned by the Federal Government and would be impacted by the Act to Save America's Forests. The remaining 80 percent of the harvestable timberland is on private land, and would not be regulated by the Act to Save America's Forests. 
   The major provisions of the Act to Save America's Forests will ban logging and road building of any kind in 13 million acres of ``core'' national forest. Core forests include ancient forest and biologically significant and roadless areas. Only environmentally compatible, sustainable logging would be permitted outside of the protected core forest areas. Clearcutting and even age logging would be banned on all federal lands. The Act will protect watersheds and fisheries by prohibiting logging within 300-foot buffer areas along streams and lakes. It directs the Federal agencies to protect and restore native biological diversity. Finally, it establishes a panel of scientists to provide guidance on Federal forest management. 
   I want to thank Senator TORRICELLI for introducing this legislation and Representative ANNA ESHOO for offering similar legislation in the House of Representatives. I strongly support this effort to balance our need to preserve and restore our national forests while allowing for the harvest of the renewable resource these forests provide.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to make a few remarks in support of the Clean Energy Act of 1999. 
   There is a strong consensus in Congress, and throughout the nation, that it is time to restructure our electric utility industry. The driving force behind this consensus is the potential to save working families and businesses billions of dollars in their electricity bills as competition replaces regulated markets and drives down costs. 
   The Clinton Administration has estimated that the nation may save as much as $20 billion through restructuring, and other estimates are even higher. Some twenty states, including Massachusetts, have already acted to bring competition to their state industry and capture these savings. 
   In addition to saving billions of dollars, electric utility restructuring also presents us with the opportunity to enhance environmental protections. The Clean Energy Act of 1999 advances environmental goals that I believe should be considered as part of the final electric utility restructuring proposal passed by the Senate--and that is why I am an original cosponsor. 
   I know that some in Congress have argued that we should not include environmental protections in a utility restructuring proposal. I think that would be a grave mistake, because some--by no means all--power plants are the source of too much pollution to be ignored. 
   In Massachusetts, for example, five power plants release more than 90 percent of the pollution from power plants in the state. If each of these plants met modern standards, it would reduce as much pollution as taking more than 750,000 cars off the road. And, while Massachusetts struggles with some of these dirty plants, many more can be found in the Midwest and other parts of the nation. 
   The consequences of this pollution are significant. In the Northeast we experience frequent and widespread violations of national health standards for ozone. Long-term exposure to ozone may increase the incidence of respiratory disease and premature aging of the lungs. Acid deposition, whose source may be plants far outside of the Northeast, degrades public health and damages aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. Mercury, which is highly poisonous, accumulates in aquatic species. Finally, carbon dioxide pollution continues to accumulate in the atmosphere and increase the potential for destructive and irreversible climate change. 
   The Clean Energy Act of 1999 would put in place important public health and environmental policies. Most importantly, it would level the playing field by requiring old, heavily-polluting power plants that are now exempt from health and environmental standards, to clean up. This is important for New England, because while many of these plants are located in the Midwest, their pollution is carried through weather patterns to our air, forests, lakes, streams and lungs. 
   We should close this loophole. Many energy companies have achieved environmental improvements, and those achievements should not be minimized, but the fact remains that electricity generation from old, heavily-polluting power plants increased 15.8 percent from 1992 to 1998, nationwide. 
   I want to add that I have heard from the citizens of Massachusetts who live around old coal and oil plants that pollute far more than newer plants. They feel strongly that all plants should comply with environmental standards and employ the best environmental technology, and that no family should be forced to live in the shadows of a plant that may cause environmental harm. 
   In addition to having tougher standards and closing loopholes in current law, the Act would require the Environmental Protection Agency to review any plant that emits excessive pollution through pollution permit trading to determine whether it is causing adverse local environmental and health impacts. As a result, the bill allows for robust trading so that we can capture all of its economic and broader environmental benefits, but only when it does not harm local communities. 
   Finally, other provisions of the Act will benefit the environment and make the U.S. a leader in clean energy technologies. For example, it would require that a percentage of the Nation's power is generated by solar, wind and other renewable sources. For years we have given heavily-polluting plants a free ride. Now it is time to reverse course and create a market force to bolster our renewable energy technologies so that we will have a growing clean power industry as we start the 21st Century. 
   I thank Senator JEFFORDS for introducing the Clean Energy Act of 1999, and I am pleased to join Senators LIEBERMAN, MOYNIHAN, SCHUMER, KENNEDY, DODD, and LAUTENBERG as an original cosponsor. I hope this legislation will help shape the Senate debate over utility restructuring and ensure that provisions to protect the environment and the public health will be part of the final legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to spend a few moments today to talk about one of the great questions to which I believe the Senate has yet to take a stand. That is the question of reform of our public school system. And Mr. President, I would suggest that today the responsibility to be creative, to be resourceful, and to empower our schools resides right here in the United States Senate. 
   I am grateful that President Clinton has recently taken a position a number of us have advocated in this age of budget surpluses. Now it's time for all of us to acknowledge that some proportion of these projected budget surpluses should be set aside for education reform--set aside in a lockbox. And, Mr. President, I would suggest that we should all be able to agree that any budget we conclude this year--if it is a budget that reflects the American people's most urgent need--must include more funding for school reform. 
   Let's be honest--as a society, there is no decision of greater importance to the long term health, stability, and competitiveness of this nation than the way we decide to educate our children. We look to public schools today to educate our children to lead in an information age and a global economy where borders have vanished--and the wealth of nations will be determined by the wisdom of their workers--by their level of training, the depth of their knowledge, and their ability to compete with workers around the world. 
   Mr. President, two hundred years ago Thomas Jefferson told us that our public schools would be ``the pillars of the republic''--he was right then, he is right now--but today there is a caveat: those public schools must also be--more than ever--the pillars of our economy and the pillars of our communities. 
   And I would respectfully suggest to you that there has not been a more urgent time than the present to reevaluate the way America's greatest democratic experiment is working--the experiment of our nation's public schools. 
   Those pillars of the republic have never before had to support so heavy a burden as they do today. In our world of telecommuting; the Internet; hundreds and soon thousands of television channels; sixty, seventy and eighty hour work weeks--there are fewer and fewer places where Americans come together in person to share in that common civic culture, fewer ways in which we unite as citizens. And more reasons, I believe, why this nation must have a great public school system. 
   And what can we say of the system before us today? I think we must say that--although there are thousands of public schools in this country doing a magnificent job of educating our children to a world class level--too many of our schools are struggling and too many kids are being left behind. 
   I believe we have a responsibility to be the true friends of public education--and the best friends are critical friends, and it is time that we seek the truth and offer our help to a system that is not doing enough for a large proportion of the 50 million children in our public schools today--children whose reading scores show that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level; children who edge out only South Africa and Cyprus on international tests in science and math, with 29 percent of all college freshmen requiring remedial classes in basic skills. 
   This year we have already passed the Ed-Flex Bill, a step forward in giving our schools the flexibility and the accountability they need to enact reform, making it a matter of law that we won't tie their hands with red tape when Governors and Mayors and local school districts are doing all they can to educate our kids, but also emphasizing that with added flexibility comes a responsibility to raise student achievement. 
   But EdFlex was just one step to balance accountability and flexibility--to continue the process of real education reform--and that is why my colleague, the Senator from Oregon, GORDON SMITH, and I have come together, in a bipartisan way--through the Kerry-Smith approach to education reform we've introduced with TED KENNEDY, MAX CLELAND, EVAN BAYH, JOHN EDWARDS, CARL LEVIN, PATTY MURRAY, RICHARD BRYAN, as well as JOHN CHAFEE, SUSAN COLLINS and OLYMPIA SNOWE from Maine. Ours is an approach which will make a difference in our schools and which can bring together leaders from across the political spectrum around good ideas which unite us. 
   For too long in this country the education debate has been stuck both nationally and locally. Leaders have been unable or unwilling to answer the challenge, trapped in a debate that is little more than an echo of old and irrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied by ideology and interest groups--both on the right and on the left. 
   Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we pride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, have we--in so many debates--been stuck in a place where Democrats and Republicans seem to talk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be always ready to throw money at the problem but never for sufficient accountability or creativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready to give a voucher to go somewhere else but rarely supportive of investing sufficient resources to make the public schools work. 
   Well, I think it is in this Congress, this year, that we can finally disengage ourselves from the political combat, and acknowledge that with so much on the line, such high stakes in our schools, you can't just talk past each other and call it reform.  
   We all need to do our part to find a new answer, and Mr. President I would respectfully suggest that in the bipartisan support you see for this approach, there is a different road we can meet on to make it happen. 
   Together we are introducing the kind of comprehensive education reform legislation that I believe will provide us a chance to come together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as the true friends of parents, children, teachers, and principals--to come together as citizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of public education in this country. We need to ask one question: ``What provides our children with the best education?'' And whether the answer is conservative, liberal or simply practical, we need to commit ourselves to that course. 
   Our bill is built on the notion of providing grants for schools with real accountability to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven best practices of any other school--Voluntary State Reform Incentive Grants so school districts that choose to finance and implement comprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models can bring forth change. We will target investments at school districts with high numbers of at-risk students and leverage local dollars through matching grants. This component of the legislation will give schools the chance to 
   quickly and easily put in place the best of what works in any other school--private, parochial or public--with decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, and high levels of volunteerism--while at the same time meeting high standards of student achievement and public accountability. I believe public schools need to have the chance to make changes not tomorrow, not five years from now, not after another study--but now--today. 
   So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school adopting the best practices of high achieving schools, building accountability into the system--what then are the key ingredients of excellence that every school needs to succeed? 
   Well, I think we can start by guaranteeing that every one of our nation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the talents and the know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; the vision to create an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer teachers and engage parents. Without those abilities, the title of principal and the freedom to lead means little. We are proposing an ``Excellent Principals Challenge Grant'' which would provide funds to local school districts to train principals in sound management skills and effective classroom practices. This bill helps our schools make being a principal the great calling of our time. 
   But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective principals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: principals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom they must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And we must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United States hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them in the next five years. In the Kerry-Smith Bill we will empower our states and school districts to find new ways to hire and train outstanding teachers: through a focus on teacher quality and training--in Title V of this bill--we can use financial incentives to attract a larger group of qualified people into the teaching profession and we can provide real ongoing education and continued training for our nation's teachers. 
   This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification policies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our standards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they are too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make teaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We know we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country to recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. Today we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal arts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. Our legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so principals have a far greater flexibility to hire liberal arts graduates as teachers, graduates who can meet high standards; while at the same time allowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to achieve a more broad based meaningful certification--the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification with its rigorous test of subject matter knowledge and teaching ability. 
   This legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our public schools--providing college scholarships for our highest achieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in our public schools. 
   We will demand a great deal from our principals and our teachers--holding them accountable for student achievement--but Mr. President we also hope to build a new consensus in America that recognizes that you can't hold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed. 
   Our bill helps to close the resource gap in public education: helping to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into arenas of violence by giving school districts incentives to write discipline codes and create ``Second Chance'' schools with a range of alternatives for chronically disruptive and violent students--everything from short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-campus alternatives, providing the resources that can, in tandem with values and character education, prevent senseless tragedy before it happens; the resources to help every child come to school ready to learn by funding successful, local early childhood development efforts; and making schools the hubs of our communities once more by providing support for after school programs where students receive tutoring, mentoring, and values-based education--the kind of programs that are open to entire communities, making public schools truly public. 
   And our legislation will help us bring a new kind accountability to public education by injecting choice and competition into a public school system badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes in monopolies. We are a country that believes competition raises quality. And we ought to merge the best of those ideas by ending a system that restricts each child to an administrator's choice and not a parent's choice where possible. It is time we adopt a competitive system of public school choice with grants awarded to schools that meet parents' test of quality and assistance to schools that must catch up rapidly. That is why our bill creates an incentive for schools all across the nation to adopt public school choice to the extent logistically feasible. 
   We are not just asking Democrats and Republicans to meet in a compromise, a grand bargain to reform public education. We are offering legislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a debate, but a vote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. Together we can embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides of the ideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of public education is not found in one concept alone--in private school vouchers or bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our children by breaking with the instinct for the symbolic, and especially the notion that a speech here and there will make education better in this country. It can't and it won't. But our hard work together in the coming year--Democrats and Republicans together--can make a difference. Education reform can work in a bi-partisan way. There is no shortage of good ideas or leadership here in the Senate--the experience of GORDON SMITH who spent years in the Oregon legislature working to balance resources and accountability to raise the quality of public education; with tireless leadership from former Governors like EVAN BAYH and JOHN CHAFEE; bi-partisan creativity from PATTY MURRAY and OLYMPIA SNOWE; and the leadership and passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my state, Senator KENNEDY, who has led the fight on education in this Senate, and who has provided this body with over 30 years of unrivaled leadership and support for education. 
   We look forward to working with all of our colleagues this year to pass this legislation, in this important year as we undergo the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act, to find common ground in ideas that we can all support--bold legislation that sends the message to parents and children struggling to find schools that work, and to teachers and principals struggling in schools simultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and starved for resources--to prove to them not just that we hear their cries for help, but that we will respond not with sound bites and salvos, but with real answers. And Mr. President, I would suggest that in this time when the United States, the richest nation on the face of the earth, leading a global economy, pushing our stock market well over 10,000, with budget surpluses we all herald at every turn, I would suggest that at this time we need to make the commitment--together, Democrats and Republicans--to give every school the chance to give every child in our country a world class education. That is an investment we can not afford to pass up--and Mr. President this is the time to do it. I look forward to working with all colleagues, Mr. President, in fashioning a budget that takes serious the American people's call for real and comprehensive education reform.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there is no shortage of ideological ferment over the issue of taxes--from IRS Reform to discussion after discussion of tax cuts, we have gone back and forth over these questions and we've worked, as much as possible, to find a bipartisan consensus. Today I am joined by my colleagues Senator GRASSLEY and Senator BAUCUS to introduce legislation about which I would think every member of this body would be able to agree--legislation that makes tax filing simpler and easier for the small businesses that constitute 98 percent of all businesses in America, employ nearly 60 percent of the workforce, and which, having created close to two-thirds of America's net new jobs since the 1970s, continue to serve as the wellspring for our Nation's technological innovation and productivity growth. 
   Mr. President, America's small businesses are today drowning in tax paperwork. The nation's 6.7 million employers are responsible for filing federal and state employment taxes and wage reports, as well as unemployment insurance reports. Under current law, employers file tax and unemployment insurance reports with federal and state agencies throughout the year, reports which obligate employers to understand and comply with diverse and often conflicting state and federal laws. Just to keep up with these requirements, employers must maintain separate wage records for federal income tax withholding, state income tax withholding, FICA, FUTA, and SUI. In many cases, employers must report this information to government agencies at different times and in different forms. The reporting burden is only compounded when employers do business in more than one state, many of which do not have the same legal or procedural requirements. Just consider the financial burden--essentially a tax  on taxes--associated with employer tax, wage, and unemployment insurance reporting is estimated at $16.2 billion for Fiscal Year 1999. The federal portion of this employer burden is $9.8 billion, the state portion relatively little less at $6.4 billion. 
   Given what we know about the role small businesses play as the engine of our economy, and given all the expectations we share in terms of the potential for these businesses to push the boundaries of economic growth out even further in the new economy, I think we would all agree that we ought to do something to relieve some of the tax filing burdens on these employers, to give them more time and, I think it follows, more capital to focus on job creation in our workforce, not, respectfully, job creation over at the IRS and in the accounting industry. 
   Let me just read to you what David A. Lifson, speaking on behalf of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, said in his testimony before the Ways and Means Committee, Oversight Subcommittee on ``The Impact of Complexity of the Tax Code on Individual Taxpayers and Small Businesses'' May 25, 1999: 
   ``Significant problems arise from the increasing complexity of the tax law. For example: a growing number of taxpayers perceive the tax law to be unfair; it becomes increasingly more difficult for the Internal Revenue Service to administer the tax law; the cost of compliance for all taxpayers is increasing (of particular concern are the many taxpayers with unsophisticated financial affairs who are forced to seek professional tax return preparation assistance); and, complexity interferes with economic decision making. The end result is erosion of voluntary compliance. By and large, our citizens obey the law, but it is only human to disobey a law if you do not or can not understand the rules. In a recent Associated Press (AP) poll, 66 percent of the respondents said that the federal tax system is too complicated. Three years ago, just under one-half of respondents in a similar AP poll said that the tax system was too complicated. The poll also showed that more than half of those surveyed, 56 percent, now pay someone else to prepare their tax returns. This is a serious indictment of our tax system. When over half our individual taxpayers have so little comprehension of (or faith in) their tax system that they have to hire another party to prepare their returns, something is not right.'' 
   Now, Mr. President, I applaud David Lifson's candor in speaking out for tax simplification. The truth is, when the one industry--accounting--which depends financially on the very complexity and unwieldiness of our tax filing process and the tax code itself, is saying--honestly--that the system is too complex, we know--unequivocally--that we need to do something to make the tax filing process work for taxpayers. The burden of tax code complexity is taking a heavy toll. At an April hearing before the Senate Small Business Committee, the General Accounting Office identified more than 200 different federal tax code requirements that potentially apply to small businesses. Today, when a business hires an employee, the business becomes responsible for collecting and paying three federal taxes (income tax withholding, FICA, and FUTA). It also becomes liable for state and local employment taxes: in most states, these include a state income tax and a state unemployment tax. For businesses, each tax presents its own set of rules and regulations. For the small business owner just starting up, these employment tax rules make compliance difficult and confusing--and in too many instances the cumbersome nature of the tax filing process is a disincentive in itself for small businesses to grow. 
   We need to reverse that course, and, Mr. President, we can do just that today--we can simplify the tax filing process for employers by allowing the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and State agencies to combine, on one form, both State and Federal employment tax returns. 
   As we all know, traditionally, federal tax forms are filed with the federal government and state tax forms are filed with individual states. This necessitates duplication of items common to both returns. Several States have been working creatively with the IRS to implement combined State and Federal reporting of employment taxes, on one form, as a way of reducing the administrative burden on taxpayers. The Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 authorized a demonstration project to assess the feasibility and desirability of expanding combined reporting. The pilot project was: (1) limited to the State of Montana, (2) limited to employment tax reporting, (3) limited to disclosure of the name, address, taxpayer identification number, and signature of the taxpayer, and (4) limited to a period of five years. On March 29, 1999, the IRS announced the successful testing of the Single-Point Filing Initiative. Several States are currently considering agreements with the IRS to initiate joint-filing of employment taxes. Those States include Maine, Oklahoma, Iowa, South Carolina, Ohio, and Massachusetts. My colleague Senator BAUCUS knows just how popular this experiment has been in Montana. He'll tell you that by permitting the IRS to share a limited amount of basic taxpayer identity information--information which States already collect separately at an added expense to themselves and the taxpayer, the Single-Point Tax Filing Act we are introducing today will allow the IRS to expand joint-filing beyond its current pilot project. 
   Implementation of combined State-Federal employment tax reporting--a good idea, a common-sense idea long in the making--has been hindered because the tax code applies restrictions on disclosure of information common to both the State and Federal portions of the combined form. Our bill will waive those restrictions, and allow us to take a common-sense step forward for small businesses in the United States, a step forward for single-point tax filing. 
   Mr. President, this is one of the obligations the American people--regardless of party or politics, expect us to take seriously--to protect them as taxpayers. And I believe that this is one tax provision, one measure of simplification, on which we can all agree--and we can make it law at no additional cost to taxpayers. I am pleased to introduce the Single Point Tax Filing legislation today, I thank the distinguished members of the Finance Committee CHARLES GRASSLEY and MAX BAUCUS who join me today in offering this legislation, and I ask for your support of this important measure.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment of the Senator from Kansas. This amendment gives the President authority to provide assistance for the countries of the South Caucasus and Central Asia--that is, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. The purpose of this amendment is to reestablish the ancient Silk Road trading route and to gain access to the oil and gas resources of the region. In so doing, it has serious implications for Armenia and for ongoing international efforts to promote a solution to the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh, because it allows the President to waive Section 907 of the Freedom Support Act, which I originally authored. That legislation prohibited aid to the Government of Azerbaijan as long as it maintains a blockade against Armenia. 
   One of the objectives of the Brownback amendment is to foster the development of regional economic cooperation. Yet, this amendment ignores some fundamental facts on the ground. First, Armenia continues to be blockaded to the east by Azerbaijan and to the West by Turkey. Second, Azerbaijan insists on establishing and maintaining east-west energy, rail and road corridors that deliberately bypass Armenia. Although Armenia is one of the countries that could benefit from this bill in theory, in reality it is totally isolated by the situation on the ground. 
   This bill does nothing to address these realities. There are no provisions requiring that blockades be lifted or that all borders be opened before aid is extended. By failing to include these requirements, the bill in effect legitimizes these blockades and helps Azerbaijan to continue to use them to marginalize Armenia and keep it weak. 
   The ten-year blockade of Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh by the Azeri government has cut off the transport of food, fuel, medicine and other vital goods. This blockade has been strengthened by Turkey, which has had a similar blockade for the last six years. 
   Section 907 is not a sanction but rather an effort to use the leverage embodied in US aid to create a level playing field for Armenia and to encourage the government of Azerbaijan to take some of the basic steps necessary if a peaceful resolution of the conflict is to be found. Section 907, as formulated in current law, prohibits US government economic and military assistance to the Azeri government, but it permits humanitarian and democracy building aid. 
   All Azerbaijan must do to get section 907 lifted is to ``take demonstrable steps to cease all blockades against Armenia and Nagorno-Karabakh.'' By allowing the President to waive Sec. 907, this bill legitimizes Azerbaijan's blockade and rewards its rejection of the 1998 OSCE compromise peace proposal. This only complicates efforts by the international community to foster a settlement to the conflict. The greatest weakness of this Brownback amendment is that it is totally silent on the peace process. 
   Mr. President, I will vote against the Brownback amendment and in support of the McConnell amendment, which removes the President's ability to waive Sec. 907.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering today calls on the President to begin multilateral negotiations for the purpose of establishing a permanent multilateral regime to govern the transfer of conventional arms to countries that engage in persistent violations of human rights, engage in acts of armed aggression, do not fully participate in the United Nations Register of Conventional, and countries in regions in which arms transfers would exacerbate regional arms races or international tensions. 
   As the United States and its allies work to expand the community of democratic nations and prevent the spread of violence and ethnic conflict, we must give higher priority to consideration of how conventional arms transfers may work to undermine these important objectives. It is simply not in our interest to allow weapons to flow freely into countries who abuse the rights of their citizens or who are engaged in conflict or destabilizing arms races. 
   International restraint in arms exports is important to U.S. national security interests, as well as for the furtherance of democracy and human rights. The June 1996 ``Report of the Presidential Advisory Board on Arms Proliferation Policy'' concluded that U.S. and international security are threatened by the proliferation of advanced conventional weapons. According to the Report, ``The world struggles today with the implications of advanced conventional weapons. It will in the future be confronted with yet another generation of weapons, whose destructive power, size, cost, and availability can raise many more problems even than their predecessors today. These challenges will require a new culture among nations, one that accepts increased responsibility for control and restraint, despite short-term economic and political factors pulling in other directions.'' An international Code of Conduct is a step toward that new culture. 
   The United States is far-and-away the world's biggest arms merchant, and we must lead the way for the rest of the world in addressing this issue. But we cannot do it alone. A unilateral decision by the United States to limit conventional arms transfers would be an important signal of our commitment to this issue, but it would not stop the flow of weapons into the countries about whom we are most concerned. We should be under no illusion about the ability or willingness of other arms-producing nations to rush in and fill any gap we might create. This amendment will require the President to expand international efforts to curb worldwide arms sales through the United Nations and other fora, such as the Wassenaar Agreement, and to report to the Congress on progress made during these negotiations. 
   The United States should lead the way to establishing a multilateral regime to prevent nations that ignore the rights of their citizens or bully their neighbors from obtaining the weapons that support these nefarious activities. This legislation can be the vehicle to accomplish this important objective. I thank the managers of this bill for accepting my amendment.

Mr. President, the pending bill prohibits the Administration from providing aid to the central government of Cambodia pending certification by the Secretary of State that Cambodia has held free and fair elections, that the Central Election Commission was comprised of representatives from all parties, and that the Cambodian government has established an international panel of jurists to try individuals who have committed genocide against the Cambodian people. 
   I share the Committee's view that aid can be a source of leverage in dealing with the new Cambodian government, and I agree that we should use our aid to encourage the Cambodian government to establish a credible, internationally acceptable genocide tribunal. However, I do not believe that the conditions in the bill provide us with effective leverage because they are outdated and irrelevant to the realities on the ground in Cambodia today. 
   All of us who are involved with Cambodia recognize full well that the elections held last July in Cambodia were a mixed bag at best. The process leading up to the elections had flaws. The elections themselves were quite successful in terms of large voter turnout, lack of intimidation, international monitoring, and lack of violence. But they were less than perfect. 
   Cambodians know this, but they have moved on. They have formed a new coalition government with what appears to be a workable power sharing arrangement between the two major parties. They have an effective opposition party. The Khmer Rouge is no longer a military or political player, looming as a threat to the new government. The climate of political intimidation and violence that has so often characterized Cambodia is no longer prevalent.  The new Cambodian government has put forth a policy platform which, if implemented, would enable Cambodia to make real strides toward the establishment of democratic institutions and processes. 
   In light of these realities, it makes no sense to put restrictions on our aid that simply cut off the aid and prevent us from using US aid as an incentive to move the Cambodian government to deal with the serious problems that are on the table now--building an independent judiciary, reforming the military and the policy so that they are professional, neutral and accountable, providing health care and schooling, and tackling the overwhelming problem of poverty. 
   The amendment that I am offering with Senator MCCAIN replaces the conditions in the bill with new conditions designed to promote the building of democratic institutions and to encourage the Cambodian government to establish a tribunal consistent with the requirements of international law and justice to try those guilty of genocide and crimes against humanity. 
   Specifically, this amendment prohibits aid to the central government pending a certification by the Secretary of State that Cambodia is making significant progress in establishing an independent and accountable judicial system, a professional military subordinate to civilian control, and a neutral and accountable police force. The amendment also requires the Secretary to certify that the Cambodian government has established a tribunal consistent with the requirements of international law and justice and including the participation of international jurists and prosecutors for the trial of those who committed genocide or crimes against humanity. 
   Let me say a word about the condition related to the tribunal. When I was in Cambodia in April, I had extensive discussions with Prime Minister Hun Sen, National Assembly Chairman Prince Ranarridh, King Sihanouk, and others about the issues related to the constitution of a genocide tribunal. While the Prime Minister insisted that the tribunal be in Cambodia, he agreed with my proposal that international judges, prosecutors and investigators actively participate in the process. He also indicated that he would support changes in Cambodian law to allow these individuals to actively operate within the Cambodian judicial system. Prince Ranariddh and King Sihanouk also were supportive of this concept. 
   I believe that this kind of tribunal, with meaningful international participation, could provide a credible and accountable process, consistent with international law and standards, for trying those who committed genocide and crimes against humanity. The carrot of US aid can serve as an important incentive for the Cambodian government to follow through on this process. 
   Mr. President, I believe this is a good amendment and I thank the managers for accepting it.

   Mr. KERRY. I congratulate my colleague on his leadership with respect to this. In the years that the Senator served on the Foreign Affairs Committee, in all those years with the visits of Lech Walesa, the visits of Vaclav Havel, and we have all shared wonderful moments with leaders of countries where the curtain fell--I think I recall each of those leaders saying it was the ability of people to come in during the time things were shut, to share with them the sense of what was happening elsewhere, the possibilities, bringing information, to bring them hope; that, indeed, was one of the great sustaining values and empowerments that brought them ultimately to the point of sharing the freedom that we have. 
   I wonder if the Senator wouldn't agree that it is almost totally contradictory with a Stalinist, tight police structure. In fact, by not having intercourse with other people elsewhere--the discussion, the movement of people, the discourse, the exchange of ideas that comes with it--you are, in fact, empowering the capacity of that secrecy and of that closed society to keep the hammer down on people, and that flies directly contrary to all of the experience we have learned from those wonderful visits we have had.

I ask my colleague if, in fact, by denying that exchange, those people the right to travel and connect with relatives and others within the country, if we don't provide Fidel Castro with the selectivity and greater capacity to restrict what information they get, when they get it, how they get it, and if, in fact, we aren't playing right into his capacity to keep a stranglehold--which is the very thing we are trying to undo.

   Mr. KERRY. I just make the point to the Senator that, having spoken with a lot of people who have gone down there and made some of those trips, the families aren't restricted in that way. They meet with relations. They tell people what is going on in the United States. They talk about their feelings about Fidel Castro. 
   What is amazing about this debate, what is absolutely stupefying, is that what the Senators seem to be defending is completely contrary now to the experience since 1959. We went through the whole 1960s, went through the Bay of Pigs, went through the 1970s. We went through the height of the Reagan opposition to the Iron Curtain and through all of the changes in Russia, the former Soviet Union, the former east bloc countries. We have seen the dynamics of that change. 
   The one place where our policy remains the same as it has throughout all of those years is the place where  there has been the least change. One of the reasons they had the power to shoot down those four planes is that there is no movement in the relationship, because they are as isolated. 
   If you look at the experience of Cubans, restricted, who go back to Cuba to visit their families, limited by the United States of America to one visit a year with their own family, you find that they are the ones saying to us today, we would like to have the right to travel to visit our families as frequently as we can. I am confident that the same kinds of changes that swept over the rest of the world will sweep over that tiny island.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the pending bill fails to authorize the Administration's full request for funding for U.S. contributions to international organizations and for U.S. contributions to international peacekeeping activities. I am pleased to cosponsor the amendment offered by my colleague, the Senator from Maryland, because it at least partially rectifies this situation by bringing the authorization for one of these two accounts up to the Administration's full request for Fiscal year 2000. 
   The bill before us today makes significant strides in the on-going efforts of the Congress and the Administration to pay U.S. arrears to the United Nations and achieve much-needed reforms in that organization. I commend both the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator HELMS, and the ranking Democrat, Senator BIDEN, for this important accomplishment. Working closely together and working closely with the Administration, they have reached an agreement that will allow the United States to begin restoring its status as a member-in-good standing of the UN. 
   I believe many of my colleagues share my profound relief that, with this bill, the United States will take an important step toward paying what we owe to the United Nations. For the United States to fail to meet its treaty obligations as a founding member of the United Nations is, in my opinion, conduct unworthy of this great nation. 
   In our increasingly interconnected world, even a great nation--even the sole remaining superpower--can not protect and advance its national interests alone. We need not look any further than the last few weeks, as the United States and our NATO allies have worked to bring an end to the conflict in Kosovo, to see just how important the UN is to our ability to exert positive international leadership. For every day we have allowed U.S. dues to go unpaid and U.S. arrears to mount, our leadership in the UN has been subtly, but surely undermined. As we take the important step today of authorizing the payment of most of what we owe to the UN, we just as surely take a step toward reinforcing U.S. leadership around the world. 
   This bill does not, unfortunately, authorize payment of the full amount the State Department says we owe the UN. Of the $1.021 billion we acknowledge that we owe, this bill only authorizes payment of $819 million in direct payments and $107 million in debt forgiveness. We still fall $95 million short. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Committee to ensure that the full amount of U.S. arrears to the UN are paid. 
   The amendment offered by Senator SARBANES, by ensuring the authorization of full-funding for what the U.S. currently owes for peacekeeping is  critical to continuing the hard-fought effort to restore U.S. standing in the United Nations. By cutting the level of our current contributions to the UN's regular budget and peacekeeping activities as this bill does, we run the risk of increasing our arrears in the very same bill where we are paying them down. The amendment offered by Senator SARBANES would ensure that we do not take one step forward and two steps back on paying what we owe to the United Nations. I strongly support this amendment. 
   Mr. BIDEN addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I understand a couple of Senators are out of town and therefore are not, even though they may want to, able to physically meet the unanimous consent request of the chairman. I wonder if the purposes of the Senate in moving this legislation forward are not equally well served by narrowing the universe of amendments by requiring that they all be laid down before the hour when there will be no further votes. We will then have a fixed universe of amendments, and we can begin debating them and proceed rapidly.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, at an appropriate time I may send an amendment to the desk. But I want to begin at least talking about where we are, where this bill currently puts us, and I have a number of points I would like to make in the effort to do that. 
   I am struck by one thing that has just happened, which is why I am a little less hesitant. 
   A few moments ago, the Senator from Colorado put in an amendment that preserved the State law; but at the same time the Senator from Oregon previously had made it very clear that their bill leaves in place the existing State law protections for consumers in both tort law and contract, but, in fact, what has happened is by virtue of the amendment just passed by the Senator from Colorado, they have actually changed that so that we have a different law for both contract and for tort. 
   It seems to me the bill has already, suddenly, by acceptance, moved to a significantly different place from what they had intended. Maybe this will be worked out later. I think it certainly makes this bill more complicated in many regards and will probably give yet another reason for the White House to veto this. 
   Let me state where I think we are with respect to this legislation. I supported willfully, happily, and with a sense of pride the securities reform legislation. Senator DODD was a leader on that, and I voted for it and voted to override the veto of the President because I thought it was important to address what was an egregious overreach within the legal community where we saw a pattern of abuse. We took action as a result of that. I think it was the right action. 
   In addition, I also voted for tort reform with respect to the aircraft industry, because Senator Kassebaum appropriately brought legislation to the Senate that made it clear that liability issues with respect to manufacturers--and she represented a State which is the home base for Cessna, among other aircraft manufacturers--and we made an appropriate change in liability law in the capacity of lawyers to bring these so-called dreaded lawsuits that we hear a lot about on the 
   Senate floor. I voted for that and we changed it. It was for the better. 
   I say that because I want to make it as clear as I can in an atmosphere where people are quick to try to paint Members into a corner or sweep Members into one position of ideology or another. I am approaching this from a perspective of what I hope is common sense and fairness. 
   I heard the distinguished Senator from Arizona--who is a great personal friend of mine and a man for whom I have enormous respect and a great relationship--say a few minutes ago, and I will certainly pass it off merely as rhetoric, that the amendment I will offer is ``form over substance'' and it is designed to ``protect the income stream of the trial lawyers.'' It is exactly that kind of polarization in the rhetoric that is preventing Members from looking at what the Senate may or may not do here, what the Congress may or may not do, and what may happen to the American citizens that we represent. 
   I challenge my colleagues to show me one piece of language in the amendment that I will submit that makes it easier for a lawyer to bring a lawsuit. There is not one. In point of fact, every point raised by the high-technology community that they wanted Members to address is addressed in their favor--in favor of the high-tech community. They wanted a period to cure; we provide a period to cure. They wanted mitigation; we put a responsibility on plaintiffs to mitigate. They wanted economic loss and contract preserved; we preserve contract law. Finally, they wanted proportionality; all we require for them to qualify for proportionality is that they act as a good citizen and do two things: We ask they identify the potential in the product they make for a Y2K failure, and having done so, we ask that they let their purchasers, their clients, know of that potential. 
   That is all we ask. We don't ask that they fix it. They have a duty; they have a period of cure within which they can fix it. If they fix it within the duty, a period of cure, as the McCain bill, they would be free from any lawsuit. 
   That doesn't help plaintiffs. That is not a plaintiff's bill. That is not an effort to maintain the revenue stream for lawyers. 
   Let's talk about the reality of what is happening here. The reality is that an industry is coming to the Congress for the first time in American history and asking for prospective anticipatory relief from liability for something they make--the first time ever. 
   What would happen if Ford Motor Company came in here and said: Gee, we produced a car that instead of turning right while turning the wheel right, turns left. Forgive us. We will fix it. Don't worry. 
   There are similar ways in which companies could come to a Senator and say they don't want to be held liable because they ``kind of overlooked something.'' 
   As the Senator from South Carolina said a little while ago, 20 years ago people knew about this. The founder and executive director of RX 2000 Solutions Institute said:  
   I am a former computer programmer who used two digits instead of four to delineate the year. Granted, this was more than 20 years ago, but even then I was aware of the anomaly posed by the year 2000. When I expressed concern to my supervisor, he laughed and told me not to worry.  
   The Y2K bug is not something that just fell out of the sky. 
   The Y2K bug is not a freak occurrence that happened as a God-given act. The Y2K problem is a result of conscious choices that people made or didn't make, deliberate decisions made to delay fixing a problem. They have led us to where we are now. 
   I represent high-technology companies, and I am very proud of them. I have had the support of high-technology CEOs, workers, and employees. I truly have a respect for the entrepreneurial capacity and the extraordinary path they are leading us on that is second to nobody in the Senate, and I understand the nature and complexity of this Y2K problem that suggests we don't want to have a wholesale slug of lawsuits that clog the courts, that create the capacity for small companies to tie up their capital, to diminish further entrepreneurial effort, to reduce creativity.  
   I understand all of those arguments. Together with Senator ROBB, Senator DASCHLE, Senator REID, Senator MIKULSKI, and Senator AKAKA, I am offering a compromise. It is not everything that the Chamber of Commerce wants, and it sure isn't everything the lawyers want. However, it is common sense, and it will be signed by the President of the United States into law. The bill that is being offered by Senator MCCAIN and others will not in its current form be signed into law. 
   If Members are really concerned about the Y2K problem and want to do something about it, we have an opportunity to legislate on the floor of the Senate in a way that is fair, that makes sense, and that will help the companies deal with Y2K, and at the same time, it doesn't turn around and ignore common sense about how to leverage good behavior within the community. 
   People ask, What are the real differences between this bill and Senator MCCAIN's bill? I will get to that. I will explain that. Two of the most important are on the issue of proportionality. That takes a little bit of explanation. Not everybody in the Senate is a lawyer. There are 55 Members who are, but even among lawyers there has always been a great tension on this issue of joint and several liability versus proportional damages. 
   Under the bill that Senator MCCAIN, Senator DODD, and Senator WYDEN are offering the Senate, a company will automatically get proportional liability. They don't have to be a good citizen. They don't have to go out and remediate, even though they say that remediation is the purpose of their legislation. There is no leverage in getting out of joint and several liability that encourages them to remediate. They automatically get proportional damages. The bill gives it to them right up front--automatic. So they could display the most negligent, the most reckless behavior, and still they get it. Is that possible? Some people will sit here and say no, that is not going to happen. 
   Look at the instance the Senator from South Carolina talked about. Ford Motor Company is historically recorded as having made a conscious business decision to measure how much it cost them to move the gas tanks and fix the gas tank problem versus the potential of damages. They chose not to move it and ultimately it caught up to them in a famous, famous case and they paid the price. That is why we have had something called punitive damages. 
   Punitive damages are not, as the Senator from Arizona said, simply to deter. Punitive damages are punitive. They are to punish in addition to deter. The deterrence is not just as to the behavior of the entity that is creating the problems. The deterrent is as to other potential entities, in the future. The reason we have the potential of punitives within the legal system is not just to deter behavior among a particular set of actors engaged in a particular behavior at a particular time. It is to say to other actors at a future time: If you do not heed the warning that the products you make could subject you to particular kinds of damages, then you, too, may be subject to them in the future. That is why, today, young kids have pajamas that don't catch on fire. That is why, today, people have all kinds of products in their homes where people are sensitive to 
   what the impact of that product may be on a user. 
   My colleagues come in here and say we don't want punitives. These outrageous lawyers are going to come in and maybe get a punitive damage verdict. Let me tell you what my colleagues, either inadvertently or willfully, are doing. They are protecting companies from a requirement that the behavior they engage in has to be--let me make this very clear. Punitive damages are only awarded if a plaintiff can show the defendant acted in the worst activity possible, worse than mere negligence. We are talking about a defendant who has to commit either an intentional tort or otherwise here, because in their bill they have a very narrow limitation as to who will qualify for joint and several, very narrow. The fact is, they will exempt anybody who acts willfully, wantonly, maliciously, recklessly or outrageously. 
   I ask a simple question: What is the public policy rationale for coming in here and saying that a company that acted maliciously, willfully, recklessly, outrageously should somehow be completely exempted from the potential of joint and several liability and have a blanket exemption even before the fact? I do not understand that. I do not understand the public policy. Just because we do not like lawyers, just because on a few occasions there have been a couple of bad jury verdicts of punitive damages--which in every occasion, I say to my friends, have been reduced by the court on appeal. Those never get paid. They are great for headlines. They are wonderful for bad reputations for lawyers. But they don't get paid because the courts reduce them. 
   So I do not want to come here to the floor of the Senate and battle phantoms. I don't want to battle dragons that do not exist. I want to deal with the real problem of Y2K, and we deal with the real problem of Y2K because we make it tougher for lawyers to bring cases. I agree with what my colleague, the Senator from Connecticut, said a few minutes ago. He said we, in a litigious society, do not want a lot of frivolous lawsuits. We do not want to be caught up in court with a whole lot of lawsuits that are inappropriate. 
   I agree with that. I was outraged when I heard about lawyers automatically triggering lawsuits by computer when stocks changed and so forth. That is an abuse of the system. We ought to do everything in our power to require that the Federal courts, through the rules that are available to them, hold lawyers accountable so that frivolous lawsuits are denied and so forth. But we go farther than that. In my amendment, on Y2K we in fact lay out a series of requirements that make it much tougher for any lawyer to bring a case. Just like the legislation of Senator MCCAIN, ours is a 3-year bill. But ours is a 3-year bill that does not harm consumers. Ours is a 3-year bill that has a fair balance between this interest for remediation or mitigation and what we are prepared to contribute to the well-being of the whole industry, to blanket the whole industry. 
   Let me be specific about what I mean by that. The Y2K bill of Senator MCCAIN and company provides you automatically get proportionality, proportional damages. Ours says you have to do two things. You have to make the effort to identify the potential for a Y2K failure and then put out the information to the people you have dealt with about that potential. 
   The purpose of this legislation is to get companies to fix the problem ahead of time. In order to get a company to fix the problem ahead of time, you want to have the maximum incentive to the company. So if you say to the company: Look, you can have the lower standard. You can have what you want--which is you can get out from under joint and several; you can have proportional liability--but we want you to do something so you will encourage the very remediation and mitigation we are looking for. We want you to look at your products and see what the potential is for one of them to have a Y2K failure. When you find the potential, we want you to be a good citizen and tell the people who bought the things from you about it. 
   Why is that better than Senator MCCAIN's bill? It is better because of the Pinto principle. Some companies may look at the situation and say: Hey, the Senate just gave us proportional liability and we don't even have to worry about paying the full 80 percent if we think we have only 20 percent liability because we don't have to do anything. They gave it to us. It is cheaper for us not to fix it and wait and see if anybody comes after us. And when they do come after us, all we are going to have to do is do the 20 percent, not the 80 percent. I ask my colleagues, how is that an incentive for the good fixing of the problem beforehand that we are seeking? 
   The answer is, it is not. It will have exonerated people before the fact from the very thing we are trying to encourage, which is the incentive to fix it. 
   I find it very hard to believe that my colleagues in the Senate want to vote against asking companies to be good citizens. I find it hard to believe that my colleagues are unwilling to say a company ought to just look for the potential of failure. We do not require that they absolutely find it. We do not  require that they identify it. They have to make a good-faith effort to look for it.

   Mr. KERRY. It says:  
   Keane believes the most recent draft of the Kerry language is a politically viable solution, because it serves the purpose of protecting against frivolous Y2K litigation and would be signed by the President. 
   Opponents of the Kerry bill argue that it does not adequately address the distribution of damages to the responsible parties. However, Keane believes that the proportional liability language in the Kerry bill addresses this issue. Specifically, your staff has assured us that your language would protect defendants who demonstrate that the plaintiff restricted access to or failed to notify the defendant about any function that could corrupt other Y2K vulnerable systems and defendants who (1) performed a reasonable assessment with a defined methodology for resolution of the plaintiff's Y2K vulnerability prior to implementing the solution, or, (2) implemented the Y2K solution with coordinated comprehensive testing and quality assurance processes. ..... Keane can endorse the Kerry language without reservation.  
   I believe that is reasonable, and I believe it is reasonable because they have looked at the reality of the language we have put forward. I want to go through a little bit of this now. 
   The McCain bill does not protect the individual consumer. They are requiring the individual person to go through the same hoops and the same requirements as a corporation. Again one has to ask: What is the public policy rationale for asking one--let's say one of these people sitting up in the gallery is assured, when they buy an alarm system for their house, that the alarm system is Y2K compatible. But they leave to go on vacation, the alarm system fails in the year 2000, their house is robbed, and they want recoupment. 
   They have to go through every hoop of a large corporation. They cannot go right in, file their suit, and get redress. They are going to have to be treated like the other corporate entities, and they cannot even get the discovery. They are left as powerless as, unfortunately, the average consumer is in our society today. 
   Again, when one looks at public policy rationale, it is hard to discern, and this is the main reason: Most of the Y2K problems that people are envisioning are corporation to corporation. We are talking about contract law. Most of this is contract law, and what we are talking about are companies that are going to have an interest conceivably in suing another company because the product they bought from that company does not do what the company that sold it to them said it would do. 
   Maybe under their warranties, just under the contract, it will be taken care of. But what the McCain bill wants to do is say to every American consumer: You are going to have to wait 3 months; you are going to have to wait the 30 days for the filing; you are going to have to refile if you were not filing with pleadings that were specific enough, according to what the corporation had to go through. 
   It is a remarkable thing, in my judgment, to thrust that kind of burden on a lot of situations that would be very difficult. Let me give you an example. This is very specific, and I apologize, it will take a minute, but I want to go through it. 
   Let's take a Mrs. Barnes who owns a home several streets away from the Acme Chemical Company. There are 85 million Americans who live or work within a 5-mile radius of one or more of the 66,000 facilities that handle or store high-hazard chemicals. Let me repeat that: 85 million of our fellow citizens live in homes near a chemical company. 
   On January 1, 2000, let's assume Acme's safety system fails and hazardous chemicals are released into the air and on to the land in the neighborhood. It forces Mrs. Barnes and others to evacuate their homes. People are allowed back into their homes after 2 days, but Mrs. Barnes' property is contaminated, including her well. She retains an attorney and she files a tort claim for recovery. 
   Acme Chemical claims that a Y2K computer failure was partially at fault for the safety system malfunctioning. Mrs. Barnes did not know that Y2K was a defense, of course, because most average citizens will not know this. 
   Under the new law, the Acme Company will treat the complaint as the notice. She has to wait 30 days for Acme to respond. In 30 days, they respond by saying: We can't pay for the cleanup and lost value. But she has to wait another 60 days to refile her lawsuit, notwithstanding that they tell her that. 
   Now the average American consumer is out 90 days and does not know where they are going, because we have protected the entity. All discovery is stayed during this period. There is not anybody in our system of justice who does not know what happens when you stay discovery for 90 days. 
   In 2 months, Mrs. Barnes refiles her suit. She refiles it against the company that installed the safety system. Under the McCain bill, she has to plead her case with a particularity in the complaint. She can state her damages as required, but she is going to have a lot of trouble specifying the materiality effect because she will not know what that is because there has been no discovery. The case is dismissed because the complaint failed to meet the pleadings requirements. 
   Assume somehow she can meet the pleadings requirement. She comes back, she finds other information to survive another motion to dismiss, and finally gets her day in court. 
   After hearing the case, the jury finds both defendants acted recklessly and outrageously for not identifying and fixing the problem, and it awards her $300,000 compensation for the property and the need to replace her water supply. They may find that Acme is 70 percent responsible and the safety system 30 percent liable under the proportionality. The total amount of her award might be $1.3 million, with the compensatory and punitive adjusted and reduced by the number of people according to the cap, because they only have 40 people who work for them. Under the cap in S. 96, that would be an adjusted award of $550,000.  
   We find that Acme cannot pay for all of the damage and files for bankruptcy. The safety system pays Mrs. Barnes $90,000 under their percentage, but that is not enough to clean up her property. She cannot get a new water supply, especially after she pays the legal bills. 
   She tries to collect from Acme but without success. In the end, under the State law she would have received her $1.3 million, but because we are going to take that away, at the end, because of the Senate bill that is contemplated being passed here that does not protect this individual consumer, she will be left with only $135,000--not nearly enough to compensate for her loss, pay her legal fees, replenish her well and make her whole. 
   What is the public policy here? That is literally how this bill would work. That is taking us step by step through the requirements that are being put on the average American here, even though what we are really talking about doing here is protecting companies from lawsuits by companies. 
   To the degree that my colleagues say: Wait a minute, Senator. We know about those naughty things called class actions, and we don't want to have a class action brought against us, I say to my colleagues, I agree. We want to have a tough standard for the potential of any class action. 
   So we have put in our bill something lawyers do not like; we have put in our bill a materiality requirement that means they have to show that very specificity of defect, and it has to be specifically material to the impact on that particular damage that took place for that person. The majority of the people who make up the class have to have the same linkage to the materiality. That makes it very hard to go out and just construct a class. So I think class actions would, in fact, be seriously reduced and impacted in an appropriate way, I might add. So we are raising the bar. We are raising the standard. 
   Our bill, therefore, in my judgment, protects consumers. The McCain bill would apply all of its procedural burdens and damage limitations to individual consumers. I know that this is one of the things that the White House, the President, is particularly concerned about. We need to try to find some kind of reasonable compromise. We have not. And that begs a veto. 
   In addition, I have talked about the proportionality issue. It is hard to believe that colleagues would not be willing to vote that a company ought to engage in good citizen behavior of a two-step effort to identify mere potential--I underscore that mere potential; the company does not have to find the problem; the company does not have to cure the problem--they have to find the mere potential that something that they have created may have done it; and, two, let people know that they have done that. It is hard to believe that we would not vote to do that. 
   In addition to that, we impose an additional duty on the plaintiff. My colleague from Arizona said this is to keep the revenue stream going. We impose an additional duty on the plaintiff because existing State law generally requires plaintiffs to mitigate their losses in the case of a breach of contract. S. 96 puts on the plaintiff an additional burden to mitigate that isn't part of additional contract law, which allows a defendant to argue that the plaintiff should have avoided the damages based on information that was in the public domain. 
   So what we have done, to encourage information sharing and in order to encourage the remediation that we want, we leave the existing State law duties in place, supplementing them with an additional mitigation requirement if the defendant itself made the information available. 
   Why is that good policy? Because, again, it encourages the good behavior that our colleagues are saying everybody is going 
   to engage in but for which there is no certainty and there is no leverage. 
   Here you have an additional burden on the plaintiff if the company undertook to share the information. What does that do? That means that the company is going to say: Oh, boy, if we go out and get the information and we put it out to the people we have sold it to, they are going to have the burden of showing that we somehow did not do what we were supposed to. We have shifted the burden to the people who then would be the plaintiffs. It makes it harder to bring a case. It also does more to encourage the mitigation that we want to get in this particular effort. 
   I want to make it very clear, I think it was back in April the Senator from Arizona, the chairman, put a letter in the RECORD from Andy Grove of Intel. The letter that was part of Mr. Grove's communication to the chairman. I will read the relevant portion of it:  
   Dear Senator MCCAIN ..... The consensus text that has evolved from continuing bipartisan discussions would substantially encourage [bipartisan] action and discourage frivolous lawsuits.  
   He cited several key measures that are essential to ensure fair treatment of all parties under the law. 
   One was procedural incentives, the requirement of notice and an opportunity to cure defects before a suit is filed. 
   Senator MCCAIN has that in his bill. We have that in our bill: The same procedural requirement to cure, the same procedural effort to have alternative dispute resolution. We both encourage alternative dispute resolution and mitigation. 
   Second point: A requirement that courts respect the agreements of the parties on such matters as warranty obligations and definition of recoverable damages. 
   Senator MCCAIN does that; we do that. We provide the exact provision of contract protection except where there is an intentional--intentional--injury to a party. I ask my colleagues, what is the public policy rationale for exempting a company from an intentional wrongdoing to an individual that is not a specific intent to that individual but nevertheless fits under the concept of a reckless, willful, or wanton act? 
   Third, Mr. Grove said he wanted threshold pleading provisions requiring particularity as to the nature, amount, and factual basis for damages and materiality of defects. We do the same thing. Senator MCCAIN does that; we do that. 
   Finally, appointment of liability according to fault, on principles approved by the Senate in two previous measures. That is the securities reform bill. I have already spoken to that. 
   Senator MCCAIN gives it to them no matter what, forget it. You just get it because you are who you are. We give it to them if they take two steps: Identify the potential for a Y2K problem, which is what this bill is all about, and let the people they have dealt with know about that potential. 
   Again, we do not require that they fix it. We do not require with a certainty that they find it. We require that they just say there is a potential. That is what they have to go out and fix. 
   The fact is that is a minimalist standard that most companies ought to be prepared to live by. Every company I have talked to tells me they are doing that. Of course, they are going to do that. They would have no reason to be concerned about that. 
   So the real fight here, I suppose, is over punitive damages and over the breadth of reach that some people are making with respect to some other efforts which I can go into later as they arise in the course of the debate. 
   We have a consumer carveout. We have a duty to mitigate. We have proportionate liability. 
   The McCain bill also creates jurisdiction for almost all Y2K class actions in Federal court. We do not do that. First of all, the Federal bar has told us they cannot handle it. They do not have room for whatever that might mean. Secondly, I cannot think of anything less respectful of States rights, of the States' abilities to manage their own affairs with respect to how they want to proceed. There is no showing that that is, in fact, necessary. So the reach of the bill, in fact, goes further than that which is necessary to fix Y2K. 
   I want to emphasize that I still hope maybe we can find some medium where people will come together. It may be that the Senate isn't in the mood to do that right now, so it will just go ahead and pass S. 96--it will go to conference, come back, and then go to the President, and he will veto it, and we will come back. Or maybe when the President gets into the negotiations in the conference committee, the very things I am talking about will be resolved, and it will come back to us in a way that people of good conscience can say: This is good public policy because it protects consumers even as it creates a  fair process for the avoidance of frivolous suits and the avoidance of the burdening of an industry that we all respect and care about. 
   I think our bill does that. I think our bill justifiably protects the capacity of companies to be free from frivolous lawsuits. It increases the pleading requirements. It provides a cure period. It provides a duty to mitigate. It shifts a greater duty to the plaintiffs, and it does so, I think, in a reasonable and fair-minded way. 
   I regret that, unfortunately, this debate has been so caught up in a larger agenda of entities that are very forceful outside of the Senate. 
   I yield the floor.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I intend to send my amendment to the desk. It is more inadvertence than anything else, and enthusiasm. I am not going to delay it whatsoever. I agree with him. We want to get on with this and make an effort. 
   Let me just make a couple of comments and address this. First of all, with respect to what the Senator from Oregon just said, the woman in the hypothetical I used would be precluded from the very kind of damages, because your bill limits it to physical injury. She is not physically injured. The fact is, the property damage and other damage would, in fact, not be subject to it. 
   Secondly, under the economic losses in the bill from the Senator from Arizona--and I think this is important for the Senator from Arizona to understand--data processing would not be included in the definition that you have with respect to economic loss. You speak to the question of property and you allow certain kinds of property, but you don't include in the definition of ``property'' intellectual property. 
   What happens if a company has a loss as a consequence of an entire software system that went down and their data being lost and, therefore, they do not provide a service to somebody? You could have a huge economic interruption as a result of that, and you don't include that as an economic loss. I will give you the precise language. There are serious, real consequences here. 
   Secondly, the Senator from Oregon just said that we are just precluding small businesses from punitive damages. Again, I just spoke at a graduation of a law school. I hate to say it, I had to stand up and say in front of the graduates of the law school, welcome to the most hated profession in America. They understood what I was saying. 
   You can't come to the floor of the Senate and quote me defending lawyers. That is not what I am doing. I am defending a principle. I am defending a cherished notion within America about how we redress problems. 
   I know people do not like being hauled into court. I almost laughed when I heard the Senator from Arizona say that all the big businesses and all the business community are united behind this bill. Of course, they are. Big surprise. They are about to get out from under an accountability system that suggests to them that they ought to behave some way. 
   The Senator from Oregon has just said to me, small businesses will only be held accountable for the proportion that they are liable. OK. What happens in this example? The small businesses in Oregon and the people served are in Oregon, but they are only 20 percent of the problem. The people who sold them the hardware and the rest of the equipment are in Japan. You cannot reach them, because you are a small lawyer and you don't have the long reach. You don't have jurisdiction, and you cannot get them conceivably. There are a lot of companies out there right now operating like that. So all you have is 20 percent of the person being made whole. 
   The theory of law for years, under joint and several, has been that in America we care first about the victim, and we are going to make the victim whole. Then the companies that have the power and the clout will sort out between each other who gets what. That has been a very efficient and effective distribution system. It is efficient. 
   What we are now saying is, sorry, average American, sorry, we are going to  give the power back to the corporate entities and you, the little average person, you are going to have to go to Japan and chase them, or you are going to have to just stomach your loss. 
   Small businesses are most of the business in the country. I am also pretty sensitive to that, because I am the ranking member of the Small Business Committee. I take great pride in the things that I have done to try to further small business efforts. I believe in it. I am the only Senator I know who has a zero capital gains tax bill here for targeted investments in the high, critical technologies. I would love to empower small business to do better. But all that punitives apply to are willful, wanton, reckless, destructive, irresponsible, unacceptable behavior. 
   And what my colleagues are doing is coming to the floor, as a matter of public policy, and saying the Senate ought to go on record saying that we don't care how you behave. We are going to take away the capacity to make the average citizen whole, and we are going to give it to the corporate entity. 
   Now, I love these corporations. Look, I represent them and I respect the leaders of them. They are doing great work for America. We have created 18 million jobs in the last 10 years or so because of their virtues and capacities. I will come back here and labor on their behalf on encryption and a host of other things. But, fair is fair. Fair is fair. Are you telling me we should not have these companies do two simple things? 
   My colleague said the language is too vague on those two simple things. Well, let's talk about that for a minute. The bill says ``identify the potential.'' What does that mean, ``identify the potential''? Does anybody have trouble with that? It means to identify whether the product the defendant made or sold had the potential for Y2K failure. How would you know that? You know you have an embedded chip in it. You know whether or not in the digitalization process you use two or four digits. I am not technically competent enough to tell you all of them, but there are people who are; they are running around the country fixing these things. 
   The IRS has invested $1.3 billion and several years of effort in order to be Y2K compliant, and they are today. How did they get there? They got there because they asked this very question. Do we have the potential for failure? And if we do, what are we going to do to fix it? 
   My colleagues come to the floor and they are trying to tell us that this bill is to encourage people to fix it. But what do they do? They let them right out from underneath it, give them an upfront, blanket exemption saying: We are not going to require that you be subject to joint and several; you don't have to do anything; you just walk. And that is wrong as a matter of policy. 
   All we ought to ask them to do is the very thing this bill's purpose is about: Look and see if you have the potential for failure and tell the people you sold it to. If we can't ask them to do that, then we are not standing up for the average citizen in this country. It is that simple.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me respond to that because it is very important. May I also respond by saying this, and, again, I say this with great respect and affection for both of my colleagues. But to be on the floor of the Senate using as a justification the passage of something that does somebody a lot of good, the fact that they like that it does them a lot of good, is kind of a strange argument. If the fox is there to guard the chicken coop and you are going to put a big fence around the chickens, and you ask the fox, ``Do you like it?'' and he says, ``No,'' that is no surprise. It is the same thing here. Who is going to be surprised that the companies are going to say: Of course, we support your bill, because it gives us more than we really properly ought to get. 
   Having said that, let me say to my friend that our bill does everything the Senator from Arizona just said. 
   We could do all of the things the Senator listed. The only difference is, we asked them to identify the potential for the failure and provide information that is calculated to reach the people. We don't even require that it reach the people. 
   My colleague just said this is going to open up a whole lot of litigation. 
   I ask my colleague, has he asked companies? Does he know of a company that isn't trying to identify their Y2K failure? Does he know of a company that, having done that, would not tell the people to whom they sold it?

   Mr. KERRY. That is precisely the point. The Senator has just acknowledged precisely the point I am making. I come back to it. 
   I am not serving on the Banking Committee and the Commerce Committee and the Small Business Committee because I don't care about business. I have the same desires as the Senator from Arizona to see business succeed. He came here for the same purpose--to create jobs and to make the country better for all of our citizens. 
   But this bill is not going to make lives better for all of our citizens in its current structure. Yes, it is wonderful for those corporate entities to be singled out to get the benefits of it. I agree with the Senator. Everything in the amendment I have offered does the exact same thing--to protect those companies, as his does, with one exception. We are fighting here over one big exception right now. This is the exception. The very thing the Senator from Arizona just acknowledged--he said yes, every company ought to want to find that, and I don't know of any company that isn't trying to. 
   That is the precise standard that we are trying to be sure companies embrace--to have a guarantee that we are doing the most to encourage mitigation, to fix the problem, inadvertently or otherwise. 
   The Senator's bill gives them automatic entry into the proportionality of damages, without the guarantee that they tried to make that effort. Why is that important? It goes to 
   the Senator's question to me. It is important because some companies may conceivably choose the cheaper road, which is to not necessarily pay for the fix up front but wait and see what the damage might be and not engage in the very mitigation we have encouraged. 
   If that company is the midline company that the Senator just referred to, under his proposal they would automatically be subject to get the proportional level of their damage. But they could have weighed on an economic basis whether the bottom line of that proportional damage was such that they would rather wait and see, or weigh that rather than fix the problem and avoid whatever the consequences may be to consumers generally. 
   I don't think that is good public policy. Maybe we differ on that. I think there is a fair way to provide all of these companies with the protection that we want them to have, and we want them to have an appropriate level of protection. 
   But, again, my colleagues can't show me why it is unreasonable to suggest that a company can't identify the potential for a Y2K failure. How can you not do that? All you have to do is sit down with your design people, have a meeting, document the meeting, and ask a couple of questions: Do we have a Y2K problem? Do we have any invented processors? What products do we have them in? Whom did we sell them to? Whoops. Let's send a letter to those people and tell them. 
   Is that asking too much? 
   The purpose of this bill is to encourage people to fix the problem. If you do not ask people to do that, how can you say you are really exhausting all of the possibilities of how you are going to fix the problem? I don't understand that. I  say to my colleagues that that is one thing we are fighting about. 
   The other thing is the question of dealing with damages. I know I have said it before. Some people do not like dealing with damages. But the standard you have to get over to have punitive damages apply--I don't know of anyone in the high-tech industry, I can't imagine a company in the high-tech industry, that would be subject to that. Any CEO I have met has as much public conscience as anybody in the Senate and is engaged in a bona fide effort to make their company work. I don't know anybody who is not. 
   But if there is some junk artist out there who is just hungry for the bottom line, trying to gamble on all of the Internet success and everything that has happened with high-tech stocks, who started out fly-by-night, who wanted to go out there and make a quick hit, if that person did it, and willfully, wantonly, recklessly, outrageously impacted the life of an American citizen, I want that American citizen to be able to have redress for that. I don't think it is right to deny them that.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me come back to the remarks of the Senator from Arizona, because I appreciate everything he just read. I would like to be associated with putting it into the RECORD. However, I don't associate myself with the notion that the consequences of what he just read ought to be automatically given a bye, a pass, if you will, without some duty to make the determination of what he just read. 
   Any company that is going to be subject to what the Senator from Arizona just read would answer the standard I have put forth about a potential for failure in the affirmative in 10 seconds. The Senator from Arizona has acknowledged that. We are almost fighting about a difference that is not a huge distinction here, but it is significant enough because of what we want to do to achieve the mitigation we want to get out of this bill. 
   There isn't a company in good standing in this country that cannot answer affirmatively the two-step qualification for proportional damages. To suggest that we will give every company an automatic bye without requiring them to do that is to actually adopt a bill that doesn't go as far as it can to 
   achieve the purpose that the Senator from Arizona states we are trying to achieve. 
   That is why there is a fundamental difference here.

<TEXT>
   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know my colleagues on the other side are anxious to know how we will proceed. Senator DASCHLE intends to speak, and I suspect that may be it on our side. I am sure our colleagues on the other side will be thrilled to hear that, and we can move forward. 
   I want to say a couple of things about what has been said in the last hour of debate. Some of my colleagues have mentioned the ``vagueness'' of the standard that is being applied to ask whether or not a company ought to determine if they have a potential for Y2K liability. First of all, there is no vagueness whatsoever in any company's capacity to determine on its own, through its technological knowledge, whether or not it has a potential of liability, and that is because of the nature of the problem. 
   We are talking about inventing chips with time-sensitive digitalization on ``00'' and its capacity for interpretation. People can run through their programs and run through the demand list, so to speak, on that program and pretty thoroughly test it to make the kind of determination about potentiality. Anybody who has sufficiently done that is going to qualify automatically for proportionality. 
   To the degree that my colleagues complain and say, well, gee, they are coming in here with this standard that might have to go to jury--the Senator from Connecticut is worried about a standard that goes to the jury--turn to their bill, page 28, Section 9: Duty to Mitigate.  
   Damages awarded in any Y2K action shall exclude compensation for damages the plaintiff could reasonably have avoided in light of any disclosure or other information of which the plaintiff was, or reasonably should have been, aware, including information made available by the defendant to purchasers.......  
   So there is an issue for the jury. There is an issue. They have no problem putting the responsibility on the plaintiff. They have no problem at all finding a vague standard, so to speak, using their terminology. I do not believe our standard is vague, but they have no problem at all requiring the jury to determine the reasonableness of what the defendants have done. And the plaintiff is going to have to prove it. 
   So that is part of the imbalance of this bill. Every step of the way, there is a shifting, a change in tort law, a requirement for a higher standard that goes beyond the original purpose. 
   I have heard my colleagues say the purpose of this bill is to help technology companies that are an important part of the American mainstream, economic bloodline, if you will, for all of our country. I agree with that. I absolutely agree with that. I do not want frivolous lawsuits. I do not want lawyers lining up for some kind of constructed settlement process that is based on a fiction. 
   But our bill does not provide for that. Our bill is very clear in the way in which it requires a period of cure, just as S. 96 does, a period of mitigation, just as S. 96 does. It requires the same underlying relationship with contract law, with one exception--where you have an intentional, willful, reckless action by a company. No one for the other side has been able to answer the public policy question of why any entity that acts recklessly, with wanton, willful purpose, ought to be exonerated from a standard that holds them accountable. I do not think any American, average citizen, who is subjected to the consequences of those kinds of actions would believe that is true. 
   Finally, on proportionality, the argument was just made by the Senator from Washington that you ought to have this proportionality available to a company. I agree with him. But it ought to be available to a company that has at least made a de minimis effort, a de minimis effort to determine whether its own product might have the potential to have a Y2K problem. 
   I think our colleagues are going to have a hard time explaining why a company should not have to at least show that it inventoried its own products to determine that. It would be irresponsible, in the context of a bill that is supposed to encourage mitigation and encourage remedy and cure, to suggest that companies should not be encouraged to go out and determine what they may have done wrong. It is just inconsistent. 
   So I believe our effort is a bona fide effort to do precisely what the sponsors of S. 96 want to do. I believe it achieves it in a more fair and evenhanded way. I believe that, as a consequence of the White House agreement with our position, ultimately we are going to have to adjust. 
   I say to my friends in the high-technology industry, I hope they will carefully read the language in our proposed amendment. If one of them wants to come to me and suggest language that is clearer, to suggest how they could conform in a reasonable way that they are not afraid of, I will adopt that language. 
   If any one of them wants to show me a reasonable way to have a standard here that makes them a good citizen or qualifies them as such, I am all for it. I have not yet found a CEO of a company who has been able to suggest to me anything except wanting to not be sued as a rationale for why, from a public policy perspective, we should change the law of this country prospectively in an anticipatory fashion to change a longstanding relationship. And I do not think that case will be made. 
   Mr. President, I yield the floor.

   I am not going to ask the reporter to read back the comments, but let me just quote the Senator. He can tell me if I have said differently. The Senator just said on the floor of the Senate that the Kerry bill seeks to create new torts. Am I correct? Am I stating what the Senator said?

   Mr. KERRY. Let me say to my colleague, he has just confirmed what I said. He is insinuating that we are creating a new tort. 
   I want to make it very clear, what the Senator and Senator MCCAIN and others are doing is taking away the right of State law, with respect to existing contract law, to be applied. They are saying that if a State allows a particular tort with respect to economic loss, they can't do it. 
   I will be very specific about it. My provision with respect to economic loss does exactly what the provision of the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from Arizona does. We are both trying to hold on to contracts, to avoid contract limitations on liability, and not to have people move into tort. Neither of us want contract law to become tort. So we both prevent that. 
   Here is the distinguishing feature. What we do that Senator MCCAIN and company do not do is, we say the following: If the defendant committed an intentional tort, you are not going to void the contract law, except--and this is the only exception--where the tort involves misrepresentation or fraud regarding the attributes or capabilities of the product that is the basis of the underlying claim.

   Mr. KERRY. I want to make this clear, Mr. President. Under the McCain bill, if a party is induced by fraud to enter into a contract, they can't recover damages for that. So what if in a conversation they say to the salesperson of the company: Is your product Y2K compliant? And the person says: Oh, absolutely, our product has been Y2K compliant. We are terrific, blah, blah, blah. 
   If they intentionally were to induce them into the contract on misrepresentation and they lose business as a result of that, they are being denied the ability to sue for that by S. 96. 
   I think that is wrong. I don't know, again, what public policy interest is served by suggesting that fraud and misrepresentation ought to be protected. Why should they be protected?

   Mr. KERRY. Let my say to my colleague, with all due respect, that he is dead wrong. He is even more so dead wrong, because moments ago they adopted an amendment by the Senator from Colorado, the Allard amendment, which makes it very clear that State law is superseded. That is the amendment they adopted. So State law takes precedence, period, end of issue. You cannot protect people from misrepresentation or fraud, and there is no public policy rationale for that. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. I yield myself 5 minutes. 
   I listened to the Senator from Connecticut. I must say that I am a little disappointed, from what I heard, for a simple reason. I haven't come to the floor of the Senate and talked about the Chamber of Commerce. I haven't come to the floor of the Senate and talked about specific companies and interests that are represented or the dynamics this raised. I think to suggest that somehow what I have put on the floor represents the interests of just a few law firms really is an insult to the legislative effort that has taken place here. There is nothing in here that lawyers like. There is a restraint on plaintiffs almost every step of the way. This has been negotiated with many different people. I have sat with high-tech people at great length. 
   I have tried to do the bidding of the high-tech community to the greatest degree possible. I have listened to them. I have talked to Andy Grove three or four times. In his letter to the committee chairman, he stated that of his four interests, each had been met in this legislation. 
   We do exactly what the McCain bill does on cure. We do exactly what the McCain bill does on the mitigation. We do exactly what they do with respect to contract preservation. The one distinction in the four ingredients is a requirement that a company be a good citizen by looking over its inventory and making a determination as to what it did or didn't put out into the marketplace that might have the potential for creating a problem. 
   My colleagues come to the floor say again and again: We want remediation; we want to make it get better; we don't want lawsuits. I don't, either. We want the same remediation. 
   But if you ask a company to investigate its inventory, in my judgment, you are doing a better job of encouraging them to remediate than if you give them a blanket ``out'' from under one of the great leverages of our judicial system, which is the joint and several liability. They get it no matter  what they do. How that is an invitation to fixing the system and making it better is beyond me. 
   I think we need to be very clear here. Moreover, we have been told we are changing contract law. We are not changing contract law. We are suggesting contract law ought to be respected, and we are very clear about that. In fact, we uphold the contract law as it is, State for State. 
   No one has answered this question: Why should a company be able to escape responsibility for an intentional, willful, wanton, reckless or outrageous, willfully committed fraud against an individual when it creates economic loss? If you have economic loss under the provision of S. 96, you are not permitted to sue with respect to the intentional willfulness that took place. Why you want to protect a company that so behaves is beyond me. Another company may have a huge loss of intellectual property; they may drop their entire database; they may not be able to provide their contracts to other companies for months; they have economic loss; there was an intentional defrauding. And we are not going to hold them accountable for that. 
   We should be clear as to what we are talking about. This is a very moderate, very legitimate effort, just as legitimate without any insinuations of who may be directing the interests of the other side and just as legitimate to legislate a sound approach to Y2K liability. 
   I reserve the balance of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. I appreciate the Senator's comment enormously. I want to call the Senator's attention to the language of the bill. Section 121, Damages and Tort Claims:  
   A party to a Y2K action making a tort claim may not recover damages for economic loss involving a defective device or system or service unless----  
   And you have two conditions under which they could. 
   No. 1, where the loss is provided in the contract; and, No. 2, if the loss results directly from damage to the property caused by the Y2K failure. 
   I have a third, and the Senator's folks are opposed to it. Here is the third. The defendant committed an intentional tort. Except where the tort involves misrepresentation or fraud regarding the attributes or capabilities of the product. Does the Senator want to pass a bill without that, without the fraud and misrepresentation? 
   It is in the bill.

   Mr. KERRY. That is entirely fair. What I would like to do is just respond and then I will sit down and reserve the remainder of the time. 
   Let me say to both of my colleagues, and I am glad we are getting to the nub of this, I say this gently and nicely: Both of the presentations that were made are incorrect with respect to what I said. The Senator from Oregon made a bold defense of contract law, and the economic loss argument that he made refers to the preservation of existing contract law. But economic loss is a tort claim. It is a tort claim. His argument is simply irrelevant when he says he is protecting the capacity of the contract law, so to speak, to be preserved within the framework of the economic loss argument. Here is why: My colleague from Connecticut just said we are trying to open this up to some broad, new thing, and the example he cited would not be, in fact, included. It absolutely would be included because our language includes both of the examples that he gave. 
   If it is provided in the contract, the person would be made whole. Or if it is the result of a Y2K failure, the person would be made whole. Here is the only difference. We go one step further. We do not allow them a whole lot of intentional torts except--and I read from  the language--``where the tort involves misrepresentation or fraud.'' That is the only ``new thing'' here. So, if the Senator from Connecticut is really concerned, what he is concerned about is that a lawyer might be able to lay out, according to the tough standards in both of our bills, sufficiently precise pleadings with a period to cure. 
   You may never have a lawsuit because everybody is going to have a 90-day period to cure, and we hope they are going to do exactly that. But if they do not do that and they do meet the sufficiency of the pleadings, and there also is a sufficiency of a showing of fraud or misrepresentation, they ought to get their economic losses. What we are saying is that under S. 96, under the current way it is written, you are denying economic losses if there is fraud or misrepresentation. That is the only ``new thing.'' 
   The Senator from Connecticut says we are going to open up some great Pandora's box, a whole lot of lawyers bringing cases. We have tough pleading requirements here, really tough. Even after you send in your first notice of a lawsuit, the company is going to get 90 days to fix it. Any company that does not fix it in 90 days probably ought to be held accountable for the fraud and misrepresentation. But your bill says no to fraud and misrepresentation. Ours says yes. I ask anybody which they think is more fair. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

   Mr. KERRY. I yield myself such time as I use. 
   Let me begin by paying tribute to both the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Utah. I know they have spent a huge amount of time, and they have done for the entire Senate and the country a great service in calling attention to and helping people understand the nature of this problem. I genuinely give both of them great credit for their leadership and their vision, understanding well over, what, 3 years ago that it was a problem and we needed to address it. 
   Our difference is not in good faith, in purpose, or intent. It is how we will or will not do something. I know my colleague from Utah is a very thoughtful and diligent student of these kinds of issues, and I share with him his own language with respect to the damages of limitation by contract, for instance. This is section 110, page 11, of the bill. It says:  
   In any Y2K action for breach or repudiation of contract, no party may claim, nor be awarded, any category of damages unless such damages are allowed--

   Mr. KERRY. I am reading from the accurate language. The point I am making is that you only allow damages according to the express terms of the contract. That contract could be illegal. That contract could be unenforceable or enforceable under other circumstances under State law. The language we have added simply says ``unless enforcement of the term in question would manifestly and directly contravene applicable State law in effect on January 1, 1999.'' Here is a major difference. You would, in fact, allow the contract to supersede applicable State law even if the contract were illegal. That is the way it reads. 
   There are serious implications in the language that is in the bill that would have a profound impact, and that is the kind of difference we have tried to address in pulling together our amendment. 
   I reserve the remainder of our time.

But you have, in the language of this bill, superseded the capacity of that illegality to be either a defense or a problem. That is all we are saying. These ought to be curable issues. We are passing a bill where they have not been cured. I promise you, if you want to create litigation problems, there they are.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, over the course of the day, there has been a lot of argument about what we seek to do and do not seek to do. I want to make it very clear. Both sides are seeking a fair and sensible way to address the Y2K problem. There is no argument that one side wants frivolous suits, the other does not. There is no argument that one side somehow wants to keep business from flourishing. We are all on the same side of the high-tech industry and of the capacity of that industry to flourish. 
   The question is, what is the fairest, most balanced way to effectively approach the question of how we will do that. 
   Senator EDWARDS from North Carolina has very effectively demonstrated one of the real flaws in the bill as presented by the Senator from Arizona. The economic losses will be denied in a way, particularly in a situation where there is fraud or misrepresentation, that no American deems to be fair. 
   Equally important, when you balance the fundamental components of this bill on the question of proportional damages and who gets them and when, there is a difference between us in what we assert is the appropriate qualification for businesses to merit the proportional damages. 
   The McCain bill automatically makes available, with a few small exceptions, those proportional damages to businesses without any fundamental mitigation requirement; that is the essence of this bill. On the other hand, the proposal I submit with Senator DASCHLE, Senator REID, Senator ROBB, Senator AKAKA, Senator MIKULSKI, and others, is a proposal that embraces 90 days for a cure period, just as the McCain bill does. It embraces a responsibility to mitigate, just as the McCain bill does. It preserves contract law, just as the McCain bill does. But it 
   also requires a good citizenship standard, an effort by companies to determine the potential--not the reality--the potential, not to find to a certainty, but to declare the potential that they may have a Y2K problem, and then in good faith to make available to the people with whom they have dealt the information about that potential. 
   It is hard to believe the Senate would not be willing to embrace the notion that companies ought to embrace the full measure of the purpose of this bill, which is mitigation, by making that good effort in order to determine what their liability may be. 
   Our bill encourages remediation. It requires notice and opportunity to cure. It imposes additional duty on plaintiffs when the defendant does act responsibly. It requires the plaintiff to undertake certain mitigation efforts which is fairly unprecedented. It discourages frivolous lawsuits by encouraging alternative dispute resolution. It increases the pleading requirements. None of these, incidentally, are things the lawyers have asked for and none of them are things the lawyers like. 
   It asserts an increased materiality requirement so that the complaint has to identify with specificity the basis of the complaint which they make. We discourage frivolous class action lawsuits with a minimum injury requirement for any class action and a materiality requirement. 
   We protect business with contract preservation, with strict limitations on damages awarded for economic loss, and also, unlike the McCain bill, we embrace the notion that individual consumers should not be cut out from their capacity to redress their problems. 
   In the end, I believe the real issue is: Do we want to accomplish what we have set out to do, which means, will the President of the United States sign the bill? The President has made it clear the McCain bill will not be signed into law without the kinds of changes Senator EDWARDS and I and others have articulated. 
   So we can go through the Pyrrhic exercise or we can try to fully legislate. I think it is clear that we are offering an alternative that is fair, sensible, protects consumers, and at the same time protects businesses in this country.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I too wish to thank the Senator from Kansas for clarifying his intentions with regard to the language in this bill as it relates to funding for the Department of Energy's Nuclear Cities Initiative. 
   There is no more important national security issue facing America today than preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Through the Nuclear Cities Initiative, the United States and Russia are working together to downsize Russia's nuclear weapons complex and prevent the dispersal of the scientific and technical legacy that remains in Russia today. In the short term, this will require the creation of alternate industries and  new employment for as many as 50,000 scientists and technicians who are under tremendous financial burdens and might be tempted to offer their nuclear expertise to rogue governments and others who are all too willing to pay top dollar for that information. Over the long run, it will require sustainable economic development to allow Russia's scientific and technological assets to be put to peaceful, prosperous use. Mr. President, the Nuclear Cities Initiative is an integral part of our ongoing counterproliferation efforts. I join my colleague from New Mexico in pledging to continue to work with the Senator from Kansas and the Department of Energy in support of this program. I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, as Ranking Democrat on the Committee on Small Business, I join Committee Chairman BOND in introducing the Small Business Advocacy Review Panel Technical Amendments Act of 1999. While there are a few minor points that Chairman BOND and I have agreed to work out before the Committee considers the bill, we both agree that this is an important piece of legislation which should be enacted promptly to facilitate the Small Business Enforcement Fairness Act process. This process enables small entity representatives to participate in rulemakings by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and, under this bill, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the Department of Treasury. 
   This bill improves and enhances the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, which has not only reduced regulatory burdens that otherwise would have been placed on small businesses, but also has begun to institute a fundamental change in the way Federal agencies promulgate rules that could have ``a substantial economic impact on a substantial number of small businesses.'' Federal agencies are required under existing law to form so-called SBREFA panels in conjunction with the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Office of Management and Budget, and with small entities, or their representatives. These SBREFA panels are charged with creating flexible regulatory options that would allow small businesses to continue to operate without sacrificing the environmental, or health and safety goals of the proposed rule. 
   These panels have been highly effective in saving small businesses regulatory compliance costs. To date, seventeen (17) Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act panels have been convened by the EPA, and three (3) by the OSHA. According to SBA's Office of Advocacy, since the law's enactment in 1996, the EPA SBREFA panels have saved small businesses almost $1 billion, and the OSHA SBREFA panels have saved small businesses about $2 billion. 
   While the process has obviously worked well to date, there are a few technical changes that we are proposing to help the process work even better. These changes were recommended by selected small entity representatives who have experience with the SBREFA panel process, and who testified at a joint hearing held by the House Small Business Committee's Subcommittees on Regulatory Reform and Paperwork Reduction, and Government Programs and Oversight on March 11, 1999. 
   Let me take a minute to describe the provisions of the bill.  
   This bill would lengthen by thirty (30) days the time that small entity representatives have to review the usually technical and voluminous materials to be considered during panel deliberations. For those small businessmen and women who would like to participate but do not have a great deal of time to review technical data, the bill requires OSHA, EPA and IRS to prepare detailed summaries of background data and information. 
   The bill would also allow a small entity representative, if he or she so chooses to, make an oral presentation to the panel. 
   Many small entities have expressed their interest in reviewing the panel report before the rule is proposed, and this bill would require the panel report to be printed in the Federal Register either as soon as practicable or with the proposed rule, but in no case, later than six (6) months after the rule is proposed. 
   Moreover, the bill would add certain rules issued by Internal Revenue Service to the panel requirements of SBREFA. Many small businesses complain that they are overwhelmed with the large burdens that the IRS places on them. It is the goal of this bill to hold the IRS accountable for the interpretative rules they issue that have a major impact on small business concerns, and to open up the rulemaking process so small entities can participate. 
   This new authority would significantly increase the workload of SBA's Office of Advocacy, the Federal office charged with monitoring agency compliance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, including SBREFA. Chairman BOND and I agree that it is important that the Office of Advocacy have adequate resources to fulfill the new responsibilities mandated by this bill. Therefore, we plan to send a letter jointly to Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and State Chairman and Ranking Member Senators GREGG and HOLLINGS requesting them to approve additional funding for the Office of Advocacy to handle these additional responsibilities under the law. 
   I am proud to support this legislation. I believe it will result in significant savings for small businesses and will improve the mechanism for their voices to be heard. 
   Finally, I would like to thank Chairman BOND and his staff for their efforts working with me and my staff to produce this important bill. 
   By Mr. SMITH of New Hampshire (for himself, Mr. INHOFE, Mr. THURMOND, Mr. NICKLES, Mr. HELMS, and Mr. COCHRAN):

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I regret that I have to come to the floor to cast my vote against the emergency supplemental appropriations bill before the Senate today. When we face crises in this country, when you have American men and women serving courageously in Kosovo, when you have the borders in Macedonia and Montenegro overflowing with refugees, and when you have hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims in Central America, you would expect that the U.S. Senate would be capable of coming together--unanimously--to address these challenges. It used to be that way in the Senate. It's not that way anymore. Now we fund our operations in Kosovo, and we help the refugees, and we aid the hurricane victims, but at the same time we practice legislative extortion--we say to every Senator, ``You want to vote for Kosovo? You want to vote for aid for hurricane victims? Go ahead--but you have to vote to cut vital housing programs for working Americans across this country. And you need to vote to eliminate environmental regulations.'' That's not the way we ought to do business in the U.S. Senate, and I think it's time we start to talk about changing that course before it contaminates public life any further. That is why I will cast my vote against this emergency supplemental appropriations bill: to register my frustration and my sadness with the way we now do business in the U.S. Senate. 
   Before I say more about the damage this bill does to so many of the vital areas of public policy in the United States, I must tell you that in many respects I only have the liberty of voting against this bill--of casting a symbolic stone against legislative blackmail--because I know this bill will pass the Senate overwhelmingly. Critical investments for our troops in Kosovo--which, as a veteran, as a citizen, and as a senator, I have aggressively supported--will be made in spite of my vote against this bill. The truth is, if this were not the case, if my vote would have undermined in any respects our efforts in Kosovo, I would have had to vote for this bill, in spite of the damage it does. I would have had to--regrettably--support this bill because we have a responsibility to support the American troops we have committed overseas, and I would never stand by and allow the Senate to send what I believe is the wrong message to our troops, and the wrong message to Slobodan Milosevic about American resolve . I believe the United States, and NATO as a whole, must remain united against the systematic killing, raping and pillaging of innocent Kosovar Albanian men, women, and children at the hands of Serb forces. The funding included in this supplemental appropriations conference report will provide support for the U.S. service men and women who are putting their lives in jeopardy and will, I believe, give them a greater capacity to achieve our military objectives in Kosovo. It will also provide the desperately needed relief for humanitarian efforts already underway to assist the refugees in that region. And these investments will be made by the U.S. Senate, reflected in our final tally. 
   I believe this Nation must have a bipartisan foreign policy, and that we can not afford to allow politics to endanger our troops. But I wish that more of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, those who included provisions which cut directly against the interests of low income working Americans and our environment, would  also have a commitment to bipartisanship on domestic issues of tremendous importance to so many working Americans struggling to keep their heads above water even in this great economy we celebrate on the floor of the U.S. Senate. The rescissions and changes in policy included in this Conference Report will eventually hurt the poorest Americans and will immediately hurt our environment. That should not be acceptable in a Senate which prides itself on its ability to do what is right for all Americans. I can not in good conscience support these measures. 
   I question what it says about our commitment to helping those who are being left behind in this new economy, that we could find the resources to provide $983 million in disaster relief for those whose lives were disrupted when Hurricane Mitch struck the Central American nations of Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala and when Hurricane Georges struck in the Caribbean last year--but we are cutting critical investments in housing for working Americans. Hurricanes in Central America have left almost 10,000 dead and have driven millions from their homes. The cost of damages to businesses, hospitals, schools and individual homes have been enormous. We are right to provide assistance to the victims of these hurricanes. But we ought to be able to do it without abandoning thousands of our neediest citizens here at home. 
   Today there are more than five million low-income Americans facing severe housing needs, receiving federal housing assistance. At least another 15 million Americans qualify for help but do not receive it because of limited budget appropriations. They suffer from homelessness--600,000 Americans homeless each night; 5.3 million Americans pay rents that are more than 50 percent of their household income, or live in severely substandard conditions--these are the severe housing problems we once hoped to address. These families are one misfortune away from homelessness. A child gets sick, a parent gets laid off--even for a week or two, the car breaks down, and that family ends up on the streets. So what are we doing in this supplemental appropriations bill? We're rescinding $350 million from the Section 8 program that helps these families who are working through the tough times--and we're rescinding this money in spite of the fact that the HUD budget in FY1999 will already be almost $1 billion less than it was in FY1994. This rescission will result in a shortfall that will cause the loss of subsidy and the displacement of approximately 60,000 families. 60,000 families. It will make the current waiting list crisis, where families must sometimes wait years to find some relief, even more difficult to solve. 
   This isn't the first time this has happened. Year after year, HUD's budget is raided--targeted for cuts in 1995, in 1997, in 1998, and again this year--to pay for emergencies which, by their nature and by law, are not required to be offset with budget cuts. Only a very small portion of this $15 billion bill is offset with spending cuts. I am disturbed, really, that some of my colleagues have chosen to make cuts to this program because they believe it is politically vulnerable. HUD's budget should not fall victim to this type of spending cut--and families struggling to stay off the streets shouldn't fall victim to this kind of politics. 
   I am not new to this game. I have fought year in and year out against substantial cuts that have been made to the HUD budget. These cuts have jeopardized the existing public housing services and have undermined HUD's capacity to continue the Secretary's ambitious program of reform or even just to make up for previous under-funding of capital needs to meet our Nation's demand for affordable housing. Last year, the Congress passed the first new section 8 vouchers in 5 years. This rescission would reverse in large part the down payment Congress made in addressing unmet housing needs. At least 100,000 new vouchers are needed to begin to address the outstanding needs. This rescission moves us in the wrong direction. 
   As the ranking member of the Housing Subcommittee, as someone who sees first hand in Massachusetts the struggles of so many families working their fingers to the bone and trying to stay off the streets, I can not support these draconian cuts in housing. 
   But this bill doesn't stop there. Some of my colleagues have included dangerous environmental riders in this bill--in a practice that is becoming all too common 
   in this Senate. It wasn't this way 15 years ago when I came here, it wasn't that way 30 years ago when Democrats and Republicans worked together to write our first environmental laws, but it's that way now--even basic environmental protections have become a partisan fight--and the riders in this bill do serious damage to our environment. Specifically, the conference report includes three environmental riders that I believe will set back environmental progress, unnecessarily limit federal revenues and undermine the legislative process--and I oppose all of them. 
   The conference report extends the moratorium on issuing a final rule-making on crude oil valuation until October 1, 1999. It restricts the implementation of the Department of the Interior Solicitor's opinion on mining that limits the number of millsites to one five-acre millsite per patent. 
   The environmental rider that I find most egregious prevents the Department of Interior from issuing new rules for hardrock mining on public lands. This is the third time the Senate has attached such a provision to an appropriations bill. As a result, the hardrock mining industry continues to cause environmental damage and costs the taxpayer. 
   The extraction of hardrock minerals like gold, silver and copper usually includes the excavation of enormous pits and the use of toxic chemicals like cyanide, and its results have been destructive. According to the General Accounting Office, there are almost 300,000 acres of federal land that have been mined and left unreclaimed. Abandoned mines account for 59 Superfund sites and there are more than 2,000 abandoned mines in our national parks. 
   The Mineral Policy Center estimates that the cleanup costs for abandoned mines on public and private lands may reach $72 billion. Rather than reform the industry through comprehensive legislation or proper execution of existing executive branch authority, we will once again block reform through a rider. 
   It is time that we put an end to this policy of undermining the environment, of gutting environmental protections, by slipping riders through the back door of every spending bill. We ought to be a better Senate than that. We ought to have our debates on the floor, in public, and if you want to promote a vision of an America where we turn the environment over to polluters, over to those who would destroy our natural resources, if that's your vision, then let's debate it--and let's end the practice of environmental degradation through appropriations bills. 
   Before I yield the floor, I do want to draw our attention to something in this supplemental bill which I believe is an important victory for Massachusetts, and for our fishermen. I am pleased that $1.88 million was included for NOAA's National Marine Fisheries Service, NMFS, to promote cooperative management and research activities in the Northeast multispecies fishery. These funds will complement the $5 million in emergency assistance that was appropriated for Gulf of Maine fishermen last November. 
   Many in this Chamber know that too many fishermen in New England are experiencing economic hardship due to new groundfish regulations recently imposed in the Gulf of Maine. In order to help alleviate the negative effects of these new regulations, fishermen have joined with NMFS in developing a spending plan for the $5 million in emergency assistance. The plan proposes to compensate fishermen for lost fishing opportunities that have resulted from inshore groundfish closures. Fishermen, in return, will make their vessels available to take part in cooperative research projects. A portion of the $1.88 million will be used to fund the cooperative scientific projects that will be conducted by NMFS and other institutions. In addition, some of the new funding will be used to employ fishermen as scientific observers. This new partnership will have a twofold benefit. Cooperative research activities will keep fishermen employed on the water while groundfish stocks recover,  and this plan will promote a more constructive relationship between fishermen and NMFS with the goal of improving management activities in the Gulf of Maine groundfish fishery. I express my very real appreciation for the support of Senate Appropriations chairman, Senator TED STEVENS and the Democratic ranking member, Senator BYRD, for including this provision in the conference report and for their continued steadfast support of the New England fishermen. 
   In conclusion, let me just say that I fully support the American men and women who are putting their lives in jeopardy in the Kosovo region for a mission which I believe in very deeply--as a veteran, I support their interests very personally in fact. I would have liked to have seen the Senate produce an Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill that we could all vote for, unanimously. But this bill is a far cry from that kind of legislation, a far cry from the kind of bipartisan foreign policy we demand from our leaders in the United States. I am entirely disappointed that some members of the Senate have used this bill as a vehicle to hurt low-income working families and damage the environment we all share. 
   Mr. President, we are a great country of Americans who care about each other, who believe that we have a national purpose and that part of the reason we are a special nation is that we help each other make it through the times and make the most of our own lives. We're a great nation. We ought to be a great Senate that reflects that sense of commitment to one another, and I look forward to the day when those values return to this Chamber.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the passage of this Juvenile Justice Bill represents an important step forward for those of us who have expressed concern for the safety and well-being of America's young people. I am pleased that in spite of the tensions and the controversies that have marked these past weeks in the United States Senate, we are, in the final analysis, able to come together as a Senate in support of certain principles that we know are absolutely essential if we are to reform our nation's juvenile justice policy to reflect modern life and the needs of all our children in this nation. 
   The aftermath of the tragic school shootings in Littleton and even the violence today in Atlanta underscored for all of us the importance of getting serious about juvenile justice. In this debate here in the Senate about juvenile justice, we heard a great deal about efforts to keep guns out of the hands of violent students, we heard about efforts to try juvenile offenders as adults, about stiffer sentences, about so many answers to the problem of kids who have run out of second and third chances--kids who are violent, kids who are committing crimes, children who are a danger to themselves and a danger to those around him. I was a prosecutor in Massachusetts before I entered elected office. I have seen these violent teenagers and young people come to court, and let me tell you, there is nothing more tragic than seeing these children who--in too many cases --have a jail cell in their future not far down the road, children who have done what is, at times, irreparable harm to their communities. 
   I am pleased we are passing a bill today which demonstrates we don't only begin to care about these kids at that point --after the violence, after the arrest, after the damage has been done, when it may be too late--when we could have started intervening in our kids' lives early on, before it was too late. We can say that we have had a real debate about juvenile justice because we are passing a bill that makes some critical investments in vital early childhood development efforts, but a great deal of work remains undone. 
   The truth is that early intervention can have a powerful effect on reducing government welfare, health, criminal justice, and education expenditures in the long run. By taking steps now we can reduce later destructive behavior such as dropping out of school, drug use, and criminal acts like the ones we have seen in Littleton and Jonesboro. We are doing that in this bill--but we should be doing far more. 
   A study of the High/Scope Foundation's Perry Preschool found that at-risk toddlers who received pre-schooling and a weekly home visit reduced the risk that these children would grow up to become chronic law breakers by a startling 80 percent. The Syracuse University Family Development Study showed that providing quality early-childhood programs to families until children reached age five reduces the children's risk of delinquency 10 years later by 90 percent. It is no wonder that a recent survey of police chiefs found that nine out of ten said that ``America could sharply reduce crime if government invested more'' in these early intervention programs. 
   I know it can work. I visited an incredible center, the Castle Square Early Childhood Development Center in Boston, and I saw kids getting the attention they need during the day while their parents work, children being held and read to, and cared for, children who aren't raising themselves, parents who come in and volunteer in the evening and take classes there so they can better take care of their kids when they're sick or when they need special attention. But you know what, for the sixty kids in that program, there are six hundred on a waiting list. 
   There is the Early Childhood Initiative in Allegheny County, PA--one of the first pilot programs in this country which gave life to the kind of legislation we're passing here today--an innovative program which helps low-income children from birth to age five become successful, productive adults by enrolling them in high quality, neighborhood-based early care and education programs ranging from Head Start, center-based child care, home-based child care, and school readiness programs. ECI draws on everything that's right about Allegheny County--the strengths of its communities-- neighborhood decision-making, parent involvement, and quality measurement. Parents and community groups decide if they want to participate and they come together and develop a proposal tailored for the community. Regular review programs ensure quality programming and cost-effectiveness. We're talking about local control getting results locally: 19,000 pre-school aged children from low-income families, 10,000 of which were not enrolled in any child care or education program. By the year 2000, through funding supplied by ECI, approximately 75% of these under-served pre-schoolers will be reached. Early evaluations show that enrolled children are achieving at rates equivalent to their middle income peers. And as we know, without this leveling of the playing field, low-  income children are at a greater risk of encountering the juvenile justice system. That's a real difference. 
   These kinds of programs are successful because children's experiences during their early years of life lay the foundation for their future development. But in too many places in this country our failure to provide young children what they need during these crucial early years has long-term consequences and costs for America. 
   Recent Scientific evidence conclusively demonstrates that enhancing children's physical, social, emotional, and intellectual development will result in tremendous benefits for children, families, and our nation. The electrical activity of brain cells actually changes the physical structure of the brain itself. Without a stimulating environment, the baby's brain suffers. At birth, a baby's brain contains 100 billion neurons, roughly as many nerve cells as there are stars in the Milky Way. But the wiring pattern between these neurons develops over time. Children who play very little or are rarely touched develop brains 20 to 30 percent smaller than normal for their age. 
   Reversing these problems later in life is far more difficult and costly. We know that--if it wasn't so much harder, we wouldn't be having this difficult debate in the Senate. 
   I think it is time we talked about giving our kids the right start in their lives they need to be healthy, to be successful, to mature in a way that doesn't lead to at-risk and disruptive behavior and violence down the road. 
   We should stop and consider what is really at stake here. Poverty seriously impairs young children's language development, math skills, IQ scores, and their later school completion. Poor young children also are at heightened risk of infant mortality, anemia, and stunted growth. Of the 12 million children under the age of 3 in the United States today, 3 million--25 percent--live in poverty. Three out of five mothers with children under three work, but one study found that 40 percent of the facilities at child care centers serving infants provided care of such poor quality as to actually jeopardize children's health, safety, or development. In more than half of the states, one out of every four children between 19 months and three years of age is not fully immunized against common childhood diseases. Children who are not immunized are more likely to contract preventable diseases, which can cause long-term harm. Children younger than three make up 27 percent of the one million children who are determined to be abused or neglected each year. Of the 1,200 children who died from abuse and neglect in 1995, 85 percent were younger than five and 45 percent were younger than one. 
   Unfortunately, our Government expenditure patterns have been inverse to the most important early development period for human beings. Although we know that early investment can dramatically reduce later remedial and social costs, our nation has spent no more than $35 billion over five years on federal programs for at-risk or delinquent youth and child welfare programs. 
   That is a course we are taking some steps to change today. We are starting to talk in a serious and a thoughtful way--through a bipartisan approach--about making a difference in the lives of our children before they're put at risk. We are starting to accept the truth that we can do a lot more to help our kids grow up healthy with promising futures in an early childhood development center, in a classroom, and in a doctor's office than we can in a courtroom or in a jail cell. But we could be doing much more. 
   These issues are now a part of this juvenile justice debate. But they need to be a bigger part of every debate we have about our kids' future. My colleague KIT BOND and I reintroduced yesterday our Early Childhood Development Act which we had previously introduced in the last Congress, and which had passed as part of the tobacco legislation last summer. That bill moves us forward in a bipartisan way towards a different kind of discussion about juvenile justice--and towards actions we can take to provide meaningful intervention in the lives of all of our children. I am appreciative of the deep support we've found for our approach in this legislation by Senator STEVENS, Senator JEFFORDS, Senator DODD, Senator KENNEDY and all of the cosponsors of the original Kerry Bond bill: Senator HOLLINGS, Senator JOHNSON, Senator LANDRIEU, Senator LEVIN, Senator MOYNIHAN, Senator WELLSTONE, and my colleague from New Jersey, Senator BOB TORRICELLI. I am pleased to join Senators STEVENS and KENNEDY in supporting parenting, but as we expressed in our sense-of-the-Senate amendment there is much more we need to be doing in terms of broader early childhood development efforts--we need a more comprehensive approach. 
   In this legislation we have taken an important step towards recognizing the importance of early childhood development programs for our children, as well as the responsibility of the Congress to make early childhood investments a priority in our budget process.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. 
   Mr. President, with sadness but with great pride, I join my colleagues today to mark the passing of a remarkably patriotic and--I think everyone would agree--extraordinarily committed public servant. 
   Rear Admiral James ``Bud'' Nance devoted his entire life to serving his country, to public service. That was made up, as we have heard, of a remarkable 35 years in the U.S. Navy, 2 years as Deputy Assistant for National  Security Affairs under President Reagan, and then, as we heard our colleagues recount today, great years of service here in the Senate, years where all of us know he didn't have to serve. He could have chosen any number of other courses for his life, but right up until the end, he stood watch. 
   He earned, as we have heard, two Distinguished Service Medals in all of the campaigns that were listed by my colleagues. One of the things for which I personally--and I am sure Senator MCCAIN will join me--express the greatest respect was his service as skipper, commander of the U.S.S. Forrestal, which our colleague, Senator MCCAIN, has very close ties to. I served one of my tours of duty in Vietnam at the Gulf of Tonkin, as we did a lot of search and rescue work with pilots and occasionally were doing guard duty right behind the carrier, so I became intimately familiar with carrier operations. 
   I think anybody who has ever been on a carrier, those 5,000-person floating cities, understands the extraordinary leadership skills that are necessary to keep everybody in those close quarters working at the pace they work under--the intense, stressful combat situation in which they work. It is a remarkable tribute to this man that he rose to that level and, indeed, performed those responsibilities with such distinction. 
   I first met him, obviously, when he came here, in 1991, and he became the Republican staff director for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Believe me, it became evident very quickly how fast he was going to be sort of the glue that helped to bring people together and keep them together. Everybody here will remember the great smile, the constant twinkle in his eye, and the wonderful kind of calm that he had about him. Literally, I think 5 days or 6 days before he passed away, clearly without any inkling on our part that that might happen so suddenly, we were down in Senate Foreign Relations room 116 dealing with a number of issues. I went over to sit beside him and seek his counsel on something. As was his manner, he sort of patted me on the knee in a calm way and said: I think we can take care of that; we can take care of that. 
   That is the way he worked. He enjoyed the give and take. He loved the responsibility. He loved the Senate. And most of all, he clearly loved his country which he served so diligently. 
   Not only did he have the confidence and friendship--a very, very special friendship--with Senator HELMS, but he also approached the job with pure professionalism, with fierce determination, and great skill. Surely he was always committed to advancing the values and belief system--such a strong value system and belief system--of Senator HELMS. Their priorities were the same. But he also was every bit as committed to working out even the most contentious issues on a bipartisan basis. 
   I consider myself privileged to have worked very closely with Admiral Nance when Senator HELMS was a member of the Senate 
   POW-MIA committee, which I then chaired. I will always be grateful to him for his very steady support during that difficult and highly emotional time. He understood the importance of dealing with that issue head-on, regardless of partisanship or political consideration, and understood as well as anybody, because of his years of service, the need to begin to heal the wounds of war that still divided this country. 
   His participation with Senator HELMS and the work of that committee was a great service to this country. The admiral and I also worked closely together during the 6 years that I was privileged to have the responsibility as chairman, and then ranking member, of the International Operations Subcommittee for the State Department authorization bill. I know that Bud Nance believed it was more than just another bill. To him, it was a reflection of our priorities in a global strategic sense, which he understood so well. So it wasn't just a substantive issue to him; it was also an institutional issue, and he cared about that. He cared about the Senate prerogatives, he cared about the committee priorities and prerogatives, and he shared that concern with all of us. 
   Although we found much to agree on, we obviously sometimes disagreed. But, boy, I can tell you it was never with anything except the deepest sense of respect and understanding for the substance of another person's position. Even throughout those disagreements, I always knew I could talk to Bud Nance and he was going to give me a fair hearing, and, working with Senator HELMS, he was going to do his best to resolve those differences. 
   We all know the degree to which Bud Nance was a devoted public servant. But of greater meaning and of greater consequence to him, surely, Bud Nance was a devoted husband and father. We have heard others talk of the wonderful marriage that he had to Mary Lyda for 53 years. Together they had four children. I simply want to take this opportunity to extend my condolences to them and to their families for their loss. 
   It is also very hard to think about Bud Nance without obviously thinking about the special relationship he had with his closest friend and our colleague, Senator HELMS. I will always fondly remember the many stories that Senator HELMS shared with us in the Foreign Relations Committee and here on the floor about two young tykes growing up within streets of each other and spending literally their lives together, even when they weren't together. No one could ever doubt the strength of the bond between them or the personal loyalty they felt toward one another over so many years. This was really a rare friendship. That it has a marvelous endurance is a tribute to both Bud Nance and JESSE HELMS, not just as public servants or as partners in a public endeavor, but as private people, as human beings. 
   Modern politics is not kind to personal lives, to private lives. It is sometimes easy to lose sight of the importance of those friendships in this city, and that is why I think it is so important, in part, to recognize the full measure of the friendship they shared. 
   I don't remember all of the words, but there is a wonderful poem by William Butler Yates that speaks about the glory man shares here on Earth, but in the end he calls on us to hope that every individual would say: And so my glory was I had such friends. Really, that is glory in itself, that he had a friend like Bud Nance. 
   Mr. President, this is a city marked by transients. People come and people go. But Adm. Bud Nance was forever proud that his service here was, in many ways, neither ephemeral or transient. It was a tireless service to the country, the Senate, stellar leadership in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and lifelong devotion to country. It defines patriotism. He will be greatly missed, but he will also be remembered very fondly by all of us who knew him and remembered 
   him as a good man who made no secret of his love of family, love of friends, and love of country. He epitomized the best of what can come from our Nation's capital and from the country itself, as well as the best of what our foreign policy can be. We will miss him today, but so much more so, we honor his legacy and his memory. 
   Mr. HELMS addressed the Chair.

   Literally the future of millions of young people is at stake here. Literally, that's what we're talking about. But is it reflected in the investments we make here in the Senate? I would, respectfully, say no--not nearly enough Mr. President. 
   Unfortunately, Mr. President, our government expenditure patterns are inverse to the most important early development period for human beings.

We are looking forward to working with all of you, from both sides of the aisle, to make that debate on the Kerry-Bond bill a productive one, a debate that leads to the kind of actions we know can make the difference in addressing violence ten years before it starts, in getting all our children off to the right start towards full and productive lives.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak before you today about a critical challenge before this Senate--the challenge of reforming the way in which elections are conducted in the United States; the challenge of ending the ``moneyocracy'' that has turned our elections into auctions where public office is sold to the highest bidder. I want to implore the Congress to take meaningful steps this year to ban soft money, strengthen the Federal Election Commission, provide candidates the opportunity to pay for their campaigns with clean money, end the growing trend of dangerous sham issue ads, and meet the ultimate goal of restoring the rights of average Americans to have a stake in their democracy. Today I am proud to join with my colleague from Minnesota, PAUL WELLSTONE, to introduce the ``Clean Money'' bill which I believe will help all of us entrusted to shape public policy to arrive at a point where we can truly say we are rebuilding Americans' faith in our democracy. 
   For the last 10 years, I have stood before you to push for comprehensive campaign reform. We have made nips and tucks at the edges of the system, but we have always found excuses to hold us back from making the system work. It's long past time that we act--in a comprehensive way--to curtail the way in which soft money and the big special interest dollars are crowding ordinary citizens out of this political system. 
   Today the political system is being corrupted because there is too much unregulated, misused money circulating in an environment where candidates will do anything to get elected and where, too often, the special interests set the tone of debate more than the political leaders or the American people. Just consider the facts for a moment. The rising cost of seeking political office is outrageous. In 1996, House and Senate candidates spent more than $765 million, a 76% increase since 1990 and a six fold increase since 1976. Since 1976, the average cost for a winning Senate race went from $600,000 to $3.3 million, and in the arms race for campaign dollars in 1996 many of us were forced to spend significantly more than that. In constant dollars, we have seen an increase of over 100 percent in the money spent for Senatorial races from 1980 to 1994. Today Senators often spend more time on the phone ``dialing for dollars'' than on the Senate floor. The average Senator must raise $12,000 a week for six years to pay for his or her re-election campaign. 
   But that's just the tip of the iceberg. The use of soft money has exploded. In 1988, Democrats and Republicans raised a combined $45 million in soft money. In 1992 that number doubled to reach $90 million and in 1995-96 that number tripled to $262 million. This trend continues in this cycle. What's the impact of all that soft money? It means that the special interests are being heard. They're the ones with the influence. But ordinary citizens can't compete. Fewer than one third of one percent of eligible voters donated more than $250 in the electoral cycle of 1996. They're on the sidelines in what is becoming a coin-operated political system. 
   The American people want us to act today to forge a better system. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows that 77% of the public believes that campaign finance reform is needed ``because there is too much money being spent on political campaigns, which leads to excessive influence by special interests and wealthy individuals at the expense of average people.'' Last spring a New York Times found that an astonishing 91% of the public favor a fundamental transformation of this system. 
   Cynics say that the American people don't care about campaign finance. It's not true. Citizens just don't believe we'll have the courage to act--they're fed up with our defense of the status quo. They're disturbed by our fear of moving away from this status quo which is destroying our democracy. Soft money, political experts tell us, is good for incumbents, good for those of us within the system already. Well, nothing can be good for any elected official that hurts our democracy, that drives citizens out of the process, and which keeps politicians glued to the phone raising money when they ought to be doing the people's business. Let's put aside the status quo, and let's act today to restore our democracy, to make it once more all that the founders promised it could be. 
   Let us pass the Clean Money Bill to restore faith in our government in this age when it has been so badly eroded. 
   Let us recognize that the faith in government and in our political process which leads Americans to go to town hall meetings, or to attend local caucuses, or even to vote--that faith which makes political expression worthwhile for ordinary working Americans--is being threatened by a political system that appears to reward the special interests that can play the game and the politicians who can game the system. 
   Each time we have debated campaign finance reform in this Senate, too many of our colleagues have safeguarded the status quo under the guise of protecting the political speech of the Fortune 500. But today we must pass campaign finance reform to protect the political voice of the 250 million ordinary, working Americans without a fortune. It is their dwindling faith in our political system that must be restored. 
   Twenty five years ago, I sat before the Foreign Relations Committee, a young veteran having returned from Vietnam. Behind me sat hundreds of veterans committed to ending the war the Vietnam War. Even then we questioned whether ordinary Americans, battle scarred veterans, could have a voice in a political system where the costs of campaigns, the price of elected office seemed prohibitive. Young men who had put their life on the front lines for their country were worried that the wall of special interests between the people and their government might have been too thick even then for our voices to be heard in the corridors of power in Washington, D.C. 
   But we had a reserve of faith left, some belief in the promise and the influence of political expression for all Americans. That sliver of faith saved lives. Ordinary citizens stopped a war that had taken 59,000 American lives.  
   Every time in the history of this republic when we have faced a moral challenge, there has been enough faith in our democracy to stir the passions of ordinary Americans to act--to write to their Members of Congress; to come to Washington and speak with us one on one; to walk door to door on behalf of issues and candidates; and to vote on election day for people they believe will fight for them in Washington. 
   It's the activism of citizens in our democracy that has made the American experiment a success. Ordinary citizens--at the most critical moments in our history--were filled with a sense of efficacy. They believed they had influence in their government. 
   Today those same citizens are turning away from our political system. They believe the only kind of influence left in American politics is the kind you wield with a checkbook. The senior citizen living on a social security check knows her influence is inconsequential compared to the interest group that can saturate a media market with a million dollars in ads that play fast and loose with the facts. The mother struggling to find decent health care for her children knows her influence is trivial compared to the special interests on K Street that can deliver contributions to incumbent politicians struggling to stay in office. 
   But I would remind you that whenever our country faces a challenge, it is not the special interests, but rather the average citizen, who holds the responsibility to protect our nation. The next time our nation faces a crisis and the people's voice needs to be heard to turn the tide of history, will the average American believe enough in the process to give words to the feelings beyond the beltway, the currents of public opinion that run beneath the surface of our political dialogue? 
   In times of real challenge for our country in the years to come, will the young people speak up once again? Not if we continue to hand over control of our political system to the special interests who can infuse the system with soft money and with phony television ads that make a mockery of the issues. 
   The children of the generation that fought to lower the voting age to 18 are abandoning the voting booth themselves. Polls reveal they believe it is more likely that they'll be abducted by aliens than it is that their vote will make a real difference. For America's young people the MTV Voter Participation Challenge ``Choose or Lose'' has become a cynical joke. In their minds, the choice has already been lost--lost to the special interests. That is a loss this Senate should take very seriously. That is tremendous damage done to our democracy, damage we have a responsibility in this Senate to repair. Mr. President, with this legislation we are introducing today, we can begin that effort--we can repair and revitalize our political process, and we can guarantee ``clean elections'' funded by ``clean money,'' elections where our citizens are the ones who make the difference.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank particularly the Senator from Maryland, the ranking member, for his leadership on this issue. I regret that the Senate is in the position it is in on this particular bill. 
   I have previously supported financial modernization. We have voted on it in several incarnations. Last year I was among those who happily sent this bill, what was then H.R. 10, to the Senate with a very significant vote of support in the Banking Committee, because we believed overwhelmingly that we had the right balance between the interests of the financial services community, whom we are all concerned about and we all understand need the needs of that community; at the same time we had what most people thought was a very fair and sensible recognition of the virtues of the CRA. 
   In the waning hours of the last Congress, all Members remember there was a single, very adamant voice of opposition, the now chairman of the committee, who in fairness has deep-rooted beliefs about it, but who frankly stood in a very, very small number last year who ultimately, because of the timing of the bill, was able to prevent an entire bill from passing the Senate. 
   Now we are back here once again revisiting the important imperatives of financial modernization. This year many of us who want to vote for that financial modernization are put in the very difficult position of having to take a position of fundamental principle that because we believe so deeply that the CRA provision is so disturbed by this bill that a strong relationship that has existed and worked with a profound, positive impact for people in this country, is being sufficiently undone, even attacked, and requires that we oppose the bill in its current form. 
   I am used to going through Pyrrhic exercises in the Senate, regrettably with increased frequency. It is a sad commentary on the nature of the legislative process today that sometimes measures move through here in a very partisan way and then we ultimately wind up in the conference committee with the administration negotiating and things are changed. 
   That may or may not happen here. It certainly didn't have to be this way. We could have arrived at some kind of fairminded compromise that reflected the views of the vast majority of Senators. Instead, we find ourselves with a bill that is not just about financial modernization. It is also about a significant reduction in the capacity of the Community Reinvestment Act to work. Many Members believe very, very deeply we can do better than that. 
   I think we obviously need to recognize that U.S. financial institutions as a whole are the most efficient providers of financial services in the world today. There have been remarkable changes in the marketplace in the last years. All Members ought to pay proper tribute to the virtues of the entrepreneurs who have themselves undertaken to put those changes in place. 
   I don't think Congress can stand here with a straight face and take entire credit for the virtues of the economy that we are living in today. I do think we take partial credit because I think it was a courageous effort in 1993 to face up to the realities of the deficit and to come up with a solid deficit reduction act. In addition to the congressional efforts, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, deserves enormous credit for his courage during the banking crisis of the last years of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s when he took bold action to help refinance the banks, as well as his remarkable stewardship of monetary policy itself. 
   Finally, it seems to me a very significant amount of the credit goes to the companies themselves and the CEOs  who saw a change coming down the road, who responded to the demands of the 1980s when people were writing books about Japan, Inc. and writing off American enterprise and suggesting we needed a wholesale adoption of another model. Indeed, our model has proven perhaps at times to be excessive and at times even to be insensitive, but nevertheless to be way ahead of any other capacity or structure in the world in the marketplace. 
   Increasingly, one of the reasons for that success has been the blurring of the lines between banking, insurance, and securities. We need to do our part. We are way behind the curve, years behind the curve. Were it not for the thoughtful and judicious steps taken by the regulators themselves without congressional impetus we perhaps wouldn't have been able to accomplish some of what we have. 
   Now is the time to respond by breaking down the artificial legal barriers of an outdated era, the barriers that prevented banks, security firms and insurance companies from affiliating. It is time we take the step to ratify the liberation of financial service companies so they can provide a broader array of services to consumers and corporate customers. I don't think we should hesitate to do it. This is several years overdue. 
   It is regrettable that we find ourselves in this position, after the Senate Banking Committee overwhelmingly by a 16-2 vote passed legislation. That is a fairly profound statement of the Senate Banking committee's willingness to move forward. 
   Here we are again, notwithstanding the challenge of financial modernization, with too many Members having to say no to moving forward because of the extreme measures being applied to the CRA itself. 
   That judgment is not ours alone. The Treasury Secretary, whose expertise and judgment over the last years, I think, has been without parallel, and the President of the United States, clearly on Secretary Rubin's recommendation, have stated that if the CRA measure stays as it is, this measure will be vetoed. Very simple: It is going to be vetoed. 
   We have a choice. We can either take a look at the CRA and make a judgment about what it accomplishes or we can go through another Senate exercise, send the bill out for veto and accept failure in the end for our capacity to be able to recognize the importance of the vast changes that I referred to a moment ago. 
   Let me say a few words about the CRA, if I may. The CRA is now more than 20 years old. It is very straightforward in concept. It is imminently reasonable. It says simply that banks have to provide credit to all the communities in which they take deposits. In other words, if a bank accepts deposits from a neighbor, that bank has some kind of responsibility to make loans available to creditworthy borrowers in those neighborhoods. 
   That is common sense and it is fundamentally fair. This statement of reciprocity, of mutual responsibility, says an awful lot about the kind of country we want to be and the kind of country we are as a consequence of that kind of effort. 
   Let me speak for a moment to what the CRA has accomplished. It has helped to make more than $1 trillion in good, profitable loans to low-income areas, loans that bankers in my State and in States all across the country have said would not have been made without the law. It has given low-income communities of working families access to capital that is absolutely crucial to start a small business or to buy a home. And it has created new business opportunities for the banks themselves. 
   I would say that CRA is a fundamentally conservative, procapitalist law because it is not a handout; it is not something for nothing. It requires responsibility. It broadens the tax base. It broadens the capitalization capacity of a community. It brings people into the economic mainstream. It is a law that provides that all Americans, low- and moderate-income Americans, very often African Americans or Hispanic Americans, with the opportunity to buy a home or build a business if they are creditworthy. 
   The law is very clear on the last point, about creditworthiness. Loans have to be made with all of the normal concerns for safety and for soundness. The act itself could not have been more clear on that. It says that it has to help meet the credit needs of the local communities from which it is chartered, ``consistent with the safe and sound operation of such institutions.'' 
   So, when the chairman of the committee says it is just an extortion program, I think there is such a level of extreme exaggeration and rhetoric in that, measured against what happens --and I will speak for a moment later to the question of extortion--because any bank has the ability to prove that any particular request was not able to meet the requirement of safe and sound operation of that institution. It is clear there are plenty of ways of doing that. And the balance of the weight is on the bank; it is really against the person requesting the credit, based upon the normal standards by which banks do business. 
   If you talk to most bankers, they will tell you the CRA loans perform as well as the rest of their portfolios. We are not looking at some enormous drag on banking institutions. In fact, some banks have begun to sell CRA loans on Wall Street in order to acquire more capital to make more CRA loans. Those are market forces that are being harnessed to expand opportunity and to grow our economy. 
   Here in the Senate, lately, we have heard a lot of talk about the ``opportunity society.'' The fact is, the Community Reinvestment Act exemplifies that notion. Credit is the economic lifeblood of every community, whether it is rich or poor. In our society, I think it is fair to say that historically we know that credit denied is also opportunity denied. When you deny hard-working Americans the chance to buy their own homes or start their own businesses, you are denying them the opportunity to share in the American promise. 
   This is a country where we have demanded a lot of our citizens. We expect them to make the most of their own lives, to take responsibility for themselves and for their families--largely because of the kinds of public policy decisions we have had the privilege of supporting here in the Senate with respect to this kind of economic sharing, if you will. We say to Americans: If you take the effort to live by the rules, to show your creditworthiness, to stand up within the economic structure, then we have the ability to help provide some of the tools to build that decent life for yourself. CRA was built on that. 
   But what we are considering today--and I heard the Senator from Wyoming and I have heard other Senators try to suggest this is 
   really just a fixing of the CRA, that it doesn't really take it apart, it is going to leave it in place; we are just going to take, whatever, about 38 percent of the banks out from under it--those are the banks under the $100 million mark--and then we are going to make it a lot more difficult to apply any real measurement because we are going to change the standard by which we measure a violation; and, we are also going to change--according to the chairman--we are going to exempt banks from protest based on a 3-year satisfactory CRA record no matter what. And of course for the new activities we are empowering in this bill, it doesn't apply at all. 
   If ever there was a reason to make judgments about whether or not people are in compliance, it is when they are going to go out and engage in new activities that involve a whole series of new, larger roles within the economic community. 
   It seems to me it is inconceivable that, when they are going to take on those new kinds of responsibilities, you are suddenly going to say: We are not going to apply it; we are going to hold it where it is based on the theory of what CRA is supposed to be. 
   There is a reason that there is this kind of semi-subtle approach--I would not call it that subtle in the end. It is sort of a sledgehammer, but it is hidden enough in a way that people who are not completely familiar with it or with the process might say there are some redeeming factors here. But the fact is, the reason it is done in this sort of backdoor approach is that they learned they cannot do a frontal assault. They are not going to strike it altogether. It does not give people enough cover. So then you are left sort of analyzing: What is it that it is really going to do? What is going to happen here, in terms of this effort?  
   I believe the Bryan amendment will preserve the appropriate relationships by simply requiring that banks have and maintain a satisfactory CRA rating as a condition of exercising the new affiliations allowed in this bill. The Bryan amendment also strikes the safe harbor language and the exemption from CRA regulations for banks with less than $100 million of assets. 
   I listened to the chairman in the committee and I addressed this directly--raised this issue of extortion. I acknowledged at the time, and I will acknowledge on the floor, that I know of instances where people have come into a bank at the last minute, or at the moment of a merger, feeling the iron is hot, and of course when the bank wants the merger to move--carefully and without ruffled feathers. When the banks don't want the regulators suddenly getting their dander up at this critical moment of merger. So people take advantage of this opportunity. 
   Let me say, I know of some instances where there have been some marginally meritorious requests. But the record of the numbers of challenges--and I will address that in a moment--is very clear. It is so de minimis that no one can come to the floor with anything except pure anecdote, sort of a story here or there, that suggests that somehow there is some massive problem. What bank does not deal with community groups, all the time--this is not some sort of a last minute thing where there are a bunch of unknown people sitting at a table who can walk into the bank and the newspapers and the local television are all going to take them seriously. We are dealing, after all, with communities in which there are sets of relationships which everybody understands. 
   Most of the people within that community--the political leaders, the elected political leaders, the opinion leaders, the bankers, the businesspeople, the news people--understand the difference between legitimacy and extortion. They understand the difference between a community that is getting its fair share of community investment from a bank and a community that has been starved. 
   The fact is, if somebody is walking in, in some sort of bald-faced ``extortion effort,'' the bank can tell them no way and probably stand there with impunity and justification in doing so. If some banker is complaining about some illegitimate group coming in and holding them up, then that banker, frankly, ought to be fired for not having the courage and the guts to say: Look, we are meeting our standards. We have covered all the people who have made legitimate requests. Your request is not legitimate. It will not withstand the scrutiny in the light of day, and I am not going to be blackmailed, period. 
   Moreover, there are laws in this country already on the books, Federal laws, State laws and local--within counties--which district attorneys can prosecute with respect to those kinds of extortion efforts. 
   To suggest we are going to hold up the financial modernization efforts of the United States of America in a global marketplace over these anecdotal stories and not be able to find a common ground where we could fix or address the question of legitimacy--there are any number of language changes you could make in the standards or in the review process or in the process, all of which would be adequate to deal with the questions that the Senator from Texas has raised. But none of those is on the table, none of them. What is on the table is an entire exemption for a whole set of banks for whom this has worked very effectively. Moreover, what is on the table is an exemption of any consideration at all for these remarkable new powers that are going to be given to the banks which demand that you make some kind of judgment about what their commitment really is in their community. 
   You can talk to most of the bankers in the country right now. 
   The Wall Street Journal summed it up this way:  
   Few Republicans share (the Chairman's) passion for the (CRA) issue. Bankers don't love the CRA but have largely made their peace with it. ..... ``CRA is part of the way we do business--we don't have any problems with it,'' says Pamela Flaherty, a vice president at Citigroup, Inc.  
   It is not industry leaders or community leaders who are driving this effort to undermine the CRA; it is the tendency in this Chamber and in our politics for ideology sometimes to work against the needs of communities and the interests of good public policy. When you measure what we are doing against the broad-based effort of the House of Representatives and the House Banking Committee to develop a more broad-based effort, you have a real confrontation with that approach. 
   If you look at some of the language we have heard about the CRA--comparing it to slavery--that is the kind of statement that just ignores the reality of what the CRA has accomplished. 
   The CRA, accepted by most bankers in this country, supported by people like Alan Greenspan, supported by major bankers in the country, has brought billions of dollars of credit into African communities, Hispanic communities, and Asian-American communities where thousands of banks have become active partners in creating opportunities for working families so they can become new homeowners and by providing the capital to budding entrepreneurs. 
   Slavery? That is an extraordinary comment. Too many of our colleagues are willing to forget the redlining and the racism that plagued lending in too many low-income communities in previous years. Before 1977, when the Community Reinvestment Act became law, many financial institutions believed they had absolutely no responsibility to the communities they served. Some financial institutions accepted racial and economic discrimination as part of their mortgage credit and business lending policy. It is because we found that too many banking institutions saw an ease to the profit line by moving into certain areas and an unwillingness to do business and reach out to Main Street with access to credit that we put the CRA in place. 
   Studies from that time period show that some financial institutions routinely invested more than 90 percent of their deposits that they received from low-income and minority neighborhoods into other areas. Ninety percent of the deposits that came from certain low-income communities went out to other areas. We have a fundamental responsibility not to start segmenting and dividing up the financial marketplace in a way that is going to allow people to turn away from that responsibility of inclusion that has benefited everybody in this country and has made this country a better place. 
   In Roxbury, MA, a low-income minority neighborhood within the city of Boston, only 20 percent of home sales were financed by financial institutions between 1975 and 1976. But in the prosperous suburbs of Boston, 83 percent of home sales were financed by financial institutions in the same time period. 
   The residents of Roxbury who were able to obtain financing were forced to use private mortgage companies, often at substantially greater expense than at financial institutions. The cost of denying private mortgage credit and business lending was literally devastating to the social and economic growth of Roxbury and other low-income neighborhoods in the inner city and in rural areas. Over time, property values and small business activity plummeted, and then crime and poverty escalated. 
   We can recreate that cycle if we want to go backward in time, Mr. President. Activities like that are exactly what brought the Congress to pass the Community Reinvestment Act in 1977, to encourage bank and thrift regulatory agencies to help meet the credit needs in all areas of the communities that they serve. 
   I don't think we can afford as a nation to roll ourselves back 
   to those days when it was more power to the powerful, more money to those who already had the money, and less concern and less effort to try to be the country that all the speeches are about and all our days of celebration are about. 
   CRA has worked in Massachusetts where there has been more than $1.6 billion in commitments made by financial assistance institutions to assist low-income neighborhoods. These funds have been invested in home ownership, affordable housing development, minority small business development, new banking facilities and services, and it has made a difference in our inner-city neighborhoods from Roxbury to Jamaica Plain to the South End. Let me give a direct example.  
   Stacy Andrus, from Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, was a restaurateur struggling to make ends meet and retain her clientele in a competitive environment. She knew she had to be creative just to keep pace. She began toasting chips out of pita bread to serve as finger food before meals. As one might expect, those chips soon became the most popular item on the menu. 
   Like so many businessowners who know they have latched on to a great idea, she wanted to expand the operation. She tried to bring the concept to scale, but capital and credit were not available to her; they were not available in Jamaica Plain. Even though their deposits went into the bank, they did not come back into the community. 
   She could not find the help she needed until finally she started working with the Jamaica Plain Neighborhood Development Corporation. This corporation works within a network of small business providers that use CRA programs at local banks to secure funding for small businesses. With their help, Stacy obtained a $60,000 loan from BankBoston. As a result, her business expanded rapidly: She has leased a production plant in Jamaica Plain; she has residents of the low-income community working for her; she has put former welfare recipients on the payroll; she has 900 bags of chips rolling off the assembly line every single day. Thanks to CRA she has now made them one of the top selling gourmet snack foods in all of Boston, and she has major airlines interested in serving her chips to first-class customers. Without the CRA, Mr. President, the community of Jamaica Plain would not have received those kinds of benefits from economic development that has been generated. In addition, it is also giving low-income communities a shot at home ownership. 
   Julie Orlando is a single working mother of three. She wanted to buy a home for her family in Leominster, MA, which is Northwest of Boston. In the days before CRA, she would not have possibly been considered a likely candidate to own a home, but because the Fidelity Cooperative Bank was involved in the CRA coalition, she was able to obtain a $72,000 mortgage with no points. The city of Leominster provided additional assistance to Julie and her family. Because the Fidelity Cooperative Bank participated in the CRA coalition, she and her children can live with their first home, which is, after all, Mr. President, not just the American dream, but it is good for the community. 
   How many times have we heard of the problem of crime that comes from transient members of the community, people who do not have a stake in the community. That is exactly the type of assistance that CRA was designed to provide. 
   It is my hope we are not going to take measures here that deny a whole generation of CRA success stories in the future. The CRA and the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data continue to show that blacks and Hispanics face significantly higher mortgage rejection rates. 
   The Boston Federal Reserve showed conclusively that African Americans get turned down for a mortgage 1.6 times more often than whites, even after you control for many of the economic income and creditworthiness differences.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there are two issues of critical importance to the future of Indonesia, the region, and the international community which has interest in securing a stable and democratic future for Southeast Asia: the upcoming elections in Indonesia and the political status of East Timor. If the June national elections in Indonesia are determined to be free, fair and transparent, the ballot for East Timor's political future has a much better chance of being conducted under the same conditions. The U.S. and the international community must make a strong effort now to ensure that these conditions are established and upheld. 
   For the first time in forty-five years, Indonesians have a chance to participate in a free and fair election and to establish a government with popular support and legitimacy. For the first time in twenty-four years, the Indonesian government is willing to consider an East Timor that is independent of Indonesian rule, pending the decision of the East Timorese, themselves. Indonesia, indeed, stands at a cross-roads. 
   We must be sure that the U.S. and the international community stands there with it to guide Indonesia down the correct path. The path that leads to democracy and free-market economic growth. Not the one headed into chaos and economic downturn. It is clear that the stakes are high. 
   Indonesia boasts the fourth largest population, and is a crucial player in Asia, where American economic and political interests overlap. In 1996, the United States benefitted from some $3 billion in exports to Indonesia and American firms had invested over $5.1 billion in Indonesia's growing economy. The Asian financial crisis reversed this course of economic expansion, crippling Indonesia's economy and exposing the inherent weakness in Indonesia's political structure under the Suharto regime. 
   The resulting disintegration, which I saw first-hand during my trip to Indonesia in December, is overwhelming. Indonesia's GNP fell by fifteen percent in 1998, and is predicted to experience another decline this year. Unemployment stands at over 20 million, up from 8 million last May. Forty percent of Indonesia's 218 million people live below the poverty line. But, this is not the end of it. 
   Economic instability has exacerbated the already prevalent political and social tensions. Student protests, attacks on Chinese businessmen, conflicts between Ambonese Christians and Muslims, and paramilitary violence in East Timor is evident across the country. Separatist forces on Aceh, Irian Jaya and other islands in Indonesia's multi-ethnic archipelago are gaining sway as Timorese independence moves closer to reality. The Indonesian government must take strong and decisive steps now to reduce these tensions and build respect for the rule of law and human rights. This is necessary and crucial in order to create an atmosphere conducive to holding democratic elections and determining, peacefully, the future political status of East Timor. 
   I must, however, commend the actions that President Habibie has taken thus far to open the political process and set the stage for democratic elections in June. In February, 1999, he signed legislation that established guidelines and procedures for conducting national elections. Forty-eight parties are now registered to compete in the June election, as opposed to three in the Suharto era. The military's representation in the parliament has also been reduced. Seats will be allocated by proportional representation, rather than the winner take all strategy which favored the Golkar party. 
   I am pleased to cosponsor legislation introduced by Senator Robert TORRICELLI which supports these efforts of the Indonesian government to achieve a real and peaceful transition to democracy. This bill calls upon the government to make necessary preparations to ensure that free, fair and transparent national elections will occur in June and that there is a strong commitment to uphold the results of them. It also asks all parties involved in determining the status of East Timor to seek an equitable and workable resolution to this issue. I have cosponsored similar legislation in the past which affirmed the right of the East Timorese to have a referendum on self-determination, encouraged the Indonesian government to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms and urged the Indonesian political leaders to implement political and economic reforms. I will continue to support such efforts in the future. 
   The reforms that the Indonesian government has implemented --however encouraging--do not on their own guarantee free and fair elections, nor do they help to reduce the tensions related to East Timor's political status. Violence has been on the rise. The world has witnessed increased hostilities in recent months among groups that have cultural and political interest in what the future shape of East Timor will be. The Indonesian government has a responsibility to resolve these tensions. I believe it can begin by abandoning its plan to employ civilian militias to combat violence and dismantling existing militias, whose abuses are already heightening the potential for violence. The government must help the military find means for handling violent outbursts effectively, without abuse. 
   Allegations of the Indonesian military's direct involvement in committing human rights abuses and perpetuating violence led me to support a restriction on U.S. arms sales and International Military Education and Training (IMET) aid to Indonesia which was initiated by Congress in 1993. I was, and still am, concerned that the Indonesian armed forces might use U.S. arms, military training, and financial assistance to commit human rights violations against innocent civilians. It remains necessary to keep these restrictions in place until it is clear that the Indonesian military is committed to upholding democratic principles. 
   I am encouraged that the leaders of the Indonesian military, the pro-Indonesia militias and the pro-Independence rebels signed a peace agreement on April 21, 1999 that calls for an end to the violence and a laying down of arms. It also establishes a Peace and Stability Commission which may help to determine the process by which full disarmament can occur and the political status of East Timor can be determined. These are significant steps forward and I believe lay the groundwork for real stability and peace. 
   Mr. President, it must not stop there, however. The Indonesian government--with the support and commitment of its military--must continue its dialogue with all competing factions, both those that support and those that oppose independence. Together, they must seek to resolve outstanding issues--such as disarmament and the question that will be asked on the ballot--in the most expeditious way possible. I am pleased that East Timor groups favoring independence from Indonesia have been included in recent  discussions regarding the future political status of East Timor. It is important for all parties to be at the table since all parties must ultimately abide by the agreement if it is to be credible and enduring. 
   While the exact details of the tripartite negotiations that occurred last month between Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N. are not fully clear at this time, the world community will be watching closely when they are released. The August ballot is supposed to determine the political future of East Timor. Whether the East Timorese choose independence or continued unity with Indonesia, the voting process and the period following the vote must be free of violence and intimidation. The world community can play an active role in helping the Indonesian government see that this happens. 
   The Administration has pledged $30 million to assist Indonesia during its national election. However, I believe we, and others in the international community, should do more to make sure that sufficient funds are available both for a free and fair election to occur in June and to help the Indonesian government conduct a free and fair ballot for East Timor in August. The United Nations already has agreed to send a civilian police force to East Timor to monitor the vote. I believe this is a good first step. The U.N. presence should, though, be supplemented by international, non-governmental organizations, or equivalent Indonesian groups, which can help monitor and facilitate the ballot process. 
   The time is now for the U.S. and the international community to focus on Indonesia and East Timor. The national election for Indonesia is less than six weeks away and the ballot for East Timor is only about eight weeks after that. I believe, as one long involved in Southeast Asia, that it is important for those who have interest in the future stability of this region to start creating a positive atmosphere in which both of these events can occur.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank Senator BIDEN for his courtesy. I appreciate this enormously. I also thank Senator DURBIN, who is not here, but will be here shortly, for his courtesy. 
   Mr. President, I join with the Senator from Arizona, the Senator from Connecticut, Senator DODD, Senator BIDEN and others in support of this resolution. I understand the sensitivities of a great many of our colleagues and the administration to where we find ourselves. But I think that a fair analysis of what the Senate has before it and what the country has before it really mandates that the Senate be prepared to back up its own steps, the steps that we took when we supported the bombing itself. 
   I heard a number of my colleagues in the course of the debate over this afternoon, most recently the Senator from New Mexico, say, ``Well, we need to recognize that the President made a decision and the President, having made a decision, we now need to know from the President what the strategy is; we need to know from the President what the exit strategy is; we need to know from the President what is called for.'' 
   Frankly, I say to my colleagues, there is not a small measure of contradiction in those statements today. There may even be some measure, I think, of confusion about the road that we have traveled. 
   The fact is that the President made it clear to us at the outset what our goal was. The goal has always been the capacity of the Kosovars to live in peace within Kosovo. The goal has been a return to the status quo before Mr. Milosevic withdrew autonomy which had been enjoyed by the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo for years, in the wake of his sudden discovery that playing the nationalist card, in fact, was a road to power, as it was also the road to some four wars and to an extraordinary amount of killing in Bosnia, in Slovenia, Herzegovina and Croatia. 
   Now, Mr. President, we find ourselves in the situation where the Senator from Arizona and some of us are suggesting that the course that we chose in the beginning is, in fact, a correct course, and the course that we ought to follow. The truth is that it was not just the President of the United States who made a decision. So did the Senate of the United States. A majority of the Senators in this body voted to approve the bombing, and having approved the bombing and having decided to send American forces into harm's way, they embraced the goals that were then stated. 
   One component of those goals did change, obviously, dramatically. The effort initially was to prevent the ethnic cleansing from taking place and to hope we could sufficiently degrade the military machine to prevent that from happening. That, obviously, did not occur, and the ethnic cleansing continued. We now find ourselves with more than half the population dislocated outside of Kosovo, a significant portion displaced within Kosovo, and as to how many that may be is imprecise. 
   It seems to me that this is not a time for the Senate to engage in covering its own posterior, not a time for the Senate to engage in a wholesale set of contradictions. It is rather the time for the Senate to declare, as unequivocally as it declared 40 days ago, that we are prepared to move forward with the bombing, that the same goals and the same objectives are viable today. 
   It is interesting. I know that some have hearkened back to the Tonkin Gulf resolution and have hearkened back to some of the lessons of the Vietnam war. There is no small irony, however, in the fact that we are beyond, in a way, the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. There was a time for people to question why we were bombing, what the motives were of bombing, what we hoped to achieve through the bombing and whether or not it was appropriate to start bombing and then suddenly stop, short of achieving those objectives. That, I think, would have been appropriate. 
   Having decided that you were going to bomb, I think most people accepted the notion that the reason for bombing was legitimate enough, that the reason for putting American forces in harm's way was legitimate enough, that the goals that we were trying to achieve were legitimate enough, and that if you were prepared to take the risks of putting those people in harm's way, you were also accepting the responsibility for achieving the goal that was set out. 
   Back in the 1960s, when the Gulf of Tonkin resolution came to the floor, there were two Senators who stood up and, as a matter of conscience, said: I disagree with this, and voted against. One was Wayne Morse; the other was Ernest Gruening. It took a long time for history to prove those lone Senators correct. It may well be that those Senators who voted against the resolution supporting air strikes against Yugoslavia and who might choose to vote against those things necessary to achieve the goals may be proven correct by history. I do not know. At least that opposition is consistent, and at least that opposition is devoid of the disingenuity that we seem to see in those who voted to start bombing, those who have been saying for a year and a half or 2 years or more, you have to stop Mr. Milosevic, those who were crying for the United States to take a stand only a year ago, and then once the President does take a stand--the only stand that most people in the world thought he could take--all of a sudden they begin to vanish and run for the sidelines and take cover. 
   I find that rather extraordinary, not to mention that it is, in fact, a contradiction of enormous proportions. 
   I understand how some in this Chamber have reservations about bombing. I understand full well about how some, given the history of the Balkans, may have inherent reservations about the United States, through NATO, even being involved there. Some of those people reflected those deep-rooted beliefs and fears in their original vote. 
   But the majority of the Senate voted by a greater margin than the majority who sent this Nation to war in Desert Storm--a greater majority. After Desert Storm, all those who had voted against it came together to suggest that the stated goals of the United States were such that we ought to  guarantee the outcome. And we were committed to do what was necessary in order to achieve that, and we would support any efforts in order to achieve that. 
   Mr. President, I think one of the great lessons of the Vietnam period--and I think Senator HAGEL feels it very strongly, Senator MCCAIN feels it very strongly, Senator ROBB, myself, and others--is that if you are going to commit American forces, you make the decisions at the outset about what you are trying to achieve, and you make decisions at the outset that if you are going to send those soldiers--airmen, seamen, all of them--into battle, you do so with the understanding that you are committed to achieving the goals that you have set out. 
   I think it would be astonishing, in the face of the reality that the goals are achievable here, that this is so distinctly different from a Vietnam or even a Desert Storm in some ways--that we should ourselves provide these ingredients of doubt and reservation that seem to back off the original commitment that we made. 
   I have heard many people questioning, not only today, some of the rationale for why we are there or how the war is proceeding. But some seek a reservation in the notion that the President has not asked for this authorization of force or the Joint Chiefs of Staff have not asked for it. But those same people are always quick to come to the floor and assert the powers and prerogatives of the U.S. Congress in the conduct of foreign policy. 
   They are often the first to come to the floor to suggest some alternative policy to the President. They have often come to the floor with amendments to change Presidential policy in foreign policy, to amend it, to strengthen it. I think there is an irony that all of a sudden they are suggesting so much power to the President, so much prerogative away from the Congress, when they have spent an awful long time here asserting the very opposite. 
   In addition to that, I have heard colleagues deeply disturbed--as anybody should be appropriately--about collateral damage and what happens in the bombing. I do not think there is an American, in good conscience, who does not feel pangs or deep reservations about any errant missile or errant bomb and what the effects are. But there is no moral equivalency whatsoever between those errant impacts and what we are trying to achieve and what Mr. Milosevic has been achieving. There is simply no moral equivalency. 
   Let us not get confused between collateral damage and the murder, rape, organized rape, pillage, plunder, decimation of ethnicity, robbing of identities, the wholesale destruction of villages, the killing of teachers and parents in front of their children, the remarkable--remarkable--dismemberment of the people that Mr. Milosevic is engaged in and not for the first time. Having seen the record of what he did in Bosnia, to allow that kind of moral equivocation to enter into our thinking in this is, to me, to miss the point altogether. 
   The fact is that Senator DODD from Connecticut pointed out, and others have pointed out, that what we do here can have a profound, long-lasting, deep impact on our capacity to negotiate, to pressure, and to speak about and stand for morality and for a 
   standard of behavior that is different from the kind of killing and marauding that has governed so much of this century. 
   Now, some will say, ``Well, the Balkans are different.'' Some will say, ``Well, we can't always affect the outcome of these things.'' The fact is, we can affect this outcome. We can affect this result. We do have the power and the ability to be able to do this. 
   I have heard some of my colleagues come to the floor and say this is going to affect our capacity to fight some other war somewhere. What war? Where? What are they talking about? I mean, are we planning suddenly some other war of which we are not aware? 
   This is staring us in the face. It is here. It is now. We are at war. The question we must ask ourselves is whether or not we are prepared to win or whether we are going to put obstacle after obstacle in front of ourselves to deprive ourselves of the capacity to achieve the goals that are achievable. 
   I hear some refer to Vietnam a lot, but other kinds of conflicts as well. I suggest that this is not a Vietnam--unless we make it a Vietnam, unless it is our own lack of resolve and pursuit. 
   Some have said, well, if it is a mistake in the first place, you do not want to go down the road pursuing a mistake. I support that notion. I recall coming back from Vietnam and saying, ``it is pretty hard to ask somebody to be the person to die for a mistake or especially the last person to die for it.'' 
   I am sensitive to that. But the original question is, Is this a mistake? When 58 of us voted on the floor of the Senate to send people into harm's way in order to achieve our stated goals, we were making a judgment about whether or not we thought it was a mistake to intervene. And now that we have decided to intervene, let us at least have the courage to persevere. 
   Why did we intervene? Well, I believe that the imperatives of intervention outweigh the alternatives so far that it is hard to really measure the counterarguments. Any one of us in the Senate can hear this well of the Senate ringing out with the voices of those who would have come to the floor if the images of CNN night after night had been of Milosevic running unstopped over the people of Kosovo, unstopped, and no effort whatsoever to try to prevent him. I could hear people coming to the floor and saying, ``Where is a President with the courage of Ronald Reagan or George Bush who's willing to draw the line as they did?'' You can hear those speeches now. They would have been spoken. 
   President George Bush, in fact, had the same policy that President Clinton has. George Bush, before he left office, said we would draw the line in Kosovo and told Mr. Milosevic, in no uncertain terms, ``Don't monkey around with this one.'' And because he had the credibility of what he had done in Kuwait, you can bet that that made a difference. 
   That is why we are here on the floor with this resolution, to give our effort the kind of credibility that it deserves, to back up our soldiers who are running those risks on a daily basis, with the understanding that there is a rationale for our having asked them to do what they are doing. I do not, by any sense of the imagination, believe that we have exhausted the air campaign in this. 
   It astonishes me, in some ways, that so many people are so questioning of an air campaign that--knock on wood--has not yet cost us the life of one of those pilots. I am astonished, as a former serviceperson, at the quality and care with which this has been prosecuted. We lose more people every week in the military of this country in normal training exercises and operations. The fact that this has been carried on now for 40 days, melding Dutch, British, Germans, Americans, French, Greeks, 19 different countries together, melding all of these airplanes and those multiple sorties, and bringing that together, is really a remarkable accomplishment. 
   At the same time, day by day by day, albeit some Members of the Yugoslav Army may feel better and think, gee, we have been given a purpose in life, the fact is that on a daily basis their capacity to wage the war is being stripped away. Who in their right mind would choose Mr. Milosevic's hand to play in this versus the hand of NATO? 
   The question before the Senate and this country is, Will we have the capacity to stay and play out the hand that we have? 
   This is not Vietnam. This is not a country that stretches from the equivalent of New England all the way down to the tip of Florida with a Laos and a Cambodia on its borders, with a superpower, the former Soviet Union, and China sitting in the background supplying, pushing down the Ho Chi Minh Trail, ready to come in when we threaten to use whatever force may be available to us. This is not the United States essentially acting alone. 
   Taken together, Serbia and Montenegro are slightly smaller than Kentucky and are essentially surrounded by friendly people. Kosovo is approximately the size of Los Angeles county. Unlike North Vietnam and South Vietnam at the time, unlike that country, where we became involved on the side of one of the combatants, where we chose to carry on years of colonial effort that had been misconstrued by the population and outright opposed and reviled for years, unlike the inadvisability of having been embroiled, we  have been very careful here to suggest we are not for independence for Kosovo, we are not for the KLA ravaging their countryside any more than we are for Mr. Milosevic and the Serbs doing so. 
   We are fighting for the standards of internationally accepted, universally accepted behavior that country after country has signed on to through United Nations conventions and other instruments of international law and through their own standards of behavior. 
   I can't think of anything more right than taking a position against this kind of thuggery and this kind of effrontery to those standards as we leave the end of this century. 
   Some people say to me, ``well, Senator, we are going to have some people there for a long time.'' My answer is, So what? If that is what it takes in order to try to begin to establish a principle that is more long lasting, so be it. 
   What is the difference between 4,000 troops who have been asked to be part of a peaceful effort to change the standards of behavior in Kosovo as part of southern Europe--what is the difference between that and the 500,000 troops we had at a high point in Europe after World War II? Don't forget the way in which most Americans were skeptical of Harry Truman and the Marshall plan. How on Earth could the United States of America, having fought the Germans, turn around and put money back into their country? How on Earth could we try to bring the Germans into NATO? 
   Well, where are we today? A united Germany, the Berlin Wall gone, Berlin about to be the united capital of Germany, and the result, Germans participating with us in standing up against the very kinds of things that stained the history of this century and of their country during World War II. Is there a more beautiful circle in terms of understanding what is at stake? I do not think so. 
   It seems to me, Mr. President, that an investment of some 5,000, 6,000, 7,000 troops in southern Europe to guarantee that Greece, Macedonia, Montenegro, and Albania can remain stable and not be dragged into this, that is worthwhile. 
   Some would say, Senator, we heard that old domino argument before; that is the one they gave us in Vietnam. 
   Once again, the facts on the ground are proving the reality. Can anyone here tell me with a straight face that Montenegro, without our current efforts and involvement, could possibly withstand the strains of what is happening? Can anybody tell me that if the entire population of Kosovo were driven out into Albania, you wouldn't somehow see Macedonia, Greece, Albania dragged into this? Ultimately, there isn't a person in the Senate 
   who doesn't understand that we would have been dragged into it, too. There was an inevitability that NATO would be called on to take a stand. 
   How astonishing it is that people find some kind of moral equivalency here between some of the difficulties of waging a fairly carefully prosecuted--not fairly, a very carefully prosecuted war, and what we are trying to achieve. How astonishing that people are so concerned about finding that equivalency measured against what Mr. Milosevic has done. 
   I believe if we will stand our ground and be steady and show the resolve that we need to show as a great country and the leader of the free world, that we have the ability, through this air campaign, to achieve ultimately the diplomatic outcome that we would like to achieve. 
   But we have also learned through all of history--Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon will tell you this, in dealing with the North Vietnamese in the Christmas bombing, and I hated it back then, but I have come to understand that there are, in fact, sometimes some things that do speak and make a difference to certain people. Like it or not, as I have been deeply involved in that part of the world in the last years, I have learned that that did help make a difference to people's decisions to try to come to some kind of resolution. 
   The fact is that we are now backing up diplomacy with force. I have heard some people call for a stay in that force, that somehow it would be diplomatically nice if we were to turn around and have a bombing pause. 
   My response to that is very simple: Do not let the politicians decide, after sending the military personnel in to risk their lives, when you are going to have a bombing pause, without adequately passing it by the military to ensure that you are not going to put your people at greater risk if you don't achieve your goals at the back side of it. 
   I can't go into all the reasons for that, but people understand that there are a great many repercussions to a bombing halt which could have greater jeopardy to our pilots and greater jeopardy to the use of whatever force we need to use down the road. I am perfectly committed to having that happen at the right moment, but I want that to be driven by the military needs of achieving our goals and not simply the political imperatives at the time. 
   Finally, Mr. President, let me say that I hear colleagues say: Well, we want to know what the end game is; we want to know what the strategy is. We have even heard mention of the Boland amendment and other things. Are we in this to win? 
   There are only three or so choices in this, Mr. President. That is about it. Anybody ought to be able to figure them out. Stop the bombing and fail to achieve your goals. And if you stop the bombing; NATO would be irreparably damaged, if not simply finished. Mr. Milosevic can declare victory, do what he wants, and you will have no force in there. That is one choice. 
   Another choice is that you continue to prosecute the air war as you press the diplomatic effort, with a guarantee that you are going to press that until you get that effort. 
   The third is--and it is the best end game, best exit strategy of all--you win. That is the exit strategy. You achieve the simple stated goal of returning the Kosovars into Kosovo, allowing them to live in a protected structure where people won't be killing them, and at the same time have a force that has the capacity to prevent the UCK/KLA from also engaging in killing. It is called peace. I think that is an end game worth fighting for. 
   If the impact of the air war is substantial enough to force Mr. Milosevic to yield and accept NATO's terms for ending the war, then we will have won. However, if bombing alone is not enough, then winning will require that we have the determination and resolve to do whatever is necessary on the ground to achieve these 
   objectives--to win. 
   I think when you measure the history of Europe and the importance of southern Europe, and the success of the integration process in Europe, you cannot question the need to achieve our stated goals in Kosovo. NATO has played an important role in the integration process--just talk to the officials in Spain or in other parts of Europe about the impact of NATO as an organizing principal, as a means of having brought countries together around democracy. They will tell you unequivocally of the degree to which the process of meeting, of coming together, of having mutual responsibilities, of needing to work together have had a profound impact on the capacity of Europe to develop so that they now have a common market and are working on the last efforts of integration, with more power in Brussels and more capacity as a European entity to speak to the world and to stand for these principles. 
   Are we going to deny that to southeastern Europe? Are we going to ignore the lesson that we would sent to Baghdad or Pyongyang or Tripoli or to other parts of the world if we fail to do what is necessary to win in Kosovo? I hope the answer of the Senate would be unequivocally no. The lessons of history are such that they taught us that this is the right thing to be doing for the right reasons. They are, I think, efforts that are worthy of our commitment in order to see it through to the end. 
   I am confident that if the Senate and the country were to speak with a single voice on this, in a short period of time we would see this resolved and, most likely, Mr. President, without recourse to ground troops or to prolonged war. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. All right. 
   Mr. President, let me just say a few words on the issue of the Y2K. I have been working quietly with a number of colleagues in order to try to see if we cannot come to some sort of compromise. 
   I heard the Senator from Arizona assert that the principal reason that we are where we are right now is because the revenue stream for lawyers, for trial counsel, might be somehow impacted, and that is the sort of overbearing consideration that has brought us to this point of impasse. Let me just say as directly and as forcefully as I possibly can that there really are public policy considerations that extend beyond that. 
   I have tried cases previously as a trial attorney. I understand the motivations and needs to certainly have a client base which allows you to survive. I have seen some ugly practices out there, and I have joined in condemning them as a Member of the Senate and also as a member of the bar. 
   I do not think any of us who are members of the bar take pride in the practices of some attorneys who have obviously given the profession a bad name at times and have abused what 
   ought to be a more respected and sacrosanct relationship in the country. 
   But at the same time, just as with any business--whether it is Wall Street and brokers or businesspeople who are manufacturers who somehow put a product on the marketplace that cost lives--there are always exceptions to fundamental rules. There are also a lot of lawyers out there who work for nothing, who do pro bono work, who give their energies to fighting for the environment or for civil rights or a whole lot of other things. I think it is a mistake to sweep everybody into one basket and suggest that that is all this issue is about. 
   We have some time-honored traditions in this country about access to our court system. We have some deep-rooted principles which allow victims of certain kinds of abuses, and sometimes even arrogance, to be able to get redress for that. That is one of the beauties of the American judicial system. And I could show--and I do not have time now--countless examples of life being made better for millions of Americans because some lawyer took a case to court and was willing to fight for a particular principle. 
   I happened to bump into Ralph Nader a little while ago going into a Banking hearing related to an issue on privacy on the House side. I recall, obviously, his landmark efforts with respect to automobiles and safety, and millions of American lives have been saved because of those kinds of challenges. 
   Sometimes the pendulum sweeps too far, and I well recognize that. In fact, there is a great tendency within the Congress for us to react to a particular problem, and, kaboom, we wind up with unintended consequences, and then we sort of have to pull the pendulum back. I have done that. 
   I have joined with colleagues here to change the law on liability with respect to aircraft manufacturing because we found that there was a particular problem for small, light plane manufacturing in the country. We also changed the law with respect to securities reform, and I joined in that effort. And I joined in overriding the veto of a President with respect to those things because I thought the reform was important and legitimate. No one here ought to condone the capacity of individual lawyers to simply trigger a lawsuit with the hopes of walking into a company and then holding them up for settlement because it is too expensive to litigate. 
   I believe that in the compromise we have on the table, as well as in other efforts that have been offered, there are legitimate restraints on the capacity of lawyers to abuse the system. There are increased specificity requirements with respect to the pleadings so that you cannot just go in on a fishing expedition. There is a 90-day period for cure; i.e., once a company is noticed that they are in fact in a particular possible breach with respect to the contract that extends for the sale of a particular computer or software program, they are given 90 days within which time they can cure the problem and there is no lawsuit. In addition to that, there are a series of other restraints which I think are entirely appropriate, and I would vote for those. 
   Let's say somebody's mother or father is at home and you have a bank account and a bank loses your entire bank account, for whatever reason, or there is some doctor's appointment that is lost by somebody that was critical to the provision of some serum or antibiotic. Who knows what might be occurring that has been computerized and 
   expected on a particular schedule that might be affected. There is a requirement in their legislation, the legislation currently about to be voted on, which would deny any consumer access to remedy for 90 days. 
   You get a 90-day stay period. What is the rationale for that? That was supposed to apply to the companies, not to individuals. But we don't have a legitimate carve-out for consumers, for the average consumer, for Joe ``Six-Pack'' who might be affected by this. They are somehow going to be plunked into a basket with all of the other companies. 
   In addition to that, there is a legitimate problem with respect to access to the system. If you have a company that does business abroad, does not have a home base here, you have no capacity to reach them with respect to service of process. We are going to say that we are going to deny somebody the capacity to have full redress or remedy, and they are going to have to go chase that other person somehow, no matter what the level of that person's responsibility is. To do that is effectively to say to people, Sorry, folks. No lawyer in the country is going to take that case. We're effectively stripping you of the rights to be able to have access to the court system. 
   I am for a fair balance here. I have a lot of companies in Massachusetts that are high-tech companies, a lot of companies that are impacted by this. I know a lot of people in the industry whom I respect enormously who deserve to be protected against greedy, voracious sorts of wrongful, totally  predatory efforts to try to hold them up in the system. I am for stopping that. 
   I would, in our effort, put restraints on the capacity to bring class actions wrongly. And I think we have an increased standard with respect to materiality that would make it much tougher for people to put a class together without a showing of injury. 
   So the real issue here before us in the Senate is, What is really trying to be achieved here? If we are trying to simply achieve a balanced, fair approach to protecting companies from unfair lawsuits and being balanced about the average citizen's approach to the court system there is a way to do that. But if what we are doing is a larger tort reform agenda, because of the bad name that lawyers in general have, and some lawyers in particular have earned for them, if that is the effort, in order to seek some broader change in the legal system that denies people access to the courts, then I think we have a different kind of problem. 
   There are many people in this Chamber who have practiced law before, some on the other side of the fence, on the Republican side, who do not believe any legislation is necessary, that this is a one-time problem, that the greatest incentive you can have to avoid a problem is for people to fix it ahead of time, and the greatest way in which you will get the best and biggest and fastest fix ahead of time is to have people required to be open to the possibilities of redress if they did not do that. 
   But if we limit people's potential liability, there is a great likelihood that a lot of people will say, Well, I'm not going to fix this. I'm not liable. I don't need to do anything about it. They can't bring suit against me. And you may, in fact, have taken away the very incentive you are trying to create. 
   Mr. President, there are very real and legitimate substantive arguments: Access to our court system. What is the best incentive? How do you approach this fairly? How are you going to wind up with a system that is balanced? All of those issues are really at stake in this. I hope colleagues will remember that as they approach the question of what is the best compromise here which would give us the kind of balance that we need. 
   Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from South Carolina.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Military Reservist Small Business Relief Act of 1999. I offer it on behalf of myself and 30 other colleagues: Senators BOND, BINGAMAN, LANDRIEU, HARKIN, LIEBERMAN, WELLSTONE, KOHL, BURNS, ROBB, EDWARDS, LEVIN, GRAHAM, SNOWE, AKAKA, MURRAY, CLELAND, KENNEDY, JEFFORDS, COLLINS, ABRAHAM, LEAHY, BAUCUS, BOB KERREY of Nebraska, GRASSLEY, MOYNIHAN, LINCOLN, BAYH, CHAFEE, LAUTENBERG, COCHRAN, and DASCHLE. I thank these Senators for their support. 
   Mr. President, a number of those colleagues I listed serve on either the Small Business Committee, the Armed Services Committee or on the Veterans Affairs Committee. However, all have joined me in a universal concern that I think goes across the aisle for the problems that reservists face when they are called suddenly to active duty. This bill will help small businesses whose owner, manager, or key employee is called to active duty. Most immediately, we are obviously looking at the question of service in Kosovo, but the act also applies to future contingency operations, military conflicts, or national emergencies. 
   Since 1973, we have taken pains as a result of the Vietnam experience to build an all-volunteer military. Our reservists are much more than just weekend warriors. When they are called, they are an essential ingredient of any kind of long-term or significant deployment of American forces. I think everyone knows the contributions they have made as soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines and Coast Guard, serving our country in extraordinary ways in recent years. 
   The National Guard and the Reservists have become a critical component of U.S. force deployment. In the Persian Gulf war they accounted for more than 46 percent of our total forces. The Acting Assistant Secretary for Defense for Reserve Affairs just Tuesday said that ``Reservists are absolutely vital to our national military strategy.'' 
   To support the NATO operations in the Balkans, Secretary of Defense Cohen has asked for and received the authorization to call up members of the Selected Reserve to active duty. President Clinton has authorized deployment of 33,000 reservists, but the initial callup includes only about 2,100 personnel. These first reservists come from Alabama, Arizona, California, Kansas, Indiana, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. A total of 1.4 million Americans currently serve in our seven Reserve components of the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   When these folks are called up, even though they know they are in the Reserves and even though they know at some point in time they might be called to meet an emergency of our country, the fact is that nothing prepares their families or them for the remarkably fast transition that takes place. There are obviously emotional and personal hardships people have to deal with, but in addition to that there are significant financial realities. 
   I have heard first-hand, talking to a number of vets who suffered this callup process, how difficult it is. One veteran told the ``Boston Globe'' on the 1-year anniversary of the Persian Gulf War:  
   The Gulf War is going to wind up having caused a lot of stress for me personally and for my family. It didn't just take a year out of my life. It's going to take a minimum of another two years, because that's how long it's going to take for us to catch up.  
   I think it is imperative that we help these families and communities to bridge the gap between the moment when the troops leave and when they return. We are talking about people who fill all of the normal, everyday positions of commerce that help to keep this country strong--bankers, barbers, mechanics, merchants, farmers, doctors, Realtors, owners of fast food restaurants--all kinds of positions that reservists hold and ultimately leave when they go to active duty. 
   As some veterans of the Persian Gulf War know all too well, they left their businesses and their companies in good shape. They were earning a living, they were providing a service, they were adding to the tax base, they were creating jobs, and then they returned to hardships that range from bankruptcy to financial ruin; from deserted clients to layoffs. 
   Even if you are not a small business owner, one has to ask what happens to one's family or to one's business or company during a 6- to 7-month deployment if you or your key employee suddenly has to depart. Particularly in rural areas and small towns it can be extremely difficult to find a replacement. 
   Let me share with you just one very quick story from my part of the country. For privacy purposes I am not going to use any names. However, I am going to talk about a physician from Raynham, MA. He was a lieutenant commander in the Navy Reserve and was called up for Operation Desert Storm as a flight surgeon in January 1991. For 10 years he had been a solo practitioner. After only 6 months of service, he had to file bankruptcy. That bankruptcy affected not only him but his wife, his two employees, and their families. After 1 year on duty, he came home and he found he literally had no business, no clients at that point in time, and no job--no income as a consequence. 
   We do not know for how long reservists will be called away, but whenever they return, we ought to make certain, to the degree we can, that the negative impacts are as minimal as possible. There is a way to do that. The way to do it is through this legislation. 
   What we seek to do is to authorize the SBA, the Small Business Administration, to defer existing loan repayments and to reduce the interest rates on direct loans that may be outstanding to those who are called up. That would include disaster loans. The deferrals and reductions that are authorized by this bill would be available from the date that the individual reservist is called to active duty until 180 days after his or her release from that duty. 
   For microloans and loans guaranteed under the SBA's financial assistance programs, such as the 504 program or 7(a) loan programs, the bill directs the agency to develop policies that encourage and facilitate ways that SBA lenders can either defer or reduce loan repayments. 
   For example, a microlender's ability to repay its debt to the SBA is obviously dependent upon the repayments from its microborrowers. So, with this bill's authority, if a microlender extends or defers loan repayment to a borrower who is a deployed military reservist, in turn the SBA would extend repayment obligations to the microlender. 
   Second, the bill establishes a low-interest, economic injury loan program to be administered by the SBA through its disaster loan program. These loans would be specifically available to provide interim operating capital to any small business when the departure of a military reservist for active duty causes economic injury. Under the bill, such harm includes three general cases: No. 1, inability to make loan repayments; No. 2, inability to pay ordinary and necessary operating expenses; or, No. 3, inability to market, produce or provide a service or product that it ordinarily provides. 
   Identical to the loan deferral requirements, an eligible small business can  apply for an economic injury loan from the date that the company's military reservist is ordered to active duty, again 
   until 180 days after the release from active duty. 
   Finally, the bill directs the SBA, and all of its private sector partners, such as the small business development centers, the women's business centers, to make positive efforts--proactive efforts--to reach out to those businesses affected by the call-up of military reservists to active duty, and to offer business counseling and training. Those left behind to run the businesses, whether it is a spouse or a child or an employee, while the military reservist is serving overseas, may be inexperienced in running the business and need quick access to management and marketing counseling. We think it is important to do what we can to help bring those folks together, to keep the doors of the business open, and to reduce the impact of a military conflict and national emergency on the economy. 
   Some people might argue--I have not heard this argument sufficiently--but it is not inconceivable that some people would say: Wait a minute now, reservists do not deserve this special assistance because they ought to know the inherent risks of their chosen role and they ought to be prepared for deployment. 
   It is true you may live with those possibilities and those probabilities. It is also true it is very hard to pick up from the moment of notification to the moment of departure in as little as 3 days, pulling all the pieces together sufficiently. During the Persian Gulf war, one reservist's wife, Mrs. Carolee Ploof of Middlebury, VT, reported that her family had 3 days to prepare for her husband's departure. She said: ``How do you prepare [for that]? I really think it's unfair that self-employed people have to lose their shirts to protect their country.'' So, from the moment her husband was mobilized, he reported for duty until 10 p.m. and then went home to try to teach his wife how to run the business--all in 48 hours before he was to depart. 
   I think we should understand we are talking here about loans and extensions on loans. We are not talking about forgiveness, and we are not talking about grants. We are talking about a hand up, not a hand-out. We are talking about trying to facilitate what is obviously a very difficult process. 
   Finally, let me just say we are the people who designed the policy that made it so our military deployments for significant kinds of conflicts are, in fact, so Reserve-dependent. We did that for a lot of good reasons, not the least of which is that we have a great tradition in this country of citizen soldiers--a voluntary civilian component of our military service. We also know it is a significant way to reduce the costs of a standing army. The costs of carrying a standing army, in lieu of having reservists as the important component they are, millions of times outweighs the very small, targeted help we are talking about in this legislation. 
   I thank my 30 other colleagues who are cosponsors of this bill. I hope that this legislation will move very rapidly through the Senate so reservists will know, and their families will know, that, should there be a greater deployment in the future, it will not come with the kind of loss, or double hit if you will, for the notion of service to our country.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for yielding. I simply wanted to inform him, I wasn't on the floor at the moment the objection was raised to the Senate proceeding as Senator MCCAIN hoped to do. 
   I want to say that I had a discussion with Senator MCCAIN, Senator DODD,  Senator HOLLINGS, and others. A bona fide effort is being made right now to work with the technology community as well as with the legal community. I think there is the capacity to come together around some form of compromise. 
   I thank Senator MCCAIN for his leadership on this. I think it may be possible within hours to come together around something.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Water Resources Development Act of 1999. This bill has passed the Senate under unanimous consent thanks to the leadership of its sponsor Senator WARNER, and Senator CHAFEE, Chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Senator BAUCUS, the ranking member on the Committee. I want to thank the Senators for their work. 
   Included in this legislation is a request that the Army Corps of Engineers evaluate plans to alleviate flooding and make other improvements to the Muddy River, which runs through Brookline and Boston, Massachusetts. This is an urgently needed project. 
   The Muddy River flows through mostly urban-residential areas in Brookline and Boston before emptying into the Charles River. The River has flooded several times in the past, with two particularly severe floods in 1996 and 1998. The 1996 flood was a presidentially declared disaster. It lasted three days, submerged parts of Brookline and Boston in knee-deep water, flooded underground Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority stations and halted commuter train traffic, and extensively damaged homes and businesses. Massachusetts Governor Paul Cellucci estimates that the cost of these two floods exceeded $100,000,000. Preventing future damage from floods is a top priority for the Town of Brookline, the City of Boston and the State of Massachusetts, and each has pledged to do their part to find a solution. 
   Specifically, the Water Resources Development Act of 1999 asks the Secretary of the Army to evaluate a study called the ``Emerald Necklace Environmental Improvement Master Plan:  Phase I Muddy River Flood Control, Water Quality and Environmental Enhancement'', and to report its findings to Congress by December 31, 1999. The Plan was commissioned by the Boston Parks and Recreation Department and issued in January 1999. It presents a solution that has broad community support. Residents and businesses joined with the Town of Brookline, City of Boston, State of Massachusetts and the federal government to develop this plan. It draws on research by the Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and others to recommend comprehensive improvements to end destructive flooding, enhance water quality and protect habitat. I believe this project embodies the kind of citizen-government partnership that is necessary for an efficient and successful use of federal resources. 
   The Massachusetts delegation, the Town of Brookline, the City of Boston and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts all look forward to working with the Army Corps in Boston and Washington over the coming months to complete this evaluation by the end of the year, and to move ahead with the work of ending these destructive floods and making other needed improvements.

   Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am pleased to speak today as a co-sponsor of legislation to award a gold medal to Rosa Parks in recognition of her historic contributions to the civil rights movement and to our country. 
   The word hero is one of the most overused words in our national vernacular, a term that should be reserved for those rare people whose incredible acts of courage in the face of tremendous adversity and long odds inspire us all. Surely it can be said, though, that one of the true living heroes in our country is the mother of the civil rights movement, Rosa Parks. 
   No one would deny that America is a better place today because, on December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks sat down on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama and insisted that she would not be moved. To those of us who were children in these years watching the news on black and white television sets, entranced by the grainy images and the reassuring voice of Walter Cronkite, it is difficult to express the singular act of courage expressed in Rosa Parks' determination--her absolute resolve--to make a stand in a part of our nation we knew was home to Bull Connor and his snarling police dogs, George Wallace and his promise of ``segregation today, segregation tomorrow, and segregation forever,'' and men like Orval Faubus who pledged to stand in schoolhouse doors from Little Rock to Selma to prevent us all from living as one America, undivided by race. 
   In one incredible moment, Rosa Parks set forth a wave of activism all across America and captured the essence of the better half of the American spirit--proud, courageous, defiant against injustice--and Americans followed her lead. 42,000 African Americans boycotted Montgomery's buses for 381 days until the bus segregation laws in Alabama were changed on December 21, 1956. 
   The changes that Rosa Parks made possible in America transcended the realm, even, of our public laws--they literally changed a way of life. Because Rosa Parks stood firm against injustice, she not only joined with Martin Luther King, Jr. in ending the era of Jim Crowe, she helped usher in an age in America when Thurgood Marshall could serve on the highest court of the land; an America where John Lewis and so many others who marched for freedom could serve in the United States Congress; and an America in which we could all, living, working, and hoping together, envision a future--still ahead--when a still-better, still-stronger America heals itself of all the scars of racism and bigotry. 
   Future generations of Americans need to know that this country considers Rosa Parks a hero. It should be known that we recognized Ms. Parks' contributions to our country--and that we hoped that for years to come--in our homes, our schools, in our cities and on our village greens--we wanted all Americans to learn and to remember what Rosa Parks struggled to make true for our nation. 
   As we all join together as a Senate united in our deep respect for Rosa Parks, let us remember also that we can do more for this leader than give her a gold medal--we can make her work our own--in the House, in the Senate, and in our lives every day. We can all summon--at the edge of the twenty-first century--the best of our own spirit to wipe away the hatred, the bigotry, and the intolerance that remains in America--and we can dedicate ourselves to building a better America in Rosa Parks' image. That effort, too, will be a part of Rosa Parks' legacy in the United States, and that monument will endure long after any medal has lost its shine. 
   Madam President, I urge the United States Senate to contemplate that challenge on this special day in the United States of America, as we honor Rosa Parks--but also as we ask ourselves how we can fulfill her promise and finally create Rosa Parks' America.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I think every American knows what today is--Tax Day, 1999. It's a day that I think no doubt leaves most Americans, certainly, tired from the all too hurried rush to file those forms--but I hope also reminded that as we pay our taxes we're really making choices about our priorities--investing in a strong national defense, making a difference in research and development, protecting Social Security and Medicare--and the truth is that while no one likes to pay taxes, this is why we do it--so we can invest in certain priorities that make our nation strong. 
   Well, Mr. President, today I want to join with my colleague GORDON SMITH to talk about one of those investments, about the commitment Americans want us to make to our public schools, and about the biggest tax cut we can ever deliver for our children and grandchildren--the tax cut you give to future generations when you insist--today--that you're going to have a committed and qualified teacher in every classroom, that you're going to make every public school work, and that you're going to put every child on the road to a life in which they can make the most of their own talents and capacities for success. 
   Let's be honest--as a society, there is no decision of greater importance to the long term health, stability, and competitiveness of this nation, than the way we decide to educate our children. 
   We look to public schools today to educate our children to lead in an information age where the term ``wired worker'' will soon be redundant because of an information revolution that has literally put more power in the computer chip of a digital watch than in every computer combined in the United States just fifty years ago; massive technological change and demands to improve our productivity, putting more Americans to work for longer hours and putting them in front of computer screens for hours more when they're not at work; a global economy where borders have vanished--and the wealth of nations will be determined by the wisdom of their workers--by their level of training, the depth of their knowledge, and their ability to compete with workers around the world. 
   Mr. President, two hundred years ago Thomas Jefferson told us that our public schools would be ``the pillars of the republic''--he was right then, he is right now--but today there is a caveat: those public schools must also be--more than ever--the pillars of our economy and the pillars of our communities. 
   And I would respectfully suggest to you that there has not been a more urgent time than the present to reevaluate--honestly--the way America's greatest democratic experiment is working--the experiment of our nation's public schools. 
   Those pillars of the republic have never before had to support so heavy a burden as they do today. In our world of telecommuting, the Internet, hundreds and soon thousands of television channels, sixty, seventy and eighty hour work weeks--there are fewer and fewer places where Americans come together in person to share in that common civic culture, fewer ways in which we unite as citizens--and caught up in that whirlwind are more students living in poverty, more students dealing with disabilities, more students with limited command of the English language. 
   More reasons, I believe, why this nation must have a great public school system. 
   And what can we say of the system before us today? I think we must say that--although there are thousands of public schools in this country doing a magnificent job of educating our children to a world class level--too many of our schools are struggling and too many kids are being left behind. 
   Mr. President, I believe we have a responsibility to be the true friends of public education--and the best friends are critical friends, and it is time that we seek the truth and offer our help to a system that is not doing enough for a large proportion of the 50 million children in our public schools today--children whose reading scores show that of 2.6 million graduating high school students, one-third are below basic reading level, one-third are at basic, only one-third are proficient and only 100,000 are at a world class reading level; children who edge out only South Africa and Cyprus on international tests in science and math, with 29 percent of all college freshmen requiring remedial classes in basic skills. 
   Mr. President, this year we have already passed the Ed-Flex Bill, a step forward in giving our schools the flexibility and the accountability they need to enact reform, making it a matter of law that we won't tie their hands with red tape when Governors and Mayors and local school districts are doing all they can to educate our kids, but also emphasizing that with added flexibility comes a responsibility to raise student achievement. 
   But Mr. President, EdFlex was just one step in a forward moving direction--balancing accountability and flexibility--to continue the process of real education reform--and that is why I am joining with my colleague from Oregon, GORDON SMITH, to introduce bipartisan legislation today--the Kerry-Smith Bill--with our colleagues the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts, my colleague TED KENNEDY and with MAX CLELAND, EVAN BAYH, JOHN EDWARDS, CARL LEVIN, PATTY MURRAY, RICHARD BRYAN, as well as JOHN CHAFEE, SUSAN COLLINS and OLYMPIA SNOWE from Maine--legislation which together we believe will make a difference in our schools, legislation which can bring together leaders from across the political spectrum around good ideas which unite us rather than dividing us. 
   Mr. President, for too long in this country the education debate has been stuck both nationally and locally--leaders unable or unwilling to answer the challenge, trapped in a debate that is little more than an echo of old and irrelevant positions with promising solutions stymied by ideology and interest groups--both on the right and on the left. 
   Nowhere more than in the venerable United States Senate, where we pride ourselves on our ability to work together across partisan lines, have we--  in so many debates--been stuck in a place where Democrats and Republicans seem to talk past each other. Democrats are perceived to be always ready to throw money at the problem but never for sufficient accountability or creativity; Republicans are perceived as always ready to give a voucher to go somewhere else but rarely supportive of investing sufficient resources to make the public schools work. 
   Well, I think it is in this Congress, this year, that we can finally disengage ourselves from the political combat, and acknowledge that with so much on the line, such high stakes in our schools, you can't just talk past each other and call it reform. 
   We all need to do our part to find a new answer, and Mr. President I would respectfully suggest that in the bipartisan support you see for this legislation, there is a different road we can meet on to make it happen. 
   Together we are introducing the kind of comprehensive education reform legislation that I believe will provide us a chance to come together not as Democrats and Republicans, but as the true friends of parents, children, teachers, and principals--to come together as citizens--and help our schools reclaim the promise of public education in this country. We need to ask one question: ``What provides our children with the best education?'' And whether the answer is conservative, liberal or simply practical, we need to commit ourselves to that course. 
   Our bill is built on the notion of giving grants for schools--with real accountability--to pursue comprehensive reform and adopt the proven best practices of any other school--Voluntary State Reform Incentive Grants so school districts that choose to finance and implement comprehensive reform based on proven high-performance models can bring forth change. We will target investments at school districts with high numbers of at-risk students and leverage local dollars through matching grants. This component of the legislation will give schools the chance to quickly and easily put in place the best of what works in any other school--private, parochial or public--with decentralized control, site-based management, parental engagement, and high levels of volunteerism--while at the same time meeting high standards of student achievement and public accountability. I believe public schools need to have the chance to make changes not tomorrow, not five years from now, not after another study--but now--today. 
   So if schools will embrace this new framework--every school adopting the best practices of high achieving schools, building accountability into the system--what then are the key ingredients of excellence that every school needs to succeed? 
   Well, Mr. President, I think we can start by guaranteeing that every one of our nation's 80,000 principals have the capacity to lead--the talents and the know-how to do the job; effective leadership skills; the vision to create an effective team--to recruit, hire, and transfer teachers and engage parents. Without those abilities, the title of principal and the freedom to lead means little. We are proposing an ``Excellent Principals Challenge Grant'' which would provide 
   funds to local school districts to train principals in sound management skills and effective classroom practices. This bill helps our schools make being a principal the great calling of our time. 
   But as we set our sights on recruiting a new generation of effective principals, we must acknowledge what today's best principals know: principals can only produce results as good as the teachers with whom they must work. To get the best results, we need the best teachers. And we must act immediately to guarantee that we get the best as the United States hires 2 million new teachers in the next ten years, 60% of them in the next five years. In the Kerry-Smith Bill we will empower our states and school districts to find new ways to hire and train outstanding teachers: through a focus on teacher quality and training--in Title V of this bill--we can use financial incentives to attract a larger group of qualified people into the teaching profession and we can provide real ongoing education and continued training for our nation's teachers. 
   This legislation will allow states to reconfigure their certification policies and their teaching standards to address the reality that our standards for teachers are not high enough--and at the same time, they are too rigid in setting out irrelevant requirements that don't make teaching better; they make it harder for some who choose to teach. We know we need to streamline teacher certification rules in this country to recruit the best college graduates to teach in the United States. Today we hire almost exclusively education majors to teach, and liberal arts graduates are only welcomed in our country's top private schools. Our legislation will allow states to rewrite the rules so principals have a far greater flexibility to hire liberal arts graduates as teachers, graduates who can meet high standards; while at the same time allowing hundreds of thousands more teachers to achieve a more broad based meaningful certification--the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards certification with its rigorous test of subject matter knowledge and teaching ability. 
   This legislation will build a new teacher recruitment system for our public schools--providing college scholarships for our highest achieving high school graduates if they agree to come back and teach in our public schools. 
   We will demand a great deal from our principals and our teachers--holding them accountable for student achievement--but Mr. President we also hope to build a new consensus in America that recognizes that you can't hold someone accountable if they don't have the tools to succeed. 
   Our bill helps to close the resource gap in public education: helping to eliminate the crime that turns too many hallways and classrooms into arenas of violence by giving school districts incentives to write discipline codes and create ``Second Chance'' schools with a range of alternatives for chronically disruptive and violent students--everything from short-term in-school crisis centers, to medium duration in-school suspension rooms, to high quality off-campus alternatives; helping every child come to school ready to learn by funding successful, local early childhood development efforts; and making schools the hubs of our communities once more by providing support for after school programs where students receive tutoring, mentoring, and values-based education--the kind of programs that are open to entire communities, making public schools truly public. 
   And our legislation will help us bring a new kind accountability to public education by injecting choice and competition into a public school system badly in need of both. We are not a country that believes in monopolies. We are a country that believes competition raises quality. And we ought to merge the best of those ideas by ending a system that restricts each child to an administrator's choice and not a parent's choice where possible. It is time we adopt a competitive system of public school choice with grants awarded to schools that meet parents' test of quality and assistance to schools that must catch up rapidly. That is why our bill creates an incentive for schools all across the nation to adopt public school choice to the extent logistically feasible. 
   Mr. President, we are not just asking Democrats and Republicans to meet in a compromise, a grand bargain to reform public education. We are offering legislation that helps us do it, that forces not just a debate, but a vote--yes or no, up or down, change or more of the same. Together we can embrace new rights and responsibilities on both sides of the ideological divide and admit that the answer to the crisis of public education is not found in one concept alone--in private school vouchers or bricks and mortar alone. We can find answers for our children by breaking with the instinct for the symbolic, and especially the notion that a speech here and there will make education better in this country. It can't and it won't. But our hard work together in the coming year--Democrats and Republicans together--can make a difference. Education reform can work in a bi-partisan way. There is no shortage of good ideas or leadership here in the Senate--the experience of GORDON SMITH who spent years in the Oregon legislature working to balance resources and accountability to raise the quality of public education; with  tireless leadership from former Governors like EVAN BAYH and JOHN CHAFEE; bi-partisan creativity from PATTY MURRAY and OLYMPIA SNOWE; and the leadership and passion, of course, of the senior Senator from my state, Senator KENNEDY, who has led the fight on education in this Senate, and who has provided this body with over 30 years of unrivaled leadership and support for education. 
   We look forward to working with all of our colleagues this year to pass this legislation, in this important year as we undergo the process of reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, to find common ground in ideas that we can all support--bold legislation that sends the message--finally--to parents and children struggling to find schools that work, and to teachers and principals struggling in schools simultaneously bloated with bureaucracy and starved for resources--to prove to them not just that we hear their cries for help, but that we will respond not with sound bites and salvos, but with real answers.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to introduce the Women's Business Centers Sustainability Act of 1999, and I do so on behalf of myself and Senators BOND, HARKIN, BINGAMAN, LEVIN, ENZI, DOMENICI, ABRAHAM, SARBANES, AKAKA, KENNEDY, EDWARDS, FEINSTEIN, LANDRIEU, BOXER, CLELAND, KOHL, WELLSTONE, BURNS, and LEAHY. 
   As the title suggests, this bill addresses the funding constraints that are making it increasingly difficult for our women's business centers to sustain the level of services that they currently provide and, in some instances, to literally keep the doors open. 
   Some colleagues may ask the question, What is the Women's Business Center Program? The Small Business Administration started the Women's Business Center Program which provides 5-year grants matched by non-Federal dollars to private sector organizations so that they can establish business training centers for women. Depending on the needs of the community being served, the centers teach women the basic principles of finance, management, and marketing, as well as specialized topics such as how to get a government contract or how to start a home-based business. 
   These business centers are located in rural, urban, and suburban areas, and they direct much of their training and counseling assistance towards socially  and economically disadvantaged women. 
   I might add, Mr. President, of all the changes in the social structure of the United States or in the marketplace in the last years, none has been more profound than the significant numbers of women entering the marketplace. As more and more women enter the marketplace and they assume roles as principal breadwinners or sole breadwinners within some families, it is more and more important that they have the capacity to participate fully in the economy and not be relegated simply to entry-level jobs. 
   Congress started this program in 1988 in response to hearings that revealed the Federal Government was not meeting the needs of women entrepreneurs and that there were very little other mechanisms for entry-level women entrepreneurs. Women faced particular discrimination in access to credit and capital, and they were shut out of many government contracts and had very little access to the kind of business assistance that they needed to compete in the marketplace. We have really come a long way since that first beginning. There are now 59 centers in 36 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. 
   In addition to increasing self-sufficiency among women, the women's business centers have strengthened women business ownership overall and encouraged local job creation. 
   The numbers really tell a remarkable story, Mr. President. In 1998, women-owned businesses made up more than one-third of the 23 million small businesses in the United States. They have accounted for some $3 trillion in annual revenues to the economy, and they employed one out of every four workers in the United States. 
   Still, according to the data from the 1998 Women's Economic Summit, women-owned businesses account for only 18 percent of all small business gross receipts, and they are dramatically underrepresented in the Nation's two most lucrative markets--corporate buying and government contracting. 
   This really underscores significantly the problem that I talked about a moment ago of entry-level jobs and of the nature of the small, entrepreneurial, home-grown, cottage-industry-type 
   businesses that women begin with, which often could be grown significantly into larger businesses but for the lack of credit, the lack of available marketing skills, and the lack of management skills. Clearly, the need for women's business centers continues, and this is no time for us to diminish or to dismantle the infrastructure that the federal government has invested in for the past decade. 
   Addressing the special needs of women-owned businesses serves not just the entrepreneurs, but it serves the overall strength of communities, as well as the economy of the whole of our country. Women's business centers help increase the growth, not just of women's businesses, but also of the large network of support businesses that are linked and affiliated with them, as well as, obviously, the general economy and the local community associated with those businesses. 
   There are many extraordinarily run centers around the country. Let me highlight two of them--one in New Mexico and one in Massachusetts. I know my colleagues, Senators BINGAMAN and DOMENICI, are particularly proud of the one in their home State. I am very proud of one in Massachusetts which has been a model women's business center. It is the Center of Women & Enterprise in Boston. Since 1995, that center has served more than 2,000 women from more than 100 cities and towns in eastern Massachusetts. Of the women it serves every year, 60 percent are low-income, 70 percent are single, and 32 percent are women of color. 
   Andrea Silbert is the tireless executive director of that center. She has effectively raised money, forged partnerships, and designed thorough training and mentoring programs to help women entrepreneurs. 
   When the Boston women's business center trains an entrepreneur, that entrepreneur then knows how to approach a lender for a loan, knows how to manage her business, and understands the ins and outs and hows and whys of marketing. 
   But notwithstanding the success of these several women's business centers, the fact is that a number of them around the country are facing increased difficulty in raising the required matching funds. 
   There are some people who think the centers should charge higher fees. And they might think so, until you examine the makeup of the people who are being reached by the centers. We were privileged to have a person by the name of Agnes Noonan, who has spent the last 8 years as the executive director of WESST Corporation, the women's business center in Albuquerque, NM, testify before us in the Small Business Committee. As she testified in March, during her first couple of years running the center, her view was that there was a very simple way to deal with the problem of raising money, and that was to do a better job of marketing the center's services to women who could afford to pay higher fees. That would increase the center's income, and it would reduce its reliance on public dollars. 
   But the problem is that the minute you do that, you start redirecting the energy and focus of the center away from the people who most benefit from it. And that is precisely what she told us as a practitioner. She said:  
   Though [such a] strategy may have made economic sense, it conflicted directly with our mission of serving low-income women. ..... If we were to target our services to women who could afford to pay market consulting and training rates, then we would clearly not be addressing the needs of low-income women in New Mexico.  
   She also gave us important information about the realities of fundraising:  
   Nationally, only six percent of foundation money is earmarked for women, and only a tiny portion of that goes to women's economic development.  
   So as she said to us, the executive directors of women's business centers are very experienced fundraisers. Lori Smith of the WBC in Oklahoma City said before the House Small Business Committee that she thought she could sell sand in the desert. She viewed herself as good a fundraiser and as good a salesperson as there is, but she also said that competition for foundation- and private-sector dollars has become so intense and those dollars so much scarcer with each year that Government funding has diminished. And they do not have anywhere to turn. 
   In addition to that, bank mergers are occurring, as we know, at an increased rate around the country. And those mergers are further exacerbating the situation because the banks have been a primary source of funds for many of these centers. 
   Take the example of the recently announced bank merger in Boston of Fleet Bank and BankBoston. Those banks separately have been very generous to the women's business center in Boston. Their combined contribution came to $150,000. But we have serious concerns that their full support continue, and not reduce as we have seen in other States, where the merged institutions rarely give the same amount of money as the two or three, or whatever number, that the prior institutions contributed. So we have seen a drying up of some of the funding sources, I might add, not just for the women's business centers but for a host of charitable institutions that rely on those contributions. 
   So for many of the centers, they now have the added specter of losing their annual base of money. We need to guarantee that we do not add to that ominous cloud by having the base that came from the SBA also disappear at the same time when they come to the end of the original 5-year grant cycle. That money is their basic bread and butter, it is their ability to stay alive, as well as the indispensable ingredient of leveraging for additional fundraising dollars. 
   I believe, and the colleagues who have joined me in introducing this legislation believe, that it is essential for us to find a fair way to let the women's business centers recompete for their base funding. That is competition; it is not entitlement. 
   So here is how the legislation we introduce gets us there. 
   First, it allows the women's business centers which have completed a funding term to compete for another 5 years of Federal funding, which, under current policy, would be up to $150,000 per year. The recompetition standards would be higher than those needed for centers applying for funds for their initial 5-year funding term. This recognizes that more experienced centers ought to be able to perform well from  the beginning of their second term funding; they have been through the learning curve. And I believe this additional Federal funding is necessary to counteract the adverse impact of bank and corporate mergers I mentioned previously. 
   Second, my bill will raise the authorization of appropriations for fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2001 for women's business center funding from $11 million to $12 million per year. It will also reserve 40 percent of those appropriations for recompetition grants. 
   I believe that increasing the authorization to $12 million is entirely consistent with the legislation which our committee passed last year, and it would ensure that there would be adequate funding to preserve effective, established centers and to help fund new centers in States that do not have one. 
   Mr. President, I thank those colleagues who have joined me in this effort. I hope additional colleagues will join in support of this legislation and we can rapidly pass it. It should not be contentious. We are not talking about vast sums of money, but we are talking about an extraordinary amount of leverage for a very small investment. 
   I think that in most States in this country my colleagues will agree with me that opening the doors of opportunity to full business ownership and participation, particularly to those who have been disadvantaged for various reasons, is of enormous importance to the longer term economic well-being of our country. And when I say ``well-being,'' I am not just talking about the bottom line in terms of the return on investment to those businesses, I am talking, obviously, about the enormous importance of strengthening families, strengthening communities, and eliminating the vestiges of discrimination that remain against women in terms of their full economic participation in the Nation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my esteemed colleagues, Senators MCCAIN, BURNS, WYDEN, LEAHY and ABRAHAM in introducing legislation that will encourage sales of US information technology products while at the same time protecting our national security interests. The Promote Reliable On-Line Transactions to Encourage Commerce and Trade (PROTECT) Act of 1999 is an important first step that recognizes that as the Internet becomes more of a presence in global commerce, there must be guarantees and assurances that business and personal information remains confidential. It also recognizes that the US companies are leaders in creating the technology that serves this vital purpose, and that these companies are integral to our growing economy. 
   United States information technology companies have been frustrated by what they perceive as too-stringent controls on the export of their encryption products. These controls have served a vital purpose in protecting national security interests. The realities of the marketplace and the technology sector, however, suggest that it time to loosen our grip somewhat on the export controls we impose. Although the US is the leader in producing high quality, strong encryption products, other countries also have the ability to produce comparable products. We must recognize this reality and understand that while export controls can slow the spread of encrypted products, they cannot stop it. Importantly, controls that do not recognize this reality put our software industry at a disadvantage as it tries to compete in the global market. 
   Nothing, of course, is more important than our national security. This legislation maintains strong guidelines to ensure that encryption technology is not sold to countries that pose a threat to our national security. It puts in place a number of reasonable checks to make certain that US encryption technology does not get into the wrong hands. At the same time, it takes into consideration that where encryption products are generally or publicly available, we should not unduly limit their sale to responsible entities in NATO, OECD or ASEAN countries. To do so would not only cause potential harm to US industry, but it could also have an unintended negative impact on our own security. 
   I applaud Senator MCCAIN for taking this first step towards resolving a complicated problem. As we work through this and other legislation that attempts to address the issue of encryption exports, I hope we can incorporate the best features into the strongest possible bill.

There is a unanimous consent order that has set up the order of amendments now. So the order is the Ashcroft amendment.  Subsequent to the Ashcroft amendment, there is an additional Daschle amendment, and then it is going back and forth. So we are on the Ashcroft amendment. If debate on that is finished, under the consent order, we would move to a separate order. This amendment, if it is separate, would not be in order at this time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am absolutely confident that we can work this out appropriately with the help of the distinguished manager. I make it clear that no call for regular order was made. We were in the middle of the process of debating the Ashcroft amendment which is under controlled time. In the course of that debate of controlled time, the Senator from Maine--and I have no objection to this--stood up to speak on a separate amendment without calling for regular order. 
   So that is not the pending business before the Senate. 
   Now, I am delighted to have the Senator from Maine and the Senator from Oregon be able to debate their amendment, but there is, in fact, an order setting up a line of amendments here. 
   I am happy to enter into a new unanimous consent agreement that adequately protects those people in line and the time of the Senator from Maine's, and then we can proceed. I would be willing to lift my objection to having the serial votes follow at that point in time. I do think we ought to follow the procedures of the Senate.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this is an amendment, really, of common sense and I think fiscal responsibility. It is a very simple amendment that I believe is a safeguard, an important safeguard, against our returning to an era of deficit spending. This amendment includes no new spending, no new programs, it does not touch the budget authority, it does not touch outlays as proposed in the budget resolution. Neither does it affect in any way whatsoever the Social Security trust funds. 
   Perhaps most important to many Members on the other side of the aisle, this amendment does not eliminate any of the tax relief that is provided in the budget resolution. Indeed, Congress can and Congress should consider sensible tax cuts which are targeted towards helping working families to meet their growing needs, whether it is health care or child care or buying a first home or any number of other things--saving to send a child to college--there are a number of tax cuts I think all of us can agree on. Those tax incentives will help Americans to plan and to save for retirement and to build the economy of the country. 
   My amendment simply directs that the tax cuts we authorize, that we pass today in the budget resolution, will not rely on deficit spending to fund them. That is it. It is a very simple proposition: We should not pass a tax cut that will rely on deficit spending in order to fund it. 
   In the Budget Committee's report accompanying this resolution, Chairman DOMENICI and his colleagues say the following, and I quote Chairman DOMENICI:  
   The whole premise of this resolution is to ensure that the onbudget deficit is eliminated and to prohibit consideration of legislation resulting in an on-budget deficit in the future. 
   So the chairman and his colleagues who have voted for this budget have brought it to the floor of the Senate with the statement that it is their purpose to prevent a future onbudget deficit by having any legislation that would create that deficit. I applaud the chairman and his colleagues for that effort to maintain the course of fiscal discipline which we began in 1993 with the Deficit Reduction Act, which has put us on this path. To keep on that path is both progrowth and fiscally responsible. I am offering my amendment to ensure this year's tax provisions cannot and will not result in deficit spending. 
   Under my amendment, if the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determines that the tax cut passed in this year's reconciliation bill would result in an onbudget deficit in the future, under the scoring periods we are currently applying for budget purposes, then all I would do is simply delay that tax cut for 1 year. We do not repeal it. We do not end it. We do not take it away. We simply delay it for the purposes of not being confronted with deficit spending in order to fund it. 
   The amendment itself would not affect the tax cuts once they become effective. 
   The budget we have before us sets aside the Social Security surplus for debt reduction, but, as every single one of my colleagues knows, the Social Security surplus is only one portion of the projected surplus over the next 10 years. The Congressional Budget Office projects an onbudget, obviously non-Social Security, surplus that will be more than $800 billion over the next 10 years. That is the projection. 
   If the Finance Committee reports out a tax bill later this year, those tax provisions will become law, and they become law not just for this year but they become law for the next year and the next year and the outyears. They will take effect regardless of what happens to the current projections on the economy. But most of them will not be effective until the year 2005. 
   All of us in this institution understand that our predictive capacities are not so honed that we are going to guarantee we have the revenues in the year 2005 in order to pay for the new tax breaks while still doing the other things the budget requires. So the last thing I think any of us would want to do is set up an equation where we put into law today $800 billion worth of projected surplus, therefore tax cuts, but, lo and behold, the surplus is not there but the tax cuts are still in law. The question then will be, How do we fund them? 
   It seems to me there ought to be precautions taken against this kind of fiscal irresponsibility. If the projected onbudget surplus suddenly disappears during the intervening years, we want to avoid the crisis that will occur when those tax provisions are in law. If we were to create an automatic push onto the next year, we would wind up in a situation where we have not promised a tax cut that cannot be delivered, we have not promised a tax cut that is going to force us into deficit spending or into other choices that are similarly unpalatable. 
   That is the simplicity of this budget amendment. Under this amendment, we can guarantee if the surplus actually materializes, tax cuts passed this year will not be affected, they will go into effect. But if the current economic projections change for the worse and the surplus turns out to be considerably smaller or nonexistent, we will delay the effect of 
   the tax cuts and avoid the crisis of that moment. I think it is common sense. It is a sound way to budget. It is an appropriate way to make a determination instead of promising a tax cut that can either never materialize or that takes you into a position of fiscal irresponsibility. 
   I reserve the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself 1 minute and then I will yield to the distinguished ranking member. 
   Mr. President, let me say to my colleague who really understands budget well and understands fiscal matters well, this is not about Social Security. Indeed, the lockbox will protect Social Security. I am not here in this amendment worried about Social Security. I am talking about the onbudget surplus predicted today. That onbudget surplus could disappear. Indeed, the budget resolution claims to save $133 billion of the onbudget surplus over 10 years, but only $14 billion is saved in the first 5 years. 
   They are going to write in some $600 billion of tax cuts in the outyears without any capacity to predict that this country will have a surplus or have the capacity to support that. 
   What happens when that is in the law, the chairman sits down in 5 years, if he is still chairman, and he says, oh, we have these big tax cuts we have to fund, but we don't have the money for it? Where will it come from? That is when we are going to have a battle over every other program, or the tax cuts are phony. 
   I am not taking the tax cut away. I am simply saying, if CBO tells us in that year there is no money to fund it, you delay it a year. That seems to be the most fundamental common sense of how most Americans would decide to handle their budgets. If you cannot afford it, you don't do it. That is what we are trying to ask for, fiscal responsibility, not a flimflam show. 
   Mr. President, I yield 3 1/2 minutes to the Senator from New Jersey.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me just say quickly to my colleague from New Mexico, he has been a real deficit hawk, and I admire the way in which he has fought it over the years he has been here. But he knows as well as I do that we have actually changed significantly our attitude and our approach towards entitlements. We have changed  significantly the entire budget structure from those years when he tried to do that with Senator Nunn. 
   The fact is, we now operate under very strict caps. I think for the last 10 or 12 years of the 15 I have been here, we have been cutting in most places, except a couple of areas where, in order to hold Social Security whole, we made some changes in the revenue stream. 
   The fact is, we have made significant reductions. All I am asking for here is--in 1993, we had the biggest turnaround of all. I remember my colleagues arguing that you had to have a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution of the United States. If you didn't do that, you couldn't change the economy of this country or our budgeting practice. Well, the fact is, we proved them wrong. In 1993, we changed the entire budgeting process and turned it around so that we now have the balanced budget and the surplus that we are talking about. 
   The American people would like us to apply the same discipline now going forward that we applied to get to this position. The fact is that Americans do not want us to create a deficit to give them a tax cut. Ask any American: Do you want me to add to the debt of the country so I can give you back some money today? They would say: That is absurd. Why would you add to the debt of the country in order to put a few dollars into my pocket? 
   Americans overwhelmingly want the surplus applied to debt reduction. That is what they say. All I am doing in this amendment is asking my colleagues to exercise the same responsibility about tax cuts that they have asked everybody to exercise about every other part of the budget. 
   This is about deficit spending to support a tax cut. The vast majority of Americans would say, don't be so crazy, don't promise me some great big tax cut that actually adds to the debt of the country and maybe even deprives my mother or father of Medicare payments and maybe even deprives my kid of a loan to go to college or a number of other things. 
   There is no way in that balance that that is the choice Americans would make. I ask my colleagues today to join in making a responsible vote on the issue of this budget. We should not fund a tax cut we can't afford down the road. Nothing in my amendment would deny us the ability to have a tax cut if the surplus is there. If you have a surplus, you will have a tax cut. That is about as decent and fiscally responsible an equation as you could ask for. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we spent a lot of effort in the last years trying to assert discipline on the budget process. This amendment is an opportunity to continue that discipline and to vote against deficit spending. As my colleagues know, I think the vast majority of the Senate is in favor of a tax cut. But this tax cut is loaded in a way that of $780 billion, $630 billion is not until the last years. In fact, it will not even take effect until about 2005. 
   What we say is we do not take away the tax cut. We simply say if CBO says that will result in deficit spending, we delay for the 1 year until we know we are in surplus rather than having to deficit spend in order to fund a tax cut. 
   The vast majority of the American people want to get out of debt. They do not want a tax cut if it means deficit spending to provide it. The danger is that the economic statistics, or realities, could turn downwards, but the law will require a tax cut we cannot afford. 
   So, this is a way of saying there is an automatic delay. We do not take it away. It affects nothing on Social Security and guarantees no deficit spending.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, tonight the Senate will vote on H.R. 440, the Microloan Program Technical Corrections Act of 1999. I urge my colleagues to support this Act which, including my amendment, makes important changes to the Small Business Administration's (SBA) Microloan program. It revises the loan loss reserve requirement for microlenders and makes changes that will more equitably distribute the microloan dollars available to each state. Ultimately, these changes will allow microlenders and intermediaries to make more loans and offer more technical assistance to our nation's small businesses. 
   Most of my colleagues know that microloans and technical assistance are effective and powerful economic development tools because they voted to make the SBA's microloan program a permanent part of the Agency's lending programs in 1997. 
   Let's look at the record since the SBA's microloan pilot program was launched in 1991. It has provided more than 7,900 microloans, worth some $80.3 million. For every microloan, 1.7 jobs are created. And, if a borrower was a welfare recipient, it is common for them to hire other welfare recipients. As the program was intended to do, a great percentage of microloans have gone to traditionally underserved groups, including 45 percent to women-owned businesses, 39 percent to minority-owned businesses and 11 percent to veteran-owned businesses. Voting for these measures will be a vote to make a good program better. 
   Specifically, this legislation revises the loan loss reserve requirement (a cash reserve to guarantee that the government is paid back if a loan defaults) for microlenders by setting a 15-percent ceiling and a 10-percent floor. After a microloan intermediary has participated in the SBA Microloan program for five years and demonstrated its ability to maintain a healthy loan fund, it can request that SBA review and, when appropriate, reduce its loan loss reserve from 15 percent to a percentage based on its average loan loss rate for the five-year period. The proposed change would continue to protect the government's interest in microloans as well as enhance the program by freeing up cash which microlenders could reprogram for more microloans or technical assistance to small business owners. 
   With my amendment, this legislation establishes a floor for the distribution of microloan funds available to the states, including the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa. Depending on the amount of appropriations, the SBA must provide the lesser of either $800,000 or the even division of the funds among the 55 states. For any monies that exceed $44 million ($800,000 x 55 states), the Administration has the discretion to decide how to distribute the microloan funds. The Administration also has the discretion to distribute any additional money that is left over at the beginning of the third quarter of a fiscal year. 
   Mr. President, in Massachusetts and across the country, microloans and technical assistance are working; assisting individuals with the tools to successfully start and manage their own business. I thank my colleagues for their past support of small business and urge them to vote for H.R. 440 as amended.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, after one year of working to enact a program that emphasizes prevention over reaction in dealing with natural disasters, the bill Senator CLELAND and I first introduced in the 105th Congress has made its way back to the Senate for our consideration and support. I ask my colleagues to vote for S. 388, the Disaster Mitigation Coordination Act of 1999. Your vote will help our nation's small businesses save money and prepare for natural disasters. 
   This bill establishes a 5-year pilot program that would make low-interest, long-term loans available to small business owners financing preventive measures to protect their businesses against, and lessen the extent of, future disaster damage. This pilot is designed to help those small businesses that can't get credit elsewhere and that are located in disaster-prone areas. 
   The small business pre-disaster mitigation loan pilot program would be run as part of the Small Business Administration's regular disaster loan program, testing the pros and cons of preparedness versus reaction. Currently, SBA's disaster loans are available for mitigation after a recent natural disaster. Those loans are also limiting because only 20 percent of an SBA disaster loan may be used to install new mitigation techniques that will prevent future damage. In contrast, this legislation would allow 100 percent of an SBA disaster loan to be used for mitigation purposes within any area that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has designated as disaster-prone. In Massachusetts, that includes Marshfield and Quincy, two coastal communities that are prone to flooding, rainstorms and Nor'easters. 
   I see a great need for this type of assistance in the small business community. Aside from avoiding inconveniences and disruptions, we know that there are cost-benefits to making meaningful improvements and changes to facilities before a disaster. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has a disaster mitigation program for communities, rather than businesses, we save two dollars of disaster relief money for each dollar spent on disaster mitigation. 
   Nationwide, whether you're a business in Florida or Massachusetts, this pilot would allow you to take out a loan to make the improvements to your building or office to protect against disasters. To lessen damage from hurricanes, it can mean constructing retaining and sea walls. To lessen damage from fires, it can mean adding sprinklers and flame-retardant building materials. And to lessen damage from floods, it can mean grading and contouring land or relocating the business. 
   The administration supports this pilot program and included it in President Clinton's budget request two years in a row--fiscal years 1999 and 2000. As the bill authorizes, the President requests that up to $15 million of the total $358 million proposed for disaster loans be used for disaster mitigation loans. 
   Senator CLELAND and I introduced this same legislation in the last Congress. And although it passed committee and the full Senate without opposition, the House did not vote on its merits before the 105th Congress ended. I thank our friends in the House and my colleagues in the Senate for sharing our concern to meet the needs of our small business owners while also working to find solutions that are smarter, more pro-active and more cost-effective. Mr. President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation and am hopeful it will pass the Senate today and that the President will soon sign it in to law.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take a few minutes today to share with my colleagues my support of this amendment--offered by my friend from South Dakota, Senator JOHNSON--an amendment which would increase funding for veterans health care services by $2 billion for Fiscal Year 2000. I believe that this funding level is necessary for the VA to provide the high quality of care it promises our nation's veterans. It is absolutely critical that we reverse the downward trend in VA health care funding and address the abhorrent deficiencies that exist currently in our VA health care system. We, as a nation, must keep our commitments to ensure that our nation's veterans receive consistent, high-quality, and reliable health care services. 
   I am convinced we cannot fulfill these commitments under the current level of funding provided both in the Administration's budget request and in the Chairman's mark which came out of the Budget Committee. I have expressed my concern in a number of letters to the Administration, both before and after their budget numbers came over to Congress--as I know many of my colleagues in both the House and Senate have done--about the Administration's decision to maintain a flat-lined budget for VA health care for the fourth consecutive year. 
   I also recently met with VA Under Secretary of Health Kenneth Kizer to make him aware of the severe effects that this level of funding has had already in Massachusetts. I told him that many of our VA hospitals and clinics are under serious budget strain and cannot provide sufficient care to the many veterans who need--and rightly deserve--to receive it. I expressed my concern that VA Hospital Directors have contacted me to say that, if they have to incorporate the same cuts in the coming fiscal year as they did this year, they will be forced to close wards, eliminate programs, and reduce staff. In fact, this already is happening. 
   In the Brockton, Massachusetts VA hospital, service providers have made it clear to me and my staff that they aren't able at times to provide adequate care for their patients. They are being forced to move psychiatric patients out into the community long before they are ready. The hospitals are unable to sufficiently help homeless veterans struggling with substance abuse problems. All of these troubles in taking care of our veterans are the result of one problem--today there is not enough money to care for those veterans who so badly need our help. 
   Our Northampton VA hospital--which has a nationally renowned reputation for its care of combat-wounded veterans--is facing the same challenges as the hospital in Brockton. They have a Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Unit there in Northampton--the only one of its kind in the entire Northeast. Veterans come hundreds of miles to find help in either putting their lives back together or keeping them from falling apart. The unit is always filled to capacity and requires a full-time, experienced staff that can address the needs of veterans who go there. But because we aren't doing right by our veterans, that unit is in jeopardy. Three years ago, this unit had a dedicated staff of twenty. Today, it has fourteen. There is only one overnight nurse to deal with 25 combat veterans. I don't believe this Senate can say that the quality of care in that unit has not been diminished. 
   These examples are part of a far broader crisis in veterans health care. Consider the VA nurses who haven't seen a substantial vacation for as long as they can remember and haven't received pay raises in five years, years when our economy has been growing in leaps and bounds. Put that crisis into a larger context: we have to ensure that adequate incentives exist for VA health care providers so that the VA can recruit and retain highly skilled staff. 
   As U.S. military personnel are going over to defend U.S. national interests in Kosovo, we must do all we can to let them know that their country is united behind them. We must do this for all the brave men and women who served and who have served our nation. Veterans are the brave men and women who already have served our nation, who have been on the front lines fighting for the freedoms Americans care about so deeply. How can we ask today's soldiers to represent our values around the globe if we're not willing to provide adequate health care services for those who have already made the sacrifice? How can we give so little to those who have already given so much to their country? 
   These are questions that I don't believe any of us want to ask. They are not ones that our country should be asking--Americans everywhere deserve a different and better debate than this one. 
   Mr. President, when the VA Under Secretary of Health asserts in a memo that the VA's flat-lined health care budget ``poses very serious financial challenges which can only be met if decisive and timely actions are taken,'' I believe that there is one critical action we must take. We must provide a significant increase over the Administration's request for VA health care. We ought to begin listening to our veterans and listening to those who care for them. We ought to provide the level of investment the national veterans service organizations have endorsed in  their Independent Budget for FY 2000--$3 billion over the Administration's request--the level of investment I believe is so badly needed just to fund the programs we already have while ensuring that future programs can address the needs of an aging veterans population.  
   Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on H.R. 774, the Women's Business Center Amendments Act of 1999. This bill will make small but important changes to the Women's Business Center program. First, similar to the bill that Senator CLELAND and I introduced last Congress, it will raise the authorization for the centers from $8 million to $11 million. Secondly, the bill changes the matching requirements for centers; instead of raising two non-Federal dollars for every Federal dollar in the third, fourth and fifth years, centers will only be required to raise one non-Federal dollar for every one Federal dollar. I  support this bill, thought I would prefer that the authorization and funding were increased to $12 million to make it consistent with the legislation our Committee passed last year. This program has been very successful in helping women start and grow businesses and it deserves generous funding. 
   Women-owned businesses are increasing in number, range, diversity and earning power. They constitute more than one-third of the 20 million small businesses in the United States, and account for some $3 trillion in annual revenues to the economy. Addressing the special needs of women-owned businesses serves not only entrepreneurs, but also the economic strength of this nation as a whole. 
   This bill further ensures that new and potential women business owners, who otherwise might be excluded from the economic mainstream of society, are afforded every opportunity to succeed through the Small Business Administration's Women's Business Centers program. 
   Centers are faced with the challenging task of teaching business basics and providing practical support and realistic encouragement. Massachusetts has an excellent example of a Women's Business Center--the Center for Women & Enterprise (CWE) in Boston. Andrea Silbert is a tireless executive director who effectively raises money, forges partnerships and designs thorough training and mentoring programs to help women entrepreneurs. When CWE trains an entrepreneur, she leans how to approach a lender for a loan, learns how to manage her business, and gains an understanding of the hows and whys of marketing. Nationwide, women should have access to this type of quality, comprehensive training. 
   It is clear that the centers are having a positive social and economic impact on the lives of many women and the communities which they serve. New clients continue to be racially and ethnically diverse: Some 40 percent are members of minority groups. About half are married, and half are single, widowed, divorced, or separated. 
   While this bill addresses some important issues, I am concerned about the unresolved problem of sustainability. How can established, effective centers that are at the end of the five-year Federal funding cycle continue to provide the same quality of services without the Federal contribution? It's their bread and butter, and it's indispensable leverage that helps centers raise the obligatory matching funding. 
   Agnes Noonan, executive director of the Women's Economic Self-Sufficiency Team (WESST corp.) in New Mexico recently reinforced this point when she testified before the Senate Committee on Small Business. With an 89 percent growth in the number of women-owned businesses over the last decade and a 161 percent increase in revenues, it is sound economic policy for the Federal government to support programs which facilitate the training and development of women business owners. It follows that we would be wise to safeguard the investment that has been made to date in the infrastructure of women's business centers around the country. 
   I believe we should find a fair way to let these centers recompete for the base funding. And we should do it this calendar year, before it's too late and the centers have lost their Federal funding and are out of business. I will be introducing a bill to allow Women's Business Centers to recompete for Federal funding in mid-April, when we return from the Easter recess. I hope that my colleagues with strong Women's Business Centers in their states will join me in sponsoring recompetition legislation. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their continuing efforts to expand policies that allow women entrepreneurs to grow and thrive.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to speak for a few minutes today about a very special young man who has been working in my office as an intern over the last months and someone who has shared endless enthusiasm with me personally and with my staff, and who has taught a great many of us in my office in the extended Kerry political family a very important lesson about the ability of individuals to overcome learning disabilities and about the power of the human spirit. 
   Brendan O'Donnell has a terrific story to tell. He comes from a wonderful and loving family that has always encouraged him to set his goals high, to pursue his aspirations to the very best of his ability, and to refuse to allow any label or characterization of his potential to stop him. He is a young man who literally does not give up. Brendan's character, his determination, his terrific attitude and positive energy that drive his efforts are really something to behold, Mr. President. 
   They are, in so many ways, the lasting imprint of his father, my friend and the friend of many of us on this side of the aisle, the late Kirk O'Donnell, and of his mother, Kathy Holland O'Donnell. 
   Kirk O'Donnell, many people may recall, was taken from us far too young, last year. I think all of us would agree that he left a lasting legacy, an imprint on all of our lives. Brendan, of course, will also tell you that one of the people who encourages him and  gives him such a huge amount of confidence is his sister, Holly O'Donnell. 
   We have been very lucky to have Brendan on our team these past months, and I look forward to continuing for a long time to get to know this young man even better. 
   Brendan has written a speech for me about a subject that he believes is very important, and I agree with him it is. He thinks it is important that here in the Senate, and all across the country, in our homes, in our schools, that we start talking about the efforts we can make together, in partnership with one another, to help those with learning disabilities make the most of their own lives. 
   Brendan's remarkable achievements are testimony enough to what individuals with learning disabilities can achieve. His words on this subject, though, are really something special. I would like to share with you what Brendan wrote. He said:  
   This is an important topic for kids today, kids like me. We should try to talk about learning disabilities and really get the point across--we can all be teachers about this subject. And we should all try to make a difference. 
   I think that there should be a different name for learning disabilities. My Mom and I have thought a lot about this, and to me it's not a disability--it's just that I have something which causes a storm in my mind. When I look at something--I have to take my time and take it all in. People need to be understanding and make things clear to me. To do that, though, people need to know more about learning disabilities, whether they're kids or adults. 
   People need to know that they should not look down at us. They should try extra hard to be nice to us and not make fun of us. We are the same as everyone else--and if someone takes the time to teach us, to work with us to help us understand, we can do whatever we want. 
   Right now I don't think we do enough to help kids with learning disabilities. You don't see enough people with learning disabilities in the best jobs--even though they are bright enough, even though they are talented enough. This needs to change. 
   It can happen, I think, if we have really good schools. I went to a high school called RiverView School. When you had a problem, when you needed special attention, they were willing to help. 
   Our school did not believe in the kind of tests you put on paper--they thought it was best for us to push and test ourselves, That's what I do every day. I test myself. 
   That's why I love to play sports. At our school anyone could play a sport. We had a cross country team, and a basketball team and swimming team and tennis team. And I learned a lot about swimming and trying my best when I played basketball and football. 
   And now I want to push myself again. I want to go to cooking school, and learn to be a chef so that some day I can have a restaurant of my own in Massachusetts, in Scituate. It'll be hard to do--but I'll do it. 
   I think there needs to be a program where kids with learning disabilities can learn how to do jobs in the real world, like cooking programs and art programs--progams so more kids can be like me. We can all try our best--and we can all do our best--if we help each other and if we care about each other. That's something I think we also need to take about in this country.  
   Those are Brendan's words, but I think he speaks for a lot of Americans, Americans who don't let anyone put limits on their potential, Americans who have dreams and do not give up. I agree with Brendan--each of us, in our own personal way, should do all we can to help those Americans who get up every day and do their best to overcome learning disabilities. And I thank Brendan for making that case better than any scientific study ever could. 
   I have been lucky to know Brendan O'Donnell, to be inspired by his strong will, his good nature, and his work ethic. I am proud of the work he has done in my office. I want to offer him my warmest wishes as he leaves us to pursue his ambitions. I am looking forward to the day when I can go to a restaurant in Scituate and know that Brendan O'Donnell is at once the owner and the chef, cooking up lobster and oyster for everyone. And I know that day will come because Brendan O'Donnell never gives up. 
   I yield the floor.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I believe that the way we have arrived here is less than ideal. However, the choices we have are also not ideal. The choice of doing nothing is absolutely unacceptable. 
   While I will have more to say about the process by which we got here, there are powerful strategic, humanitarian, and historical reasons that the United States, in a broad-based, NATO-based effort, ought to be doing what it is engaged in. 
   I think it is important for all of our colleagues to reflect on the fact, this is not the United States acting unilaterally; this is all of the allies, all together, all of them coming together, with a preponderance ultimately of European involvement if there ever is a peace process to enforce. 
   I want to emphasize one thing with respect to the goals and objectives. I view these as very limited in their current structure. I view it as essentially an effort to try to minimize Milosevic's capacity militarily to ethnically cleanse. It is hoped that you might also secure the peace. It is hoped that you might also be able to move to a more broad-based enforcement process. But I don't view that as the essential objective. The essential objective is to minimize his capacity to work his will without any contravening forces that would equalize the battlefield, if you will, and minimize the capacity for ethnic cleansing. That is the overpowering strategic and, I think also, humanitarian interest here, 
   and I think it is important for the Senate to stay focused on the limitations.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this bill calls upon the United States to take a momentous step--the deployment of a National Missile Defense system--on the basis of one, and only one criterion: technological feasibility. This bill gives no consideration to the ramifications of deploying such a system on U.S. security, political and diplomatic interests. 
   It is true that missile technology is proliferating more rapidly than we  could have predicted. And this is of grave concern to us all. Certainly, the proliferation of ballistic missile technology constitutes a serious threat to U.S. national security. The question before us is, Will deciding today to deploy a National Missile Defense system--as yet untested, unproven and un-paid for--advance our national security interests? The answer, in my view, is that it will not. 
   First, I believe this bill will undermine long-term U.S. national security interests, by placing too much emphasis on just one of the many threats we face today. 
   While the United States is enjoying a period of relative safety and security in world affairs, we must prepare to face a multitude of diverse challenges in the international security environment in coming years. These include: transnational threats, such as terrorism and drug trafficking; the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and the chaos of failed states, as we have seen in Somalia and the former Yugoslavia--just to name a few. The threat from ballistic missiles is one of many. 
   Ballistic missiles are a threat, because they are capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction to American soil. The United States has faced this threat for decades, posed by the nuclear arsenals of the Soviet Union and China. Russia and China maintain their ability to strike American soil. But even though both nations are today struggling through a period of great uncertainty, the threat to the United States of a ballistic missile attack from either nation is low. 
   The threat of a missile attack from a rogue state, such as North Korea or Iran, is obviously growing. Last fall, North Korea tested its new Taepo-Dong One missile, with a range of up to 3000 km. We also know the North Koreans are developing a Taepo-Dong Two missile, which could have a range two to three times greater. Pakistan has tested a 1500 km range missile. Iran is expected to have one of similar range in the near future. 
   But ballistic missiles are only one means of delivering weapons of mass destruction. Nuclear weapons can be delivered in trucks, ships, and suitcases; chemical and biological weapons can be delivered through the mail, dispersed in a crowded subway, or inserted into our water supply. These methods of delivery are far simpler, less costly, and far less detectable than ballistic missiles, and they pose a much more immediate threat to U.S. security. A National Missile Defense won't protect us from these threats. 
   The proposed NMD system would only allow us to defend ourselves against an unsophisticated long-range missile threat with a single warhead. We would not be able to defend against a missile that carried decoys along with the warhead. Multiple objects would readily defeat the proposed system. We would have no defense against a warhead containing chemical or biological agents divided into many small ``bomblets'' for better dispersion. This would simply overwhelm the NMD system. The NMD system would be ineffective against cruise missiles or missiles launched from air or sea platforms. 
   An NMD system also has very limited use as a deterrent to the threats we currently face. In the case of a ballistic missile attack, the perpetrator is readily identified, and U.S. retaliation could be swift and devastating. That alone is a serious deterrent, a much greater deterrent than a deployed NMD system. Deploying an NMD system would simply encourage potential adversaries to develop appropriate countermeasures or to pursue other, more effective means of attack. It is exactly this logic--that an NMD system would be more destabilizing than deterrent--that underpins our commitment to the ABM Treaty. 
   Which brings me to my second point. I oppose this bill because it will undermine decades of U.S. leadership in international efforts to reduce the nuclear danger. 
   A unilateral decision by the United States to proceed with a National Missile Defense would sound the death knell for the ABM Treaty, a development that is apparently quite welcome to many of my colleagues across the aisle. This is puzzling to me, because a U.S. signal that we intend to circumvent, violate or withdraw from the ABM Treaty would almost certainly kill prospects for Russian ratification of START II. This would delay any further reductions in the large remaining Russian nuclear force, a goal we have worked for decades to achieve. 
   I would remind my colleagues that, in 1991, the United States--under the leadership of President George Bush--reached agreement with Russia that it would legally succeed to all international treaties of the former Soviet Union. These include the UN Charter, the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, SALT/START, and others, as well as the ABM Treaty. If we refuse to recognize the validity of the ABM Treaty, we not only undermine the credibility of our past commitments to international arms control agreements--such as the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty--we also weaken U.S. leadership in future international efforts to stem the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. 
   If we proceed with this legislation and deal a blow to international arms control efforts, we will have succeeded in fostering precisely the threats we intend to reduce. And furthermore, we can encourage this threat without ever deploying an NMD system, simply by establishing our intention to deploy an NMD system. 
   Finally, I have deep concerns about the technical feasibility, operational effectiveness and costs of the proposed NMD system. 
   I have consistently supported development of effective missile defense technology, and continue to do so. In particular, I have supported the development and deployment of effective theater missile defense systems, to protect our forces and our regional allies. But we have encountered tremendous technological challenges in trying to build defenses against these theater missile systems. We have spent billions of dollars and experienced many failures in our efforts to ``hit a bullet with a bullet.'' The THAAD system has experienced five successive failures. Yet, THAAD is much simpler to develop than NMD. 
   On cost, the Administration's FY 2000 budget request calls for an additional $6.6 billion in new funding for National Missile Defense. This would bring total FY 1999 - 2005 funding for NMD to $10.5 billion. But the Defense Department does not anticipate that we will be able to test key components of the proposed system until 2003. If we encounter problems with this system that are the least bit similar to those we have seen in testing THAAD, we can expect delays well beyond the projected deployment date of 2005--and costs far above the $10.5 billion we are currently contemplating. And, while I have every confidence that American technological know-how will eventually produce a feasible system, I wonder: At what cost, and with how much real benefit to our national security, will this technological marvel be achieved? 
   In addition to the financial costs of deploying a feasible NMD system, we must also acknowledge the opportunity costs that pursuing this project will entail. America's leadership in world affairs relies on ready military forces. And the fact is, if we dedicate tens of billions of dollars to developing a National Missile Defense system, we will not be able to devote the resources and energy we should to ensuring the long-term readiness of America's fighting forces. At a time when the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff have publicly and repeatedly expressed their concerns over our ability to attract and keep bright young men and women in the U.S. armed forces, I am not convinced that we should move NMD to the top of our list of defense priorities. 
   With so much at stake, it would be irresponsible for us today to commit to the deployment of a National Missile Defense system, without further consideration of the implications and potential consequences of that commitment. We must not devote these resources to defending against the wrong threat with the wrong system. We must not create a world where weapons of mass destruction proliferate because arms control agreements are no longer credible. And we must not become so focused on this one defense issue that we leave our nation defenseless against other, more imminent threats. 
   Mr. President, this legislation poses tremendous risks to our long-term national security interests.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, let me begin my question to him by saying I, with many others here, am cognizant of the threat that has now been more realistically defined and is more present. I think most people feel a safety measure with the capacity that might save Hawaii or some other sector of the United States from some accidental, rogue, or unauthorized launch, makes sense in theory. And I certainly support that. But many people have expressed concerns. I know the Senator from Virginia has long been a member of the Arms Control Observer Group, long been involved in these issues, and has a great sensitivity to the perceptions of other countries which often drive arms races and the building of weapons. 
   I assume, based on that experience, the Senator from Virginia will acknowledge that if the United States proceeded in some way that altered the perception of another country--be it Russia or China or someone with whom we are currently trying to cooperate--that could, indeed, have an impact on the weapons they might build or, ultimately, on the security of the United States itself. 
   Is that a fair statement of how perceptions operate in arms races?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could further continue the colloquy--and I thank the Senator for his answer--I concur with his judgment about Mr. Primakov. I have had the pleasure of having a discourse or two with him. He is a very thoughtful and articulate person who understands the nature of this. But that is not to say that other politicians, other wings of other various ideologies, do not try to use these kinds of issues to play politics within their countries. Nor is to it say that conceivably--and I am only talking about the possibilities here, because it is important for us to put any deployment issue or any future procurement issue in the context of these realities --China could also make certain determinations with respect to this. Is that not also a fair judgment?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, again, I appreciate the answer and I appreciate the sensitivity the Senator has shown, as to how we might have gotten here otherwise. I cannot disagree with him with respect to that. But, by the same token, there has been a push here to try to achieve certainty with respect to technology, technological feasibility governing an issue of deployment. There are a lot of questions about what kind of system we might or might not really be building. 
   The early concepts that surrounded this entire debate envisioned a system that did more than simply address the question of a rogue missile or an accidental launch or even a few individual missiles. The best estimate of the threat from North Korea, in 15 or 20 years, is still dealing with minimalist numbers. Always, when we are debating in the context of Russia or in the context of China, we are dealing with multiple numbers, and the system you need to deal, with any reality, with those kinds of potential adversaries--I underscore ``potential''; we view neither of them that way today, as the Senator has said--but the kind of system that would be needed to deal with that is a system that most people make the judgment is technologically so expensive and so complicated--because it requires the SWIR intercept capacity at boost phase, it requires the capacity to go exoatmospheric for a certain phase, you have to hand off for the next phase for LWIR capacity for tracking, the capacity to distinguish between multiple decoys--all of this gets into such a zone of expense and of arms deterrence imbalance that a whole series of other questions have to be put on the table. 
   So what we are talking about, in terms of a system, is really a critical, critical component of what we might be willing to deploy and what might ultimately work and what we might even be able to afford realistically. 
   Mr. President, let me say also, if you developed a system that had all of the capacity I just defined--it could distinguish between decoys, it could actually hit at the level that gave you an assurance that you have the kind of protection you are trying to achieve--you have actually shifted the entire balance of power, 
   because you have created a near first strike capacity, if not a perfect first strike capacity. If you can shoot down anything that comes at you, then clearly you have changed the balance of power. So we are not making ourselves more secure necessarily. Plus, everyone in the business knows that we are talking, in that case, about intercontinental ballistic; they will simply go cruise missile, go underneath or any other alternatives. The notion that we are making ourselves, in the long run, somehow very significantly safer by building this larger system, I think, is a debate we put aside some time ago. 
   I come to the floor supportive of the notion that we are in a new world today. I appreciate what the Senator said about thinking about Madeleine Albright's language of how you perhaps change, together with other countries, to meet that new world. But that new world, to me, is quite delimited. It is a new world that seeks to protect us against a rogue, against accidental or unauthorized. That is a very limited kind of system. It is one that we ought to be able to negotiate, if we can develop it with China, with Russia, with other people, all of whom have a similar kind of threat to think about with respect to unauthorized or accidental or rogue launches. 
   I simply want to make it part of the record of this debate that that is my understanding of the direction we ought to be going in--and I hope and think it is the understanding of the Senator from Virginia--that we do not rush headlong into the building of a system that simply creates greater unrest, greater instability, greater question marks and, I might add, is measured against a $60 billion expenditure that to date, even in the THAAD program, has not shown success. There isn't anybody who won't tell you that when you are switching from THAAD into the intercontinental ballistic, you are moving into levels of complexity so much higher in terms of intercept and distinguishing capacity. 
   It is my judgment that while we ought to proceed, I hope the Senate is going to contemplate this in the context of really building stability in our relationships and also in trying, as diligently as we can, to negotiate with these other countries the process by which we will move forward.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. 
   I think, again, that the clarification here is important because, obviously, we come to this through the experience of a very large expenditure and a very different kind of concept than was contemplated. I think it is vital, as we proceed forward, that technological feasibility not be the only judgment which we will use as we proceed forward. I think the amendment which has thus far been accepted, the notion that the Senate now embraces the continued efforts to have negotiated reductions with Russia and that we do not want to upset that, is a very important statement that puts into context the down sides if we don't proceed with the sensitivity which most of us feel is so important here. 
   I thank the President, and I yield the floor.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Aviation Safety Protection Act of 1999 with Senator GRASSLEY to increase overall safety of the airline industry by establishing whistleblower protection for aviation workers. I am honored to work on this important issue with Senator GRASSLEY, who has long been a leader on whistleblower legislation. 
   The Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) properly protects both private and federal government employees who report health and safety violations from reprisal by their employers. However, because of a loophole, aviation employees are not covered by these protections. Flight attendants and other airline employees are in the best position to recognize breaches in safety regulations and can be the critical link in ensuring safer air travel. Currently, those employees who work for unscrupulous airlines face the possibility of harassment, negative disciplinary action, and even termination if they report violations. 
   Aviation employees perform an important public service when they choose to report safety concerns. No employee should be put in the position of having to choose between his or her job and reporting violations that threaten the safety of passengers and crew. For that reason, we need a strong whistleblower law to protect aviation employees from retaliation by their employers when reporting incidents to federal authorities. Americans who travel on commercial airlines deserve the safeguards that exist when flight attendants and other airline employees can step forward to help federal authorities enforce safety laws. 
   This bill would provide the necessary protections for aviation employees who provide safety violation information to federal authorities or testify about or assist in disclosure of safety violations. This legislation provides a Department of Labor complaint procedure for employees who experience employer reprisal for reporting such violations, and assures that there are strong enforcement and judicial review provisions for fair implementation of the protections. 
   I want to acknowledge the leadership of Representative SHERWOOD BOEHLERT, Republican from New York, and Representative JAMES CLYBURN, Democrat from South Carolina, who have introduced the companion bill in the House. I also want to thank the Administration for their support of this legislation. 
   This bill will provide important protections to aviation workers and the general public. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join Senator GRASSLEY and me in supporting it.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the distinguished Senator. 
   Mr. President, I thank my colleagues, Senators DASCHLE, HAGEL and EDWARDS, for placing this resolution before us today; and I would like to speak just for a few moments about both the event and the person that it commemorates. 
   This is an important anniversary in the life of one of our colleagues and one of our great friends, my personal friend, the senior Senator from the State of Nebraska. I first came to know BOB KERREY during the very time that we commemorate today. He and I were in the Navy together. We were in Vietnam together. 
   In fact, though we did not know each other, we knew of each other because it is inevitable that two young lieutenants with the same name, somewhat in the same vicinity, will hear of each other. And irony of ironies, I actually was on a couple of missions in the very area, Nha Trang Bay, just about 2 months or so prior to the event which led to BOB winning the Medal of Honor. 
   BOB and I also knew of each other afterwards when he came back and he was in the hospital and I had shortly thereafter returned. Our mail crossed, and we have had about 30 years of our mail crossing. On one occasion I think my newsletter from Massachusetts went to Nebraska, and people didn't know what that was all about. And on other occasions we have joked about the fact that he probably received a couple of real ``Dear John'' letters while he was in the hospital and quickly discerned they were not meant for him but for me. And I often had these images of what he might have been reading of my mail. But at any rate, that began sort of a strange odyssey for both of us long before our paths crossed in the U.S. Senate. 
   I still get letters about the wheat prices in Omaha and he still gets letters about the cod fishing in Massachusetts, and we somehow manage to work these things out. But, Mr. President, it is no light matter to suggest that I have always had an enormous special respect for BOB KERREY. I am honored, as I think all of my colleagues are, to serve with him here in the U.S. Senate. 
   It was 30 years ago this past Sunday that a 25-year-old lieutenant junior grade BOB KERREY was, as we know, severely injured in Vietnam, sustaining those critical injuries that cost him his right leg. And over the years we have heard others describe, with great eloquence and great poignancy, the fighting on that island in Nha Trang Bay and the courageous way in which BOB fought on after a grenade had exploded at his feet, that he kept fighting even though he was nearly unconscious at the time, kept on the radio directing his men, leading--leading--in the way that we have come to know and expect BOB KERREY to lead, leading those SEALs under his command to suppress the enemy's fire and to try to safely get out of a bad situation. 
   I think, though, that what we really celebrate here today--and I think for those of us who have served in Vietnam, it is not so much the fighting there as the things that people faced when they returned. In that regard, I think BOB KERREY has also traveled a very special journey. And it is a journey that teaches us a great deal, as it taught him a great deal. It is a journey of personal recovery and of personal discovery. 
   In many ways, he struggled to put things back into perspective. It is not easy to lose people; it is certainly not easy to lose a piece of yourself, and come back to a country that has deep questions itself about why it was that it put you through that kind of turmoil. And BOB managed to sort all of that out, finding a special sense of humor, a kind of impish reverence, I think we might call it at times, that he shares with all of us to help keep a perspective in our lives. 
   He also forged a new patriotism out of that experience. Clearly, he went as a patriot because he chose to go. But he came back and struggled even with the definition of ``patriotism'' and of his concern and love for his country. He had to ``refind'' that, if you will, in those difficult times. 
   I think it is fair to say that he has come back more tested, more capable, and more understanding of what it means to care about the country and to give something to the country and to ask other people to join you in doing that. So he has the ability here to ask all of us in the Senate or our fellow citizens in the country to join with us in acts of giving in ways that others cannot. 
   I also say that it is not just for that that we celebrate his presence here, but he has been a steady friend and ally in the effort of a number of us here in the U.S. Senate to keep faith with the lingering questions over those who may have been left behind in the course of the war, and also to try to really make peace with Vietnam itself, 
   and to help bring the Senate to a point where we were able to lead the country in normalizing relations and, indeed, putting the war behind us. 
   It is a great pleasure for me to say how proud I am to serve with BOB KERREY, not just because of the qualities that were celebrated in the Nation's highest award for valor, not just for the qualities that people talk about for his military service, but, more importantly, for his humanity and for his sense of purpose, for his idealism and for his understanding of the real priorities in life. I am delighted to be here today to share in this special celebration of who our colleague is and what he brings us.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I want to take just a few moments today to salute one of the young leaders of the Indo-American community, someone who is providing for all of us an exemplary model of what it means to serve our neighborhoods, our communities, and our fellow Americans. 
   Mr. Sunll ``Sunny'' Aghi is the founder and President of the Indo-American Political Foundation, an organization based in California, dedicated to engaging Indo-Americans in the political process and ensuring that Indo-Americans gain a foothold in our government as elected officials. Sunll Aghi has brought an impressive energy to this mission--actively recruiting Indo-Americans to meet the challenges of participatory democracy as voters, supporters, and candidates, whether the be new citizens or established leaders in California's diverse communities. 
   Sunll has also found substantial ways to contribute to life in California beyond politics. Mr. Aghi is the founder of Thank You America--an organization dedicated to providing food and clothing to the homeless of Orange County each year on Thanksgiving Day, an effort which has benefits over 500 needy individuals each holiday. Sunll hopes to expand Thank You America's operations to eventually include providing college scholarships for talented, young Californians struggling to afford a college education. These efforts demonstrate to all of us the truth that DeTocqueville spoke of 150 years age when he said ``America is great because Americans are good.'' Sunll Aghi is keeping that tradition of civic responsibility alive and well for a new generation of our citizens. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to have the chance to acknowledge Mr. Aghi for his contributions to our country and to the democratic process. I applaud his efforts and share his hopes that someday soon we will bring all Indo-Americans into the mainstream of American politics as full participants, and that in the coming years we will build an America where Indo-Americans serve in and are fully represented in the House, the Senate, and the Administration. His work is an inspiration to all of us, and I hope more Americans will follow his tremendous example of activism and citizenship raised to a higher level.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I would like to pause for a few moments to acknowledge that those of us in Massachusetts are mourning the loss of one of our state's finest citizens, a graduate and loyal alumnus of Assumption College, a friend of the Massachusetts congressional delegation, and someone I had the privilege over the years to know as a good friend. 
   Mr. President, Bob Morrow's death was a shock to those of us who knew him--this wonderful man taken from his family and friends at the age of forty-five--and to those of us who looked forward to the contributions he would make in the years still ahead of us. 
   Although it seems a gesture wholly insufficient to honor the life of a friend lost too soon--to come to terms with the fact that a friend who was never comfortable behind a desk, who could never sit still, has come to a final rest--we can at least take the time today to remember the kind of person--and the type of friend--Bob Morrow was to those whose lives he touched. 
   We can certainly remember Bob's extraordinary capacity as an advocate for two of Massachusetts' pioneering high technology firms, The Riley Corporation in Worcester and Stone and Webster in Boston. Bob Morrow was a man who lived his life in a way that proved not only that you can be involved in government and brush against the legislative process without losing your soul, but that politics can be a way for the needs of our citizens to be communicated to those who represent them in Washington, D.C. In this age of seemingly endless cynicism, Bob Morrow truly enjoyed the work of advocating on behalf of the companies he represented--and they were well served by both the depth of his knowledge and the levels of his idealism. 
   Many of us forget that although Bob was a terrific representative of these companies in Washington--expertly guiding their federal relations--this was just one component of a job that he truly loved. Bob was also responsible for human resources management, training, public relations, and range of other services for an eight thousand employee firm. Although it is incredible to believe that a single person managed not just to juggle, but to excel, in all these enterprises, we all knew that Bob was one of those rare people capable of packing his days with wall to wall activity, because no task proved too difficult for a man who genuinely loved working with people. 
   Bob drew on these enormous personal talents again and again--in his work in Worcester and Boston, but also in his willingness to bring together citizens from across Massachusetts to share in a political cause or to help one of his friends. I will always be grateful for Bob's efforts to help me in 1996 in my tough battle for the Senate against Bill Weld. Whether the task was large or small, organizing an event for a handful of supporters, or pulling together a dinner with the President of the United States at my home in Boston, Bob was always eager to serve--and he had a tremendous capacity to enlist others in the fights in which he was engaged. 
   The real measure, though, of Bob Morrow, was in his devotion to family. Few conversations with Bob did not come back to Linda and the boys. He was incredibly proud of his family. He was a wonderful son to his mother Mary, a terrific brother to his sisters. I know that, as much as we will all miss him, his wife Linda and his sons Bobby, Sean, and Tim will miss him infinitely more. I hope they know in this time of grief and sadness, we extend to them our most sincere condolences and support. 
   It is impossible to capture in words alone the essence of Bob Morrow. From a humble background, through hard work and an absolutely genuine optimism and enthusiasm, Bob made himself an important contributor to our state, a wonderful and loyal friend, an exemplary husband and father, and the kind of outstanding citizen that is the foundation and strength of this nation. Bob Morrow was loved by so many--and he will be missed by us all.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we are currently gridlocked over the most important issue in the country today. I don't think anybody in this Chamber would question that what the U.S. Senate and the Congress chooses to do with respect to education is going to have more to do with determining the long-term transformation that can take place socially and politically in the long run in this country. 
   We hear countless references within almost every political speech today to the impact of globalization, the impact of technology, the changes that have taken place in the marketplace and, indeed, the extraordinary numbers of challenges that people face in the workplace today. It is almost axiomatic to say that if you are going to earn a decent living in the United States, or anywhere in the world today, you have to be able to manage information; you have to be able to develop your thinking skills. 
   We live in an information age. Most of the good service jobs and even good light manufacturing jobs, technology-oriented jobs, and certainly the kinds of jobs to which most people aspire at the upper levels of income are absolutely dependent on the maximization of that skill level. 
   The truth is, however, that in the United States of America today about two-thirds of our high school graduates are handed a diploma although they can read only at a basic reading level. A basic reading level, according to our testing standards, is not a proficient reading level; it is just that--it is basic. 
   One-third of the graduates of our high schools are at below basic reading level. It is extraordinary that 30 percent of all the students in our country who go to college begin college taking remedial courses to fix what they didn't do properly in high school--remedial writing, remedial math, remedial reading. And colleges are literally required to expend--some might argue, waste--a considerable portion of the collegiate experience bringing people up to the level that they should have been when a principal handed them a diploma--or the chairman of the school board, or whatever dignitary is there--handed them a diploma, and said, ``Congratulations. You are ready to go out into the world and earn conceivably a low-level income, or perhaps even minimum wage.'' 
   I don't think most of my colleagues would argue with the notion that the public school system of this country is in distress. That is why we have such a tension on the floor and in our politics between vouchers and some of the priorities of those who approach reform differently. Most of the debate last year on the floor of the U.S. Senate was focused on either the voucher solution--which is in the end not a solution at all to the problem of fixing public schools--or it focused on construction money and technology money but barely enough on the issue of accountability: How do we guarantee that reforms are put into the schools that are really going to make a difference in how students learn and in how we will know that they are in fact learning? 
   So Republicans and Democrats talked past each other, each intent on their own sort of ideological goals, with the end result that the Congress did precious little to fix the schools, and another grade, if you will--the kids who went from the 11th to 12th, the kids who graduated from high school, the kids who went from middle school to high school, or elementary school to middle school--all were sort of pushed on in the same state of inadequacy that has characterized the school systems for too long. 
   I know my colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle want good schools. I have also become convinced that one of the things which most restrains them from joining in some of the Democrat initiatives is the conviction they have that without accountability, without adequate change in the fundamental structure, without adequate capacity to really push the envelope of reform, they would be spending good money that would be chasing bad. I have to say in all candor I don't disagree with that--that in many school systems, if all we do is throw money at the problem, we are not going to be achieving what we want. 
   There is, however, something that has been happening in the United States for the last 10 years or more which we ought to take note of and respect. That is that the Governors of the States have been engaged in major reform efforts on their own. I think we in Congress ought to take more note of the legitimacy of the connection of the Governors and local governments to the same people who vote for us. They  are held accountable in the same way. The races for Governor across this country are, more often than not now, fought out over the issues of whether or not the incumbent or, in an open race, which candidate is going to provide the best educational opportunities to the kids of that particular State. Indeed, they are accountable in the same way that we are accountable for what we do. 
   I believe we in the U.S. Congress ought to be perhaps a little more sensitive to and respectful of that process of political accountability and perhaps be a little bit more willing to try to 
   trust the Governors to embrace a certain broad set of reforms that we could in fact target or articulate through the legislative process without becoming sort of management specific, without becoming so intrusive that we tend to have taken the discretion away from them, or in fact asserted ourselves in ways that begin to become ideologically divisive rather than constructive in how we are trying to find reform. 
   There are many areas where we could do this. I think Senator SMITH and I have been trying together to frame a bipartisan approach to how we might in fact unleash a remarkable level of creative energy within the school systems of our country. I thank Senator SMITH for his willingness to reach out across the aisle and to also try to be thoughtful about what we could do that would most impact the schools of this country. 
   Mr. President, there are a number of different experiments happening in different schools in America. Private schools have engaged in certain reforms. So, generally speaking, an awful lot of private schools have had an easier road to go down for a lot of reasons that are inherent in the nature of private schools. The nature of their student population, the ways in which they are able to manage, the sort of streamlined accountability that exists within a private school--there are a whole series of reasons. But there are things we can learn from private schools. There are things we can learn from parochial schools. 
   I often hear people say, ``Gee, go to any parochial school and look at the level of discipline you have,'' or, ``Go to a parochial school and you will find people teaching for less than you see them teaching in public schools, and they teach as effectively or perhaps more effectively in some cases.'' 
   The question is legitimately asked: How is it that in a parochial school you have this broad mix and diversity of student population sometimes found in the inner-city and you are able to do better than you are in a public school? 
   There are some reasons for that, incidentally. There is a certain kind of creaming that takes place, inadvertently perhaps sometimes, even consciously, or just by virtue of economics, by virtue of even the small fee that people are required to pay, or the simple fact that to get to a parochial school, you need a parent involved in your life who is both sensitive enough and caring enough to get you there, to take you there, to make the decision to pull you out of the other school. 
   For too many kids who are stuck in our school system, their parents, regrettably, are not that involved. They don't have those kinds of choices in front of them. They aren't aware of them. They do not know how to effect them. There are a whole lot of reasons you wind up with disparities between the schools. But the truth is that there are practices within a parochial school which could serve as a model for what we might try to adopt or try to implement in public schools. 
   There are obviously charter schools. Charter schools are the reaction to what is happening in the public school system. Charter schools have grown because people are increasingly despairing of whether or not they will be able to achieve the changes they want in their public school. So charter schools come along, and all of a sudden people say, ``Oh, boy, we can escape from the albatross of bureaucracy. We can get out from under the sort of school board politics. We can finally put our kids in a classroom that doesn't have 28 or 33 kids. We are going to get the magic 12 to 18 or something.'' 
   So people say, ``I am going to go for this opportunity,'' and so all of a sudden the charter school increases in popularity. It is a reaction to the failure of the public school system. 
   But here is the most important thing of all. All across this country, in community after community after community, there are great public schools. There are public schools that work brilliantly. They are not failing; they are on the rise. And what they say to us is that if we pay enough attention to this and work hard enough at trying to fix the things that are broken, you can make a public school great. 
   No one in this country should doubt that. Because most of the generation that went ahead of us, and the generation before that--generations that are being extolled in book after book now: Tom Brokaw's ``The Greatest Generation'' or other books that are out--all of those generations, the vast majority of them, came out of public schools, public schools that faced a different set of problems than the public schools of today, and those public schools were able to respond. 
   The bottom line is, and I will repeat this again and again and again, there are not enough private schools, there will never be enough charter schools fast enough, and there are not enough vouchers to save an entire generation of young people when 90 percent of the kids in America go to school in public schools. So the real challenge to the U.S. Senate is not to get locked up in a debate about vouchers and not to get locked up in a debate about some targeted narrow area of reform. The real challenge to the U.S. Senate is, can we come together around a broad set of reforms that will empower the States and local communities to be able to embrace the best practices of any of the schools that work, a public school that can look to any other school and draw on those practices and put them into place? And the bottom line truth is we are not going to do that without a major increase in resources. 
   I was delighted to see that the Senator from New Mexico, Senator DOMENICI, recently embraced the notion that we should put somewhere in the vicinity of $40 billion into education over the next 5 years, and put it back in the States, liberating the States to be able to embrace real reform. I believe that is a minimum figure, but it is a figure that Senator SMITH and I and others have talked about over the last year or so. That is the raw, essential ingredient necessary to guarantee the kind of broad-based massive reform effort that will help to guarantee the kind of education structure that we want. 
   No one should doubt if you want a tax cut in America in the long run, invest in children today. If you want to stop the extraordinary increases in spending in the criminal justice system or for chronic unemployment or for drug abuse or for other problems that come out of our juvenile justice system, or a host of other areas, the best thing we could do is guarantee that kids are not running around the streets in the afternoon or going home to empty homes and apartments after school and getting into trouble, or not doing their homework. I don't know what happened to the fundamental notion of raising children: children need structure, and structure in the earliest stages can be provided in schools or in community centers when parents are working until late hours of the evening and are less available to take care of their kids than they were in the past. 
   Within that context of reform, there are a number of things that could be done. They range from attracting stronger teachers by loan repayment programs or by incentives to draw the higher tiers of SAT scores into teaching for a period of time. There are a number of ways in which we could provide incentives to college graduates who come out of school with $50,000-plus of loans and who need desperately to earn a decent base income to raise a family and to get ahead. We could help supplement that capacity of school districts, particularly in low-tax-base areas where they do not have the ability to do this on their own; we could help them get the best teachers, which is what we want. We could also help school districts deal with the problem of technology. We could 
   also help provide the capacity for ongoing professional education or mentoring. We could help schools keep their doors open into the evenings. We could help turn schools into real centers of community learning for parent and child--alike, into the evening hours. 
   But one of the most important things we could do--Senator SMITH and I were  going to offer an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill on this--one of the most important things we could do is help deal with the problem of principals. In every blue-ribbon school that I have ever gone into, I have found that the first ingredient that hits you about why that school earned the blue-ribbon award, or why it is a singularly strong school within the public school system, is you will find a principal with extraordinary capacity. I could cite schools in Massachusetts--the Saltonstall School up in the North Shore, or the Jacob Hiatt School in Worcester, or the Timilty Middle School in Roxbury. In all of the schools where I found great learning going on and great enthusiasm, I found, without exception, it was a direct result of an extraordinary principal who was helping to drive the energy of that school. 
   I think every one of us knows the great impact that a principal makes on a school--principals who are real leaders; principals who can build the vital relationships between teachers, parents, students and the community; principals who are trained and talented enough, when it comes to leadership and when it comes to management, to understand all the nuances of modern education and all the ways they can implement good practices within their school. Without a principal doing that, it is not going to happen. 
   Here is the reality. As we talk about providing more flexibility in public education, which is what Ed-Flex does, and as we talk about turning over more control on the local level, we are really talking about providing greater responsibility to the 65,000 or so principals in our public schools. 
   I would like to just point to this chart. This is how we approach the issue of training principals in America today. The fact is that less than half of the school districts in the United States have formal or on-the-job training or mentoring programs for new principals. That comes at a time when we have a greater need for new principals than we had, just as we have a need for new teachers. 
   In the next 10 years, we need to hire 2 million new teachers. Mr. President, 60 percent of those new teachers have to be hired in the next 5 years. If we don't have an effective principal who is managing a school effectively and searching for those best teachers, we are not going to fulfill this extraordinary opportunity with the hiring that we ought to have, and we are not going to wind up implementing the reforms in the way we ought. 
   Let me just quote the executive director of the National Association of Secondary School Principals. He said:  
   Schools are going without principals, retired principals are being called back to full-time work, and districts have to go to great lengths to recruit qualified candidates.  
   I believe that this is the unheralded crisis of our education system, the quality of our principals and their capacity to be able to lead and effect reform. It is remarkable that we currently provide so little assistance to the people we trust to do the most important job of education reform. I do not believe we can leave it to chance, that every single principal has received the training or the skills needed to be the kind of dynamic leader that education reform requires. 
   As the National Association of Secondary School Principals said in their letter supporting this amendment:  
   As the individuals most responsible for implementing vision, direction, and focus for their schools, these leaders must be fortified with the best sources of knowledge and skills required to effectively manage positive change.  
   If we want flexibility to have the kind of impact that I think everybody in the Senate wants, then we have to guarantee as best we can that we help the local communities be able to provide qualified principals in each school who can apply that freedom we are giving them to the work of raising student achievement. That is why GORDON SMITH and I want to introduce a title of our legislation, the Excellent Principals Challenge Act, as an amendment to the Ed-Flex bill, as a way of investing in the school leadership that we need. 
   The amendment that we contemplate would provide grants to the States to provide funds to our local school districts for ongoing education and training for our principals, to empower them to learn all the best management and business skills the private sector has to offer, and to gain a knowledge of the most effective teaching practices in the country. So even if the principals themselves have not been teachers, as many of them have not been within decades, they can work with the teachers on their staff to help kids learn and to really give our principals the knowledge they need about education technology so they can put to use the new modern instruments of teaching that are now coming to the classroom. 
   We also need them to be able to seek out and build the collaboratives and the partnerships with business and with the high-tech community to graduate students who are genuinely ready for the information age. 
   Our amendment would also commission a report on the best practices of the best principals in the country, create a sharing of best practices so that we really start documenting what works best, not in theory, but the reality of what happens in our classrooms, so that Governors and school board leaders and principals in the years to come can bring good ideas to scale in every principal's office in this country. 
   These are really some of the most important investments that we can make, if we are going to trust that the reforms we want so desperately are going to be implemented in our schools. There are many people of talent who we should encourage to become principals of schools; people who have left the public sector, people who have left the military at a young age, but who have great leadership skills and leadership development. There are many other examples across this country--CEOs who have retired at an early age because they have been very successful with their companies. They have great management skills, great leadership skills. We should be reaching out to these people all across this country to ask them to come in and be part of the job of helping to save our schools. 
   At an investment that we offer of simply $100 million a year, including a 25-percent matching grant required from States and local school districts, exempting our poor districts, we believe this investment will leverage the local energies so badly needed in order to invigorate new school leadership and make reform work across the country. 
   I come from an Ed-Flex State. Based on what we have learned in Massachusetts, it is clear that we should increase the flexibility we give to our schools. I have also been willing to recognize, and I have learned that it is not just the flexibility that brings us reform. In fact, if you give flexibility, but do not have strong leadership in place, or you do not have the kind of capacity to put best practices in place from other school systems in the country, then you will not have reform, and flexibility itself will be given a bad name. You cannot bring about these kinds of comprehensive efforts without terrific leadership, and that leadership should come from, must come from principals within each school. It is the first and most important commitment. 
   As the National Association of Secondary School Principals wrote in their letter of support, this amendment addresses the critical professional development needs of principals as they seek to improve learning for all students. 
   I hope when the time comes, whether it is on this bill or conceivably in the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, colleagues will join together in embracing not just the effort to provide a better avenue for stronger principals to come into the school system, but will embrace a set of reforms that will truly liberate our schools so that good thinking and common sense can take over from bureaucracy. I think we need a major overhaul of the current structure, but I think if the U.S. Congress were willing to hold out to our schools the most significant incentive grant proposal we have ever provided, we would see the most dramatic change at the fastest rate that we could ever contemplate. Whether it is the hiring of new, stronger teachers, whether it is the lowering of classroom size, whether it is providing the capacity for classrooms that do not currently exist, whether it is raising the capacity of our principals, or even implementing the standards we know we need to measure student performance or even  teacher performance, these things are the sine qua non of any kind of legitimate education reform. 
   It is time for the U.S. Senate to embrace real reform, not another set of Band-Aids, not a simple little trinket here and a simple little trinket there that satisfies one political party or another or one constituency or another. A broad-based reform ought to be something that we can all understand. 
   I hope we can cross the aisle and build the kind of coalition of bipartisanship that will make this the year of genuine education reform in the country. We have talked about it for too long. We have lost too many kids to the lack of our capacity to build that coalition. Now is the time to make it happen. 
   Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.

   Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. I thank my colleague, the chairman of the committee. I thank him for his work on this act and for his leadership within the committee so that we can proceed as he has described. 
   Most of the media attention with respect to the Y2K problem has been on big businesses, the challenges they face and the costs they are going to bear in order to fix the problem. But as my colleague has mentioned, small businesses face the same effects of Y2K as big businesses. However, they often have little or no resources available to devote to detecting the extent of the problem or to developing a workable and cost-effective solution. That is why we on the Small Business Committee are proceeding with this particular response which I think is most important. 
   It is in our economic best interest to make sure that all of our small businesses, some 20 million if we include the self-employed--are up and running soundly and effectively, creating jobs and providing services, on and after January 1 of the year 2000. 
   There are a lot of questions about what the full impact of the Y2K problem is going to be. Is it going to bring a whole series of nationwide glitches? Could it, in fact, induce a worldwide recession? 
   One hears differing opinions on the extent of that. I was recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and there was a considerable amount of focus there from sizable numbers of companies on this issue. I think it is fair to say that here in the United States we have had a greater response than has taken place in Europe or in many other countries. But it is interesting to note that the Social Security Administration, I understand, spent about 6 years and some 600 people, and spent upwards of $1 billion, in order to be ready and capable of dealing with the Y2K problem. Other Departments have spent significant amounts of money as well and have had very large teams of people working in order to guarantee that they are going to be safe. Compared to that, you have very large entities in Europe and elsewhere that are only just beginning. 
   So, if you look at the numbers of people and the amount of money and the amount of years people have been spending in order to try to put together solutions--obviously those experiences can be helpful to many other entities around the world as we cope with this problem. But the bottom line is, we know our economy is interdependent. We know that most of our technology, interdependent as it is, is date-dependent, and much of it is incapable of distinguishing between the years 2000 and 1900. 
   We have 10 short months now to become completely Y2K compliant, and national studies have found that the majority of small businesses in the United States are not ready and they are not even preparing. Specifically, the 1998 ``Survey of Small and Mid-Sized Business'' by Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group and National Small Business United found that only 62 percent of all small- and mid-sized businesses have even begun addressing Y2K issues. The good news is that a greater percentage of small- and mid-sized businesses are preparing for Y2K than last summer. The bad news is that they have only just begun that process and a significant group is taking a ``wait and see'' approach. 
   On a local level, Y2K consultants and commercial lenders in Massachusetts, from Bank Boston to the Bay State Savings Bank, tell us of reactions to the Y2K dilemma that vary from complete and total ignorance, or complete and total denial, to paralysis or simply to apathy. 
   I will give you an example. Bob Miller, the president of Cambridge Resource Group in Braintree, MA, shared with us what he has observed. Though his company specializes in the Y2K compliance of systems with embedded processors for Fortune 1000 companies and large State projects, he knows how real the technology problem is and how expensive a consultant can be. He has tried to help small companies through free seminars, but literally no one shows up. One time, in Maine, only 2 out of 400 companies responded. ``Small businesses just don't get it. Many think it is a big company problem, but it is not. It will bite them,'' says Mr. Miller. He advises companies to start now, and to build a contingency plan first, because it is so late in the game.  
   The owner of Coventry Spares, Ltd., a vintage motorcycle parts company, would not disagree with that. John Healy was one of those small business owners who thought it was somebody else's problem. It couldn't happen to him. Luckily for John Healy and his business, he got a scare and so he decided to test his computer system by creating a purchase order for motorcycle pistons with a receivable date of early January 2000. So what happened when he put the order into his system? He punched a key and he waited for his software to calculate how many days it would take to receive the order. He got back a series of question marks. 
   Then he turned to the company's software that publishes its ``Vintage Bikes'' magazine and he tested it with a 2000 date. His indispensable machine told him the date was not valid. 
   Mr. Healy's computer problems are, ironically, compounded by his own Yankee ingenuity. As his business evolved, he combined and customized a mishmash of computer systems. It saved money, it worked well, handling everything from the payroll to inventory management, but making these software programs of the various computers Y2K-compliant is all but impossible. As Mr. Healy said:  
   ``[These programs] handle 85 percent of the business that makes me money. If I didn't fix this by the year 2000, I couldn't do anything. I'd be a dead duck in the water.''  
   When all is said and done, Mr. Healy estimates he is going to pay more than $20,000 to become Y2K-compliant, and that includes the cost of new hardware, operating system and database software and conversion. 
   So, how do we reach those small business owners who have been slow to act, or who, to date, have no plans at all to act? How do we help them facilitate assessment and remediation of their businesses? We believe the way we do that is by making the solution affordable. 
   According to the same Andersen and NSBU study that I quoted a moment ago, 54 percent of all respondents said ``affording the cost [was the] most difficult challenge in dealing with information technology.'' 
   That sentiment was echoed by David Eddy, who is a Y2K consultant who owns Software Sales Group in Boston, and who testified before the Small Business Committee when we were putting this legislation together last June. Mr. Eddy recently wrote:  
   ``Basically, all of our customers are having trouble paying for Y2K......The cost varies from client to client, but no business has ``extra'' money around, so they are struggling.''  
   So, Mr. President, cost is a very legitimate, albeit risky, reason to delay addressing the Y2K problem--saving until you are a little ahead or waiting until the last possible moment to take on new debt to finance changes. Those are strategies that many companies are forced to adopt, but those are strategies that can still leave you behind the eight ball as of January 1, year 2000. 
   If you own your own facility, you have to ask yourself, Is the security system going to need an upgrade? What will the replacement cost be? Will simple things work? Will the sprinklers in your plant work? What happens if there is a fire? If you own a dry cleaning store and you hire a consultant to assess the equipment in your franchise, will remediation eat up all of your profit and set you back? 
   These are the basic questions of any small business person in this country. Some business owners literally cannot afford to hear the answers to those questions. It may come down to a choice between debt or dissolution, or rolling the dice, which is what a lot of small companies are deciding to do. They say to themselves: I can't really afford to do it, I am not sure what the implications are, I am small enough that I assume I can put the pieces together at the last moment--so they are going to roll the dice and see what happens. 
   There is another problem with waiting. Just as regulators have forced lenders to bring their systems into compliance, the lenders themselves are now requesting the same compliance of existing borrowers and loan applicants. In Massachusetts, for instance, the Danvers Savings Bank, one of the State's top SBA lenders, has stated publicly that it will not make loans to businesses unless they are in control of their Y2K problems. The bank fears that if a small company isn't prepared for Y2K problems, it could adversely affect its business, which could then, obviously, adversely affect the loan that the bank has made and the small business ability to repay the loan, which adversely affects the bottom line for the bank. 
   The Year 2000 Readiness Act gives eligible business owners a viable option. 
   And that is why we ask our colleagues to join in supporting this legislation today. 
   This legislation will make it easy for lenders, and timely for borrowers, and it is similar to the small business loan bill that I introduced last year in Congress. It expands the 7(a) loan program, one of the most popular and successful guaranteed lending programs of the Small Business Administration. 
   Currently, this program gives small businesses credit, including working capital, to grow their companies. If the Year 2000 Readiness Act is enacted, those loans can be used until the end of the year 2000 to address Y2K problems ranging from the upgrade or replacement of date-dependent equipment and software to relief from economic injury caused by Y2K disruptions, such as power outages or temporary gaps in deliveries of supplies and inventory. 
   The terms of 7(a) loans are very familiar to those, obviously, within the small business community, and they have taken advantage of them. The fact is, these loans are very easy to apply for and to process. They are structured to be approved or denied, in most cases, in less than 48 hours. So for those who fear paperwork or fear the old reputation of some Government agencies, we believe this is a place where they can find a quick answer and quick help to their problems. We expect the average Y2K loan to be less than $100,000. 
   In addition, Mr. President, to give lenders an incentive to make 7(a) loans to small businesses for Y2K problems, the act raises the Government guaranties of the existing program by 10 percent, from 80 percent to 90 percent for loans of $100,000 or less, and from 75 to 85 percent for loans of more than $100,000. Under special circumstances, the act also raises the dollar cap of loan guarantees from $750,000 to $1 million for Y2K loans. 
   Eligible lenders can use the SBA Express Pilot Program to process Y2K loans. Under this pilot, lenders can use their own paperwork and make same-day approval, so there can be a streamlined process without a whole lot of duplication for small businesses, which we know is one of the things that most drives small business people crazy. The tradeoff for the ease and loan approval autonomy is a greater share of the loan risk. Unlike the general 7(a) loans, SBA Express Pilot loans are guaranteed at 50 percent. 
   We know that many small-business owners also have shoestring budgets, and that they are going to be hard-pressed to pay for another monthly expense. With this in mind, we have designed the Small Business Year 2000 Readiness Act to encourage lenders to work with small businesses addressing Y2K-related problems by arranging for affordable financing terms. For example, when quality of credit comes into question, lenders are directed to resolve reasonable doubts about the applicant's ability to repay the debt in favor of the borrower. And, when warranted, borrowers can get a moratorium for up to 1 year on principal payments on Y2K 7(a) loans, beginning when the loans are originated. 
   Mr. President, one final comment. As important as this Y2K loan program is, in my judgment, it has to be available in addition to, not in lieu of, the existing 7(a) program. It is a vital capital source for small businesses. We provided 42,000 loans in 1998, and they totaled $9 billion. That is not an insignificant sum. What we do not want to have happen is to diminish the economic up side of that kind of lending. With defaults down--and they are--and recoveries up and the Government's true cost under the subsidy rate at 1.39 percent, we should not create burdens that would slow or reverse the positive trend that we have been able to create. 
   To protect the existing 7(a) program, we have to make certain that it is adequately funded for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. And because the Y2K loan program is going to be part of the 7(a) business lending program, funds that have already been appropriated for the 7(a) program can be used for the Y2K loan program.  
   Already this year, demand for that lending is running very high. Typically, the demand for 7(a) loans increases by as much as 
   10 percent in the spring and in the summer. So we are entering the high season of cyclical lending within the SBA itself. If that holds true for the current fiscal year, the program may use nearly all of its funds to meet the regular loan demand. There may be even greater demand for Y2K lending as people become more aware of the problem with increased publicity and discussion of it in a national dialogue. 
   Under these circumstances, we need to be diligent about monitoring the 7(a) loan program to make certain there is adequate funding. I appreciate that Chairman BOND, who also serves on the Appropriations Committee, shares this concern and has agreed to work with me to secure the necessary funds targeted specifically for the Y2K loan program, and I thank Chairman BOND for his commitment. 
   I also thank Senators BENNETT and DODD and the Small Business Administration for working with our committee on this important initiative. We have tackled some tough policy issues, and the give-and-take, I believe, has made this legislation more helpful for businesses that face the Y2K problems. 
   I am very hopeful that all of our colleagues will join with us in voting yes today and that our friends on the House side will act as quickly as possible to pass S. 314. It is, obviously, a good program that will have a profound impact on the year 2000 and on the long-term economic prospects of our Nation. 
   Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time. 
   Mr. BOND addressed the Chair.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend JOHN MCCAIN to introduce the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act, to ensure that our disabled and elderly citizens have the same opportunity to vote as the rest of us--in private and at a polling place. Despite the intention of a voter accessibility law passed in 1984, many individuals with physical challenges are literally left outside the polling place, unable to exercise their fundamental right to vote without embarrassing themselves or relying on others to cast their ballot for them. 
   As abysmally low as voter turnout is for the population as a whole, it is estimated that the rate of voter participation by persons with disabilities is even lower--as much as 15-20 percent according to some surveys. Among the reasons for this gap is that polling places are not accessible to people with physical disabilities. This is the case, despite the Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act (VAEHA) of 1984, which requires polling places to be physically accessible to both older voters and voters with disabilities. Unfortunately, the VAEHA does not define an ``accessible'' voting place, nor does it place responsibility for making a voting place accessible with any particular agency or official. 
   Since the 1984 act was passed, many polling places have improved their accessibility. Nevertheless, according to the Federal Election Commission, which tracks accessibility under the 1984 act, there were some 19,500 inaccessible polling places in 1992--the last time for which statistics are available. And, since the FEC report relied on self-reporting by voting precincts, the actual number of inaccessible polling places in likely to be even higher. 
   The result is that there are still too many instances where disabled voters must resort to what is known as ``curbside voting.'' According to a survey by the National Voter Independence Project, 47 percent of polling places are inaccessible because they don't have a wide enough path from the street, there are no signs directing disabled people where to go, or stairs or narrow doorways block wheelchair access. Disabled voters who go to inaccessible polling places are told to honk their car horn, or ask a passerby to get the attention of the polling official, who must then bring a ballot out to the disabled voter or carry him or her into the voting place. Rather than face this indignity, many disabled voters choose not to vote. 
   Why shouldn't they just vote by absentee ballot? Because voting is a community event in which those without disabilities can choose to participate. Disabled voters deserve the same voting rights as everyone else. If they vote by absentee ballot, they should do so because they choose to, not because they have to. 
   Visually impaired voters--many of whom are older Americans--also often face certain indignities when they attempt to exercise their fundamental right of a secret vote. If they cannot see the ballot, they are told to bring someone into the voting booth with them, to read the ballot for them and cast their vote. An extraordinary 81 percent of visually impaired individuals had to rely on others to mark their ballots for them, according to the National Voter Independence Project. The secret ballot is so basic to our democratic system that it is shocking that it is denied to so many. 
   The right to vote at a polling place and in private can be provided to the elderly and disabled for a very low price. State election agencies may incur some costs in bringing their polling places into compliance, however, these are expenses already required of the states by the 1984 law. More importantly in most cases, the costs are not likely to be high. The FEC noted that improvements seen in 1992 ``were in many cases achieved merely by relocating polling places to accessible buildings at no cost to the taxpayers.'' Where polling places are not accessible to individuals with physical disabilities, they can be moved to already accessible buildings, such as malls, public libraries and schools. In many instances, access would be improved by putting up signs directing persons with disabilities to accessible entrances. These and other simple solutions have been implemented by some precincts at only minimal cost. 
   Improving access for the visually impaired can also be a low-cost endeavor for states. Many visually impaired individuals would be able to vote independently if the ballots were simply in larger type. Providing a tape recording of the ballot for the visually impaired to listen to is another solution that has been implemented by a few precincts for very low cost. It is a small price to pay to guarantee our fundamental rights to all of our citizens. 
   Those who would benefit from this bill include the men and women who were injured serving our country in the armed forces. Other beneficiaries would be elderly citizens who may have voted regularly throughout their lives, and only their failing vision keeps them from voting now. Still others on whose behalf we offer this bill are victims of accidents, illnesses, or genetic disorders. Is there any one among those individuals who should be denied the right to participate in the voting process? Of course not. It is for them, Mr. President, that we offer this very important piece of legislation.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the overall goal of this bill is to address the critical recruitment and retention problems facing our military today. I strongly support that objective. We have heard that recruitment numbers are down; that the Navy is 20,000 sailors short of what it needs to meet our national interests at sea; that within the last three months the Army was 2,300 soldiers short of its recruitment goal; and that increasingly pilots are leaving the service to take more lucrative jobs with private airlines. These are serious problems requiring serious attention. 
   At a time when we are asking our Armed Forces to undertake more different kinds of missions, we need to provide incentives to men and women to serve and to be able to keep those who are currently serving. A 1998 Youth Attitude Tracking Study of 10,000 young men and women found that the desire to serve in our military remains strong. In fact, more than 25% of the men surveyed said they wanted to join one of the active duty services. The percentage of women who expressed interest actually increased by a percentage point from last year, reaching 13% for 1998. Therefore, if the initial desire is there, we should not allow it to be clouded by fears of low pay, frequent deployments and insufficient retirement benefits once they sign up. We must do everything we can to ensure that high quality men and women will continue to join the United States Armed Services maintaining a force that is second to none in the world. The U.S. military maintains its stature because of the people who serve in it. 
   We cannot afford to lose them or lower the standards of recruitment just to fill in the holes. 
   Unfortunately, the reality is that we are losing them and we are being forced to look at ways of lowering the bar so that each service can meet its recruitment goal for the coming years. A strong economy able to boast of high paying jobs in the private sector is causing extreme recruitment and retention problems for the Department of Defense. S. 4 attempts to reverse these problems by offering high pay raises, reforming the pay table, establishing a retirement savings plan and expanding Montgomery GI bill benefits for those who serve and will serve in the military. Specifically, it provides for a 4.8% pay raise for every member of the Armed Services. It changes the pay scale to recognize and reward meritorious service rather than the number of years served. It establishes a thrift savings plan similar to the one available to Federal civil employees and available to many in the private sector by way of 401-K plans. It also provides a monthly subsistence allowance for those service personnel eligible to receive food stamps and expands current Montgomery GI Bill benefits both in the amount of money provided and in the number of people who can use it, among many other things.  
   When I read through this bill, I find many things that I believe can improve the current system and I support the general thrust of this legislation. I believe that significant pay increases are necessary both to help those currently serving in the military and those who might serve in the future. The Administration did not ignore the call for pay increases coming from many personnel, as well as the Joint Chiefs. They are in the President's budget request. It is clear that military pay must be competitive with wages paid in the private sector. 
   It truly saddens me that about 12,000 of the brave men and women who have chosen to serve their country by defending the flag, to which we all pledge allegiance, are on food stamps. These people should not be forced to make a decision between serving their country and bringing home enough money to make ends meet. At a time when our economy is growing and higher paying jobs require the kind of skills that are taught in the military, it must be very difficult not to look at the greener pastures. 
   There is another part of this bill that I want to address because it is one of the reasons why I am going to vote in favor of it. I sincerely believe that the Montgomery GI Bill should be revamped and am pleased that this legislation takes a step in that direction. When this body passed the GI Bill in 1984, the average annual cost of tuition at a four-year university was about $5,200. That number has since doubled with costs reaching above $11,000 for the school year 1996 to 1997. However, we are still offering basically the same amount of financial assistance per month and requiring that those eligible to use it first pay $1200 before they can receive anything back. I wholeheartedly agree that we should do away with that requirement and increase the amount of monthly assistance provided. It is the right thing to do. I also support the provision in this bill that allows immediate family members also to benefit from the education allowances. I am pleased that my friend--and fellow veteran--MAX CLELAND introduced this portion of the bill and that it was incorporated into the final version we are debating today. 
   I don't believe there is a single one of us who would argue that we shouldn't do more for our Armed Services personnel. That is clear. There is no question that they need increases in their basic pay and an expansion of their education and retirement benefits. But it seems to me that we ought to be careful and at least examine--if not critically analyze--how best to go about addressing our recruitment and retention problems without trying to fast-tract a bill which has significant increases in funding, above and beyond what the Administration has requested, without adequately explaining how to pay for it. 
   I believe that we owe it to our military men and women to determine how we are going to pay for this bill and how funds used for this purpose will affect overall spending and military readiness. What are the sources for funding this bill? Is this coming out of other accounts within the Pentagon's budget? Is it coming out of domestic spending? Is it going to be off-budget? Can we really afford to pay for this across all the pay scales? Are we going to tap into our large budget surplus? It is not clear to me that these critical questions have been answered. 
   This bill requires funding for 10 years, not just this fiscal year. We don't have any ironclad promises that our economy will prove as strong tomorrow as it is today. I think we ought to be sure that the commitments we make now can be met in the future. 
   I remain concerned that we are moving this bill in the absence of hearings by the Armed Services Committee and an overall discussion about how our defense dollars should be spent. However, I will support this bill because as a veteran, I understand how important it is to know that your country is behind you and to know that your country recognizes and rewards the service you have given it.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President. February 23rd is an important day not just in Black History Month, but in the history of Massachusetts. Today is the birthday of one of the most significant leaders ever to call Massachusetts home, one of the brave leaders of the early civil rights movement whose words still stir us today. 
   131 years ago, W.E.B. DuBois was born in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. He studied at Harvard University in Cambridge, where he earned his doctorate and published his landmark book ``Souls of Black Folk,'' through the Harvard University press. 
   On college campuses around the country, in our high schools, in our cities, and on our village greens, we are still reading that pioneering text--and we remember the way it touched off a movement and challenged a nation to consider the issue of race in a more honest and personal light. 
   DuBois's prophetic words about the age in which he was living still ring true. ``The problem of the twentieth century,'' he wrote, ``is the problem of the color line.'' 
   DuBois was right. We look back this month and honor the struggles and the perseverance of so many courageous trailblazers in the civil rights movement, so many leaders whose sacrifices paved the way for a society more attune to the guarantees of equal opportunity under God and under the law--ideas as fundamental to the promise of America as the Declaration of Independence itself. 
   This month we remember Dr. King, Medgar Evers, James Meredith, Julian Bond, the late Rep. Barbara Jordan, and my distinguished colleague from Georgia, Rep. JOHN LEWIS. We honor their efforts to remove the barriers of race that kept America from knowing the full measure of its own greatness--and we look towards their legacy as a polestar to guide us towards the future. 
   There could be no more appropriate time to reflect on the future of the Civil Rights Movement and the future of our nation itself than today--in this historic month, in this, the last year of the twentieth century. 
   No one can deny that ``the problem of the color line'' was indeed the great problem of the twentieth century. But no one can deny that America made strides in putting that problem to rest, in healing our wounds--and in moving forward towards a brighter day in American history. African American family income, college admissions, and home ownership have hit an all-time high. African American poverty is down to near-record levels. African Americans have written some of the pivotal decisions of our Supreme Court, written the laws of our land in the Congress, and written their own inspiring stories into the fabric of our history. 
   But still more must be done before we can say the problem of the color line has been eradicated. 
   The question before us today is simple--to paraphrase the words of the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in his last book, ``where do we go from here?'' 
   The violence in Jasper, Texas; the conditions of too many of our nation's inner city schools; the subtler forms of discrimination still prevalent in so many of our top corporations; all these problems require our attention if we are to make good on the promise that never--never again--will an American century be defined by our struggles over race and our encounters with an intransigent crisis. 
   With open hearts and open minds--and with the commitment and determination of W.E.B. DuBois or Rosa Parks, who forty years ago sat down on a bus and said she `would not be moved'--we too can tell those who stand against equality that America will not be moved from an unshakable belief in the fundamental rights of every American--no matter their race, creed, or color--to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. 
   The challenge before us today is to summon the leadership in the twenty-first century--at the highest levels of government, and in our daily lives--to wipe away hatred, bigotry, and intolerance--and to make America in the image of the African Americans we honor this month: the land of the free, the proud, and the brave. I urge the United States Senate to contemplate that challenge on this special day, in this important month for the United States of America.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chief Justice, my colleagues, I want to thank the Chief Justice for his important stewardship of these proceedings. And I thank Senator LOTT and Senator DASCHLE for their patient leadership in helping to bridge the divide of partisan votes so that these are not partisan deliberations. 
   There is a special spirit in this Chamber. No matter all the easy criticisms directed our way, this is a great institution and in our own way we are witnessing--living out--the remarkable judgment of the Founding Fathers. 
   Let me turn to the question of removing President William Jefferson Clinton. 
   Many times the House managers have argued to us that if you find the facts as you argue them, you must vote to convict and thereby remove. But of course, that, like a number of things that they said, is really not true. You can, of course, find the facts and still acquit, because you don't want to remove on a constitutional basis or, frankly, on any other balance that a Senator decides to make in the interest of the Nation. 
   Now, I agree that perjury and obstruction of justice can be grounds for removal or grounds for impeachment. The question is, Are they in this case? I will not dissect the facts any further because I don't have the time but also because I believe there are issues of greater significance than the facts of this case. 
   Let's assume you take the facts as the House managers want you to. I would like to talk about some of the things in the arena outside of the mere recitation of facts--critical considerations in this matter. 
   I have listened to all of the arguments for removal, and I must say that even as I understand what many have said, there seems to be a gap between the words and the reality of what is happening in this country. 
   Some have said it sets a double standard for judges, despite the fact that the vast majority of scholars say there is a difference between impeachment of judges and the President, despite a difference clearly spelled out in the Constitution, and despite all of the distinguishing facts of each one of those cases involving judges. 
   Some have said we will have a negative impact on kids, on the military, and on the fabric of our country. 
   And while I agree that this is absolutely not about polls and popularity, some are making a judgment that clearly the country itself does not agree with. The country does not believe the fiber of our Nation is unraveling over the President's egregious behavior, because most people have a sense of proportion about this case that seems totally lacking in the House managers' presentation. 
   No parent or school in America is teaching kids that lying or abusing the justice system is now OK. In fact, the President's predicament, I argue, does not make it harder to do so. If anything, there may now be a greater appreciation for the trouble you can get into for certain behavior. More parents are teaching their children about lying, about humiliation, about family hurt, about public responsibility, than before we ever heard the name of Monica Lewinsky. 
   The clear answer to children who write letters about the President is that since being discovered he has been in a lot of trouble, may even be criminally liable, has suffered public humiliation, and all of history will not erase the fact of this impeachment, this trial, or the lessons of this case. 
   But the bottom line for us is our constitutional duty, our responsibility to balance based on common sense and sense of honor. 
   There is a simple question but a question of enormous consequence: Do we really want to remove a President of the United States because he tried to avoid discovery in a civil case of a private, consensual affair with a woman who was subsequently determined to be irrelevant to the case, which case itself was thrown out as wholly without merit under the law? That is the question. 
   Let me be clear about the President's behavior so no one misinterprets. I am as deeply disturbed by it as all of us are here in the Senate. But I am not sure we need additional moralizing about something that the whole Nation has already condemned and digested. The President lied to his countrymen, to family, friends, to all of us. And if one is not enormously concerned by gifts not surrendered, conversations which can't refresh recollection, jobs produced with uncommon referral and speed, certainly one must be unsettled by the mere lack of easy compliance with judicial inquiry by a President. That is of grave concern to all. It deserves our censure. 
   But let me say as directly as I can that no amount of inflated rhetoric, or ideological or moral hyperextension can lift the personal, venial aspects of the President's actions to the kind of threat to the fabric of the country contemplated by the Founding Fathers. I must say that I am truly somewhat surprised to see so many strict constructionists of the Constitution giving such new and free interpretation to the clear intent of the framers. 
   And I have, frankly, been stunned by the overreach, the moral righteousness, even the zealotry of arguments presented by the House managers. 
   No matter the words about not hating Bill Clinton, no matter the disclaimers about partisanship, I truly sensed at times not just a scorn but a snarling, trembling venom that told us the President is a criminal and that ``we need to know who our President is.'' 
   Well, the President is certainly a sinner. We all are. And he may even have committed a crime. But just plain and simply measured against the test of history so eloquently articulated by the Senator from New York this morning and by the Senator from Delaware yesterday, just plain and simply, this is not in any measure on the order of high a crime and misdemeanor so clearly contemplated by the Founding Fathers. 
   Unlike President Nixon's impeachment case, no government power or agency was unleashed or abused for a goal directly affecting public policy. No election was interfered with. No  FBI or IRS power was wrongfully employed. At worst, this President lied about his private, consensual affair and tried wrongfully, but on a human level--understandable to most Americans, at least as to the Paula Jones case--to cover it up. I think, in fact, that most Americans in this country understood there was in that inquiry a violation of a zone of privacy that is as precious to Americans as the Constitution itself. 
   The fact that the House dropped the Paula Jones deposition count underscores the underlying weakness on which all of this is based. So I ask my colleagues, are we really incapable of at least measuring the real human dimensions of what took place here and contrasting it properly with the constitutional standards we are presented by precedent and history? 
   We have heard some discussion of proportionality. It is an important principle within our justice system and in life itself. The consequences of a crime should not be out of proportion to the crime itself. As the dictionary tells us, it should correspond in size, degree or intensity. 
   I must say that no one yet who will vote to remove has fully addressed that proportionality issue. 
   If you want to find perjury because you believe Monica about where the President touched her, and you believe that adopting the definition given to him by a judge and by Paula Jones' own lawyers, and you can reach into the President's mind to determine his intent, then that is your right. But having done that, if you think a President of the United States should be removed, an election reversed, because of such a thin evidentiary thread, I think you give new meaning to the concept of proportionality. If you do that, you turn away from the central fact that the President opened his grand jury testimony by acknowledging ``inappropriate, intimate contact'' with Monica Lewinsky. 
   Enough said, you would think. But no, not enough for this 
   independent prosecutor. While not one more question really needed to be asked, a torrent of questions followed. Every question thereafter calculated to either elicit an admission of a lie in a case found to be without merit, or to create a new lie which could bring us here. 
   With the President's acknowledgment of intimate contact, everyone in this Chamber understood what had happened. Everyone in America understood what had happened. For what reason did we need eighty percent of the questions asked about sexual relations? For the simple reason that the Presidential jugular instinct of the so-called independent counsel was primed by what all of us have come to know--he had colluded with Paula Jones' attorneys and Linda Tripp to set the Monica trap in the January deposition, and now he was going to set the perjury trap in the grand jury. Mr. BENNETT's own comments in the deposition underscore this:  
   ``I mean, this is not what a deposition is for, Your Honor. He can ask the President, What did he do? He can ask him specifically in certain instances what he did, and isn't that what this deposition is for? It is not to sort of lay a trap for him.''  
   I wonder if there is no former district attorney, now Senator; no former attorney general, now Senator; no former U.S. attorney, now Senator; former officer of the court, now Senator, who is not deeply disturbed by a so-called independent counsel grilling a sitting President of the United States of America about his personal sex life, based on information from illegal phone recordings? 
   Is there no one finding a countervailing proportionality in this case when confronted by our own congressionally created Javert who is not just pursuing a crime but who is at the center of creating the crime which we are deliberating on now? 
   Think about it. When Mr. Starr was appointed, when we authorized an independent counsel, when the grand jury was convened, the crime on trial before us now had not even been committed, let alone contemplated. 
   I wonder also if there is no one even concerned about Linda Tripp--who new gives definition to the meaning of friendship--working with Paula Jones' attorneys even as she was in the guidance and control of Mr. Starr as a Federal witness. Some of you may want to turn away from these facts. Secondly, the House managers never even acknowledged them in their presentations. I raise them, my colleagues, not for ideological or political purposes, but fundamental fairness demands that we balance all of the forces at play in this case. 
   Now, much has also been made in this trial of the rights of Paul@ Jones and her civil rights case--that we must protect Paul@ Jones' rights against the President of the United States. 
   My fellow colleagues--please let us have the decency to call this case what it was. This was no ordinary civil rights case. It was an assault on the Presidency and on the President personally, and the average American's understanding of that is one of the principal reasons our fellow citizens figured this case out long ago. 
   But there is more to it than that: 
   Mr. Starr became involved in the Paula Jones suit before he became independent counsel. 
   He had contacts with Paula Jones' attorneys before his jurisidction was expanded. 
   He wired Linda Tripp before his jurisdiction was expanded. 
   Many sources documented that without any expansion of jurisdiction, in 1997, he had FBI agents interrogating Arkansas State troopers, asking about Governor Clinton's private life--especially inquiring into Paula Jones. 
   After Paul@ Jones filed her suit in 1994, announcing it at a conservative political convention, and with new counsel affiliated with the Rutherford Institute, her spokesperson said, ``I will never deny that when I first heard about this case, I said, ``OK, good. We're gonna get that little slime ball.'' 
   She later said: ``Unless Clinton wants to be terribly embarrassed, he'd better cough up what Paula needs. Anybody that comes out and testifies against Paula better have the past of a Mother Teresa, because our investigators will investigate their morality.'' 
   Even Steve Jones, Paula Jones' husband, was part of an operation to poison the President's public reputation by divulging the secrets of his personal life--threatening even to employ subpoena power to depose, under oath, every State trooper in Arkansas who may have worked for the Governor. Steve Jones pledged that: ``We're going to get names; we're going to get dates; we're going to do the job that the press wouldn't do. We're going to go after Clinton's medical records, the raw documents, not just opinions from doctors.....we're going to find out everything.'' 
   Into all of this came Ken Starr, and the police power of our Nation. 
   This was not a civil rights suit in the context most of us would recognize. Indeed, there existed an extended and secret Jones legal team of outside lawyers--including George Conway and Jerome Marcus, experts on sexual harassment and Presidential immunity, who ghostwrote almost every substantive argument leveled by Paula Jones' lawyers; Ken Starr's friend Theodore Olson, and Robert Bork, the former Supreme Court nominee, who together advised the Jones team; Richard Porter, a law partner of Ken Starr and former Bush-Quayle opposition research guru, who also wrote briefs for the Jones team; and the conservative pundit and longtime Clinton opponent Ann Coulter, who worked on Paula Jones' response to President Clinton's motion for a dismissal. The connections between this crack--and covert--legal team, and Ken Starr's staff and his witnesses--including Paul Rosenzweig, Jackie Bennett, and Linda Tripp--as well as familiar figures including Lucianne Goldberg, add up to something far more than a twisted and disturbing game of six degrees of separation. 
   I do not suggest that this was the right wing conspiracy bandied about on the talk shows. But I ask you--are we not able to acknowledge that this was a legal and political war of personal destruction--not just a civil rights case? 
   And we cannot simply dismiss the fact that all of this turmoil--these entire proceedings--arise out of this deeply conflicted, highly partisan, ideologically driven, political civil rights case with incredible tentacles into and out of the office of the independent counsel. 
   Moreover, I remind my colleagues, Mr. Starr is supposed to be independent counsel--not independent prosecutor. He was and is supposed to represent all  of the Congress and nowhere do I remember voting for him to make a referral of impeachment--a report of facts, yes--a referral of impeachment, no. 
   Now there is a rejoinder to all of this. Nothing wipes away what the President did or failed to do. 
   So, some of you may say, So what? The President lied. The President obstructed justice. No one made him behave as he did. And yes, you're right. The President behaved without common sense, without courage, and without honor, but we are required to measure the totality of this case. We must measure how political this may have been; whether process was absurd; whether the totality of what the President did meets the constitutional threshold set by the Founding Fathers. 
   We must decide whether the removal of the President is proportional to the offense and we must remember that proportionality, fairness, rule of law--they must be applied not just to convict, but also to defend--to balance the equities. 
   I was here during Iran-contra and I remember the extraordinary care Senator Rudman, Senator INOUYE, and Senator SARBANES exerted to avoid partisanship and maintain proportionality. I wish I did not conclude that their example frankly is in stark contrast to the experience we are now living. 
   The House managers often spoke to us of principle and duty. And equally frequently we were challenged to stand up for the rule of law. 
   Well, we all believe in rule of law. But we also believe in the law being applied fairly, evenly--that the rule of law is not something to cite when it serves your purposes, only to be shunted aside when it encumbers. 
   But where was the managers' duty to their colleagues in the House--in the committee--on the floor; where was the same self-conscious sense of pain for what they were going through, when they denied a bipartisan process for impeachment; where was their commitment to rule of law in denying the President's attorneys access to the exculpatory evidence which due process affords any citizen? 
   Rule of law is a process in a democratic institution, and there is a duty to honor process. 
   I believe the Senate has distinguished itself in that effort and I want to express my deep respect for the strongly held views of all my colleagues. Reasonable people can differ and we do, but we can still come together in an affirmation of the strength of our Constitution. 
   Chairman Hyde says ``let it be done''--I hope it will be. Right requires we be proportional as to all aspects of this case. I hope that what we do here will apply the law in a way that gives confidence to all our citizens, that everyone can look at the final result of our deliberations and say justice was done. And we have called an end to the process by which we savage each other, and are beginning to heal our country.

Does the majority leader contemplate approaching that difficulty?

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Rear Admiral Bill Stubblefield on the occasion of his retirement as the Director of the Office of NOAA Corps Operations and the Director of the NOAA Corps, in the Department of Commerce's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Rear Admiral Stubblefield has given 33 years of dedicated service to the nation. 
   Bill Stubblefield served as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Navy from 1962 to 1968 aboard a minesweeper and an icebreaker, and then with the U.S. Navy's SOSUS network. In 1968, he resigned his commission from the Navy to further his education and received his Master's degree in Geology from the University of Iowa in 1971. 
   In July 1971 Admiral Stubblefield joined the NOAA Commissioned Corps as a Lieutenant in his home town of Medina, Tennessee, and attended the 38th NOAA Corps Basic Officer Training Class which was held at the United States Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York. After his commissioning, he was assigned to serve as a Junior Officer aboard the NOAA Ships Pathfinder and Rainier, conducting hydrographic surveys in California, Washington, and Alaska. His next assignment was ashore with the Environmental Research Laboratory, Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, in Miami, Florida, as Deputy Director of the Marine Geology and Geophysics Division. For this work, he received a NOAA Corps Special Achievement Award. 
   Admiral Stubblefield returned to sea duty in December of 1975 as Operations Officer aboard the NOAA Ship Researcher, which conducted oceanographic and atmospheric research in the waters of the Atlantic Ocean. 
   From January 1978 to May 1979, Admiral Stubblefield attended full-time university training at Texas A&M University receiving his Ph.D. in geological oceanography. He returned to the Environmental Research Laboratory as a research oceanographer until 1981, when he was summoned back to sea as the Executive Officer of the NOAA Ship Researcher. 
   Following his sea assignment Admiral Stubblefield had tours of duty as the Scientific Support Coordinator of the southeastern Atlantic and Gulf coastal areas for the NOAA Office of Marine Pollution Assessment Hazardous Material Program and Technical Specialist for the NOAA Office of Sea Grant in Washington, D.C. Admiral Stubblefield was then assigned to the position of Chief Scientist for the NOAA Undersea Research Program. 
   He returned to sea in 1988 as Commanding Officer of the NOAA Ship Surveyor which conducted oceanic research from the Arctic to the Antarctic, including the north and south Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Alaska, and the Bering Sea. At the time, the Surveyor had attained the award of traveling the farthest north and south of any NOAA vessel at its time. 
   In 1990 he was assigned the position of Coordinator for the Fleet Modernization Study to assess the life expectancy of NOAA's ships and determine how to modernize NOAA's fleet to operate into the 21st century. For this work, he received the Department of Commerce Silver Medal, DOC's second highest award. In late 1990, Admiral Stubblefield became the Executive Director for the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric Research, where he was responsible for the management and budget functions, international affairs, and administrative duties of this NOAA program office. 
   In August 1992, he was promoted to the rank of Rear Admiral, Lower Half and assigned as Deputy Director, Office of NOAA Corps Operations where he was responsible for the day-to-day operations of this staff office. In 1995, Admiral Stubblefield was selected for the position of Director, Office of NOAA Corps Operations and Director of the NOAA Commissioned Corps, and promoted to Rear Admiral, Upper Half, the highest position in the NOAA Corps. 
   Since Admiral Stubblefield became Director, the Office of NOAA Corps Operations has undergone many changes. He re-engineered the office to become more cost-efficient and customer oriented. He decommissioned five older ships, downsized the headquarters office by over 40 percent, both civilian and commissioned personnel, and reduced ship operating costs, while increasing the level of ship support. 
   Under his command, a new oceanographic ship, the Ronald H. Brown, was built and commissioned, and two former Navy ships were converted to conduct fisheries, oceanic, and atmospheric research. He also saw the new Gulfstream IV jet built and brought into operation to study the effects of El Nin 6o last winter off the California coast and conduct hurricane reconnaissance this past hurricane season. 
   Also under his command, Admiral Stubblefield faced the most challenging task of his career, one that no head of a uniformed service would ever want to face--the decision to disestablish the NOAA Commissioned Corps. The Corps was under a hiring freeze that lasted for 4 years. Yet, Admiral Stubblefield still was able to maintain morale and fill the assignments required to operate the ships and aircraft. 
   This past October, when it became apparent the NOAA Corps plays a vital role for the country, the decision was made to retain the NOAA Corps. In January 1999, 17 new officers began their basic training at the Merchant Marine Academy in Kings Point, New York.  
   Admiral Stubblefield is an officer, a scientist, and a gentleman. I commend Bill for his tremendous accomplishments during his career and service to  the Nation, especially those over the past three years. Thanks to his efforts, NOAA is stronger, more efficient and will carry out its invaluable mission into the next century.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my colleague, Senator MAX CLELAND, in introducing the Disaster Mitigation Coordination Act of 1999, a bill that helps our nation's small businesses save money and prepare for natural disasters. 
   We can't prevent disasters, but we can take measures to lessen and prevent the destruction that often hurts, and sometimes destroys, small businesses. Aside from avoiding inconveniences and disruptions, we know that there are cost-benefits to making meaningful improvements and changes to facilities before a disaster. According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which has a disaster mitigation program for communities, rather than businesses, we know that we save two dollars of disaster relief money for each dollar spent on disaster mitigation. 
   I see a great need for this type of assistance in the small business community. This bill establishes a five-year pilot program that would make low-interest, long-term loans available to small business owners financing preventive measures to protect their businesses against, and lessen the extent of, future disaster damage. This pilot program is designed to help those small businesses that can't get credit elsewhere and that are located in disaster-prone areas. 
   The small business pre-disaster mitigation loan pilot program would be run as part of the Small Business Administration's regular disaster loan program, testing the pros and cons of preparedness versus reaction. Up to $15 million will be set aside for this pilot if enacted. 
   Only a portion of SBA's regular disaster loans, up to 20 percent, are available for mitigation after a recent natural disaster. In contrast, this legislation would allow 100 percent of an SBA disaster loan to be used for mitigation purposes within any area that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated as disaster-prone. In Massachusetts, that includes Marshfield and Quincy, two coastal communities that are prone to flooding, rainstorms and Nor'easters. 
   Nationwide, whether you're a business in Missouri or Massachusetts, this pilot would allow you to take out a loan to make the improvements to your building or office to protect against disasters. For floods it can mean elevating the foundation or relocating. For tornados it can mean installing storm windows and building a stronger roof. For hurricanes it can mean reinforcing walls. And for fires it can mean adding sprinklers and flame-retardant building materials. 
   The Administration supports this pilot program and included it in Clinton's budget request this fiscal year, and again for fiscal year 2000. The President requests that up to $15 million of the total $358 million proposed for disaster loans be used for disaster mitigation loans. 
   Senator CLELAND and I introduced this same legislation in the last Congress. And although it passed committee and the full Senate without opposition, the House did not have time to vote on its merits before the 105th Congress ended. I thank my colleagues, Senators HOLLINGS, CONRAD, BOXER, DASCHLE and HARKIN for sharing our concern to meet the needs of our small business owners while also working to find solutions that are smarter, more pro-active and more cost-effective. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and am hopeful it will again receive the full support it deserves when it comes before the Senate this Congress.

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. Chief Justice, reserving the right to object. I ask the majority leader, is there an assumption that if White House counsel were to want sufficient time on Saturday in order to be able to present video testimony countering whatever surprise video--and there may or may not be a surprise --would they have time to be able to provide that on Saturday--not to carry over, but merely if they choose to, to do that on Saturday?

   Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join Chairman BOND in support of the Small Business Investment Company Technical Corrections Act. 
   The Small Business Investment Company (SBIC) program is vital to our fastest growing small companies that have capital needs exceeding the caps on SBA's loan programs, but are not large enough to be attractive to traditional venture capital investors. The demand is clear: Last year, participating securities in the SBIC program invested $360 million in 495 financings. In Massachusetts, where there is an impressive community of fast-growing companies, particularly in the hi-tech industry, there were 140 SBIC financings, worth $145.4 million. 
   This legislation sets out to make five technical changes. They range from improving the incentive for SBIC's to loan money to small companies to structuring a fairer formula for determining whether companies of the same revenue size can quality for SBIC financing. One of the most important changes will increase the authorized levels for participating securities. 
   The Participating Securities component of the SBIC program invests principally in the equities of new or expanding businesses. To leverage the private capital of participating securities and better serve these fast-growing businesses, I supported Senator LIEBERMAN's amendment to H.R. 3412 during the last Congress, which would have raised the authorization level for participating securities from $800 million to $1 billion in fiscal year 1999 and from $900 million to $1.2 billion in fiscal year 2000. This bill passed the Senate Small Business Committee and the full Senate by unanimous consent, but unfortunately, the House was unable to act on it before the 105th Congress ended. 
   Since that amendment was introduced, we have seen that the need is even greater than those levels. The Administration anticipates faster growth in the SBIC program because of both its increasing popularity and the increase in additional personnel at the Small Business Administration to its SBIC licensing unit. In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, SBA licensed approximately 30 new SBIC's per year. With more staff devoted to the licensing unit, SBA projects that it will license more than double that amount in fiscal year 1999. Accordingly, Senator BOND's Act would increase the authorization level to $1.2 billion in FY99 and to $1.5 billion in FY2000. 
   Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I applaud the work of my colleagues on the Senate Small Business Committee, Chairman BOND and Senator LIEBERMAN.

    Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I join my colleagues--Chairman BOND of the Small Business Committee and Senators BENNETT and DODD of the Special Committee on the Year 2000 Technology Problem--to introduce a bill that provides affordable loans to small businesses preparing for or responding to the Year 2000 computer problem. 
   As Ranking Member of the Committee on Small Business, I believe it is in our economic best interest to make sure that our small businesses, some 20 million if we include the self-employed, are still up and running, creating jobs and providing services, on and after January 1, 2000. 
   Will the new year bring national ``hiccups'' or ``worldwide recession''? It depends on who you ask. Peter de Jager, considered one of the first Year-2000 crusaders, believes there will be problems, but not devastation. As published in the December 31, 1998 issue of ``ITAA's (Information Technology Association of America) Year 2000 Outlook'': De Jager says ``a blackout across North America is `inconceivable' and power brown-outs, should they occur, will be localized.'' 
   However, if you ask a particular senior executive at Barclays about the millennium computer bug, his advice would be to sell your home, stockpile cash and buy gold in case of a global economic collapse. He and other international bank managers fear a run on deposits. 
   Because our economy is inter-dependent and most of our technology is date-dependent, either scenario concerns me, particularly for small businesses. National surveys and conversations with Y2K consultants and commercial lenders in Massachusetts tell a story that varies from ignorance to denial to paralysis to apathy. 
   That's serious when you consider a 1998 Arthur Andersen Enterprise Group and National Small Business United survey that found 94 percent of all small and mid-sized businesses have computers, and only 62 percent of all small and mid-sized businesses, regardless of whether they rely on computers or date-dependent equipment, have ``begun addressing'' Y2K issues. The good news is that a greater percentage of small and mid-sized businesses are preparing for Y2K than last summer; the bad news is that they've only ``begun'' and a significant group is taking a wait-and-see approach. 
   And what about those who have been slow to act or have no plans to act? How do we reach them and facilitate assessment and remediation of their businesses? By making the solution affordable. 
   The Andersen and NSBU study showed that 54 percent of all respondents said ``affording the cost [was the] most difficult challenge in dealing with information technology.'' Cost is a legitimate, albeit risky, reason to delay addressing the Y2K problem--saving till you're a little ahead or waiting until the last possible moment to take on new debt to finance changes are strategies many small businesses are forced to adopt. 
   Most of the media attention has been on big business, the challenges they face and the costs they are bearing to fix the problem. Small businesses face the same effects of the Y2K problem as big businesses, but, as the study found, they often have little or no resources to devote to detecting the extent of the problem or developing a workable and cost-effective solution. If you own your facility, is the HVAC (Heating Ventilation and Air Conditioning) system in compliance and how much will it cost to fix a system that serves 5,000 square feet? Does the security system need an upgrade or to be replaced? If you own a dry cleaner and you hire a consultant to assess your equipment in your franchise, will remediation eat all your profits or set you back? These are questions to which some business owners can't afford to hear the answers. It may come down to a choice between debt or dissolution. 
   The Year 2000 Readiness Act gives eligible business owners a viable option. To make it easy for lenders and timely for borrowers, this Act, like the Y2K small business loan bill I introduced last Congress, expands the 7(a) loan program, one of the U.S. Small Business Administration's most popular and successful guaranteed lending programs. 
   Currently, the 7(a) program is intended to give small businesses credit and capital, including working capital to grow their companies. If the Year 2000 Readiness Act is enacted, that program could be used until the end of the year 2000 to address Y2K problems through assessment, planning, remediation and testing computers and equipment, or to provide relief for substantial economic injury a small business suffers as a direct result of Y2K problems, such as a brown-out or a temporarily incapacitated supplier. 
   The terms of 7(a) loans are familiar to lenders and small-business owners alike and, therefore, the loans are easy to apply for and process. They are structured to be approved or denied, in most cases, in less than 48 hours. We expect the average Y2K 7(a) loan to be less than $100,000. 
   To give lenders an incentive to make 7(a) loans to small businesses for Y2K problems and related economic injury, this Act raises the government guaranties of the existing 7(a) program by ten percent. Under special circumstances, it also raises the dollar cap of loan guaranties from $750,000 to $1 million for these Y2K small business loans. 
   For Y2K 7(a) loans of more than $100,000, the government will guarantee 85 percent, and for such loans of $100,000 or less, the government will guarantee 90 percent. For those lenders with special authority to approve their loans, this Act allows them to use the SBA Express Pilot Program--a pilot that makes it easy for lenders to process loans worth up to $150,000 using their own paperwork and making same-day approval--for Y2K loans. SBA Express loans are guaranteed at 50 percent. 
   This legislation encourages lenders to work with small businesses addressing Y2K-related problems by arranging for affordable financing. When quality of credit comes into question, lenders are directed to resolve reasonable doubts about the applicant's ability to repay the debt in favor of the borrower. And when appropriate, to establish a moratorium for up to one year on principal payments on Y2K 7(a) loans, beginning when the loans are originated. 
   To protect against fraud, abuse or double compensation, this Act prohibits a business from qualifying for a Y2K 7(a) loan if it has already received insurance proceeds for Y2K problems or economic injury related to Y2K problems. 
   As important as this Y2K loan program is, it must be available in addition to, and not in lieu of, the existing 7(a) program. The 7(a) program is a vital capital source for small businesses, providing more than 42,000 loans in 1998, totaling $9 billion. Nine hundred sixty-six of those loans went to small businesses in Massachusetts.  With defaults down, recoveries up and the government's true cost, called the subsidy rate, at 1.39 percent, we should not create burdens that would slow or reverse this trend. To protect the existing 7(a) program, we need to make sure that it is adequately funded for fiscal years 1999 and 2000. Because the Y2K loan program would be part of the existing 7(a) business loan program, funds that have already been appropriated for the 7(a) program may be used for the Y2K loan program. As of two weeks past the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 1999, SBA's records show that the program has already used $2.5 billion (roughly 23 percent) of the total $10 billion appropriated. Typically the demand for these loans increases by as much as ten percent in the spring and summer. If this holds true for this fiscal year, it is an indication that the program will need nearly all of its funds to meet the regular loan demand. 
   Under these circumstances, we must be diligent about monitoring the 7(a) loan program to make sure the Y2K loans don't drain the program and cause it to run out of money. If we do find that the appropriated amount is inadequate to support the general 7(a) loan program and the new Y2K loan program, we will need to get more funding. Though it's never easy to get more money, Chairman BOND, who also serves on the Committee on Appropriations and is chairman of one of the Appropriation subcommittees, has agreed to attempt to secure additional funds targeted specifically for the Y2K loan program. I thank Chairman BOND for his commitment, and offer my help if the need arises. 
   I am hopeful that this legislation can be passed in the Small Business Committee and the full Senate as quickly as possible to begin assisting small businesses in need of this important initiative. This is a good program, which with adequate funding, will help many small businesses get a strong start in 2000 and the new millennium.  
    Mr. DODD, Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in supporting this very important legislation. Together with Senators BOND, KERRY, and BENNETT, I recognize the necessity of strengthening the ability of America's small businesses to negotiate the complex challenges related to the Year 2000 computer problem. This legislation is designed to assist the 14.5 million small businesses that may have Y2K concerns. According to various studies, almost half of all of the small businesses in America are not ready to respond to the possible effects of the Y2K computer problem. 
   I would like to take a moment and thank Chairman BOND and Ranking Member JOHN KERRY of the Small Business Committee for their leadership and cooperation with the Special Committee on the Year 2000, on which I serve as Vice-Chair. The object of this cooperation between our two Committees is to strengthen the economic backbone of America, small businesses, as they face a potentially devastating threat to their very existence. This is not to alarm anyone, but merely to warn of a possible danger. As I have said on numerous occasions, I believe very strongly that we must prepare and plan for any Y2K contingency. We must be vigilant and provide assistance for small businesses. Unfortunately, many small businesses do not consider themselves in danger from the effects of the Y2K problem and so have taken little, if any, steps to address problems that may arise. This extends to reviewing whether all of their suppliers, customers and financial institutions are free from the Y2K glitch. Even if our small enterprises were aware of all problems that face them, not all of them have access to the necessary funds to take corrective measures. 
   This legislation helps our nation's small enterprises in two ways. First, if a company wants to remediate or fix its own equipment that is not Y2K compliant, this bill provides easier access to loans. Hopefully, this will encourage the small business owners to learn of their companies deficiencies, and then correct them in a timely manner so that company does not stop working. 
   Second, if a company faces economic disruption due to outside Y2K related problems, then that company may apply for funds to assist it. This is the area to which I am especially sensitive. We do not know exactly what will work and what will need immediate attention so that our lives, our jobs, our economic well being, can continue. To address that lack of knowledge, this bill will allow small business owners access to financial support guaranteed by the Small Business Administration until December 31, 2000. This is very important. Our concern is not just January 1, 2000, but the continual smooth operation of our nation and our nation's small businesses throughout this momentous year. 
   Less than one-third of small businesses have checked the Y2K preparedness of the companies that they depend upon to continue to function everyday. Though only half of the small businesses in America classify themselves as dependent upon computers, many of the small businesses in America are dependent on other businesses, which are dependent upon computers. Like a cog in the wheel of our nation's economy, if one small business suddenly ceases to function, its effects may be felt across the country. That is why I am glad to support this legislation to assist the United States small business community. 
   An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. We must help our nation's small businesses regardless of when they become aware of the problems facing them. This legislation is designed to do exactly that.

   Mr. KERRY. I would simply ask whether or not that answer was in fact fully responsive to the question. I believe the question also asked whether or not there were any omissions.
